      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1791">'''Abstract particulars''' are [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] entities which are both [[abstract object]]s and [[particular]]s. 

==Examples==
Individual [[number]]s are often classified as abstract particulars because they are neither concrete objects nor [[universals]] — they are particular things which do not themselves occur in [[spacetime|space or time]]. [[Trope theory|Tropes]] are another example of entities cited as abstract particulars.

==History&lt;!--'Abstract particularity' redirects here--&gt;==
The concept of "'''abstract particularity'''"&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{lang-de|abstrakte Besonderheit}}) was introduced in philosophy by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6020">An '''accident''', in [[philosophy]], is an attribute that may or may not belong to a subject, without affecting its essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=William Keith Chambers|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|pages=148|isbn=978-0-521-38760-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aristotle]] made a distinction between the [[essential properties|essential]] and accidental [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of a thing. [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other [[Catholic]] theologians have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the [[theology]] of the [[Eucharist]], particularly the [[transubstantiation]] of bread and wine into body and blood. In this example, the bread and wine are considered accidents, since at transubstantiation, they become incidental to the essential substance of body and blood. 

In modern [[philosophy]], an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts:  property and [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]. [[Non-essentialism]] argues that every property is an accident. Modal [[necessitarianism]] argues that all properties are essential and no property is an accident.

==Aristotle ==
{{see also|Potentiality and actuality}}
[[Aristotle]] made a distinction between the [[essential properties|essential]] and accidental [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of a thing. For example, a chair can be made of wood or metal, but this is accidental to its being a chair: that is, it is still a chair regardless of the material from which it is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|others=Richard J.

To take another example, all bachelors are unmarried: this is a necessary or essential property of what it means to be a bachelor. A particular bachelor may have brown hair, but this would be a property particular to that individual, and with respect to his bachelorhood it would be an accidental property. And this distinction is independent of experimental verification: even if for some reason all the unmarried men with non-brown hair were killed, and every single existent bachelor had brown hair, the property of having brown hair would still be accidental, since it would still be logically possible for a bachelor to have hair of another color.

The nine kinds of accidents according to Aristotle are quantity, quality, relation, habitus, time, location, situation (or position), action, and passion ("being acted on"). Together with "substance", these nine kinds of accidents constitute the ten fundamental [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] of Aristotle's [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/433/catlec.htm|title=Predication and Ontology: The Categories|publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic church|Catholic]] theologians such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the [[theology]] of the [[Eucharist#Roman Catholic|Eucharist]], particularly the [[transubstantiation]] of bread and wine into body and blood. According to this tradition, the accidents (or ''species'') of the appearance of bread and wine do not change, but the substance changes from bread and wine to the [[Eucharist|Body and Blood of Christ]].

== Modern philosophy ==
In modern [[philosophy]], an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: [[Property (philosophy)|property]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]. In relation to the first, an accidental property (Greek ''symbebekos'')&lt;ref name="Slomkowski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slomkowski|first=Paul|title=Aristotle's Topics|publisher=BRILL|year=1997|pages=90–93|isbn=978-90-04-10757-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is at its most basic level a ''property''. The color "[[yellow]]", "high value", "Atomic Number 79" are all properties, and are therefore candidates for being accidental. On the other hand, "[[gold]]", "[[platinum]]", and "[[electrum]]" are not properties, and are therefore not classified as accidents.

There are two opposed philosophical positions that also impact the meaning of this term:
*[[Non-essentialism|Anti-essentialism]] (associated with [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]) argues that there are no essential properties at all, and therefore every property is an accident.
*Modal [[necessitarianism]] (associated with [[Saul Kripke]]), argues for the veracity of the modal system "Triv" (If P is true, then P must be true). The consequence of this theory is that all properties are essential (and no property is an accident).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="118465">{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''achievement gap in the United States''' is the observed, persistent disparity in measures of educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially groups defined by [[socioeconomic status]] (SES), [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]] and [[gender]]. The achievement gap can be observed on a variety of measures, including [[standardized test]] scores, [[grade point average]], [[Dropping out|dropout]] rates, and college enrollment and completion rates. While this article focuses on the achievement gap in the United States, the gap in achievement between lower income students and higher income students exists in all nations&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy &amp; Rothstein, [http://www.epi.org/blog/international-tests-achievement-gaps-gains-american-students/ "International Tests Show Achievement Gaps in All Countries"], Economic Policy Institute, January 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been studied extensively in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rowntree Bawlls vs Lunch [http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty "Education and Poverty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324140816/http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty |date=March 24, 2013 }}, "How Does Poverty Affect Children's Education?"&lt;/ref&gt; Various other gaps between groups exist around the globe as well.

Research into the causes of the disparity in academic achievement between students from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds has been ongoing since the 1966 publication of the Coleman Report (officially titled "Equality of Educational Opportunity"), commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], which found that a combination of home, community, and in-school factors affect academic performance and contribute to the achievement gap. According to American educational psychologist [[David Berliner]], home and community environments have a stronger impact on school achievement than in-school factors, in part, because students spend more time outside of school than in school. In addition, the out-of-school factors influencing academic performance differ significantly between children living in poverty and children from middle-income households.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, D., [http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/PB-Berliner-NON-SCHOOL.pdf "Poverty and Potential: Out-of-School Factors and School Success"], Education Public Interest Center, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, D., [http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=12106 "Our Impoverished View of Educational Reform"], Teachers College Record, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement gap, as reported in trend data collected by the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP), has become a focal point of [[education reform]] efforts by a number of nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups. Attempts to minimize the achievement gap by improving equality of access to educational opportunities have been numerous but fragmented, such as [[affirmative action]], [[multicultural education]], finance equalization,{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and interventions to improve school testing, teacher quality and accountability.

==Racial achievement gap==
{{main|Racial achievement gap in the United States}}{{see also|National Assessment of Educational Progress|Race and intelligence}}
The [[education of African Americans]] and some other minorities lags behind those of other [[United States|U.S.]] ethnic groups, such as [[White people|Whites]] and [[Asian Americans]], as reflected by test scores, grades, urban high school graduation rates, rates of disciplinary action, and rates of conferral of undergraduate degrees. Indeed, high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates are comparable to those of whites 25 or 30 years ago. It should also be noted that the category of [[Africans in the United States|African immigrant]] population (excluding Haitians and other foreign-born blacks born outside of Africa) has the highest educational attainment of any group in the United States, but they represent a small group within the larger African American population.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census http://www.asian-nation.org/immigrant-stats.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asian Americans|East Asian Americans]] of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Koreans|Korean]] descent score the highest in all scholastic standardized tests such as the [[SAT]], [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]], [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]], [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]] exams and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]] followed by [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] [[White people]] who score in the intermediate range followed by [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] students who tend to score in the lower ranges. U.S. students as whole have in general attained average scores on the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|International PISA test]] while other wealthy [[industrialized]] [[developed country|developed]] [[East Asian]] countries, such as [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]] have the highest top scores. However, compared with children in some less developed countries like Benin where some children, especially girls, end their education after the elementary level, education in the United States is compulsory to age 16 regardless of race or class. It is expected that over half of public education students will be required to pass [[high school graduation examination|standards-based assessments]] which expect that all students to be at least exposed to algebra by high school and exit prepared for college. In many other nations, such as Germany and Japan, those with lower test scores may be tracked as skilled tradepersons or unskilled laborers.

Nowadays, there's a gaining population of students who use online education, and the number of institutions which offering fully online degrees is also increasing. According to several studies, online education probably could create an environment where there is less cultural division and negative stereotypes of African Americans, thus protecting those students who have had bad experiences. In addition, the influence technology and user skills and so as economics and academic influences are tightly bonded, that may have positively contributed to African American online learners experience. However, it appears African American male students are less likely to enroll in online classes.

===Evidence of the racial achievement gap: National Assessment of Educational Progress (United States)===
&lt;!-- sort, annotate me --&gt;
{{Main|National Assessment of Educational Progress}}
[[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Evidence of the racial achievement gaps|Evidence of the achievement gap]] can be found using various measures, but one assessment used nationwide is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The graphs below show the achievement gap on this assessment between black and white students and between Hispanic and white students in the U.S. over time. Although the gaps have generally narrowed in recent years according to this particular measure, there are clearly still large disparities between groups.

===Debate on the origins of the racial achievement gap===
Researchers have not reached consensus about the [[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Theories about the origin of the racial achievement gap|causes of the academic achievement gap]]; instead, there exists a wide range of studies that cite an array of factors, both cultural and structural, that influence student performance in school. Annette Lareau suggested that students who lack middle-class [[cultural capital]] and have limited parental involvement are likely to have lower academic achievement than their better resourced peers.&lt;ref&gt;''Social Class Differences in Family-School Relationships: The Impact of Cultural Capital'' Annette Lareau, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers suggest that academic achievement is more closely tied to race and [[socioeconomic status]] and have tried to pinpoint why.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Tracking: From Theory to Practice'' Maureen Hallinan 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic factors were identified as lack of online course access (McCoy, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, K. L. (2012). A study of African American males and their response to online learning (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3546682) &lt;/ref&gt; and online course attrition which indicated before (Liu et al., 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Liu, S., Gomez, J., Khan, B., &amp; Yen, C.J. (2007). Toward a learneroriented community college online course dropout framework. International Journal on ELearning, 6(4), 519–542. &lt;/ref&gt;. Based on the National Center for Educational Statistic (2015)&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2011). The condition of education, 2011. (NCES 2011033), Indicator 43. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2011033&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;, about half of African American male students grew up in single-parent households. They are associated with higher incidences of poverty, which leads to poorer educational outcomes (Child Trends Databank, 2015). Low-income households tend to have fewer home computers and less access to the Internet (Zickuhr &amp; Smith, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Zickuhr, K., &amp; Smith, A. (2012). Digital differences. Pew Research Center’s Internet &amp; American Life Project, Washington, D.C., 1–41. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Digital&lt;/nowiki&gt; differences.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

For example, being raised in a low-income family often means having fewer educational resources in addition to poor nutrition and limited access to health care, all of which could contribute to lower academic performance. Researchers concerned with the achievement gap between genders cite biological differences, such as brain structure and development, as a possible reason why one gender outperforms the other in certain subjects. For example, a Virginia Tech Study conducted in 2000 examined the brains of 508 children and found that different areas of the brain develop in a different sequence in girls compared to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanlon|first=Harriet|author2=Robert Thatcher |author3=Marvin Cline|title=Gender Differences in the Development of EEG Coherence in Normal Children|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=1999|volume=16|issue=3|pages=479–506|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn1603_27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differing maturation speed of the brain between boys and girls affects how each gender processes information and could have implications for how they perform in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sax|first=Leonard|title=Why Gender Matters: What Parents and Teachers Need to Know about the Emerging Science of Sex Differences|year=2005|publisher=Doubleday|location=Portland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Hernstein and Murray claimed in the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]'',&lt;ref name="X"&gt;Hernstein, R. J., and C. Murray, ''The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life'' (The Free Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; creating much controversy, that [[Race and intelligence|genetic variation in average levels of intelligence]] (IQ) may explain some portion of the racial disparities in achievement. Other researchers have argued that there is no significant difference in inherent cognitive ability between different races that could help to explain the achievement gap, and that environment is at the root of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;"Genetic Differences and School Readiness" William T. Dickens, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Race, IQ, and Jensen" James R. Flynn (London: Routledge, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbett, Richard. “Race, Genetics, and IQ,” in The Black-White Test Score Gap, edited by Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips (Brookings, 1998), pp. 86–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The racial achievement gap in early childhood====
Research shows that the achievement gap, which often is first measured (by standardized tests) in elementary school, actually begins well before students reach kindergarten as a “school readiness” gap.&lt;ref&gt;"School Readiness: Closing Racial and Ethnic Gaps" Cecilia Rouse, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Sara McLanahan, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; One study claims that about half the test score gap between black and white high school students is already evident when children start school.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Phillips, James Crouse, and John Ralph, “Does the Black-White Test Score Gap Widen after Children Enter School?” in The Black-White Test Score Gap, edited by Jencks and Phillips (Brookings, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of different tests at kindergarten entry have provided evidence of such a gap, including the U.S. Department of Education's Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey of Kindergarten children (ECLS-K). While results differ depending on the instrument, estimates of the black-white gap range from slightly less than half a standard deviation to slightly more than 1 standard deviation.&lt;ref&gt;"Assessment Issues in the Testing of Children at School Entry" Donald A. Rock and A. Jackson Stenner, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This early disparity in performance is critical, as research shows that once students are behind, they do not catch up. Children who score poorly on tests of cognitive skills before starting kindergarten are highly likely to be low performers throughout their school careers.&lt;ref&gt;"School Readiness and Later Achievement" G. J. Duncan et al, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of the early appearance of the gap has led to efforts focused on early childhood interventions (see “Narrowing the achievement gap” below).

====African American culture and family structure====
{{Further|African American culture|African-American family structure}}

Achievement gaps between African American students and White students in online classes tend to be greater than regular class.

The culture and environment in which children are raised may play a role in the achievement gap. Jencks and Phillips argue that African American parents may not encourage early education in toddlers because they do not see the personal benefits of having exceptional academic skills. As a result of cultural differences, African American students tend to begin school with smaller vocabularies than their white classmates.&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"&gt;''America's Next Achievement Test: Closing the Black-White Test Score Gap'' Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Hart and Risley calculated a "[[30 million word gap]]" between children of high school dropouts and those of professionals who are college educated. The differences are qualitative as well as quantitative, with differences in "unique" words, complexity, and "conversational turns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sparks|first1=Sarah D.|title=Research on Quality of Conversation Holds Deeper Clues Into Word Gap|work=Education Week|publisher=Educational Projects in Education, Inc.|date=April 22, 2015|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, poverty often acts as a confounding factor and differences that are assumed to arise from racial/cultural factors may be socioeconomically driven. Many children who are poor, regardless of race, come from homes that lack stability, continuity of care, adequate nutrition, and medical care creating a level of environmental stress that can affect the young child's development. As a result, these children enter school with decreased word knowledge that can affect their language skills, influence their experience with books, and create different perceptions and expectations in the classroom context.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Hart and Risley (1995). Meaningful differences in the every day experiences of young children. Baltimore, MD: Paul H Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that when students have parental assistance with homework, they perform better in school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Immigration, Family Life, and Achievement Motivation Among Latino Adolescents'' Carola Suarez-Orozco and Marcelo Suarez-Orozco 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This is a problem for many minority students due to the large number of single-parent households ([[African-American family structure|67% of African-American children are in a single-parent household]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Rankings.aspx?ind=107|title=Children in single-parent families by race|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the increase in non-English speaking parents. Students from single-parent homes often find it difficult to find time to receive help from their parent. Similarly, some Hispanic students have difficulty getting help with their homework because there is not an English speaker at home to offer assistance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==== Hispanic views toward education ====
Disadvantages in a child's early life can cultivate into achievement gaps in their education. Poverty, coupled with the environment they are raised in, can lead to shortcomings in educational achievement. Despite strong standards and beliefs in education, Hispanic children consistently perform poorly, reflected by a low average of math and reading scores, as compared to other groups except African American.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Digest of Education Statistics|url=http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.51-5366|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=51|issue=10|pages=51–5366–51-5366|doi=10.5860/choice.51-5366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanic and African American children have been shown to be more likely to be raised in poverty, with 33% of Hispanic families living below the [[Poverty in the United States|economic poverty level]], compared to African American (39%), Asian (14%) and White (13%) counterparts.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Children who are raised in poverty are less likely to be enrolled in nursery or preschool. Though researchers are seeing improvements in achievement levels, such as a decrease in high school dropout rates (from 24% to 17%) and a steady increase in math and reading scores over the past 10 years,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; there are still issues that must be addressed.

There is a common misconception that Hispanic parents are not involved in their child's education and fail to transmit strong educational values to their children. However, there is evidence that Hispanic parents actually hold their children's education in high value. The majority of Hispanic children are affected by [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]]. It affects recent immigrants as well as the children of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valencia|first=Richard R.|date=2002-04-01|title="Mexican Americans Don't Value Education!" On the Basis of the Myth, Mythmaking, and Debunking|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S1532771XJLE0102_2|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81–103|doi=10.1207/s1532771xjle0102_2|issn=1534-8431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both recent immigrants and the children of immigrants are faced with language barriers and other migration obstacles. A study explored the unique situation and stressors recent Latin American immigrants face. Hispanic students showed lower academic achievement, more absences, and more life stressors than their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Sita G.|last2=Barrera|first2=Alinne Z.|last3=Strambler|first3=Michael J.|last4=Muñoz|first4=Ricardo F.|last5=Macciomei|first5=Erynn|date=2016-04-02|title=The Achievement Gap Among Newcomer Immigrant Adolescents: Life Stressors Hinder Latina/o Academic Success|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15348431.2015.1099529|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|volume=15|issue=2|pages=121–133|doi=10.1080/15348431.2015.1099529|issn=1534-8431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014-2015, 77.8% of Hispanic children were [[English-language learner|English Language learners]]. This can be problematic because children may not have parents who speak English at home to help with language acquisition. Immigration struggles can be used as a motivator for students. Immigrant parents appeal to their children and hold high expectations because of the “gift” they are bestowing on them. They immigrated and sacrificed their lives so their children can succeed, and this framework is salient in encouraging children to pursue their education. Parents use their struggles and occupation to encourage a better life.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ceballo|first=Rosario|last2=Maurizi|first2=Laura K.|last3=Suarez|first3=Gloria A.|last4=Aretakis|first4=Maria T.|title=Gift and sacrifice: Parental involvement in Latino adolescents’ education.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0033472|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=116–127|doi=10.1037/a0033472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parent Involvement|Parental involvement]] has been shown to increase educational success and attainment for students. For example, parental involvement in elementary school has been shown to lower high school dropout rates and improved on time completion of high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Wendy Miedel|title=Parent involvement in elementary school and educational attainment|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190740903001178|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume=26|issue=1|pages=39–62|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2003.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception is that Latino parents don’t hold their children's education in high regards (Valencia, 2002), but this has been debunked. Parents show their values in education by holding high academic expectations and giving “consejos” or advice. In 2012, 97% of families reported teaching their children letters, words or numbers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; A study reported that parent involvement during adolescence continues to be as influential as in early childhood.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

====Motivation gap====
Another explanation that has been suggested for racial and ethnic differences in standardized test performance is that some minority children may not be motivated to do their best on these assessments. Many argue that standardized IQ tests and other testing procedures are culturally biased toward the knowledge and experiences of the European-American middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ronnie-reese/test-bias-minorities_b_2734149.html |title=Minority Testing Bias Persists |last=Reese |first=Ronnie |publisher=''The Huffington Post'' |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/11/why-its-time-to-get-rid-of-standardized-tests/ |title=Why It's Time to Get Rid of Standardized Tests |last=Rooks |first=Noliwe M. |publisher=''TIME'' |date=October 11, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude M. Steele suggested that minority children and adolescents may also experience [[stereotype threat]]—the fear that they will be judged to have traits associated with negative appraisals and/or stereotypes of their race or ethnic group. According to this theory, this produces test anxiety and keeps them from doing as well as they could on tests. According to Steele, minority test takers experience anxiety, believing that if they do poorly on their test they will confirm the stereotypes about inferior intellectual performance of their minority group. As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy begins, and the child performs at a level beneath his or her inherent abilities.

===="Acting white"====
{{Main|Acting white}}

Some researchers&lt;ref name="researchers"&gt;Steele, C., and J. Aronson, “Stereotype Threat and the Test Performance of Academically Successful African Americans” (pp. 401–430), in C. Jencks and M. Phillips (Eds.), The Black-White Test Score Gap (Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; also hypothesize that in some cases, minorities, especially African American students, may stop trying in school because they do not want to be accused of “[[acting white]]” by their peers,&lt;ref&gt;''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the "Burden of 'Acting White'"'' [[Signithia Fordham]] and John U. Ogbu 1986&lt;/ref&gt; or that some minority students simply stop trying because they do not believe they will ever see the true or deserved benefits of their hard work. As some researchers point out, minority students may feel little motivation to do well in school because they do not believe it will pay off in the form of a better job or upward [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the "Burden of 'Acting White'"'' Signithia Fordham and John U. Ogbu 1986&lt;/ref&gt; By not trying to do well in school, such students engage in a rejection of the [[achievement ideology]] &amp;ndash; that is, the idea that working hard and studying long hours will pay off for students in the form of higher wages or upward social mobility.

====Structural and institutional factors====
Different schools have different effects on similar students. Children of color tend to be concentrated in low-achieving, highly segregated schools. In general, minority students are more likely to come from low-income households, meaning minority students are more likely to attend poorly funded schools based on the districting patterns within the school system. Schools in lower-income districts tend to employ less qualified teachers and have fewer educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;''Education and the Inequalities of Place'' Vincent J.Roscigno, Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, and Martha Crowley 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student learning. Good teachers can actually close or eliminate the gaps in achievement on the standardized tests that separate white and minority students.&lt;ref name="teachers"&gt;Gordon, Kane &amp; Staiger (2006). 'Identifying Effective Teachers Using Performance on the Job.' Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools also tend to place students in [[tracking (education)|tracking]] groups as a means of tailoring lesson plans for different types of learners. However, as a result of schools placing emphasis on socioeconomic status and cultural capital, minority students are vastly over-represented in lower educational tracks.&lt;ref&gt;''Why Do Some Schools Group By Ability?'' Peter G. VanderHart 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Hispanic and African American students are often wrongly placed into lower tracks based on teachers’ and administrators’ expectations for minority students. Such expectations of a race within school systems are a form of [[institutional racism]]. Some researchers compare the tracking system to a modern form of [[racial segregation]] within the schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Detracking: The Social Construction of Ability, Cultural Politics, and Resistance to Reform'' Jeannie Oakes, Amy Stuart Wells, Makeba Jones, and Amanda Datnow 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on tracking groups within schools have also proven to be detrimental for minority students.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Teachers' Beliefs on Teaching, Learning, and Students: A Pilot Study in the United States of America'' Kim Hyunsook Song 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Once students are in these lower tracks, they tend to have less-qualified teachers, a less challenging curriculum, and few opportunities to advance into higher tracks.&lt;ref&gt;''Social Class in Public Schools'' Jennifer L. Hochschild 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some research that suggests students in lower tracks suffer from social psychological consequences of being labeled as a slower learner, which often leads children to stop trying in school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In fact, many sociologists argue that tracking in schools does not provide any lasting benefits to any group of students.&lt;ref&gt;''Is Ability Grouping Equitable?'' Adam Gamoran 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of awarding low grades and test scores to children who struggle causes low-performing children to experience anxiety, demoralization, and a loss of control.&lt;ref name="Crooks, Terence J. 1988"&gt;Crooks, Terence J. (1988). The Impact of Classroom Evaluation Practices on Students.

(2017). ''Solving the achievement gap: Overcoming the structure of school inequality.'' New York: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect may explain why the achievement gap has resisted solution.&lt;ref name="Yeh, Stuart S. 2017"/&gt;

====Preschool education====
Additionally, poor and minority students have disproportionately less access to high-quality early childhood education, which has been shown to have a strong impact on early learning and development. One study found that although black children are more likely to attend preschool than white children, they may experience lower-quality care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Early Childhood Care and Education: Effects on Ethnic and Racial Gaps in School Readiness |first=Katherine A. |last=Magnuson |first2=Jane |last2=Waldfogel |year=2005 |journal=The Future of Children |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=169–196 |jstor=1602667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also found that Hispanic children in the U.S. are much less likely to attend preschool than white children. Another study conducted in Illinois in 2010&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fuller, 2010 (referenced in: {{cite web |url=http://www.mccormickfoundation.org/pdf/press%20release%20-%20NJLC%20Illinois%20as%20Trailblazer.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207045158/http://mccormickfoundation.org/PDF/PRESS%20RELEASE%20-%20NJLC%20Illinois%20as%20Trailblazer.pdf |archivedate=December 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that only one in three Latino parents could find a preschool slot for his or her child, compared to almost two thirds of other families.

Finally, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), families with modest incomes (less than $60,000) have the least access to preschool education.&lt;ref&gt;"Who Goes to Preschool and Why Does it Matter?" W. Steven Barnett &amp; Donald J. Yarosz, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that dramatic increases in both enrollment and quality of prekindergarten programs would help to alleviate the school readiness gap and ensure that low-income and minority children begin school on even footing with their peers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Economic implications of the racial achievement gap===
In addition to the moral and social justice arguments for closing the achievement gap, there are [[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Economic outcomes|strong economic arguments for doing so]]. A 2009 report by the management consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] asserts that the persistence of the achievement gap in the U.S. has the economic effect of a “permanent national recession."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap on America's Schools |publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company |year=2009 |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievementgap.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424192005/http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievementgap.asp |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report claims that if the achievement gap between black and Latino performance and white student performance had been narrowed, GDP in 2008 would have been $310 billion to $525 billion higher (2–4 percent).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

If the gap between low-income students and their peers had been narrowed, GDP in the same year would have been $400 billion to $670 billion higher (3–5 percent). In addition to the potential increase in GDP, the report projects that closing the achievement gap would lead to cost savings in areas outside of education, such as incarceration and healthcare. The link between low school performance and crime, low earnings and poor health has been echoed in academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence From Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-reports |first=L. |last=Lochner |first2=E. |last2=Moretti |year=2004 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=155–189 |doi=10.1257/000282804322970751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krueger |first=Alan B. |first2=Diane M. |last2=Whitmore |chapter=Would Smaller Classes Help Close the Black-White Achievement Gap? |title=Bridging the Achievement Gap |publisher=The Brookings Institution |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences of technical difficulties and technology support ===
Students who have problems with technology interfered are more likely to withdraw from their online courses (Bambara et al., 2009)&lt;ref&gt;Bambara, C. S., Harbour, C. P., Davies, T. G., &amp; Athey, S. (2009). Delicate engagement: The lived experience of community college students enrolled in highrisk online courses. Community College Review, 36(3), 219–238. doi:10.1177/0091552108327187 &lt;/ref&gt;. Also, there's no sufficient technology support which will also leads students to drop the class since their problems could not be solved quickly (Palmer &amp; Holt, 2010; Yang &amp; Cornelius, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S., &amp; Holt, D. (2010). Students’ perceptions of the value of the elements of an online learning environment: Looking back in moving forward. Interactive Learning Environments, 18(2), 135–151. doi:10.1080/09539960802364592

Presented at Association for Educational Communications and Technology Annual Meeting 2005. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.learntechlib.org/p/76937/&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences of technology experience, skills, and self-efficacy ===
Students who were more focused and engaged themselves to the class will tend to receive higher grade, their self-confidence can be gained through daily life use of Internet (Sahin &amp; Shelley, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Sahin, I., &amp; Shelley, M. (2008). Considering students’ perceptions: The distance education student’s satisfaction model. Journal of Educational Technology and Society, 11(3), 216–223. &lt;/ref&gt;. Male online learners had higher Internet self-efficacy than female, while they participated less in discussions (Chang et al., 2014; Ong &amp; Lai, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C.S., Liu, E. Z.F., Sung, H.Y., Lin, C. H., Chen, N.S., &amp; Cheng, S.S. (2014). Effects of online college student’s Internet selfefficacy on learning motivation and performance.

=== Factors contributing to onsite academic success for African American males ===
As Fletcher (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R. P. (2015). Voices of persistence: A case study analysis of African American male community college students participating in a firstyear learning community (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3737723)&lt;/ref&gt; indicated, possible factors that helped African American college students to gain academic success via online education might be: positive pre-college educational experiences, supportive environments in college campus, involving in campus activities, positive faculty interactions and support, same race/gender relationships with peers, family support, self-confidence, future career ambitions and the ability to face racism.

=== African American male online learners as college students ===
Students of color like African American students need a color-blind environment to support them reaching towards academic success better. In this way they are more likely to gain self-confidence and educational resilience (Tucker, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, W. G. (2014). Spaces for success in higher education: Males of color at an online predominantly white community college (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3621155) &lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Attempts at narrowing the racial achievement gap ===
Explanations for the achievement gap and concerns over its effects and even the existence of such a gap are widely contested.  These explanations are also the source of much controversy, especially since efforts to "close the gap" have become some of the more politically prominent education reform issues. The issues that the achievement gap perpetuate also hold politically charged issues. For example, the cause of the Latino education crisis is not attributable to any single factor. It is likely the result of multiple variables-- all of which can have an effect on one another-- ranging from social, economic, and educational conditions to inadequate social services and families with exceptionally low human and social capital. The effects of the achievement gap in school can be seen later in life for students. For example, since schools often lack the resources to meet many students' most basic educational needs and since there are few entry level jobs that provide a living wage and benefits available to those without higher education or special skills in the economy, many are left at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215170642/http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-02-15|title=NEA - The Crisis in the Education of Latino Students|date=2010-02-15|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following attempts have all been made in order to counteract the effects of the achievement gap at schools. They range from nationwide, government-led initiatives to smaller school-based initiatives.

====Standards-based reform and No Child Left Behind====
The federal [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002 (NCLB) focuses on standardized test scores and school accountability to ensure that all students have the same educational opportunities. As written, the legislation incentivizes that schools show continual improvement toward this goal (otherwise known as "Adequate Yearly Progress," or AYP) otherwise schools face punishments, such as sanctions. This system has been criticized by some for being unfair toward schools that have the highest population of minority and poor students, as it is harder for these schools to meet the standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act, due to insufficient funding from either local, district, or state actors. This in turn leads to a cycle of underperformance and sanctions within these areas which furthers the problems that the Act meant to fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Obama Administration]] instituted the [[Race to the Top]] (RTTT) program which provides financial incentives to states to produce measurable student gains. RTTT's primary goals are to improve student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve high school graduation rates.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact Sheet: The Race to the Top". The White House. Archived from the original on April 9, 2011. Retrieved April 9,2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of both programs has been to close the achievement gap, but the RTTT has been more focused on closing the gap between higher and lower performing schools rather than focusing on a national approach.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0235.htm|title=COMPARING NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND AND RACE TO THE TOP|last=Director|first=Judith Lohman, Assistant|website=www.cga.ct.gov|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major difference between the two educational reform programs is that RTTT is a competitive grant program that provides incentives for schools to change, while the NCLB Act mandated various changes in state and local education systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The RTTT's approach is more adaptable and focused as it allows for individual actions between schools, and is meant to encourage reform within schools without resorting to punishments, whereas the No Child Left Behind Act relies on punishments as its main form of promoting reform in schools.

Another attempt to standardize the education of students is the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], also known as Common Core. The Common Core, created in 2009 and 2010, sets benchmarks for the skills that students should have by certain grade levels in subjects such as Math and Language Arts and the system itself is to meant to be a national baseline for how students are achieving. This baseline is meant to help establish what students need in order to achieve in higher education.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/commoncore/3-what-problems-is-the-common-core-trying-to-solve|title=What problems is the Common Core trying to solve?|date=2014-03-26|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the standards are meant to be nationwide, they have only been adopted by 35 states as it is not mandatory for states to subscribe to the Common Core unless they desire federal grants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-states-academic-standards-common-core-or.html|title=Map: Tracking the Common Core State Standards|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Core Initiative has been criticized as it has not yielded any noticeable improvement in what has almost 10 years since it has been implemented, due to a multiple reasons, from incorrect implementation to content as the idea of a centralized system for education has been criticized for not taking the dynamic differences in learning-style into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nealmccluskey/2018/10/18/common-core-doesnt-seem-to-be-working-that-may-be-just-fine/#1b9d5bbb6993|title=Common Core Doesn't Seem To Be Working; That May Be Just Fine|last=McCluskey|first=Neal|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newest addition to the growing list of government-led initiatives has been the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], or ESSA. The ESSA, enacted in December 2015, is Congress's replacement for the NCLB. The ESSA takes notes from both the RTTT and the NCLB, by keeping the standardized testing of the NCLB while allowing for the flexibility of the RTTT. The ESSA gives states more say in how schools are held accountable, and how states can act to fix issues at their schools, and as such, states can set long-term goals instead of having to worry about year-to-year performance issues as with the NCLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/every-student-succeeds-act/index.html|title=The Every Student Succeeds Act: An ESSA Overview|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; States must still identify low performing schools and provide additional support, but now states can focus on long-term solutions. The new bill also focuses more on academic growth, which is subjective and does not always line up with a student's grade level, whereas the NCLB only cared whether students were performing to grade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://educationpost.org/the-abcs-of-esea-essa-and-no-child-left-behind/|title=The ABC’s of ESEA, ESSA and No Child Left Behind - Education Post|work=Education Post|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining the standardized test requirements of the NCLB while allowing for more state control like in the RTTT, the ESSA hopes to achieve long-lasting success and reform.

====School-based reform====
Initiatives to close the achievement gap have been implemented at the school, district and state level in order to better address the issue. These include investments in pre-kindergarten programs, class size reduction, small schools, curricular reform, alignment of pre-kindergarten through college standards and expectations, and improved teacher education programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Bridging the Achievement Gap" John E. Chubb &amp; Tom Loveless, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools have started implementing [[After-school activity|after-school activities]] such as tutoring sessions, remedial programs, and rapid assessment programs. These programs are meant to help minority students learn at a more accelerated rate in order to help them catch up to their peers. Other schools have started de-tracking their students in order to provide the same quality education for all students, regardless of race. De-tracking not only allows for all students to be taught in the same way, but it also opens up new opportunities for students who would be put on a certain career path by their education.

====Teacher-focused reform====
Another focus of reform directed toward the achievement gap has been on teacher development, as research shows that since teachers are responsible for almost every aspect of a child's education within the bounds of a classroom. Therefore, in order to best address the achievement gap, reform efforts based on improved teaching are one of the main strategies used to address the gap. This reform effort has been both top-down, in the form of higher state standards for teacher education and preparation,&lt;ref&gt;"Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching" Linda Darling-Hammond(prepared for the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as bottom-up, through programs like Teach for America and AmeriCorps that aim to address educational inequity by recruiting and training teachers specifically to work in high-needs schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for America: Our Approach|url=http://www.teachforamerica.org/what-we-do/our-approach/|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Way Public Schools AmeriCorps team|url=http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|accessdate=October 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419162328/http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|archive-date=April 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investment in early childhood====
One strategy being used to address the achievement gap has been focusing on early childhood development. Economic research shows that investment at this stage is both more effective and cost effective than interventions later in a child's life.&lt;ref&gt;"Investments in Early Childhood as a Means for Deficit Reduction" James Heckman, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By helping develop critical skills early on, these programs cut out the need for such intervention later on. Head Start and various state-funded pre-kindergarten programs target students from low-income families in an attempt to level the playing field for these children before school begins. In addition to increased access, there has also an increased national focus on raising quality standards for Head Start and state-funded pre-K programs, and in improving training and professional development for early care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Changing Landscape of Pre-K: Examining the changes and impacts of quality standards in prekindergarten at the national, state, district and program levels|url=http://www.nieer.org|accessdate=April 13, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110417172816/http://nieer.org/| archivedate=April 17, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is substantial evidence pointing to early childhood development playing a huge role in closing the achievement gap: various studies, including the Carolina Abecedarian study, Child-Parent Center study, and HighScope Perry Preschool study, have shown that pre-K programs can have a positive and long-lasting impact on academic achievement of low-income and minority students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=F. A. |last2=Ramey |first2=C. T. |year=1995 |title=Cognitive and school outcomes for high-risk African-American students at middle adolescence: Positive effects of early intervention |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=743–772 |doi=10.3102/00028312032004743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Chicago Child-Parent Centers: A Longitudinal Study of Extended Early Childhood Intervention" Arthur J.

Pre-K programs help students develop social, emotional, and critical thinking skills at a young age, and while none of this prevents the effects of poverty, it does help in dampening the effects while also better preparing student for their future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/03/524907739/pre-k-decades-worth-of-studies-one-strong-message|title=Pre-K: Decades Worth Of Studies, One Strong Message|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of narrowing the racial achievement gap====
Sociologists [[Christopher Jencks]] and Meredith Phillips have argued that narrowing the black-white test score gap "would do more to move [the United States] toward racial equality than any politically plausible alternative".&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"/&gt; As already discussed, there is also strong evidence that narrowing the gap would have a significant positive economic and social impact.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, Stuart S. (2009). Shifting the Bell Curve: The Benefits and Costs of Raising Student Achievement. Evaluation and Program Planning, 32(1), 74-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narrowing the achievement gap through technology====

Computer and technology use have been linked to increased student achievement. “When teachers and administrators make a sustained commitment to the use of [[computers in the classroom]], student achievement increases (Mann &amp; Shafer, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=D. |last2=Shafer |first2=E. |year=1997 |title=Technology and Achievement |journal=The American School Board Journal |url=http://www.asbj.com/achievement/cilcilo.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randomized experiments demonstrate that the performance of low-achieving students can be improved by using technology that adjusts the level of difficulty of the books and math problems that are presented to each student, raises the probability that each student will achieve high scores on end-of-book reading comprehension quizzes and high accuracy scores on daily math assignments, raises the probability that each student can earn high letter grades, and creates a structured environment where each student is likely to receive regular, objective, positive feedback signaling that he or she is advancing on a daily basis, promoting high self-efficacy and a strong sense of control over academic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ysseldyke |first=Jim |last2=Bolt |first2=Daniel M. |year=2007 |title=Effect of Technology-Enhanced Continuous Progress Monitoring on Math Achievement |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=453–467 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven M., Nunnery, John, &amp; Goldfeder, Elizabeth (2004).

Generally, those students who enrolled and finished online courses were older college students (Fetzner, 2013; James, Swan, &amp; Daston., 2016; Newell, 2007; Romero &amp; Usart, 2014 ). &lt;ref&gt;Fetzner, M.

As Friedman (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, T. L. (2007). The world is flat: A brief history of the TwentyFirst Century (3rd ed.). New York, NY: Picador. &lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the world is flat, online education has made the education becomes more accessible for a wider range of students. But there's also some counter points of online education for example: lack of technical support (Palmer &amp; Holt, 2010; Yang &amp; Cornelius, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S., &amp; Holt, D. (2010). Students’ perceptions of the value of the elements of an online learning environment: Looking back in moving forward.

Using technology as a tool for narrowing the achievement gap begins with a purpose, communication, listening, and collaboration. These skills can be achieved through the use of weblogs, social networking sites, feeds, and myriad other multimedia. In classrooms, students can communicate internally, or they can work side by side with others who are located thousands of miles away. Through the use of technology, presentations can be archived so that the material can be reviewed at any time. “All teachers could record important parts of what they do in the classroom that can then be archived to the class Weblog and used by students who may have missed the class or just want a refresher on what happened.” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;117)&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"&gt;Richardson, W. (2010), Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms&lt;/ref&gt;

Having access to information on the web gives students an advantage to learning. “Students at all levels show more interest in their work and their ability to locate and reflect upon their work is greatly enhanced as are the opportunities for collaborative learning” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;28).&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"/&gt; Weblogs are different from posts or comments; they require students to analyze and synthesize the content and communicate their understanding with the audience responses in mind. 
 
Technology has been incorporated into the Standards. Even though the NCLB Act holds school districts accountable for student achievement, there are still many students who do not have the resources at home to fully take part in these excellent educational tools. Some teachers feel that technology is not the solution and see it as a risk. Therefore, technology is not always being used to its fullest potential by teachers and students do not gain the advantages technology offers. “Given the fact that the amount of information going online shows no sign of slowing, if they are unable to consistently collect potentially relevant information for their lives and careers and quickly discern what of that information is most useful, they will be at a disadvantage.” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;73).&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"/&gt;

According to the U.S. Census, by 2012, it is estimated that 70% of homes will have broadband access. While this is a large percentage, it still leaves 30% of households without internet access. The government has lent its hand in closing the Global Achievement Gap by granting funding for low-income school districts for programs such as one-on-one computing, however, the fact that many of these students do not have online capability at home is still a main issue. This [[digital divide]] may cause the achievement gap to increase as technology continues to become heavily integrated in the daily coursework for school children. Students need to have Internet access outside of school on a regular basis to successfully complete challenging courswork.

According to National Center for Education Statistics, it noted that African American 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade male students had the lowest reading scores among other racial and ethnic group. Reading gaps between African Americans and Whites have increased from 1992 to present (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2016). Educational attainment of young adults, 2016. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=27&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Tonsing-Meyer (2013)&lt;ref&gt;TonsingMeyer, J. (2013). An examination of online instructional practices based on the learning styles of graduate education students. The Quarterly Review of Distance Education, 14(3), 141–149. &lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the reading and writing practice was specified and emphasized in 85% of online course assignment, with activities attached, which might improve this situation.

===High-performing high-poverty and high-minority schools===
Exceptions to the achievement gap exist. Schools that are majority black, even poor, can perform well above national norms, with [[John S. Davidson Fine Arts Magnet School|Davidson Magnet School]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} in [[Augusta, Georgia]] being a prominent example. Another school with remarkable gains for students of color is Amistad Academy in New Haven, Connecticut.Additionally North Star Academy has been awarded the National Blue Ribbon School for two years in a row. These schools offer more rigorous, traditional modes of instruction, including [[Direct Instruction]]. In one study, Direct Instruction was found to be the single most effective pedagogical method for raising the skill levels of inner-city students (Project Follow Through).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/hu091597.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

High performing Black schools are not unique to the twentieth century. In Washington, DC in the late 19th century, a predominantly low income Black school performed higher than three White schools in yearly testing. This trend continued until the mid 20th century, and during that time the M Street School exceeded national norms on standardized tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsowell.com/speducat.html|title=Thomas Sowell - "The Education of Minority Children"|first=Na|last=Liu|website=www.tsowell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans lagged behind whites in 2000 by nearly a factor of two. However, it is less frequently observed{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} that whites lag behind Asians by nearly as large a ratio. The group with the least education is not the African Americans, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Hispanic]] or [[Latino]] or other groups who have quite a different legacy of discrimination.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The African-American community is behind the curve in education but statistics show 9 out of 10 young black adults ages 25 to 29 have completed high school or its equivalent.

In 2008, over three million degrees were awarded throughout the United States. Half of all degrees earned were [[bachelor's degrees]]. The bachelor's degree is one of the most awarded degrees for all ethnicities and races. Asians obtained bachelor's degrees more than any other race, followed by Whites. Despite high educational expectations, Hispanics are among the least educated group in the United States: 11 percent of those over age 25 have earned a bachelor's degree or higher compared with 17 percent of blacks, 30 percent of whites, and 49 percent of Asian Americans in the same age group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003).&lt;ref name="Schhneider"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Barriers to Educational Opportunities for Hispanics in the United States|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19909/|date = 2006-01-01|first = Barbara|last = Schhneider|first2 = Sylvia|last2 = Martinez|first3 = Ann|last3 = Ownes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asians obtain more [[first professional degree]]s than any other race. A high percentage{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} of Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska Natives own an [[associate's degree]] compared with other races. About 1–2% [[doctorate degree]]s are awarded to all races. The table below shows the number of degrees awarded for each group.

=== College and university enrollment ===

Between 1978 and 2008, college enrollment rates increased for all races. The college enrollment rate is determined by the percentage of high school students who enroll in two-year or four-year college and universities immediately after high school. In 2008, the college enrollment rate for all races was 69%. Although the college rate increased for each racial and ethnic group between 1980 and 2007, the enrollment rates for [[Black people|Blacks]] and [[Hispanics]] did not increase, and the college enrollment rate for Blacks increased from 44% to 56%.{{clarification needed|date=June 2018|It did increase, but it didn't, but it did?}} Between 1980 and 2007, the college enrollment rates for Hispanics have increased from 50% to 62%. In comparison, the same rate increased from 49.8% to 77.7% for Whites.

In 2009, the enrollment rate of high school graduates reached a historical high of 70.1% (see above for statistics on the racial gap in graduation rates).

=== Parenting influence ===

Parenting methods are different across cultures, thus can have dramatic influence on educational outcomes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} For instance, Asian parents often apply strict rules and parental authoritarianism to their children while many white American parents deem creativity and self-sufficiency to be more valuable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} ''[[Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]]'' by Yale Professor Amy Chua highlights some of the very important aspects in Asian parenting method in comparison to the “American way”. Chua's book has generated interests and controversies in the “Tiger Mom” parenting method and its role in determining children's education outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger Moms: Is Tough Parenting Really the Answer?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2043477,00.html|publisher=Time Magazine | date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hispanic parents and their children believe that a college degree is necessary for obtaining stable and meaningful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ambitious Generation: America's Teenagers, Motivated but Directionless.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED430176|publisher = Yale University Press |isbn = 0-300-07982-6|first = Barbara|last = Schneider|first2 = David|last2 = Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude is reflected in the educational expectations parents hold for their children and in the expectations that young people have for themselves (U.S. Department of Education, 1995b, p.&amp;nbsp;88).&lt;ref name="Schhneider"/&gt; High educational expectations can be found among all racial and ethnic groups regardless of their economic and social resources (p.&amp;nbsp;73). Although parents and children share high educational aims, their aspirations do not necessarily translate into postsecondary matriculation. This is especially the case for Hispanic high school students, particularly those whose parents have not attended college.&lt;ref&gt;Nuñez, Cuccaro-Alamin, and Carroll, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/98082.pdf |title = National Center for Education Statistics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental involvement in children's education is influential to children's success at school.&lt;ref name="brown.edu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=J.

Collaboration between teachers and parents is necessary when working to help a child; parents have the necessary knowledge of what is best for their child's situation.&lt;ref name="LaRocque, M. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=LaRocque |first=M. |last2=Kleiman |first2=I. |last3=Darling |first3=S.

School administrators must accommodate and account for family differences and also be supportive by promoting ways families can get involved. For example, schools can provide support by accommodating the needs of the family who have do not have transportation, schools may do so by providing external resources that may benefit the family.&lt;ref&gt;Flakes, B. M. (2007). Teacher and parent perceptions of parental involvement at W. S. Hornsby Elementary School. (Doctoral dissertation). (Order No. 3278095). Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/304722541&lt;/ref&gt; As referenced by Feliciano et al. (2016), educators can also account for culture by providing education about the diversity at the school. This can be achieved by creating an environment where both teachers and students learn about cultures represented among the student population.

Larocquem et al. (2011) stated that family involvement may include visiting their children's class, being involved with a parent teacher organization, attending school activities, speaking to the child's class, and volunteering at school events. It is also important for families to be involved with the child's school assignments, especially by holding them accountable for completion and discussion of the work assigned.&lt;ref name="LaRocque, M. 2011"/&gt; Also, educators may want to consider how parental language barriers and educational experiences affect families and the influence of contributing to their child's education.&lt;ref name="brown.edu"/&gt; In addition, even when families want to get involved, they may not know how to collaborate with school personnel, especially for families who are Hispanic, African American, and or of low economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barton |first=A.

(2011) suggest that teachers need to find out what values and expectations are held for the child, which should be done by involving parents in the decision making process.&lt;ref name="LaRocque, M. 2011"/&gt;

=== Illiteracy ===

African Americans were once denied educations. Even as late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. However, by 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among African Americans—the number of among young adults was less than one percent, though African Americans still lag in more stringent definitions of document literacy.&lt;!-- see table below --&gt; Inability to read, write or speak English in America today is largely an issue for immigrants, mostly from Asia and [[Latin America]].

=== Immigrants ===
Educational attainment rates change when it comes to comparing the same races against immigrants or foreign born students. Black African and Caribbean immigrant groups to the U.S report having higher levels of education than any other group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwec.edu/geography/ivogeler/w188/datarace.htm |title=U.S. Population: Ethnicity, Race, Gender, Income |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214090723/http://www.uwec.edu/geography/ivogeler/w188/datarace.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2018}} Of all foreign-born U.S. residents, foreign born Africans (those who come from the African continent) nowadays{{when|date=April 2018}} have a higher level of educational attainment than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/diversitymatters/a/DoesAffirmativeActionAddressIntraRacialDivides.htm|title=Ethnicities Eligible for College Affirmative Action|author=Nadra Kareem Nittle|work=About.com News &amp; Issues|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aracorporation.org"&gt;{{cite journal |title=African-Born U.S. Residents are the Most Highly Educated Group in American Society |journal=Journal of Blacks in Higher Education |volume=13 |year=1996 |pages=33–34 |doi=10.2307/2963153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be highly educated and be fluent in English.

According to data from the [[2000 United States Census]], "43.8 percent of African immigrants had achieved a college degree, compared with 42.5 of Asian Americans, 28.9 percent of immigrants from Europe, Russia and Canada and 23.1 percent of the U.S. population as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaresource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=235:african-immigrants-are-the-most-educated&amp;catid=135:immigration&amp;Itemid=348|title=African Immigrants are the Most Educated|author=Africa|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The educational attainment amount varies by group.

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans age 25 to 29 had completed high school, lagging only slightly behind 93 percent for whites. For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.

Source: 1995 College Board SAT Profiles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurhu.com/index/test.htm#satincome] Hu's Index of Diversity&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative African American scholars such as [[Thomas Sowell]] observe that while SAT scores are lower for students with less parental education and income. Asian Americans who took the SAT with incomes below $10,000 score 482 in math in 1995, comparable to whites earning $30–40,000 and higher and blacks over $70,000. Test scores in middle-income black communities, such as [[Prince George County]], are still not comparable to those in non-black suburbs.

=== State standards ===

Most state tests showing African American failure rates anywhere from two to four times the rate of whites, such as Washington State's [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] test, and only half to one-quarter as likely to achieve a high score, even though these tests were designed to eliminate the negative effects of bias associated with standardized multiple choice tests. It is a top goal of education reform to eliminate the ''[[Education gap]]'' between all races, though skeptics question whether legislation such as [[No Child Left Behind]] truly closes the gap just by raising expectations. Others, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], observe it may merely penalize those who do not score as well as the most educated ethnic and income groups.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Murray |title=Acid Tests |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 25, 2006 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115379210632316123 }} He claims NCLB punishes minority students and does not close basic skill differences.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===

The amount of education completed varies greatly between members of religions in the United States. Hindus and Jews, for example, are more likely than general population to have completed a college education, whereas members of Evangelical churches, historically Black Protestant churches and Jehovah's Witness are less likely (21%, 15% and 12% respectively).&lt;ref name="pew2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pew Research Center |date=12 May 2015 |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/05/RLS-05-08-full-report.pdf |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=The Pew Forum |accessdate=20 May 2015 |page=56 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082110/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/05/RLS-05-08-full-report.pdf |archivedate=May 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International comparisons ===

{{TIMSSMathScores2007}}

As a whole, students in the United States lagged the best Asian and European nations in the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS international math and science test]]. However, broken down by race, US Asians scored comparably to Asian nations, white Americans scored comparably to the best European nations. Although some racial generally score lower than whites in the US, they scored as well as whites in other European nations. Hispanic Americans averaged 505, comparable to students Austria and Sweden, while African Americans at 482 were comparable to Norway and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/12/24/odds-and-ends-alternative-energy-czar-2/|title=Odds and Ends|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404215401/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/12/24/odds-and-ends-alternative-energy-czar-2/|archive-date=April 4, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special programs ===

Achievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of [[special education]] and [[gifted education]] programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, R.

==Gender achievement gap in the United States==
{{see also|Sex and intelligence}}
For the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science.&lt;ref name="Kafer"/&gt;

Data in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious [[STEM fields]] (science, technology, engineering, and math).&lt;ref name="Kafer"&gt;Kafir, Krista (April 2007). "Taking the Boy Crisis in Education Seriously: How School Choice can Boost Achievement Among Boys and Girls." Independent Women's Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; Male students consistently achieved worse school marks than female students from 1913 to 2011 in all countries for which there is data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Voyer |first2=Susan D. |last2=Voyer |title=Gender Differences in Scholastic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=2014 |volume=140 |issue=4 |page=1194 |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-a0036620.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Fletcher (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R. P. (2015). Voices of persistence: A case study analysis of African American male community college students participating in a firstyear learning community (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3737723) &lt;/ref&gt; indicated, possible factors that helped African American college students to gain academic success via online education might be: positive pre-college educational experiences, supportive environments in college campus, involving in campus activities, positive faculty interactions and support, same race/gender relationships with peers, family support, self-confidence, future career ambitions and the ability to face racism.Students of color like African American students need a color-blind environment to support them reaching towards academic success better. In this way they are more likely to gain self-confidence and educational resilience (Tucker, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, W. G. (2014).

===Gender gap in literacy===

[[File:Differences in Average Scale Scores for Girls and Boys.jpg|thumb|450px|Achievement gaps between boys and girls in the United States are more pronounced in reading and writing than in math and science.]]

Traditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing. Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading Assessment measured by the [[US Department of Education]], the gap between boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14 points behind girls during their 12th grade year.&lt;ref name="Perie"&gt;Perie, M. (2005). NAEP 2004 Trends in Academic Progress. Washington, DC: US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap between males and females.&lt;ref name="Perie"/&gt;

On the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17 points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21 points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high school.&lt;ref name="Persky"&gt;Persky, H. (2003). The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2002. US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In the more recent 2007 National Assessment of Writing Skills, female students continued to score higher than male students, though margins closed slightly from previous assessments. The average score for female eighth-graders was 20 points higher than males, down 1 point from the 2002 score. For twelfth-graders, females outscored males by 18 points as opposed to 21 points in 2002.&lt;ref name="Salahu"&gt;Salahu-Din, Debra (2008). The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2007. US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these assessments were conducted on a 100-point scale.&lt;ref name="Perie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salahu"/&gt;

===Gender gap in math and science===

Which gender is disadvantaged by the gap in math and science achievement largely depends on how academic achievement is being measured. Female students generally have better grades in their math classes, and this gap starts off very minimal but increases with age.&lt;ref name="Dee2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dee |first=T. |year=2007 |title=Teachers and the gender gaps in student achievement |journal=Journal of Human Resources |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.3368/jhr.XLII.3.528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adeleke |first=M. |year=2007 |title=Gender disparity in mathematical performance revisited: can training in problem solving bring difference between boys and girls? |work=Essays in Education |volume=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, males score higher on standardized math tests, and these score gaps also increase with age. Male students also score higher on measures of college readiness, such as the AP Calculus exams and the math section of the SAT.&lt;ref&gt;Amelink, C. (2009).

The differences in National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) math scores between boys and girls nearly double from the 9-year-olds to the 17-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Dee2007" /&gt; This inconsistency in which gender shows more achievement could be due to the fact that class grades, especially in middle and high school, usually depend on a student's completion of homework assignments, and studies have shown that girls report spending more time on homework than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Lubienski, S. T., McGraw, R., &amp; [[Marilyn Strutchens|Strutchens, M.]] (2004). NAEP findings regarding gender: Mathematics achievement, student affect, and learning practices. In P. Kloosterman, &amp; F. K. Lester Jr. (Eds.), Results and interpretations of the 1990 through 2000 mathematics assessments of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (pp. 305–336). Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; The gender gap in mathematics is particularly large among the highest-achieving students; for example, there is a 2.1 to 1 male-female ratio among students who score an 800 on the math portion of the SAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=CollegeBoard.com |year=2010 |title=SAT Percentile Rank or Males, Females, and Total Group, 2007 College-Bound Seniors—Mathematics |others=A table |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/SAT_percentile_ranks_males_females_total_group_mathematics.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study has challenged the existence of the gender gap in mathematics. In 2008 Janet Hyde and others published a study showing that male and female students did equally well on [[No Child Left Behind]] standardized tests that were administered in second through eleventh grades in ten states. However, Hyde and her team did find gaps that favored males at the upper end of the achievement distribution and tried to examine gaps on more difficult test questions (previous research has shown that males outperform females on more challenging items), but the tests they examined lacked adequately challenging items. This raised questions about whether there is still a gender gap in math achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hyde |first=J. S. |last2=Lindberg |first2=S. M. |last3=Linn |first3=M. C. |last4=Ellis |first4=A. B. |last5=Williams |first5=C.

There is also a large discrepancy between the number of men and women working in STEM fields. Women have been, and continue to be, underrepresented in these fields. This underrepresentation is evident in the distribution of college majors among men and women; from 1997 to 2007, women earned only 18% of engineering bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dey |first=J. G. |last2=Hill |first2=C. |year=2007 |title=Beyond the Pay Gap |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Association of University Women Educational Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender gap in graduation rates===

According to recent data, 55 percent of college students are females and 45 percent are males. From 1995 until 2005, the number of males enrolled in college increased by 18 percent, while the number of female students rose by 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Digest of Education Statistics 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Males are enrolling in college in greater numbers than ever before, yet fewer than two-thirds of them are graduating with a bachelor's degree. The numbers of both men and women receiving a bachelor's degree have increased significantly, but the increasing rate of female college graduates exceeds the increasing rate for males.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, Sara. (2006). The Evidence Suggests Otherwise: The Truth About Boys and Girls. Washington: Education Sector.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the percentage of women with bachelor's degrees was higher than the percentage of men with bachelor's degrees for the first time in America. &lt;ref&gt; "Women Now at the Head of the Class, Lead Men in College Attainment" Wed Oct 07 2015.

===Gender gap in lifetime earnings===
{{see also|Gender pay gap}}
Although more women are graduating with undergraduate degrees, men are still earning disproportionately more in their lifetimes. This could be due to many factors, including different types of jobs for males and females. Females are greatly underrepresented in science and engineering fields, which are typically correlated with high lifetime earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bedard |first=Kelly |first2=Insook |last2=Cho |year=2010 |title=Early gender test score gaps across OECD countries |journal=Economics of Education Review |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=348–363 |doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2009.10.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Males and females also have vastly different labor market histories based on type of job and time spent in each job.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

==Possible causes of the gender achievement gap in the United States==

===Teacher interactions===

How a student interacts with and is evaluated by his or her teachers is closely correlated with that student's future academic achievement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} According to researcher Thomas Good, there are two competing views of how teachers can indirectly impact the achievement of their students. The first is that teachers are more likely to give special attention and extra assistance to students who appear to be struggling in their class. In reading and writing classes, male students are often behind female students in terms of achievement. Therefore, male students are more likely to get more teacher attention, and this extra interaction could give males an advantage in terms of future achievement. The second view is that teachers demand more and show more respect toward students who they view to be high achievers, which creates a cycle in which only students who are perceived to be intelligent receive extra help and teacher attention.&lt;ref name="Good"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Good |first=T. L. |year=1987 |title=Two decades of research on teacher expectations: Findings and future directions |journal=Journal of Teacher Education |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=32–47 |doi=10.1177/002248718703800406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher evaluations===

How teachers perceive students’ knowledge and abilities varies by gender and influences classroom processes and student achievement in both reading and math. Teachers usually have higher expectations for students they view as higher achievers and treat these students with more respect.&lt;ref name="Good"/&gt; A study by Tach and Farkas has also found that when students are split into reading groups based on their abilities, the students in the higher-ability reading groups are more likely to demonstrate positive learning behaviors and higher achievement.&lt;ref name="Tach"/&gt;

Teachers are more likely to favor girls when evaluating what types of readers students seem to be. Because studies have shown that teacher perceptions of students can determine how much individualized attention a student receives and can serve as an indicator of future academic progress, if teachers underestimate males’ reading abilities and use ability grouping in their classrooms, male students might be put at a disadvantage and have their learning in reading classes be negatively affected.&lt;ref name="Tach"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tach |first=L. M. |last2=Farkas |first2=G. |year=2006 |title=Learning-related behaviors, cognitive skills, and ability grouping when schooling begins |journal=Social Science Research |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=1048–1079 |doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2005.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigro, G., M. Tappan, and S. Desrochers. (2008). The gender divide in academic engagement: Perspectives from Maine boys and young men. Report presented at the annual meeting of the Maine Boys Network conference, Bates College, Lewiston, ME.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite trend has been found in math classes. Teachers still tend to view math as a “masculine” subject and tend to have higher expectations for and better attitude towards their male students in these classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Li |first=Q. |year=1999 |title=Teachers’ beliefs and gender differences in mathematics: A review |journal=Educational Research |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=63–76 |doi=10.1080/0013188990410106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Fennema et al. has also shown that teachers tend to name males when asked to list their “best math students.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fennema |first=E. |last2=Peterson |first2=P. L. |last3=Carpenter |first3=T. P. |last4=Lubinski |first4=C. |year=1990 |title=Teachers’ attributions and beliefs about girls, boys, and mathematics |journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=55–69 |doi=10.1007/BF00311015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females are more likely than males to be negatively impacted than male students by this underestimation of their math abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKown |first=C. |last2=Weinstein |first2=R. S. |year=2002 |title=Modeling the role of child ethnicity and gender in children’s differential response to teacher expectations |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=159–184 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb01425.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These gender-specific evaluations from teachers are implicit; usually the teachers have no idea that they are favoring one gender over the other until they are shown concrete evidence, such as a video recording of their classroom. However, even though the discrimination is implicit, it still has negative effects on both male and female students.&lt;ref name="Good"/&gt;

There is conflicting evidence about whether teacher assessments of student performance and ability are consistent with cognitive assessments like standardized tests. Teacher assessment evidence comes from a relatively small number of classrooms when compared to standardized tests, which are administered in every public school in all fifty states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Joseph Paul |first2=Sarah Theule |last2=Lubienski |year=2010 |title=The Development of Gender Achievement Gaps in Mathematics and Reading During Elementary and Middle School: Examining Direct Cognitive Assessments and Teacher Ratings |journal=American Education Research Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=268–302 |doi=10.3102/0002831210372249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotyping===
{{see also|Stereotype threat}}
There is speculation that gender stereotyping within classrooms can also lead to differences in academic achievement and representation for female and male students. Math and science are often perceived as “masculine” subjects because they lead to success in “masculine” fields, such as medicine and engineering. English and history, on the other hand, are often perceived as “feminine” subjects because they are more closely aligned with “feminine” jobs, such as teaching or care work. These stereotypes can influence student achievement in these areas.&lt;ref name="Ellison"/&gt;

Research on [[stereotype threat]] has shown that gender stereotypes decrease the mathematical self-esteem of many female students, and that this lack of academic confidence leads to anxiety and poorer performance on math exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Amelink |first=C. |year=2009 |title=Information sheet: gender differences in math performance |work=Assessing Women in Engineering |volume=1–4 |url=https://www.engr.psu.edu/AWE/misc/ARPs/ARP_InfoSheet_Math.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parent socialization===

How a child's parents view his or her skills can also contribute to the gender achievement gap in education. A study by Jacobs and Eccles has shown that adults rate female children as having better social skills than male children, and that girls are more likely to be seen as "good children" than boys.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt; These gender-based stereotypes can perpetuate the gender achievement gap in education by influencing parents' perceptions of their children's skills, and these perceptions can influence the types of activities and subjects parents steer their children toward.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Janis E. |first2=Jacquelynne S. |last2=Eccles |year=1992 |title=The Impact of Mothers' Gender-Role Stereotypic Beliefs on Mothers' and Children's Ability Perceptions |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=932–944 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-economic factors === 
The gender achievement gap, measured by standardized test scores, suspensions, and absences, in favor of female students, is larger at worse schools and among lower-income households. So poverty and school quality are partially responsible for the gap. &lt;ref&gt;Guo, Jeff. "The serious reason boys do worse than girls." The Washington Post. January 28, 2016. https://archive.today/20180722233207/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/28/the-serious-reason-boys-do-worse-than-girls/?utm_term=.4f067a226d42&amp;noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;

=== self-regulation and conscientiousness. === 
Girls tend to have better self-regulation skills than boys. Self-regulation skills correlate with time spent on homework and time spent taking notes in class. This contributes to girls getting better grades than boys in all subject. &lt;ref&gt;GNAULATI, ENRICO. "Why Girls Tend to Get Better Grades Than Boys Do." The Atlantic. SEP 18, 2014. https://archive.today/20170328190455/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/why-girls-get-better-grades-than-boys-do/380318/#selection-1251.0-1251.12.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Sex differences in psychology]]

==Implications of the gender gap==

It is important to address the gender achievement gap in education because failure to cultivate the academic talents of any one group will have aggregate negative consequences. If women are underrepresented in STEM fields, and if men are underrepresented in the social sciences and humanities, both genders are missing opportunities to develop diverse skill sets that can help them in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Ellison"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellison |first=Glenn |first2=Ashley |last2=Swanson |year=2010 |title=The Gender Gap in Secondary School Mathematics at High Achievement Levels: Evidence from the American Mathematics Competitions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=109–128 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the gender achievement gap in education continues to exist, so does the stereotype that medicine, science, and engineering are all “masculine” fields and that women belong in fields like teaching, counseling, or social work. This stereotype can lead to the image that women who pursue careers in the STEM fields are seen as “nerdy” or “geeky,” and this can have a detrimental effect on the self-esteem of females who do choose to enter these fields.&lt;ref name="Ellison"/&gt;

Researchers have found that the gender achievement gap has a large impact on the future career choices of high-achieving students. Part of this is a result of the college majors that men and women choose; men are more likely to major in engineering or the hard sciences, while women are more likely to receive degrees in English, psychology, or sociology. Therefore, men are statistically more likely to enter careers that have more potential for higher long-term earnings than women.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

The careers that are aligned with these majors have different levels of prestige and different salaries, which can lead to a [[Gender pay gap|gender wage gap]]. U.S. Census data indicates that women who work full-time earn only 77% of what their male counterparts earn. For men and women who are ten years out of college, women earn only 69% of the salaries of their male workers.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

==Attempts to reduce the gender gap==

There have been several studies done of interventions aimed at reducing the gender achievement gap in science classes. Some interventions, such as instituting mentoring programs aimed at women or restructuring the course curriculum, have had limited success. The most successful interventions have been a form of psychological interventions called values affirmation. In a famous study of women's achievement in college science by Miyake et al., values affirmation was successful in reducing the differences between male and female academic achievement in college-level introductory physics classes, and it has been particularly effective at combating the psychological phenomenon known as [[stereotype threat]].&lt;ref name="Miyake"/&gt;

Values affirmation exercises require students to either write about their most important values or their least important values two times at the beginning of the 15-week course. After this intervention, the modal grades of women enrolled in the course increased from a C to a B. Psychological interventions such as this one show promise for increasing women's achievement in math and science courses and reducing the achievement gap that exists between the genders in these subject areas, but further research will need to be done in order to determine whether the positive effects are long-lasting.&lt;ref name="Miyake"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Akira |last=Miyake |first2=Lauren E. |last2=Kost-Smith |first3=Noah D. |last3=Finkelstein |first4=Steven J. |last4=Pollock |first5=Geoffrey L. |last5=Cohen |first6=Tiffany A. |last6=Ito |displayauthors=1 |year=2010 |title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=330 |issue=6008 |pages=1234–1237 |doi=10.1126/science.1195996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barriers for disadvantaged students and efforts to close the gap    ==
Another explanation to address this educational gap is the lack of resources attainable by certain groups of students. A study found that there is a need for financial literacy for students enrolled in colleges and universities. Specifically, there is a need for student knowledge about loans, budgeting, and time requirements for degree completion .&lt;ref&gt;Eichelberger, Brenda, Mattioli, Heather, &amp; Foxhoven, Rachel. (2017). Uncovering Barriers to Financial Capability: Underrepresented Students' Access to Financial Resources. ''Journal of Student Financial Aid,'' ''47''(3), Journal of Student Financial Aid, 2017, Vol.47(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Focus group results in the same study concluded that students in search of financial aid information believe that there will be a lack of understanding among advisors and staff regarding minority student's cultural/identity based circumstances. As a result of this belief, many students rather just not seek any services. 

On the high school level, a report finds that the greater the amount of people of color enrolled at any particular school, the less likely that school has any computer science courses whatsoever .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zelinski, N. (2015, May). "Path not found": Report says low-income students lack computer access. ''Oakland Post'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://libproxy.csun.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.csun.edu/docview/1686085124?accountid=7285&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide economics indicate 1.3 million new jobs in the tech industry by 2022. Meanwhile, African Americans and Latinos only make up about 5 percent of the technical work force. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Supplemental funding for targeted disadvantaged school districts in Ohio showed a reduction in performance gaps between disadvantaged districts and other districts. Supplementing state funds for the districts with higher amount of disadvantaged students produced benefits in the form of student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Gary T., Fortner, C. Kevin, &amp; Thompson, Charles L. (2010). Targeted Funding for Educationally Disadvantaged Students: A Regression Discontinuity Estimate of the Impact on High School Student Achievement. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis,'' ''32''(2), 183-204.&lt;/ref&gt; IDA's or individual development account initiatives introduced in the 1990s to address poverty was found on the belief that poor family's should have access to asset development in order to break the cycle of poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kezar, A., Lester, J., &amp; Yang, H. (2010). Nonprofits Partnering With Postsecondary Institutions to Increase Low-Income Student Access. Educational Policy, 24(3), 500-533.&lt;/ref&gt; As of now most IDA's main focus is on home ownership or starting small businesses. There has been a push for partnerships between community agencies and higher education institutions that would offer IDA's to encourage lower income individuals to turn towards higher education. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Human growth and development}}
[[Biology|Biologically]], an '''adult''' is a [[human]] or other [[organism]] that has reached [[sexual maturity]]. In human context, the term ''adult'' additionally has meanings associated with [[social]] and [[Law|legal]] concepts. In contrast to a "[[Minor (law)|minor]]", a '''legal adult''' is a [[person]] who has attained the [[age of majority]] and is therefore regarded as independent, [[self-sufficient]], and [[:wikt:responsible|responsible]]. The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.

Human adulthood encompasses [[Adult development|psychological adult development]]. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and responsibility that may define an
adult character.

In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or [[coming of age]]. This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.

==Biological adulthood==
[[File:RudolfMilly.jpg|right|thumb|270px|A group of adult people]]
Historically and cross-culturally, adulthood has been determined primarily by the start of [[puberty]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} (the appearance of [[secondary sex characteristics]] such as [[menstruation]] in women, [[ejaculation]] in men, and pubic hair in both sexes). In the past, a person usually moved from the status of child directly to the status of adult, often with this shift being marked by some type of coming-of-age test or ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robin| last = Maranz Henig| title = What Is It About 20-Somethings? | date = 2010-08-18| publisher = New York Times| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1 | pages = 10 | accessdate = 2010-09-24 | quote = THE DISCOVERY OF adolescence is generally dated to 1904, with the publication of the massive study "Adolescence," by G. Stanley Hall, a prominent [[psychologist]] and first president of the American Psychological Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the social construct of [[adolescence]] was created, adulthood split into two forms: ''biological adulthood'' and ''social adulthood.'' Thus, there are now two primary forms of adults: biological adults (people who have attained reproductive ability, are fertile, or who evidence secondary sex characteristics) and social adults (people who are recognized by their culture or law as being adults). Depending on the context, ''adult'' can indicate either definition.

Although few or no established dictionaries provide a definition for the two word term biological adult, the first definition of adult in multiple dictionaries includes "the stage of the life cycle of an animal after reproductive capacity has been attained".&lt;ref&gt;''International Dictionary of Medicine and Biology'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Churchill's Medical Dictionary'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the base definition of the word adult is the period beginning at physical sexual maturity, which occurs sometime after the onset of puberty. Although this is the primary definition of the base word "adult", the term is also frequently used to refer to social adults.  The two-word term ''biological adult'' stresses or clarifies that the original definition, based on physical maturity, is being used.

The time of [[puberty]] varies, but usually begins around 10 or 11 years old. Girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12.&lt;ref name="Kail"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kail | first = RV |author2=Cavanaugh JC| title = Human Development: A Lifespan View | isbn = 0495600377 | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010 | page = 296 |edition = 5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-n5E7oyCgoC&amp;pg=PA296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuiling"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schuiling| title = Women’s Gynecologic Health | isbn = 1284125017 | publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] | year = 2016 | page = 22|accessdate=March 20, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTDFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|quote=The changes that occur during puberty usually happen in an ordered sequence, beginning with thelarche (breast development) at around age 10 or 11, followed by adrenarche (growth of pubic hair due to androgen stimulation), peak height velocity, and finally menarche (the onset of menses), which usually occurs around age 12 or 13.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

==Legal adulthood==
{{Main|Age of majority}}

Legally, ''adulthood'' typically means that one has reached the age of majority - when parents lose [[parenting]] rights and responsibilities regarding the person concerned. Depending on one's jurisdiction, the age of majority may or may not be set independently of and should not be confused with the minimum ages applicable to other activities, such as engaging in a [[contract]], [[marriage]], [[voting]], having a [[employment|job]], serving in the [[military]], buying/possessing [[firearm]]s, [[driving]], traveling abroad, involvement with [[alcoholic beverages]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[gambling]], being a model or actor in [[pornography]], running for [[President]], etc. Admission of a young person to a place may be restricted because of danger for that person, concern that the place may lead the person to immoral behavior or because of the risk that the young person causes damage (for example, at an exhibition of fragile items).

One can distinguish the legality of acts of a young person, or of enabling a young person to carry out that act, by selling, renting out, showing, permitting entrance, allowing participation, etc. There may be distinction between commercially and socially enabling. Sometimes there is the requirement of supervision by a [[legal guardian]], or just by an adult. Sometimes there is no requirement, but rather a recommendation.

Using the example of pornography, one can distinguish between:
*being allowed inside an adult establishment
*being allowed to purchase pornography
*being allowed to possess pornography
*another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person pornography, see [[disseminating pornography to a minor]]
*being a [[pornographic actor]]: rules for the young person, and for other people, regarding production, possession, etc. (see [[child pornography]])

With regard to films with violence, etc.:
*another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person a film; a cinema being allowed to let a young person enter

The age of majority ranges internationally from ages 15 to 21, with 18 being the most common age. [[Nigeria|Niger,]] [[Mali]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Cameroon]] define adulthood at age 15, but marriage of girls at an earlier age is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-07-14-legal-ages-of-marriage-across-africa|title=Legal ages of marriage across Africa: Even when it's 18, they are married off at 12!|last=Spooner|first=Samatha|date=July 14, 2014|website=Mail &amp; Guardian Africa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the world, including most of the United States, [[India]] and [[China]], the [[legal]] adult age is 18 (historically 21) for most purposes, with some notable exceptions:

# [[United Kingdom]] (16)
# [[British Columbia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon Territory]] in [[Canada]] (though there are some exceptions in which Canadians may be considered legal adults in certain situations{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}); [[Nebraska]] and [[Alabama]] in [[The United States]], and [[South Korea]] (19)
# [[Indonesia]] (20)
# [[United States]] purchasing [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and entering [[bar]]s has a minimum age of 21.

==Social construction of adulthood==
In contrast to biological perspectives of aging and adulthood, social scientists conceptualize adulthood as socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Elder, Glen H. Jr. 1985. “Perspectives on the life course.” Pp. 23-49 in ''Life Course Dynamics: Trajectories and Transitions, 1968 – 1980'', ed. Glen H. Elder Jr. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Settersten, Richard A. 1999. ''Lives in Time and Place: The Problems and Promises of Developmental Science.'' Amityville, NY: Baywood Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; While aging is an established biological process, the attainment of adulthood is social in its criteria. In contrast to other perspectives that conceptualize aging and the attainment of adulthood as a largely universal development, regardless of context, nation, generation, gender, race, or social class, social scientists regard these aspects as paramount in cultural definitions of adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Ryff, Carol D. 1985. “The Subjective Experience of Life-Span Transitions.” In ''Gender and the life course'', by Alice S. Rossi, 97-113. New York: Adine.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence of adulthood as a social construction is illustrated by the changing criteria of adulthood over time. Historically, adulthood in the U.S. has rested on completing one's education, moving away from the family of origin, and beginning one's career.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. 1998. “Learning to Stand Alone: The Contemporary American Transition to Adulthood in Cultural and Historical Context.” ''Human Development'' 41:295-315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Daniel J. 1978. ''The Seasons of a Man’s Life.''  New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, Michael J. 2000. “Pathways to Adulthood in Changing Societies: Variability and Mechanisms in Life Course Perspective.” ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 26:667-692.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key historical criteria include entering a marriage and becoming a parent. These criteria are social and subjective; they are organized by gender, race, ethnicity, social class, among other key identity markers. As a result, particular populations feel adult earlier in the life course than do others.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. 2001. “Conceptions of the Transition to Adulthood among Emerging Adults in American Ethnic Groups.” ''Journal of Adult Development'', 8:133-143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aronson, Pamela 2008"&gt;Aronson, Pamela. 2008. “The Markers and Meanings of Growing Up: Contemporary Young Women’s Transition from Adolescence to Adulthood.” ''Gender &amp; Society'' 22:56–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Anne. 2003. “Socioeconomic Status and Age Identity: The Role of Dimensions of Health in the Subjective Construction of Age Identity.” ''Journal of Gerontology'' 58: 101-110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Anne. 2005. “Gendered Experiences in Midlife: Implications for Age Identity.” ''Journal of Aging Studies'' 19:163-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary experiences of and research on young adults today substitute more seemingly subjective criteria for adulthood which resonate more soundly with young adults' experiences of aging.&lt;ref name="Aronson, Pamela 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furstenberg, Frank F. Jr., Rubén G. Rumbaut, and Richard A. Settersten Jr. 2005. “On the Frontier of Adulthood: Emerging Themes and New Directions.” In ''On the frontier of adulthood: Theory,'' ''Research, and Public Policy'', by Richard A. Settersten Jr., Frank F. Furstenburg Jr., and Rubén G. Rumbaut, 3-25. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria are marked by a growing "importance of individualistic criteria and the irrelevance of the demographic markers" of normative conceptions of adulthood."&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, Michael J., Erik J. Porfeli, Jeylan T. Mortimer, and Lance D. Erickson. 2005. “Subjective Age Identity and the Transition to Adulthood: When do Adolescents Become Adults?” In ''On the Frontier of Adulthood: Theory, Research, and Public Policy'', by Richard A. Settersten Jr., Frank F. Furstenburg Jr., and Rubén G. Rumbaut, 225-255. Chicago: University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:230&lt;/sup&gt; In particular, younger cohorts' attainment of adulthood centers on three criteria: gaining a sense of responsibility, independent decision-making, and financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. 2004. ''Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from Late Teens through the Twenties''. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Settersten, Richard A. 2011. “Becoming Adult: Meanings and Markers for Young Americans.” In ''Coming of Age in America: The Transition to Adulthood in the Twenty-First Century'', by Mary C. Waters, Patrick J. Carr, Maria J. Kefalas, and Jennifer Holdaway, 169-190. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
According to [[Jewish]] tradition, adulthood is reached at age 13 (the minimum age of the [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah]]) for Jewish boys and girls; they are expected to demonstrate preparation for adulthood by learning the [[Torah]] and other Jewish practices. The [[Christian]] [[Bible]] and [[Jewish scripture]] contain no age requirement for adulthood or [[marriage|marrying]], which includes engaging in sexual activity

The 1983 Code of Canon Law states, "A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age, and likewise a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age, cannot enter a valid marriage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3Y.HTM canon 1083, §1]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Disappearance of Childhood'' by [[Neil Postman]], the [[Christian Church]] of the [[Middle Ages]] considered the age of accountability, when a person could be tried and even [[execution|executed]] as an adult, to be age 7.

'''Alton Wayne Roberts''' (April 6, 1938 – September 11, 1999) was a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] convicted of depriving slain activists [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[James Chaney]] of their [[civil rights]] in 1964. He personally shot two of the three civil rights workers before his accomplices buried their bodies in a dam.

==Early life==
Roberts had a younger brother by the name of Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iD6rL_e8VZMC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wQjoQqaB5X&amp;sig=W07_K8AGE5-dOd7RXmchSY89CiA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8Zv_VI7xBKfmsASrmoLADw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgy#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Feldman|first=Jay|title=Manufacturing Hysteria: A History of Scapegoating, Surveillance, and Secrecy in Modern America|year=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307388230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlvs7498TJMC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ie-1iC1oCf&amp;sig=gT1_Qwp0-jGyG_dQJVVZLcx4AfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Lpr_VKWEJciIsQSw3IHwBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Chalmers|first=David Mark|title=Backfire: How the Ku Klux Klan Helped the Civil Rights Movement|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780742523111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-84635lwKYC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xazSltWpK3&amp;sig=VVKDJIr1IeeQLuTaX6Qtn0RZpeE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y5v_VNXjOaOxsAS5mYDwDA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Sims|first=Patsy|title=The Klan|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813108872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts played [[American football|football]] during [[high school]].&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhorter|first=Diane|title=Since Mississippi Burned|date=9 January 1989|publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]]''|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20119300,00.html|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts, then 26 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJD4mjtUgOQC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xBYmSoEK5C&amp;sig=HG3IjyQEg6MgTj3NuUlErwEPWog&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-pr_VJS1GsK1sATHyoL4DA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Mars|first=Florence|title=Witness in Philadelphia|year=1989|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=9780807115664}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] in [[Meridian, Mississippi]] at the time of the murders.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

==Freedom Summer Murders==
{{main|Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner}}

In the afternoon of June 21, 1964, Chaney, Goodman, &amp; Schwerner arrived at Longdale to inspect the burned out church in Neshoba County. They left Longdale around 3 p.m. They were to be in Meridian by 4 p.m. that day. The fastest route to Meridian was through Philadelphia. At the fork of Beacon &amp; Main Street their station wagon sustained a flat tire. It is possible that a shot was fired at the station wagon's tire. Sheriff Lawrence Rainey's home was near the Beacon &amp; Main Street fork. Deputy Cecil Price soon arrived and escorted them to the county jail. Price released the trio as soon as the longest day of the year became night which was about 10 p.m. The three was last seen heading south in their Ford station wagon along Highway 19 toward Meridian.

Two Mississippi Highway Patrol men waited at Pilgrim's Gas Station not far from Philadelphia's city limits. The trio was likely deferred from using a phone at the station. They drove past the station and continued toward Meridian.

===Lynch mob===

The lynch mob, in Horace D. Barnette's and Billy W. Posey's cars, was drinking while arguing who would kill the three men. Eventually Philadelphia Police Officer Other N. Burkes drove up to Barnette's car and told the mob that "they're going on 19 toward Meridian. Follow them!" After a quick rendezvous with Philadelphia Police Officer Richard Willis, Price was in pursuit of the three civil rights workers. Posey's Chevrolet carried Jerry M. Sharpe, Jimmy L. Townsend, and Alton W. Roberts. Horace Barnette had a two-toned blue Ford Fairlane sedan. In Horace's car were James Jordan, Jimmy K. Arledge, Jimmy Snowden, Roberts, and Posey. Posey's car apparently had carburetor problems and broke down on the side of the road. Sharpe and Townsend were ordered to stay with the car and get it running again. Price eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward Union, Mississippi on state highway 492.

Soon the three civil right workers would be escorted north on Highway 19 to secluded Rock Cut Road where they would be executed at the hand of Roberts and Jordan.

When they arrived, Roberts reportedly pulled Schwerner out of the car, pointing a gun at his chest. "Are you that nigger lover?" Roberts asked, his left hand on Schwerner's shoulder.  "Sir, I know just how you feel," Schwerner replied.  Roberts then shot him in the heart and then grabbed Goodman, shooting him in the chest near his right shoulder.  Chaney ran, but Roberts along with other Klansmen were able to shoot him dead before he could run any farther.  Roberts fired into Chaney's lower back and his head.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite web|last=Ladd|first=Donna|title=Down a Southern Road|date=21 June 2004|publisher=''[[Jackson Free Press]]''|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2004/jun/21/down-a-southern-road/|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors said that Roberts fired two of the three bullets found in Chaney's body.&lt;ref name=people/&gt; After the murders James Jordan was accused of saying "well, you didn't leave me nothing but a nigger, but at least I killed me a nigger."

==Conviction==
{{main|United States v. Price}}

On December 4, 1964, The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested several men for engineering a conspiracy to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner.&lt;ref name=fbiapprehend&gt;{{cite news|title=Day of Accusation in Mississippi|first=David|last=Nevin |date=December 1964 |work=Life |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts was one of many rounded up that day.

Roberts was indicted on February 28, 1967. He went to federal trial in Meridian on October 7 of that same year; 13 days later, he was convicted.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wr9Ehq158DUC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S7zpGzGAIN&amp;sig=H6wrcB9lavy4H3Y-xgU7VpO7Yc8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gJr_VIPZKfDisASooIAw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Putnam|first=Richelle|title=Lauderdale County, Mississippi: A Brief History|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9781609490218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the sentence hearing on December 29, 1967, Judge [[William Harold Cox]] sentenced Roberts 10 years in federal prison.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-p_zy5V5NXUC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=alton+wayne+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nJakB0oVwl&amp;sig=6KYOKUxi1muRjDevT2VUDF8EdJU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WJv_VOzIDKawsAT2s4GwBg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=alton%20wayne%20roberts&amp;f=false|last=Dickerson|first=James|title=Dixie's Dirty Secret: The True Story of how the Government, the Media, and the Mob Conspired to Combat Integration and the Vietnam Antiwar Movement|year=1998|publisher=M.E.

Roberts gained national recognition on January 27, 1965 when Jack Thornell took photos of him beating up [[CBS]] cameraman Laurens Pierce outside the federal courthouse in Meridian where he was in trial at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Associated-Press-Domestic-News-Mississippi-Unit-/da3d82e2c3e3da11af9f0014c2589dfb CBS cameraman Laurens Pierce, left, struggles for his camera with Alton Wayne Roberts outside the Federal Building in Meridian, Miss., Jan. 27, 1965.

'''Archery''' is the art, sport, practice or skill of using a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] to [[shooting|shoot]] [[arrow]]s.&lt;ref name=Paterson17&gt;Paterson ''Encyclopaedia of Archery'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''arcus''. Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat. In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity. A person who participates in archery is typically called an '''archer''' or a ''bowman'', and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a '''toxophilite'''.&lt;ref&gt;The noun "toxophilite", meaning "a lover or devotee of archery, an archer" derives from ''[[Toxophilus]]'' by [[Roger Ascham]] —"imaginary proper name invented by Ascham, and hence title of his book (1545), intended to mean 'lover of the bow'." "toxophilite, n." ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Second edition, 1989; online version November 2010. &lt;http://www.oed.com:80/Entry/204131&gt;; accessed 10 March 2011.

==History==
{{Main|History of archery}}

The bow and arrow seems to have been invented in the later [[Paleolithic]] or early [[Mesolithic]] periods. The oldest signs of its use in Europe come from the {{Interlanguage link|Stellmoor|de}} in the {{Interlanguage link|Ahrensburg valley|de|3=Stellmoor–Ahrensburger Tunneltal}} north of [[Hamburg]], Germany and dates from the late [[Paleolithic]], about 10,000–9000 BC. The arrows were made of [[pine]] and consisted of a main shaft and a {{convert|15|–|20|cm|in|abbr=off}} long fore shaft with a [[flint]] point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by [[spear-thrower]]s rather than bows. The [[Holmegaard bow|oldest bows]] known so far comes from the [[Holmegaard|Holmegård]] swamp in Denmark. Bows eventually replaced the [[spear-thrower]] as the predominant means for launching shafted [[projectiles]], on every continent except [[Australasia]], though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico and among the [[Inuit]].

Bows and arrows have been present in [[Egypt]]ian &amp; neighboring [[Nubia]]n culture since its respective [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] &amp; [[Pre-Kerma]] origins. In the [[Levant]], artifacts that could be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the [[Natufian culture]], (c. 10,800–8,300 BC) onwards. The [[Khiamian]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPN A]] shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.

[[Classical antiquity|Classical]] civilizations, notably the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[History of Armenia|Armenians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[History of India|Indians]], [[History of Korea|Koreans]], [[History of China|Chinese]], and [[History of Japan|Japanese]] fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]] were the first to use [[composite bows]] in war according to the victory stele of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zutterman|first=C.|date=2003|title=The bow in the Ancient Near East.

University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archery was highly developed in [[Asia]]. The [[Sanskrit]] term for archery, [[dhanurveda]], came to refer to martial arts in general. In East Asia, [[Goguryeo]], one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of the Later Han]] [http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%BE%8C%E6%BC%A2%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B785]"句驪一名貊耳有別種依小水為居因名曰小水貊出好弓所謂貊弓是也"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koreantrad"&gt;{{citation|title=Korean Traditional Archery|last1=Duvernay|first1=Thomas A.|last2=Duvernay|first2=Nicholas Y.|publisher=Handong Global University|year=2007|postscript=&lt;!-- none --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mounted archery===
{{Main|Mounted archery}}
[[File:Maximilian 1470.png|thumb|Hunting for flying birds from the back of a galloping horse was considered the top category of archery. The favorite hobby of Prince [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], engraved by [[Dürer]] ]]
Central Asian [[tribesmen]] (after the [[domestication of the horse]]) and American [[Plains Indians]] (after gaining access to horses)&lt;ref&gt;[[T. R. Fehrenbach|Fehrenbach, Theodore Reed]] (1974) The Comanches: The Destruction of a People.

New York: Anchor Books. {{ISBN|1-4000-3049-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; became extremely adept at [[Mounted archery|archery on horseback]]. Lightly armoured, but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the Central Asian steppes, and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of Eurasia. Shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback, and the [[composite bow]] enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons.&lt;ref name="HorseArchery"&gt;{{citation|title=The Horse, The Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the World|last1=Anthony|first1=David W.|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-05887-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empires throughout the Eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective "barbarian" counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow, to the point where powerful states like the [[Han Dynasty]] referred to their neighbours, the [[Xiong-nu]], as "Those Who Draw the Bow".&lt;ref name="ChinaEnemies"&gt;{{citation|title=Ancient China &amp; Its Enemies: The Rise of Nomadic Power in East Asian History|last1=Di Cosmo|first1=Nicola|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-5217706-4-4|postscript=&lt;!-- none --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Xiong-nu mounted bowmen made them more than a match for the Han military, and their threat was at least partially responsible for Chinese expansion into the Ordos region, to create a stronger, more powerful buffer zone against them.&lt;ref name="ChinaEnemies" /&gt; It is possible that "barbarian" peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their "civilized" counterparts—the Xiong-nu and the Han being one example. Similarly, short bows seem to have been introduced to Japan by northeast Asian groups.&lt;ref name="JapanBows"&gt;{{citation|title=Armed Martial Arts of Japan: Swordsmanship and Archery|last1=Hurst III|first1=G. Cameron|year=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-04967-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline of archery===
The development of [[Gunpowder warfare|firearms]] rendered bows obsolete in warfare, although efforts were sometimes made to preserve archery practice. In England and Wales, for example, the government tried to enforce practice with the longbow until the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Gunn, ''Archery Practice in Early Tudor England'', Past and Present, (2010) Vol. 209 (1): 53–81. {{doi|10.1093/pastj/gtq029}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because it was recognised that the bow had been instrumental to military success during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Armenia, China, Egypt, England and Wales, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|America]], India, Japan, Korea, Turkey and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the neglect of archery. Early firearms were inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very sensitive to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range&lt;ref name="koreantrad" /&gt; and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armour without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield. However, the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon, and archers have seen action in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Bows and arrows: deadly weapons of rural Kenya's war.

===Eighteenth-century revival===
[[File:The meeting of the Royal British Bowmen in the grounds of Erthig, Denbighshire.jpeg|thumb|A print of the 1822 meeting of the "Royal British Bowmen" archery club.]] 
Early recreational archery societies included the Finsbury Archers and the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers. The latter's annual [[Popinjay (sport)|Papingo]] event was first recorded in 1483. (In this event, archers shoot vertically from the base of an abbey tower to dislodge a wood pigeon placed approximately 30 meters above.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - Club History|url=http://www.kilwinningarchers.com/about_us.php|website=Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers|access-date=24 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030330/http://www.kilwinningarchers.com/about_us.php|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Company of Archers was formed in 1676 and is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=William|title=Royal Company of Archers|url=http://yeomenoftheguard.com/company_of_archers.htm|website=Yeomen of the Queen's Body Guard|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archery remained a small and scattered pastime, however, until the late 18th century when it experienced a fashionable revival among the [[aristocracy]]. Sir [[Ashton Lever]], an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, with the patronage of [[George III|George, the Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Toxophilite Society|url=http://www.longbow-archers.com/royaltoxophilitesociety.html|website=Longbow Archers|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes. Recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility, complete with flags, music and [[21 gun salute]]s for the competitors. The clubs were "the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside" and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of the local upper class. As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females. Young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so. Thus, archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnes |first=Martin |url=https://swansea.academia.edu/MartinJohnes/Papers/127610/Archery--Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales--c--1780-1840 |title=Archery—Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales—c-1780-1840 Martin Johnes. Archery, Romance and Elite Culture in England and Wales, c. 1780–1840 |publisher=Swansea.academia.edu |date= |access-date=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was often consciously styled in the manner of a [[Medieval]] [[tournament]] with titles and [[laurel wreath]]s being presented as a reward to the victor. General meetings were held from 1789, in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies. Archery was also co-opted as a distinctively British tradition, dating back to the lore of [[Robin Hood]] and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in [[Europe]]. The societies were also elitist, and the new [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status.

After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the sport became increasingly popular among all classes, and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the [[Industrialisation|preindustrial]] rural Britain. Particularly influential was Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s 1819 novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' that depicted the heroic character Lockseley winning an archery tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/archers.html |title=The Royal Company of Archers |access-date=17 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125050714/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/archers.html |archivedate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A modern sport===
The 1840s saw the second attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport. The first [[Grand National Archery Society]] meeting was held in [[York]] in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardized as the 'York Round' - a series of shoots at 60, 80, and 100 yards. [[Horace A. Ford]] helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques. He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.

[[File:Saxton Pope and grizzly.jpg|thumb|left|Picture of [[Saxton Pope]] taken while grizzly hunting at Yellowstone]]
Towards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as [[croquet]] and [[tennis]] became more popular among the middle class. By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the [[1900 Paris Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archery results - Pari 1900|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/results-and-medalists/gamesandsportsummary/?sport=31766&amp;games=1900%2f1&amp;event=122225|website=olympic.org|access-date=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century. The last of the [[Yahi#Yahi|Yahi Indian]] tribe, a native known as [[Ishi]], came out of hiding in California in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Traditional Bowyer's Bible, Volume 4|last1=Allely|first1=Steve|year=2008|publisher=The Lyons Press|isbn=978-0-9645741-6-8|postscript=&lt;!-- none --&gt;|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ishi in Two Worlds: a biography of the last wild Indian in North America|last=Kroeber|first=Theodora|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|place=Berkeley|year=2004|isbn=978-0-520-24037-7|postscript=&lt;!-- none --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctor, [[Saxton Pope]], learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hunting with the Bow and Arrow|last=Pope|first=Saxton|publisher= G.

From the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts.&lt;ref name="technical"&gt;{{citation|title=Archery: The Technical Side.

These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority. In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding. Much of this expertise is available in the ''Traditional Bowyer's Bibles'' (see Further reading). Modern game archery owes much of its success to [[Fred Bear]], an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Bertalan, Dan.

===Mythology===
[[File:Vishwamitra archery training-1.jpg|thumb|[[Vishwamitra]] archery training from [[Ramayana]]]]

Deities and heroes in several mythologies are described as archers, including the Greek [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]], the Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Cupid]], the Germanic [[Agilaz]], continuing in legends like those of [[Wilhelm Tell]], [[Palnetoke]], or [[Robin Hood]]. Armenian [[Hayk]] and Babylonian [[Marduk]], Indian [[Karna]] (also known as Radheya/son of Radha), [[Abhimanyu]], [[Eklavya]], [[Arjuna]], [[Bhishma]], [[Drona]], [[Rama]], and [[Shiva]] were known for their shooting skills. The famous archery competition of hitting the eye of a rotating fish while watching its reflection in the water bowl was one of the many archery skills depicted in the [[Mahabharata]].

Persian [[Arash (mythology)|Arash]] was a famous archer. Earlier Greek representations of [[Heracles]] normally depict him as an archer.

The Nymphai Hyperboreioi (Νύμφαι Ὑπερβόρειοι) were worshipped on the Greek island of Delos as attendants of [[Artemis]], presiding over aspects of archery; Hekaerge (Ἑκαέργη), represented distancing, Loxo (Λοξώ), trajectory, and Oupis (Οὖπις), aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphaiHyperboreiai.html |title=Nymphai Hyperboreioi at Theoi Greek Mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jumong]], the first [[Taewang]] of the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], is claimed by legend to have been a near-godlike archer. Archery features in the story of Oguz Khagan.

In [[West Africa]]n [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief, [[Ochosi|Osoosi]] is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery.

==Equipment==
===Types of bow===
{{Main|Bow and arrow}}
[[File:Pacific Yew Selfbow.jpg|thumb|Clay Hayes drawing a Pacific yew selfbow using the split finger method. Selfbows are made from a single piece of wood.]]
While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.

Directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being [[self bow]]s, [[laminated bow]]s and [[composite bow]]s. Bows can also be classified by the [[shape|bow shape]] of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to traditional European straight bows, a [[Recurve bow#Recurve bow|recurve bow]] and some types of longbow have tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. The cross-section of the limb also varies; the classic [[longbow]] is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are D-shaped in cross section, and the [[flatbow]] has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross-section. The classic D-shape comes from the use of the wood of the yew tree. The sap-wood is best suited to the tension on the back of the bow, and the heart-wood to the compression on the belly. Hence, a cross-section of a yew longbow shows the narrow, light-coloured sap-wood on the 'straight' part (riser) of the D, and the red/orange heartwood forms the curved part of the D, to balance the mechanical tension/compression stress. [[Cable-backed bow]]s use cords as the back of the bow; the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable. They were widespread among [[Inuit]] who lacked easy access to good bow wood. One variety of cable-backed bow is the Penobscot bow or [[Wabenaki]] bow, invented by Frank Loring (Chief Big Thunder) about 1900.&lt;ref&gt;The Penobscot War Bow. Gordon M Day. Contributions to Canadian Ethnology 1975. Canadian Ethnology Service Paper no. 31. {{ISSN|0316-1854}}. Ottawa 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.

In different cultures, the arrows are released from either the left or right side of the bow, and this affects the hand grip and position of the bow. In [[Arab archery]], [[Turkish archery]] and [[Kyūdō]], the arrows are released from the right hand side of the bow, and this affects construction of the bow. In western archery, the arrow is usually released from the left hand side of the bow for a right-handed archer.

[[File:recurve bow.jpg|thumb|right|Modern (takedown) recurve bow]]

[[Compound bow]]s are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this. A typical let-off is anywhere from 65% to 80%. For example, a 60-pound bow with 80% let-off only requires 12 pounds of force to hold at full draw. Up to 99% let-off is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptarchery.com/ |title=99% Let Off Bows |publisher=Concept Archery |date= |access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound bow was invented by [[Holless Wilbur Allen]] in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America.

Mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the [[crossbow]]. Crossbows typically have shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows. Because of this, heavier draw weights are required to achieve the same energy transfer to the arrow. These mechanically drawn bows also have devices to hold the tension when the bow is fully drawn. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as [[siege engine]]s.

===Types of arrows and fletchings===
{{Main|Arrow}}
The most common form of arrow consists of a [[Arrow straightener|shaft]], with an [[arrowhead]] at the front end, and [[fletching]]s and a [[Arrow#Nocks|nock]] at the other end. Arrows across time and history have normally been carried in a container known as a [[quiver]], which can take many different forms. Shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid [[wood]], [[bamboo]], [[glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]], [[aluminium alloy]], [[carbon fiber]], or [[composite material]]s. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily. Aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century, due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s because they are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows. Today, the most popular arrows at tournaments and Olympic events are made of composite materials, in particular the X10 and A/C/E, made by [[Easton (company)|Easton]],

The arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but separate arrowheads are far more common, usually made from metal, stone, or other hard materials. The most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.

[[File:Spliced feather 0002.jpg|thumb|Shield cut straight fletching – here the hen [[feather]]s are barred red]]
[[Fletching]] is traditionally made from bird feathers, but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though as many as six have been used. Two makes the arrow unstable in flight. When the arrow is ''three-fletched'', the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes. This fletch is called the "index fletch" or "cock feather" (also known as "the odd vane out" or "the nocking vane"), and the others are sometimes called the "hen feathers". Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision. When an arrow is ''four-fletched'', two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.

The fletching may be either ''parabolic'' cut (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or ''shield'' cut (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield), and is often attached at an angle, known as ''helical'' fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight. Whether helicial or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) is used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird. Oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called ''[[flu-flu arrow|flu-flus]]''. Misplacement of fletchings can change the arrow's flight path dramatically.

===Bowstring===
{{Main|Bowstring}}
[[Dacron]] and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows. Linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows. Several modern methods of making a bowstring exist, such as the 'endless loop' and 'Flemish twist'. Almost any fiber can be made into a bowstring. The author of ''Arab Archery'' suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel.&lt;ref name="arabarchery"&gt;{{citation

===Protective equipment===
{{Main|Bracer|Finger tab|Thumb ring}}
[[File:Finger-tab hg.jpg|A right-hand finger tab to protect the hand while the string is drawn.|thumb]]
Most archers wear a [[bracer (archery)|bracer]] (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bowstring. The bracer does not brace the arm; the word comes from the armoury term "[[brassard]]", meaning an armoured sleeve or badge. The [[Navajo people]] have developed highly ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment.&lt;ref name="ketoh"&gt;{{cite web

Some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow. Possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time. In traditional [[Kyūdō|Japanese archery]] a special [[yugake|glove]] is used that has a ridge to assist in drawing the string.&lt;ref name="Elmer R.P. pages 345-349"&gt;Elmer, R. P. ''Target Archery'' (1952), pp. 345–349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release aids===
{{Main|Release aid}}
[[File:Release-aid.jpg|thumb|right|Release aid]]
A release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow. In the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer's hand or attached to their wrist. In another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.

===Stabilizers===
{{Main|Stabiliser (archery)}}
Stabilizers are mounted at various points on the bow. Common with competitive archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to be mounted at various angles to fine tune the bow's balance.

Stabilizers aid in aiming by improving the balance of the bow. Sights, quivers, rests, and design of the riser (the central, non-bending part of the bow) make one side of the bow heavier. One purpose of stabilizers are to offset these forces. A reflex riser design will cause the top limb to lean towards the shooter. In this case a heavier front stabilizer is desired to offset this action. A deflex riser design has the opposite effect and a lighter front stabilizer may be used.

Stabilizers can reduce noise and vibration. These energies are absorbed by viscoelastic polymers, gels, powders, and other materials used to build stabilizers.

Stabilizers improve the forgiveness and accuracy by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow to resist movement during the shooting process. Lightweight carbon stabilizers with weighted ends are desirable because they improve the moment of interia while minimizing the weight added.

==Shooting technique and form==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Mediaeval archery reenactment.jpg|thumb|left|[[Historical reenactment]] of medieval archery]]
[[File:Thrill_of_the_hunt.jpg|thumb|Chief Master Sgt. Kevin Peterson demonstrates safe archery techniques while aiming an arrow at a target on the 28th Force Support Squadron trap and skeet range at [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], S.D., October 11, 2012.]]
The standard convention on teaching archery is to hold the bow depending upon eye dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is eye dominance? Why does it matter for my first bow?|url=http://esdf.org/discover-archery/equipment/what-is-eye-dominance-why-does-it-matter-for-my-first-bow/|website=Discover Archery|publisher=Easton Foundations|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (One exception is in modern [[Kyudo]] where all archers are trained to hold the bow in the left hand.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deprospero|first1=Dan and Jackie|title=One Point Lessons: A collection of simple lessons and explanations of Kyudo technique|url=http://www.kyudo.com/kyudo-l.html|website=Meishin Kyudojo|access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one is right-eye dominant, they would hold the bow in the left hand and draw the string with the right hand. However, not everyone agrees with this line of thought. A smoother, and more fluid release of the string will produce the most consistently repeatable shots, and therefore may provide greater accuracy of the arrow flight. Some believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity should therefore be the hand that draws and releases the string. Either eye can be used for aiming, and the less dominant eye can be trained over time to become more effective for use. To assist with this, an eye patch can be temporarily worn over the dominant eye.

The hand that holds the bow is referred to as the ''bow hand'' and its arm the ''bow arm''. The opposite hand is called the ''drawing hand'' or ''string hand''. Terms such as ''bow shoulder'' or ''string elbow'' follow the same convention.

If shooting according to eye dominance, right-eye-dominant archers shooting conventionally hold the bow with their left hand. If shooting according to hand dexterity, the archer draws the string with the hand that possesses the greatest dexterity, regardless of eye dominance.

===Modern form===

To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the "open stance" or the "closed stance" may be used, although many choose to stick with a "neutral stance". Each archer has a particular preference, but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.

To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground, tipped slightly clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the '''nock''' (a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow). This step is called "nocking the arrow". Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the "cock feather", is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest.

A compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest, known as a launcher, and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather/vane pointed either up, or down, depending upon the type of launcher being used.

The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers, or with a mechanical arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique. ''Instinctive'' shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in the first or second joint, or else on the pads of the fingers. When using a mechanical release aid, the release is hooked onto the D-loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Billets to Bows|last = St. Charles|first = Glenn|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0965139403|location = |pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the Mongol warriors, known as the "thumb release", style. This involves using the thumb to draw the string, with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support. To release the string, the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb. When using this type of release, the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i.e. Left hand draw = arrow on left side of bow.

The archer then raises the bow and draws the string, with varying alignments for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions. This is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows, which tend to vary from archer to archer. Compound shooters often experience a slight jerk during the drawback, at around the last inch and a half, where the draw weight is at its maximum—before relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position. The archer draws the string hand towards the face, where it should rest lightly at a fixed ''anchor point''. This point is consistent from shot to shot, and is usually at the corner of the mouth, on the chin, to the cheek, or to the ear, depending on preferred shooting style. The archer holds the bow arm outwards, toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground, as exemplified by the Korean archer [[Jang Yong-Ho]]. This keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring.

In modern form, the archer stands erect, forming a "T". The archer's lower [[trapezius muscle]]s are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some modern recurve bows are equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length. In contrast, traditional English Longbow shooters step "into the bow", exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously, especially when using bows having draw weights from 100&amp;nbsp;lbs to over 175&amp;nbsp;lbs. Heavily stacked traditional bows (recurves, long bows, and the like) are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight, whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight around the last inch and a half, dropping holding weight significantly at full draw. Compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy.

The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see [[Bow draw]]), or triggering the mechanical release aid. Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also pay attention to the recoil or ''follow through'' of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.

==Aiming methods==
{{More citations needed|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Kyujutsu14.jpg|thumb|From ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'', 1817]]
There are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow.

Mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming. They can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification. They usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string, which aids in a consistent anchor point. Modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity, while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length. Some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent. Barebow archers often use a sight picture, which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed "anchor point" (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same [[Predicted impact point|point]]. This lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy.

Modern archery equipment usually includes [[Sight (device)|sights]]. Instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows. The two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under. Split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below. Three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow. This technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called "gun barreling" (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).

When using short bows or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target, but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming then involves hand-eye coordination—which includes proprioception and motor-muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war.&lt;ref name="lehman"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiming without a sight picture may allow more rapid shooting, not however increasing accuracy.

'''Instinctive shooting''' is a style of shooting that includes the barebow aiming method that relies heavily upon the subconscious mind, proprioception, and motor/muscle memory to make aiming adjustments; the term used to refer to a general category of archers who did not use a mechanical or fixed sight.&lt;ref name="bear"&gt;{{citation

== Physics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Mongol soldiers by Rashid al-Din 1305.JPG|thumb|Mongol archers during the time of the [[Mongol conquests]] used a smaller bow suitable for horse archery.]]

When a projectile is thrown by hand, the speed of the projectile is determined by the [[kinetic energy]] imparted by the thrower's muscles performing [[Work (physics)|work]]. However, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather [[Power (physics)|power]], which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available. Power generated by muscles, however, is limited by [[Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships|force–velocity relationship]], and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force–velocity relationship.

When a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done. This work is stored in the bow as [[elastic potential energy]], and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance. This same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance. In archery, some energy dissipates through [[Hysteresis#Elastic hysteresis|elastic hysteresis]], reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the remaining energy, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring. Depending on the arrow's elasticity, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side. This is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers.

Even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism. This makes the arrow oscillate in flight—its center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds. This is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when [[dry firing]]. Dry firing refers to releasing the bowstring without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow. Some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures—and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75758007/The-Physics-of-Archery-AstraZeneca-Science-Teaching-Trust |title=The Physics of Archery AstraZeneca Science Teaching Trust |publisher=Docstoc.com |date= |access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Snake Indians - Testing Bows - Walters 37194060.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snake Indians]] - testing bows, circa 1837 by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]], the [[Walters Art Museum]]]]

Modern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the [[archer's paradox]]. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.

The accurate flight of an arrow is dependent on its fletching. The arrow's manufacturer (a "fletcher") can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis. This improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to "plane" on the air in a random direction after shooting. Even with a carefully made arrow, the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow. Consequently, rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e. accuracy. This rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet. Fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel.

The innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow. The huge ratio of length vs. cross sectional area, coupled with velocity, made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented. Arrows can spread or concentrate force, depending on the application. Practice arrows, for instance, have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration. Arrows designed to pierce armor in the Middle Ages used a very narrow and sharp tip ("bodkinhead") to concentrate the force. Arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip ("broadhead") that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.

==Hunting==
{{Main|Bow hunting}}
[[File:Bow compound.JPG|thumb|A modern compound hunting bow]]
Using archery to take game animals is known as "bow hunting". Bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms, as distance between hunter and prey must be much shorter to ensure a humane kill. The skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or tree stand. In many countries, including much of the United States, bow hunting for large and small game is legal. Bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle. Usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting due to the relatively short time it takes to master them as opposed to the longbow or recurve bow. These compound bows may feature fiber optic sights, stabilizers, and other accessories designed to increase accuracy at longer distances. Using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as "[[bow fishing]]".

==Modern competitive archery==
{{Main|Modern competitive archery}}
Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called [[target archery]]. A form particularly popular in Europe and [[Americas|America]] is [[field archery]], shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Archery/Resources/About-Us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105090748/http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Archery/Resources/About-Us |archivedate=5 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Para-Archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability governed by the [[World Archery Federation]] (WA), and is one of the sports in the Summer [[Paralympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldarchery.org/Para-Archery|title=Para Archery|website=World Archery|publisher=World Archery Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as [[archery games|archery novelty games]] and [[Modern competitive archery#Flight archery|flight archery]], where the aim is to shoot the greatest distance.

'''Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement''' were used primarily by ancient [[Israelites]] and appear frequently within the [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as in later [[Judaism|Judaic]] scripture, such as the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]. These units of measurement are still an important part of Jewish life today.
There is much debate within Judaism, as well as by outside scholars, about the exact relationship between measurements in the system and those in other [[system of measurement|measurement systems]]. Classical statements, such as that an ''Etzba'' was seven [[barley]]corns laid side by side, or that a ''Log'' was equal to six medium-sized eggs, are so indefinite and vague as to be nearly useless.
Nevertheless, the entire system of measurement corresponds almost exactly with [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|the Babylonian system]], and in all probability the Israelite measurement system was derived from the Babylonian measurement system, with some lesser level of influence from [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|the Egyptian system]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It may therefore be assumed that the relationship between the Israelite measurements and contemporary units is the same as the relationship between the Babylonian system and contemporary units.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Note: The listed measurements of this system range from the lowest to highest acceptable [[Halakha|halachic value]], in terms of conversion to either English or SI units.

== Length and distance ==
The original measures of length were clearly derived from the human body — the finger, hand, arm, span, foot, and pace — but since these measures differ between individuals, they are reduced to a certain standard for general use. The Israelite system thus used divisions of the '''[[digit (unit)|digit]]''' or fingerbreadth (Hebrew: אצבע, ''Etzba''; plural ''etzba'ot''), the '''[[Palm (measurement)|palm]]''' or handbreadth (Hebrew: טפח, ''Tefah''/''Tefach''; plural ''Tefahim''/''Tefachim''), the '''[[span (measurement)|span]]''' (Hebrew: זרת, ''Zeret''), the '''[[ell]]''' (Hebrew: אמה, ''Amah'', plural ''Amot''), the '''mile''' (Hebrew: מיל, ''Mil''; plural ''milin''), and the '''parsa''' (Hebrew: פרסה, ''Parasa''). The latter two are [[loan word]]s into the Hebrew language, and borrowed measurements - the [[Roman mile|Latin ''mille'']], and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''[[parasang]]'', respectively; both were units of [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] distance, and thus varied according to terrain and stride length, and, in the case of the ''parasang'', also on the speed of travel.

The Israelite measurements were related as follows:
* 1 palm (''Tefach'') = 4 digit (''Etzba'ot'')
* 1 span (''Zeret'') = 3 palms (''Tefahim'')
* 1 ell (''Amah'') = 2 spans (''Zeret'')
* 1 [[Biblical mile|mil]] (''Mil'') = 2000 ells (''Amot'')
* 1 parasang (''Parasa'') = 4 mils (''Milin'')

=== Discrepancies of ell ===
{{details|ell}}

The biblical ''ell'' is closely related to the [[cubit]], but two different factors are given in the Bible; Ezekiel's measurements imply that the ell was equal to 1 cubit plus 1 palm (''Tefah''),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Ezekiel|40:5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Ezekiel|43:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while elsewhere in the Bible, the ell is equated with 1 cubit exactly. Ezekiel's ell, by which he gave measurements in his guided vision through a future Jerusalem Temple, is thus one sixth larger than the standard ell, for which an explanation seems to be suggested by the [[Book of Chronicles]]; the Chronicler writes that Solomon's Temple was built according to "cubits following the first measure",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2|Chronicles|3:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that over the course of time the original ell was supplanted by a smaller one.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The Egyptians also used two different ells, one of which — the ''royal'' ell — was a sixth larger than the common ell;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; this ''royal'' measurement was the earlier of the two in Egyptian use, and the one which the [[Pyramid]]s of the 3rd and 4th Dynasties seem to be measured in integer multiples of.&lt;ref name="Peakes"&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The smaller of the Egyptian ells measured {{convert|17.72|in|cm|sp=us|abbr=on|0}}, but the standard Babylonian ell, cast in stone on one of the [[statues of Gudea|statues of King Gudea]], was 49.5&amp;nbsp;cm (19.49&amp;nbsp;in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8&amp;nbsp;cm (20.67 and 20.79&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The [[Books of Samuel]] portray the Temple as having a [[Phoenicia]]n architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5&amp;nbsp;cm (19.49 or 20.67&amp;nbsp;in), but are fairly certain that it was one of these two figures.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit — the finger-breadth (''Etzba'') — can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2&amp;nbsp;cm (0.83 or 0.87&amp;nbsp;in); Rav [[Avraham Chaim Naeh]] approximates at 2&amp;nbsp;cm (0.79&amp;nbsp;in); Talmudic scholar [[Chazon Ish]] at 2.38&amp;nbsp;cm (0.94&amp;nbsp;in). The ''mile'' (''Mil'') is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760&amp;nbsp;ft) — approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land [[mile]] of 5280&amp;nbsp;ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;km).

The precise width of the ''etzba'' (finger) has been a subject of controversy among halakhic authorities. The best known are those of the Rav Chayim No'eh and Chazon Ish.

See also Rabbi Chaim P. Benish's "Midos V'Shiurei Torah" where he brings an alternative view in understanding the ''Rambam'' and therefore suggests that the ''etsba'', according to the ''Rambam'', is 0.748–0.756&amp;nbsp;in (1.90–1.92&amp;nbsp;cm). This would affect the other measurements in the following ways: ''Tefah'' 2.99–3.02&amp;nbsp;in (7.59–7.67&amp;nbsp;cm); ''Zeret'' 8.98–9.07&amp;nbsp;in (22.81–23.03&amp;nbsp;cm); ''Amah'' 17.95–18.14&amp;nbsp;in (45.59–46.08&amp;nbsp;cm).

Alternatively, according to some early authorities{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} a ''zeret'' is two ''tefahim'' instead of three.

===Talmudic additions===
To the somewhat simple system of distance, the Talmud adds a few more units, namely the '''double palm''' (Hebrew: חסיט, ''hasit''), the '''pace''' (Hebrew: פסיעה, ''pesiah''), the '''cord''' (Hebrew: חבל, ''hebel''), the '''stadium''' (Hebrew: ריס, ''ris''), the '''day's journey''' (Hebrew:דרך יום, ''derekh yom''), and an undetermined quantity named the '''garmida''' (Hebrew: גרמידא). The ''stadium'' appears to have been adopted from Persia, while the ''double palm'' seems to have been derived from the Greek ''[[dichas]]''.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;
The relationship between four of these ''additional'' units and the earlier system is as follows:
* 1 double palm (''hasit'') = 2 palms (''tefah'')
* 1 pace (''pesiah'') = 1 ell (''amah'')
* 1 stadium (''ris'') = 1600 palms (2/15 mile) (''tefah''). {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Others say that 1 stadium was equivalent to 470–500 [[cubits]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (15.11.3; XV.415–416), who described the dimensions of the [[Temple Mount]] in the following terms (apparently not including the extension made to the Temple Mount): “This hill was walled all round, and in compass four furlongs; [the distance of] each angle containing in length a furlong (Gr. ''stadion'').” Compare [[Mishnah]] [http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Middot.2.1?lang=bi ''Middot'' 2:1] which states that the Temple Mount measured five-hundred cubits (Heb. ''amah'') by five-hundred cubits. If it can be ascertained that Josephus' ''stadion'' is equivalent to the 500 cubits mentioned in the Mishnah, and being that the Southern Wall measured 281 meters, this would place each cubit (Heb. ''amah'') at 56.205 cm. Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]], on the other hand, holds that a ''stadion'' was equivalent to only 470 cubits (v. Uziel Fuchs, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24174679?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''"Millot HaMishnah" by R. Saadia Gaon — the First Commentary to the Mishnah''], Sidra: A Journal for the Study of Rabbinic Literature, pub. [[Bar-Ilan University]] Press (2014), p. 66), in which case , each cubit was 59.792 cm, close to the 60 cm. cubit espoused by the [[Chazon-Ish]]. Moreover, Josephus, in his ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' (§ 12), says that ''Bethmaus'' (Heb. '''בית מעון''') was distant from Tiberias four ''stadia'', or what was actually one [[biblical mile]]; meaning, each ''stadia'' equalled roughly 500 cubits.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* 1 day's journey (''derekh yom'') = 10 parasangs (''parasa'')

The other two additional units are more ambiguous. The ''garmida'' is mentioned repeatedly but without its size being indicated; it is even sometimes treated as an area,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Baba Batra]]'', 27a&lt;/ref&gt; and as a volume.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Erubin]]'', 14b&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cord'' is given two different definitions; in the [[Mishnah]] it is 50 ells,&lt;ref&gt;''Erubin'', 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; but in the [[Gemara]] it is only 4 ells.&lt;ref&gt;''Erubin'', 58b&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area==
The Israelite system of measuring area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown with a certain volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 ''seah''s of barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:32|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest thing to a formal area unit was the '''yoke''' (Hebrew ''semed'')&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref||Isaiah|5:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes translated as ''acre''), which referred to the amount of land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in [[Mesopotamia]] the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an [[acre]].&lt;ref name="Peakes"/&gt;

"Beit kor" ({{Lang-he-n|'''בית כור'''}}) - (pl. ''batei kor'') space for sowing a ''kor'' of seed, or what is 30 ''seah'' in volume; the area needed is appx. 1.73 to 2.48 hectares (4.27-6.15 acres), or about 23,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', vol. 2, Jerusalem 1971, s.v. Agricultural Methods and Implements in Ancient Ereẓ Israel (p. 395).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume and capacity==
The Israelite system of powder/liquid volume measurements corresponds exactly with the Babylonian system. Unlike the Egyptian system, which has units for multiples of 1, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 of the base unit, the Babylonian system is founded on multiples of 6 and 10, namely units of 1, 12, 24, 60, 72 (60 plus 12), 120, and 720.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The basic unit was the ''mina'', which was defined as 1 sixtieth of a ''maris'', which itself was the quantity of water equal in weight to a light royal [[talent (measurement)|talent]]; the ''maris'' was thus equal to about 30.3 litres, and hence the ''mina'' is equal to about 0.505 litres.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; In the Israelite system, the term ''log'' is used in place of the Babylonian ''mina'' but the measurement is otherwise the same.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Although they both use the ''log'' as the basic unit, the Israelites differentiated their systems of volume measure between dry and liquid states.

===Dry measure===
For dry measurements, the smallest unit was the '''egg''' (Hebrew: ''Beitza''), then came the ''Log'' (לג), ''Kab'' (קב), ''Se'ah'' (סאה), ''Eiphah'' (איפה), ''Lethek'' (לתך), and ''Kor'' (כור). The ''Lethek'' is mentioned only once in the [[masoretic text]], and the [[Septuagint]] translates it by the Greek term ''nebeloinou'', meaning ''wine-skin''. These measurements were related as follows:
* 6 ''Eggs'' (''Beitza'') = 1 ''Log''
* 4 ''Log'' = 1 ''Kab''
* 6 ''Kav'' = 1 ''Se'ah''
* 3 ''Se'ah'' = 1 ''Eiphah''
* 5 ''Eipha'' = 1 ''Lethek''
* 2 ''Letek'' = 1 ''Kor''

The smaller unit the [[Ke'zayit]] is, by different sources, considered equal to 1/2 a beitza, 1/3 of a beitza, or not directly related to the other units of volume.

The ''[[Omer (unit)|Omer]]'', which the [[Torah]] mentions as being equal to one-tenth of an ''Eiphah'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:36|}}&lt;/ref&gt; is equivalent to the capacity of 43.2 eggs, or what is also known as one-tenth of three ''seahs''.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the [[Aramaic Targum]] of pseudo-Jonathan ben Uzziel on Exodus 16:36 who says: "an omer is one-tenth of three ''seahs''." In Hebrew measures, 1 ''seah'' is equal to the capacity of 144 eggs. Three seahs are the equivalent of 432 eggs; one-tenth of this is 43.2 eggs (''The Mishnah'', ed. Herbert Danby, Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix II, p. 798)&lt;/ref&gt; In dry weight, the ''omer'' weighed between 1.560 kg. to 1.770 kg., being the quantity of flour required to separate therefrom the [[dough offering]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]] brings down its approximate weight in Egyptian ''[[dirham]]s'', writing in [[Mishnah]] ''Eduyot'' 1:2: "...And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty ''dirhams'' of wheat flour, while all these ''dirhams'' are the Egyptian [''dirham'']." This view is repeated by [[Yosef Karo|Maran]]'s ''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (Hil. Hallah, [[Yoreh Deah]] §{{nbsp}}324:3) in the name of the [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]]. In Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah (''Eduyot'' 1:2, note 18), Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] explains that the weight of each Egyptian ''dirham'' was approximately 3.333 grammes, which total weight of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion comes to appx. 1 kilo and 733 grammes. Rabbi [[Ovadiah Yosef]], in his ''Sefer Halikhot ʿOlam'' (vol. 1, pp. 288-291), makes use of a different standard for the Egyptian ''dirham'', saying that it weighed appx. 3.0 grammes, meaning the minimum requirement for separating the priest's portion is 1 kilo and 560 grammes. Others (e.g. Rabbi [[Avraham Chaim Naeh]]) say the Egyptian ''dirham'' weighed appx. 3.205 grammes, which total weight for the requirement of separating the dough-portion comes to 1 kilo and 666 grammes. Rabbi Shelomo Qorah (Chief Rabbi of [[Bnei Barak]]) brings down the traditional weight used in Yemen for each ''dirham'', saying that it weighed 3.36 grammes, making the total weight for the required separation of the dough-portion to be 1 kilo and 770.72 grammes.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Torah, it is the [[Priestly Code]] which refers to the ''Omer'', rather than to the ''Se'ah'' or ''Kab'';&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] view the Priestly Code as one of the later sources of the Torah, dating from a period when Egypt and Assyria had much more direct influence over [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ezekiel 45:11 both the eipha and the bath were one tenth an omer (הומר ''HOMeR'').  Boadt notes the word homer comes from the Hebrew for an "ass."  "It is one ass-load."&lt;ref&gt;The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, Brown, Fitzmyer, and Murphy, Printice Hall, 1990 ISMN 0-12-614934, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the ''[[Omer (unit)|Omer]]'' to collect [[manna]] is explained by [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] influence{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

===Liquid measure===
For liquid measure, the main units were the ''Log'', ''Hin'', and ''Bath'', related as follows:
* 1 ''Hin'' =  12 ''Logs''&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 3, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1967, s.v. Introduction to Tractate ''Menahoth'', p. 67 (Hebrew); a ''log'' has the capacity of six eggs. A ''hin'' is the equivalent of 12 logs.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 ''Bath'' = 6 ''Hin''&lt;ref name="Dever2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=William G. Dever|title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?: What Archeology Can Tell Us About the Reality of Ancient Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-VxwC5rQtwC&amp;pg=PA215|date=10 May 2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2126-3|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bath'', equal to 72 ''Logs'', is thus the liquid equivalent of the ''Ephah'', also equal to 72 ''Logs''. The liquid equivalent of the ''omer'', which appears without a special name, only being described as the tenth part of a bath,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Ezekiel|45:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is as much of an awkward fit as the ''omer'' itself, and is only mentioned by Ezekiel and the Priestly Code; scholars attribute the same explanation to it as with the ''Omer'' — that it arose as a result of decimalisation.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The Omer is mentioned as a tenth of an ephah in Exodus 16:36, before the Priestly code.

According to Herbert G. May, chief editor of two classic Bible-related reference books, the bath may be archaeologically determined to have been about 22 liters (5.75 US gal) from a study of jar remains marked 'bath' and 'royal bath' from [[Tell Beit Mirsim]].&lt;ref&gt;The Interpreter's Bible, Buttrick ed., Abingden Press, Nashville, 1956, volume VI, p. 317 (p155 in the Internet Archive copy of the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talmudic additions===
In Talmudic times many more measures of capacity were used, mostly of foreign origin, especially from Persia and Greece, which had both held dominance over [[Judea]] by the time the Talmud came to be created. The definitions for many of these are disputed. Those that were certain (disputed) fractions of the ''Kab'' include, in increasing order of size, ''ukla'' (עוכלא), ''tuman'' (תומן), and ''kapiza'' (קפיזא). Those that were larger, in increasing order of size, included the ''modius'' (מודיא),&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Gittin'' 57a; traditionally associated with the ''seah''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''geriwa'' (geriwa), ''garab'' (גרב). Of unidentified size were the ''ardaba'' (אדרב), the ''kuna'' (כונא), and the ''qometz'' (קמץ); the latter two of these were said to equate to a ''handful''.

==Weight and coins==
The Babylonian system, which the Israelites followed, measured weight with units of the ''talent'', ''mina'', ''[[shekel]]'' (Hebrew: שקל), and ''[[Gerah|giru]]'', related to one another as follows:
* 1 ''shekel'' = 24  ''giru''
* 1 ''mina'' = 60 ''shekels'' (later 100 zuz)
* 1 ''talent'' = 60 ''mina''

In the Israelite system, the ratio of the ''giru'' to the ''shekel'' was altered, and the ''talent'', ''mina'', and ''giru'', later went by the names ''kikkar'' (ככר), ''litra'', and ''gerah'' (גרה), respectively; ''litra'' is a loan word from Latin - ''libra'', meaning ''pound''.&lt;ref name="Peakes"/&gt;
The Israelite system was thus as follows:

* 1 ''shekel'' = 20 ''[[gerah]]''
* 1 ''litra'' = 60 ''shekels''
* 1 ''kikkar'' = 60 ''litra''

There were, however, different versions of the ''talent''/''kikkar'' in use; a ''royal'' and a ''common'' version. In addition, each of these forms had a heavy and a light version, with the heavy version being exactly twice the weight of the lighter form; the light ''royal'' talent was often represented in the form of a duck, while the heavy ''royal'' talent often took the form of a lion. The ''mina'' for the heavy ''royal'' talent weighed 1.01 kilograms (2.23&amp;nbsp;lbs), while that for the heavy ''common'' talent weighed only 984 grams (2.17&amp;nbsp;lbs); accordingly, the heavy ''common'' shekel would be about 15.87 grams (0.56&amp;nbsp;oz).&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; According to [[Josephus]], it was the heavy ''common'' talent, and its ''mina'' and ''shekel'', that was the normal measure of weight in [[Syria]] and [[Judea]];&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', volume 14, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus also mentions an additional unit – the ''bekah'' – which was exactly half a shekel.

Gradually, the system was reformed, perhaps under the influence of Egypt, so that a ''mina'' was worth only 50 shekels rather than 60; to achieve this, the shekel remained the same weight, while the weight of the standard ''mina'' was reduced. [[Moses]] mandated that the standard coinage would be in single shekels of [[silver]]; thus each shekel coin would constitute about 15.86 grams (0.51 troy ounces) of pure silver. In Judea, the Biblical shekel was initially worth about 3⅓ [[denarii]], but over time the measurement had enlarged so that it would be worth exactly four denarii.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

== Time ==

=== Year ===
{{main|Hebrew calendar}}
The [[Hebrew calendar]] is a [[lunar calendar]] synchronised with the seasons by [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]], i.e. a [[lunisolar calendar]]. There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) every few years. Some months vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as ''Ziv'' (meaning ''light'') and ''Ethanim'' (meaning ''strong'', perhaps in the sense of ''strong rain'' - i.e. ''[[monsoon]]''), with [[Canaan]]ite origins, but after the [[Babylonian captivity]], the names were changed to [[Babylonian calendar|the ones used by the Babylonians]]. With the Babylonian naming, the intercalary month has no special name of its own, and is merely referred to as ''[[Adar I]]'', the following month being ''Adar''/''[[Adar II]]'' (in the Babylonian calendar, it was ''Adar II'' that was considered to be the intercalary month).

=== Week ===
The Israelite month was clearly broken up into weeks, since the [[Genesis creation]] (and biblical references to [[Shabbat]]) describe a seven-day week.  The seven-day cycle is not seen as a cycle in nature and is rather a custom biblically originating from {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:3-2:3|HE}}.

The modern Hebrew calendar follows a seven-day [[Hebrew calendar#Weeks|weekly cycle]], which runs concurrently but independently of the monthly and annual cycles. The origin of Hebrew seven day week and the [[Sabbath]], as well as the true meaning of the name, is uncertain. The earliest Biblical passages which mention it (Exodus 20:10 and 24:21; Deut. 5:14; Amos 8:5) presuppose its previous existence, and analysis of all the references to it in the canon makes it plain that its observance was neither general nor altogether spontaneous in either pre-exilic or post-exilic Israel. It was probably originally connected in some manner with the cult of the moon [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12962-sabbath#anchor10], as indeed is suggested by the frequent mention of Sabbath and New-Moon festivals in the same sentence (Isa. 1:13; Amos 8:5; H Kings 6:23).

The names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example "Day 1, or Yom Rishon".

=== Day ===
In addition to "tomorrow" (''machar'') and "yesterday" (''etmol''), the Israelite vocabulary also contained a distinct word for ''two days ago'' (''shilshom''). ''Maḥaratayim'' ("the day after tomorrow"), is a dual form of ''machar'', literally "two tomorrows". In the Bible, the day is divided up vaguely, with descriptions such as ''midnight'', and ''half-night''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|12:29|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Judges|16:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Psalms|119:62|}})&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is clear that the day was considered to start at [[dusk]].

By Talmudic times, the Babylonian system of dividing up the day (from sunset to sunrise, and sunrise to sunset), into '''hours''' (Hebrew: שעה, ''sha'ah''), '''parts''' (Hebrew: חלק, ''[[helek|heleq]]'', plural ''halaqim''), and '''moments''' (Hebrew: רגע, ''rega'', plural ''rega'im''), had been adopted; the relationship of these units was:

* 1 part  (''heleq'') = 76 moments  (''rega'im'') (each moment, ''rega'', is 0.04386 of a second; 22.8 ''rega'im'' is 1 second)
* 1 hour (''sha'ah'') = 1080 parts (''halaqim'') (each ''heleq'' is 3⅓ seconds)
* 1 day = 24 hours (''sha'ah'')

To complicate matters, [[Halakha]], speaking of the [[Relative hour (Jewish law)|relative hour]], states that there are always 12 hours between the break of [[dawn]] and sunset, so these measurements are averages. For example, in the summer, a day time hour is much longer than a night time hour.

A '''biophysical  environment''' is a [[life|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] surrounding of an [[organism]] or [[population]], and consequently includes the factors that have an influence in their survival, development, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Biology online| title=''Environment. Definition''| url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Environment| accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biophysical environment can vary in scale from [[microscopic]] to global in extent. It can also be subdivided according to its attributes. Examples include the [[marine environment]], the [[atmospheric environment]] and the [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term ''[[:wikt:environment|environment]]'' can refer to a singular global environment in relation to [[human]]ity, or a local biophysical environment, e.g. the UK's [[Environment Agency]].

==Life-environment interaction==
All life that has survived must have adapted to conditions of its environment. Temperature, light, humidity, soil nutrients, etc., all influence any species, within any environment. However life in turn modifies, in various forms, its conditions. Some long term modifications along the history of our planet have been significant, such as the incorporation of [[oxygen]] to the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. This process consisted in the breakdown of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[anaerobic microorganism]]s that used the carbon in their [[metabolism]] and released the [[Atmospheric chemistry|oxygen to the atmosphere]]. This led to the existence of oxygen-based plant and animal life, the [[great oxygenation event]]. Other interactions are more immediate and simple, such as the smoothing effect that forests have on the temperature cycle, compared to neighboring unforested areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions within the biophysical environment. Part of this [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] is the investigation of the [[effect of human activity on the environment]]. [[Ecology]], a sub-discipline of biology and a part of environmental sciences, is often mistaken as a study of human induced effects on the environment. [[Environmental studies]] is a broader [[academic discipline]] that is the systematic study of interaction of humans with their environment. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], [[built environment]]s and [[social environment]]s.

Environmentalism is a broad social and philosophical movement that, in a large part, seeks to minimise and compensate the negative effect of human activity on the biophysical environment. The issues of concern for environmentalists usually relate to the natural environment with the more important ones being [[climate change]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[pollution]], and [[old growth forest]] loss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7612">The '''candle problem''' or '''candle task''', also known as '''Duncker's candle problem''', is a [[cognitive test|cognitive]] [[Performance test (assessment)|performance test]], measuring the influence of [[functional fixedness]] on a participant's [[problem solving]] capabilities. The test was created by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]] [[Karl Duncker]]&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html|title=Dan Pink on the surprising science of motivation|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published posthumously in 1945.  Duncker originally presented this test in his thesis on problem-solving tasks at [[Clark University]].&lt;ref name="5th European Conference on e-Learning "&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniel Biella and Wolfram Luther|title=5th European Conference on e-Learning |pages=23|chapter=A Synthesis Model for the Replication of Historical Experiments in Virtual Environments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhS1sd3gEB4C&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=the+candle+problem+karl+duncker&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20candle%20problem%20karl%20duncker&amp;f=false | isbn=978-1-905305-30-8 | publisher=Academic Conferences Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem==
The test presents the participant with the following task: how to fix and light a [[candle]] on a wall (a [[cork board]]) in a way so the candle wax won't drip onto the table below.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "&gt;{{cite book|title=Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction Volume 3: Conative and Affective Process Analysis |editor=Richard E. Snow and Marshall J. Farr|chapter=Positive Affect and Organization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNepLHdEhUMC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=duncker+candle+task&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EqrF8VXHLB&amp;sig=G0P3JWGkkSvnA9fxmc2_BeRuO0Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=69pRS4bcEo-Ytgecy_2mCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=duncker%20candle%20task&amp;f=false | isbn=978-0-89859-721-9 | year=1987 | publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, one may only use the following along with the candle:

*a book of matches
*a box of thumbtacks

==Solution==
[[File:Genimage.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The candle problem]]
The solution is to empty the box of thumbtacks, use the thumbtacks to nail the box to the wall, put the candle into the box,  and light the candle with the match.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt; The concept of functional fixedness predicts that the participant will only see the box as a device to hold the thumbtacks and  not immediately perceive it as a separate and functional component available to be used in solving the task.

==Response==
Many of the people who attempted the test explored other creative, but less efficient, methods to achieve the goal. For example, some tried to tack the candle to the wall without using the thumbtack box,&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt; and others attempted to melt some of the candle’s wax and use it as an [[adhesive]] to stick the candle to the wall.&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "/&gt; Neither method works.&lt;ref name="Dan Pink "/&gt; However, if the task is presented with the tacks piled ''next'' to the box (rather than inside it), virtually all of the participants were shown to achieve the optimal solution, which is self defined.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/frank.pdf|title=Against Informational Atomism|last=Frank|first=Michael|accessdate=15 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184646/http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/frank.pdf#|archive-date=2014-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test has been given to numerous people, including [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] students at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] in a study investigating whether living abroad and creativity are linked.&lt;ref name="Kellogg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index.php/Kellogg/article/living_outside_the_box|title=Living Outside the Box: Living abroad boosts creativity |date=April 2009|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glucksberg==
[[Sam Glucksberg|Glucksberg]] (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Glucksberg | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1037/h0044683 | title = The influence of strength of drive on functional fixedness and perceptual recognition | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 63 | pages = 36–41 | year = 1962 | pmid =  13899303| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; used a 2 × 2 design manipulating whether the tacks and matches were inside or outside of their boxes and whether subjects were offered cash prizes for completing the task quickly. Subjects who were offered no prize, termed ''low-drive'', were told "We are doing pilot work on various problems in order to decide which will be the best ones to use in an experiment we plan to do later. We would like to obtain norms on the time needed to solve." The remaining subjects, termed ''high-drive'', were told "Depending on how quickly you solve the problem you can win $5.00 or $20.00. The top 25% of the ''S''s [subjects] in your group will win $5.00 each; the best will receive $20.00. Time to solve will be the criterion used." (As a note, adjusting for inflation since 1962, the study's publish year, the amounts in {{inflation-year|US}} dollars would be approximately ${{inflation|US|5|1962}} and ${{inflation|US|20|1962}}, respectively.{{inflation-fn|US}}) The empty-boxes condition was found to be easier than the filled-boxes condition: more subjects solved the problem, and those who did solve the problem solved it faster. Within the filled-boxes condition, high-drive subjects performed ''worse'' than low-drive subjects. Glucksberg interpreted this result in terms of "neobehavioristic drive theory": "high drive prolongs extinction of the dominant habit and thus retards the correct habit from gaining ascendancy". An explanation in terms of the [[overjustification effect]] is made difficult by the lack of a main effect for drive and by a nonsignificant trend in the opposite direction within the empty-boxes condition.

Another way to explain the higher levels of failure during the high-drive condition is that the process of turning the task into a competition for limited resources can create mild levels of stress in the subject, which can lead to a [[sympathetic nervous system]] response known as [[fight-or-flight]].  This stress response effectively shuts down the creative thinking and problem solving areas of the brain in the [[prefrontal cortex]].

==Linguistic implications==
[[E. Tory Higgins]] and W. M. Chaires found that having subjects repeat the names of common pairs of objects in this test, but in a different and unaccustomed linguistic structure, such as "box ''and'' tacks" instead of "box ''of'' tacks", facilitated performance on the candle problem.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt; This phrasing helps one to distinguish the two entities as different and more accessible.&lt;ref name="Aptitude, Learning, and Instruction "/&gt;
     
In a written version of the task given to people at [[Stanford University]], Michael C. Frank and [[language acquisition]] [[List of language acquisition researchers|researcher]] Michael Ramscar reported that simply underlining certain relevant materials ("''on the table there is a &lt;u&gt;candle&lt;/u&gt;, a &lt;u&gt;box&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;tacks&lt;/u&gt;, and a &lt;u&gt;book&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;matches&lt;/u&gt;''...") increases the number of candle-problem solvers from 25% to 50%.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1669">In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Cantor–Dedekind axiom''' is the thesis that the [[Real number#Axiomatic approach|real number]]s are order-[[isomorphic]] to the [[linear continuum]] of [[geometry]]. In other words, the axiom states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between real numbers and points on a line.

This axiom is the cornerstone of [[analytic geometry]]. The [[Cartesian coordinate system]] developed by [[René Descartes]] implicitly assumes this axiom by blending the distinct concepts of real number system with the geometric line or plane into a [[conceptual metaphor]]. This is sometimes referred to as the ''real number line'' blend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = George Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez | title = Where Mathematics Comes From: How the embodied mind brings mathematics into being | publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn= 0-465-03770-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consequence of this axiom is that [[Alfred Tarski|Alfred Tarski's]] proof of the [[decidability (logic)|decidability]] of the ordered real field could be seen as an [[algorithm]] to solve any problem in [[Euclidean geometry]].

==Life==
Charles Frederick McDew was born in [[Massillon, Ohio]] in 1938, to Eva (née Stephens) and James McDew. He was one of four children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paquelet.com/obituary/Charles-Frederick-McDew/St.-Paul-Minnesota/1791521&lt;/ref&gt;  Mcdew's mother worked as a nurse and his father, who had been a chemistry teacher in [[South Carolina]], had become a steel worker after Ohio schools refused to hire him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|authorlink1=Sam Roberts (newspaper journalist)|title=Charles McDew, 79, Tactician for Student Civil Rights Group, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/obituaries/charles-mcdew-79-tactician-for-student-civil-rights-group-dies.html|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 April 2018|page=A26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to McDew's autobiography, he believed that his birth date was notable because he was born on the day that boxer [[Joe Louis]] defeated [[Max Schmeling]] for the heavyweight championship of the world. Even though the fight was a rematch, McDew was convinced by his elders that he was destined to do something great or good for the "[[Negro]]" race. McDew also referred to himself as a "race baby", an ideal that had never been defined to him by family members, but one that he believed he was expected to define for himself as his future unfolded. "I had a charge to do something for the race. It was never specified what I would do for the race, but it was expected that I would do something to help the colored race to move ahead."&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;[http://charlesmcdew.com/about/index.html "Teacher, Organizer, Activist - Charles 'Chuck' F. Charles McDew"], Charles McDew website.&lt;/ref&gt;

McDew grew up in a family who talked little about the advancement of [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though there was little talk on that topic, McDew displayed his first example of general protesting when he was only in the eighth grade.&lt;ref name="AAR" /&gt; Protesting the rights of religious freedom, McDew is seen standing up for his peers by representing [[Amish]] religion at a very young age.&lt;ref name="AAR" /&gt;

As he got older, McDew expected to grow up to work in the steel mills, as many men in that area did.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Before he did so, his father requested that McDew go to the South to experience his "own culture" to expand his ideas of what work he could do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon arrival at his university of choice, [[South Carolina State University]], Charles thought that his father was "the most brilliant man alive."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Never having seen so many "pretty black girls," McDew instantly knew he chose the right college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==College==
During his first [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] on campus, McDew decided to travel with his roommate, Charles Gatson, back to the area where Gatson had family because it would be cheaper than going back to [[Ohio]] and the schools closed during these holidays.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During their vacation, the two of them, and some others, went to a party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; McDew responsibly decided to be the designated driver, but on their way home, they were pulled over by a police officer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was presumably for the reason of McDew and Gatson being black.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Not knowing how to address an officer in the South different than in the North, McDew answered the officer's questions with a bit too much sass.(I) This is what led to the beating and first arrest of Charles McDew.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A couple days later, McDew was on his way to the train station to head home. The general cart for white people and the end cart for the black people were both filled, so McDew was told to go sit in the luggage cart.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Refusing is what led to the second arrest of Charles McDew.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The day he finally got back to South Carolina, McDew was walking to his dorm. In pain because of his previous beating, he decided to walk home though a park. Being unfamiliar with [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], the park McDew walked through happened to only be open to white people on this particular day, which led to his third arrest in two days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These events were said to be the beginning of McDew's inspiration towards the Movement and McDew's general distaste for the Southern way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2189/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=fb4f627f-5243-4669-b37c-b5633b1de798%40sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4207|title = The Orangeburg Massacre: A Case Study Of The Influence Of Social Phenomena On Historical Recollection|date = 2011|accessdate = 4 Nov 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Toth|first = Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Movement==
In April 1960, McDew received a letter from [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.]] stating that they were going to have a [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] meeting at [[Shaw University]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] to discuss the student sit ins, and as a representative for [[South Carolina State University]], Charles attended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt; This meeting talked about student involvement all over the South, along with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|King]] trying to persuade everyone to join the SCLC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; McDew did not want to join because he did not completely agree with the route of nonviolence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thinking of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], McDew's reasoning was that if Gandhi tried the [[nonviolence]] method in Africa and was beaten, jailed, and ultimately run out of the country, how would this method work in the "most violent country in the world?"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to this disagreement, McDew and a few other students went down the hall and talked about creating a new group. This group would compliment the already established SCLC, along with enforcing a few other beliefs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After much talking, the students thought to call their new group the Student Coordinating Committee, but with a couple students completely focused on nonviolence, they ultimately chose to include "Nonviolent" in the name.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The students then proceeded to nominate [[Marion Barry]] as their first chairman. Performing the last touches to establish their organization, McDew even had a hand in developing the dress code and other rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2059/ic/uhic/AcademicJournalsDetailsPage/AcademicJournalsDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Journals&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;limiter=&amp;u=puya65247&amp;currPage=&amp;source=&amp;disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;zid=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=UHIC%3AWHIC&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA341126703|title = SNCC women, denim, and the politics of dress|date = 2013|accessdate = 4 Nov 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Tanisha C.|first = Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] received more publicity and presence in the media, reporters gave them nicknames. This is how SNCC (pronounced "snick") came to be. One reporter referred to them as this in his article, and from then on, the organization was SNCC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During this time, SNCC and McDew wanted to focus on black voter registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2077/docview/468588455?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:primo&amp;accountid=2280|title = Founder of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Headlines Vanderbilt University Events Honoring Life and Legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.|date = 8 Jan 2009|accessdate = 4 Nov 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling that the real "threat" in the movement would ultimately be the black voters, McDew and the organization went on to promote registration in the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|"blackest" parts of the country]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thinking that if they could get people in, for example, [[Baker County, Alabama|Baker's County]] and [[Mississippi]] to register, then they could get anyone to register.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Knowing that "violence was a part of the game," they could not let these areas of the country intimidate them because once these areas were registered, anywhere could get registered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As the movement developed and grew, SNCC kept getting into trouble and people kept getting arrested. This is how the "Jail No Bail" tactic began. This was where activists would get arrested, refuse to pay their fines for 39 days, (they only had 40 days to post bail) and then on the 39th day post their bail.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Civil Rights Movement -- History &amp; Timeline, 1961|url = http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm|website = www.crmvet.org|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a way of protesting the illegal arrests they were suffering.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As time went on and the need for a second chairman came around, and Charles McDew was elected because of his obvious drive for the movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He remained SNCC's second chairman until 1963.&lt;ref name="AAR" /&gt; Since these years, he has participated in many sit ins, arrests,  protests and more to stand up for what he believes is right and fair for everybody.&lt;ref name="AAR" /&gt;

He, and eleven others, were once arrested for "disrupting racial harmony" and were placed into a cold Mississippi cell described as an "iceberg."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Little food, no eating or drinking utensils, and some having to huddle for warmth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This arrest included, McDew has been arrested 43 times.&lt;ref&gt;McDew, Charles F. "Charles McDew." Telephone interview. 11 November 2015.{{Original research inline|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also active in organizations for social and political change, working as a teacher and as a labor organizer, managing anti-poverty programs in [[Washington, D.C.]], "serving as community organizer and catalyst for change in [[Boston]] and [[San Francisco]], as well as other communities."&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt;

==Religion==
After moving to the South for college, McDew attempted to attend various churches. All the churches he tried were white churches, so he was rejected from every one. This led him into the arms of a rabbi, who was the first to welcome him religiously in the South.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This, along with the quote "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am for myself only, what am I? If not now, when?" from the [[Talmud]], is what led McDew to [[Judaism]] and McDew's moral "obligation" to fight for justice.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX2uPnGjp1AC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4 |title= The Shadows of Youth: The Remarkable Journey of the Civil Rights Generation|publisher=Hill and Wang |author= Andrew B. Lewis  |year= 2010|page= 4|isbn=978-0-374-53240-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
McDew had one daughter, Eva (Dion) Goodman. He lived in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was retired from [[Metropolitan State University]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he had taught classes in the history of the civil rights movement, African-American history and classes in social and cultural awareness. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paquelet.com/obituary/Charles-Frederick-McDew/St.-Paul-Minnesota/1791521&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thetandd.com/news/local/noted-civil-rights-activist-charles-mcdew-dies-at-age/article_be544cf2-2644-5916-afc6-139fb0c7691b.html&lt;/ref&gt;

McDew died on April 3, 2018 of a heart attack while visiting his close longtime friend in Massachusetts. He was 79.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/obituaries/charles-mcdew-79-tactician-for-student-civil-rights-group-dies.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=B7F72F5FFAEB4D6626C542B711EE399D&amp;gwt=pay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brezniakrodman.com/obituary-archive/charles-frederick-mcdew/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Classification of Instructional Programs''' ('''CIP''') is a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] at institutions of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

The CIP was originally developed by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES) of the [[United States Department of Education]] in 1980 and was revised in 1985, 1990, 2000 and 2010. The 2010 edition (CIP 2010) is the fourth and current revision of the taxonomy. Instructional programs are classified by a six-digit CIP at the most granular level and are classified according to the two-digit and four-digit prefixes of the code. For example, "Forensic Science and Technology" has the six-digit code 43.0106, which places it in "Criminal Justice and Corrections" (43.01) and "Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and Related Protective Services" (two-digit CIP 43).

In [[sociology]] and [[gender studies]], "'''doing gender'''" is the idea that in [[Western civilization|Western culture]], [[gender]], rather than being an innate quality of individuals, is a [[psychological conditioning|psychologically ingrained]] [[social construct]] that actively surfaces in everyday human interaction.  This term was used by [[Candace West]] and Don Zimmerman in their article "'''Doing Gender'''", published in 1987 in ''[[Gender and Society]]''.  According to this paper, an individual's performance of gender is intended to construct gendered behavior as naturally occurring.  This façade furthers a system through which individuals are judged in terms of their failure or success to meet gendered societal expectations, called the accountability structure.  The concept of doing gender was later expanded by authors such as West and Fenstermaker in the book ''Doing Gender, Doing Difference''.  

==Concept==
The concept of "doing" gender came from conversations of gender from sociology and gender studies. The specific term "doing gender" was used in West and Zimmerman's article by the same title, originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;  West and Zimmerman illustrate that gender is performed in interactions, and that behaviors are assessed based on socially accepted conceptions of gender.  Rather than focusing on how gender is ingrained in the individual or perpetuated by institutions, West and Zimmerman emphasize the interactional level as a site where gender is invoked and reinforced.  They begin by differentiating [[sex]] from sex category and [[gender]].  In this piece, sex is the socially agreed upon criteria for being male or female, usually based on and individual's [[genitalia]] at birth or chromosomal typing before birth.  Sex category is the assumed biological category, regardless of the individual's gender identification. This is "established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;{{rp|127}}  Gender, in this context, is the degree to which an actor is masculine or feminine, in light of societal expectations about what is appropriate for one's sex category.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Doing gender according to West and Zimmerman "is to advance a new understanding of gender as a routine accomplishment embedded in every day interaction".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;  Essentially, West and Zimmerman argued that gender is something that humans created.  As humans, we have categorized and defined many aspects of life.  If someone was not in favor of their gender role or did something that was not deemed "correct" for that gender this person would be committing an act of social deviance.

Gender is described as 'omnirelevant,' as it is apparent and relevant in almost every interaction.  In their article, West and Zimmerman use examples such as bathrooms, sports, coupling, conversations, professions and the might have been{{Clarify|date=May 2018}} division of labor to illustrate the ways in which gender is prevalent in many taken for granted activities.  West and Zimmerman employ the example of a professional woman in a male-dominated field, through which it becomes apparent that the woman will have to make decisions as to whether or not she should engage in "unfeminine" behavior that would otherwise be an integral part of her identity.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Another component of this theory is gendered assessment of behavior.  In the above example, the woman is engaging in behavior that will be assessed as either masculine or feminine by her co-workers.  According to West and Zimmerman, this woman will be evaluated based on how her actions compare to accountability standards of the sex category she belongs to.  Deviations from these expectations do not have an immediate effect on the accountability structure itself.  Instead, failures to meet these standards are attributed to the individual rather than to the rigidity of recognized categories.  With this theory, West and Zimmerman stress the importance of social interaction in maintaining the gender structure.  Because individuals "do" and assess gender in interaction, gender is visible in a wide variety of activities such as conversation.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

==Foundations==
The idea that gender is something that individuals actively 'do' was largely inspired by the social psychological approach taken by Erving Goffman (1976) in ''Gender Display''.(p.&amp;nbsp;129)  Goffman theorizes that humans make the assumption that each has an "essential nature," which can be interpreted by reading "natural signs given off or expressed by them" (p.&amp;nbsp;75).  One of the most basic natures that can be assumed from interpreting these signs is one's masculinity or femininity.  Not only is gender often determined by others relatively easily, but this determination often establishes the ways in which individuals interact with one another.  Goffman asserts that, because we habitually function within such scripts, they are taken to be further evidence of essential natures.  He coins the term "gender display" as a way to conceptualize the ways in which individuals act in a gender appropriate manner.  However, these performances are optional and vulnerable to disturbance, as inappropriate gender display can just as easily be invoked as socially accepted ones.  Goffman asserts that there is a "scheduling" of gender displays around activities, so that the activities themselves are not interrupted by gender displays.  For instance, colleagues may interact in a gendered manner during their lunch hour, rather than while they are working together on a project.  West and Zimmerman take issue with this piece of Goffman's perspective, claiming that this masks the ways in which gender displays permeate nearly all social situations in that individuals cannot avoid being interpreted as masculine or feminine.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

== In the media ==
Media has a powerful influence over many aspects of modern life.  The way gender is expressed and perceived by audiences varies from culture to culture.  The language within a culture as "the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis [states], notes how language influences our perceptions and thus shapes our reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McGrath | first = Karen | title = Teaching sex, gender, transsexual, and transgender concepts | journal = [[National Communication Association#Publications|Communication Teacher]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 96&amp;ndash;101 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/17404622.2013.865764 | date = 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/17404622.2013.865764 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As language evolves within a culture and new language is added, the gender identities are influenced and categories change.  The influence of language and the significance it has often communicated over media and the gender categories people use to place gender roles in, may change or add new categories.  There are other areas that gender roles and differences stem from, "some researchers suggest that gender differences result from a variety of factors including socialization and biology…gender roles are often manifested through communication and culture (Goffman, 1976; Lauzen et al., 2008; Wanta &amp; Legett, 1989; Williams &amp; Best, 1990; Wood, 2009)."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = Jessica | last2 = Mackey-Kallis | first2 = Susan | last3 = Shyles | first3 = Len | last4 = Barry | first4 = Kelly | last5 = Biagini | first5 = Danielle | last6 = Hart | first6 = Colleen | last7 = Jack | first7 = Lauren | title = Face it: the impact of gender on social media images | journal = [[Communication Quarterly]] | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 588&amp;ndash;607 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01463373.2012.725005 | date = 2012 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/01463373.2012.725005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender is something that is always out there whether we are mindful of it or not: "Gender identity and gender roles are a significant part of everyday life."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  On top of this, gender roles help us make sense of our environment, they influence relationships and our own views.  Since the social aspect of life is such an essential part and needs to be fulfilled, we are exposed to gender roles frequently and sometimes unconsciously, absorbing it if it fits with the category that society has influenced us to perceive it as.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  "In contemporary media and culture, women's and men's social desirability and gender often been defined in terms of their bodies. For women this has often involved comparing themselves to and even replicating the 'thin ideal'."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These views like the 'thin ideal' are reinforced through media with advertising, actors, and Photoshop touchups.  On the other end, men have been shown images of being extremely fit and muscular, usually in a pose that expresses power, and the cultures values of what 'masculinity' is for a culture.  "Gender-based definitions of success frequently revolve around presenting or developing their bodies as strong, youthful, active and physically dominant."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These roles are promoted by society, with visual displays and traits assigned to specific gender roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  "Goffman (1976) accounts for these traits in his research of magazine and newspaper photography, finding women to be pictured in more submissive positions while men are depicted in more elevated positions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These depictions of gender are growing in certain trending shows and movies. Lauzen and colleagues (2008) examined gender roles in television, "they found male characters on prime time television were more likely to inhabit work roles, including blue collar, white collar, and extracurricular activities, while women were portrayed in more interpersonal roles involving romance, friendship, and family."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The way gender roles are portrayed in TV can spill into everyday life. Another area that 'doing gender' is being expressed is in video games: "Female characters are represented as highly sexualized while male characters possess exaggerated strength, are hyper masculine, aggressive, and, with the exception of showing hostility, lack emotion."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The way gender roles are represented in video games adds another influence that society has to take in and this can make people think that these fictional depictions can be obtained. This then creates perspectives used to categorize gender roles and as we see others 'doing gender' we want to believe that we should be looking like these characters in games or actors in advertisements and T.V. "A number of studies, for example, have demonstrated extensive 'gender-swapping' in 'avatar' creation for online gaming and in text based CMC."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The increase in video games and in especially online environments allow people to step into other gender roles, by 'doing gender' that may be different in how they present themselves in real life. These online environments allow users to shape their roles in gender.

===Social media and dating ===
The rise of [[social media]] networks allows people to communicate globally and manage how others perceive them and how they choose to express their gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The increase of digital content in today's technology has influences over gender roles, "Digital formats…represent exciting possibilities for individuals who can explore the freedom of presenting a physical self that might differ from the one they present or perform in everyday life or form socially-defines expectations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  People will put themselves into a role to look as though they fit in and to avoid embarrassment in case they violate a social norm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Responses and critiques==
{{main|Gender performativity}}
[[Judith Butler]] has written extensively on this topic, using the term "gender performativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= June 2011 |access-date = 4 May 2016 | title= Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/your-behavior-creates-your-gender}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She explains the same idea of doing gender by explaining gender as a performance that people are taught and attempt to recreate through actions and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Butler|first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | chapter = Performative acts and gender constitution: an essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GNNww3jmH3kC&amp;pg=PA278 | editor-last = Case | editor-first = Sue-Ellen | title = Performing feminisms: feminist critical theory and theatre| page = 278 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780801839696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of doing gender has been critiqued by scholars who assert that it does not take human agency and acts of resistance into account.&lt;ref name="Vidal-Ortiz" /&gt; 

In order to illustrate the possibility of change, several works have been published in which researchers claim to document an 'undoing' or 'redoing' of gender.  Francine M. Deutsch, in "Undoing Gender" (2007), examines how the concept of doing gender has been employed in research.  Deutsch uses examples of studies that use West and Zimmerman's work to illustrate how normative gender ideals are apparent in a variety of contexts.  This, she argues, contributes to the invisibility of gender transgression and does not work towards West and Zimmerman's goal of eliminating gender inequity.  In order to facilitate the undoing of gender, Deutsch suggests that "The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered; (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions; (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality; (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change; and (5) interaction as the site of change" (p.&amp;nbsp;114).  By focusing on these areas, Deutsch asserts, it is easier to find practical solutions to problems cause by gender inequity.&lt;ref name="Undoing" /&gt;

Catherine Connell (2010) presented the idea of "redoing gender" as well as "doing [[transgender]]" in her work, "Doing, Undoing or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople".  Connell posits that transpeople may redo gender by altering normative ideas of gender in their interactions, but may simultaneously participate in the doing of gender in other ways.  Connell coins the term "doing transgender" in order to provide a way to examine how transpeople must make sense of the disconnect between sex, gender and sex category, which they may obscure or actively express in interactions.&lt;ref name="Redoing" /&gt;

In January 2009, the academic journal ''Gender and Society'' published a West and Zimmerman Symposium, in honor of the concept of doing gender.  Nine short articles were composed for the symposium, including a piece by West and Zimmerman.  Several authors argued that the doing gender framework did not allow for agency, intent or consciousness.  Other authors argued that biology needed to be focused on when considering doing gender, in order to understand what role the body plays in gender assessment.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jurik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal-Ortiz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Risman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mess" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raewyn" /&gt;

West and Zimmerman responded with an article titled "Accounting for Doing Gender", in which they restated their original argument, with an emphasis on accountability.  In this, they argued, the doing gender framework does not hide agency, but contextualizes it.  Because individuals' gender will be interpreted based on the accountability structure, the effectiveness of their resistance may not serve to "undo" gender.  The authors contend that gender may be "redone" but never "undone", as accountability structures may change but gender will not disappear.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt;

== Doing difference ==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2017}}
'''Doing difference''' is a concept&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman 2009" /&gt; that grew out of the authors' earlier idea of "doing gender", presented at the American Sociological Association in 1977 by Candace West and Don Zimmerman and published in  ''Gender and Society'' in 1987.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt; In 1995, Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker sought to extend the idea of gender as an ongoing interactional process into the realms of race and class.

They begin by asserting that the intersection of these three fundamental ways to categorize social difference cannot{{clarify|date=May 2018}} simply be thought of in a mathematical or even strictly hierarchical sense.  That is, simply plugging in these concepts as variables in a multiple regression model to predict life success in a particular society provides a simplified way to look at their relative effects, but would fail to provide an adequate basis for even understanding, lesser yet altering systemic inequalities based on race, class, and gender.  For instance, poor black women in the United States face immense social disadvantages, but to place them at the bottom of some abstract listing of vulnerable populations tells us little about how race, class, and gender interacted in their [[biography]] and social milieu to constrain and direct their lives.  Their analysis of these core differences from the standpoint of [[ethnomethodology]] turns the focus away from individual characteristics.  Instead, they are understood processually as "emergent properties of social situations" which simultaneously produce systematically different outcomes for social groups and the rationale for such disparities.

The authors assert that the reason [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]] were not adequately considered in earlier works is because the [[feminist movement]] has historically been the province of white middle class women in the developed world who were not sufficiently affected or attuned to the nature of these corollary oppressions.  Furthermore, few women outside this privileged lot were able to gain access to institutions of higher education, which might have permitted them to engage in the academic discourse and activity about such shortcomings.  Even if they had, the [[gatekeeper]]s within the academy and at leading journals made this unlikely process even more difficult.  Perhaps overt racism and [[classism]] (and [[sexism]]) is less apparent today in these institutions, but the tendency remains for those in positions of power to view the world in a way that discounts the experience of marginalized groups.

The central theme of "difference" here is meant to illustrate how the concepts of race and gender have been falsely conceived as biologically bound predictors of behavior and aptitude among those who are a certain skin color or sex.  The commonalities within these somewhat arbitrary categories often exaggerated and the behavior of the most dominant group within the category (e.g. rich white men or women) becomes idealized as the only appropriate way to fulfill one social role.  This conceptualization is then employed as a means of excluding and stigmatizing those who do not or cannot live up to these standards.  This process of "doing difference" is realized in constant interpersonal interactions that reaffirm and reproduce social structure.  Experiencing the world through the interaction of these "essentialized" characteristics and especially through dominant group's frame of reference (power interests) produces a pattern of thought and behavior that reproduces these social inequalities.

Social science research has rendered dubious any claim that race can simply be conflated with color, or gender with genitalia, or even class with paychecks.  Class may not seem as prone to ideas about natural social differentiation, but within capitalist societies, it is often assumed that one's economic situation is a more or less direct indication of one's capacity to achieve.  Since women and people of color taken are more often poor, natural disadvantage is at least tacitly assumed by many.  Given the general observation that powerful groups seem to rely heavily on these ideas of natural subordination, many liberationist thinkers came to the conclusion that this essentialism would be a prime rhetorical vehicle to subvert.  Thus, the [[deconstruction]] of [[role theory]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] within sociology was a central theme from the 1960s onward.  This still left a somewhat gaping theoretical vacuum, one that continues to be felt by people struggling with this challenge to fundamentally alter their social cosmology.

[[Social constructionism]] has assumed the major explanatory role in these discussions by positing that the meanings of these supposedly [[ascribed status]]es are in fact situationally dependent on the sort of social context in which we employ them.  That is, race, class, and gender aren't just objective scientific facts, but dynamic processes of culturally constructing cues for moral behavior (for which one can be held personally accountable) in a particular circumstance.  It is these constantly occurring processes, not some divinely decreed grand plan, which reproduces social structure.  Individuals "do difference" when they acknowledge (knowingly or unknowingly) how their categorization renders them socially accountable to acting in a particular way in a situation.  However, when individuals recalibrate "doing difference" to produce alternative ways to conceptualize interaction patterns, it amounts to social change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5354">'''EconMult''' is a general [[fishing fleet|fleet]] [[model (abstract)|model]] to be used in [[fishery|fisheries]] modelling. EconMult has been developed since 1991 as a part of the Multispecies management programme by the [[Norwegian Research Council]] at the [[Norwegian College of Fishery Science]] ([[University of Tromsø]], [[Norway]]).

==Model resolution and key variables==
EconMult is a [[discrete time]] [[simulation]] model where the fleet activity is controlled by two [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]: ''Number of vessels ('''v''')'' (within each fleet segment) and ''Number of fishing days '''d''')'' (within each time interval). ''The biomass units'' ('''''x''''') are exogenous variables. The model resolution is determined by four structural variables: ''Number of fleet groups '''j''')'', ''Number of targeted species '''n''')'', ''Number of biomass units '''i''')'' (which may be more than one within each targeted species) and ''Period length'' (time step in the simulation). The number of vessels and fishing days therefore are presented in fleet (columns)-targeted species (rows) matrices, while the biomass units is presented in a column vector ('''''X'''''):

{|
|&lt;math&gt;
V = \begin{pmatrix} 
v_{1,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; v_{1,n} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ v_{j,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; v_{j,n}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="padding-left:2em" |
&lt;math&gt;
D = \begin{pmatrix} 
d_{1,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; d_{1,n} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ d_{j,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; d_{j,n}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="padding-left:2em" |
&lt;math&gt;X = \begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\ \vdots \\ x_{i} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| style="padding-left:2em" |
&lt;math&gt;i \ge n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;j &gt; 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Catch production==
A ''fishery'' is in EconMult defined as a unique fleet/targeted species combination. The total catch within each fishery may include all biomass units defined in the model. Each biomass unit vessel catch is computed by [[Cobb–Douglas]] [[production function]], applying two input variables: ''number of fishing days '''d''')'' and ''biomass unit '''x''')''. In the matrix below each column represents a fleet group and each row a targeted species so each element in the matrix is a fishery and gives the vessel catch of the biomass units represented. The biomass units represent all the targeted species. Each catch is represented a Cobb–Douglas production equation as shown in the vessel yield matrix (Y):

&lt;math&gt;
Y_{V} = \begin{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 
q_{1,1,1} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,1,i} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,1,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{pmatrix}
q_{1,n,1} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,n,i} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,n,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \begin{pmatrix} 
q_{j,1,1} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,1,i} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,1,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{pmatrix}
q_{j,n,1} d_{j,n} v_{j,n}^{\alpha_{j,n,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,n,i} d_{j,n} v_{j,n}^{\alpha_{j,n,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,n,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding fleet catches are

'''Edward René David Goldsmith''' (8 November 1928&amp;nbsp;– 21 August 2009), widely known as '''Teddy Goldsmith''', was an Anglo-French [[environmentalist]], [[writer]] and [[philosopher]].

He was a member the prominent [[Goldsmith family]]. The eldest son of Major [[Frank Goldsmith]], and elder brother of the financier [[James Goldsmith]]. Edward Goldsmith was the founding editor and publisher of ''[[The Ecologist]]''. Known for his outspoken views opposing industrial society and economic development, he expressed a strong sympathy for the ways and values of [[indigenous peoples|traditional peoples]].

He co-authored the influential ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'' with [[Robert Prescott-Allen|Robert Allen]], becoming a founding member of the political party "People" (later renamed the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]), itself largely inspired by the'' Blueprint''. Goldsmith's conservative view of environmentalism put him at odds with the socialist currents of thought, which came to dominate the Green Party.

A [[deep ecologist]] and [[systems theorist]], Goldsmith was an early proponent of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], having previously developed a similar [[cybernetic]] concept of a self-regulating [[biosphere]].

A talented [[public speaking|after-dinner speaker]] and raconteur, Goldsmith was an articulate spokesman and campaigner,&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/27/obituary-edward-goldsmith |title=The Guardian Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London | first=Walter | last=Schwarz | date=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving a number of awards for his work protecting the natural world and highlighting the importance and plight of [[indigenous peoples]], including an honorary [[Right Livelihood Award]] and the [[Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur]].

== Early life ==
Goldsmith (widely known as Teddy) was born in Paris in 1928 to a German Jewish father, [[Frank Goldsmith]], and French mother, Marcelle Mouiller.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page2.html |title=curriculum vitae |publisher=Edward Goldsmith |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822022558/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page2.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered [[Millfield School]], [[Somerset]], as a grammar student, and he later graduated with honours in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1947–1950).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; While studying at Oxford, Goldsmith rejected the reductionist and compartmentalised ideas taught at the time, and he sought a more holistic worldview with which to study societies and the problems facing the world at large.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page288.html |title=The Godfather of Green by Paul Kingsnorth |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fulfilling his [[National Service]] as a British Intelligence Officer in [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]], he involved himself unsuccessfully in a number of business ventures and devoted most of his spare time to the study of the subjects that were to preoccupy him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, he spent time travelling the world with his close friend, [[John Aspinall (zoo owner)|John Aspinall]], witnessing at first hand the destruction of traditional societies. He concluded that the spread of [[economic development]] and its accompanying industrialisation, [[Postdevelopment Theory|far from being progressive]] as claimed, was actually the root cause of social and environmental destruction.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. pp.28-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page279.html |title=Uncle Teddy by Fred Pearce, 1991 |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date=10 January 1991 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Primitive People's Fund ===
{{main article|Survival International}}
In London, at meetings of the Primitive People's Fund (the committee that founded [[Survival International]]), Goldsmith teamed up with the fund's treasurer [[Robert Prescott-Allen]], the explorer [[Jean Liedloff]], and a writer from ''World Medicine'', [[Peter Bunyard]], to found ''The Ecologist'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"/&gt;

=== "Theory of a Unified Science" ===
After rejecting what he saw as the excessively reductionist and compartmentalised approach of mainstream academia, he spent much of his time researching and developing his own theories for the unification of the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith. The Wadebridge Press, 1978. p iv&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Theory of a Unified Science'' was heavily influenced by cybernetics, as well as the [[General Systems Theory]] of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], the [[holism]] of the early academic ecologists, and the [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] employed by many anthropologists.&lt;ref name="WayIntro"&gt;The Way: an ecological worldview by Edward Goldsmith, University of Georgia Press, 1998. Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; His theory would later be published, in its final form, as ''The Way: an ecological world view.'' ([[#The Way|see below]])

Early on, Goldsmith had formulated a concept of the biosphere as an integrated cybernetic entity, the self-regulating parts (of which he included tribal societies) co-operating, largely unconsciously, for the mutual benefit of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1. Appendix A |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view that anticipated aspects of the Gaia thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/312409/teddy_goldsmith_a_tribute.html |title=Teddy Goldsmith: a tribute by Peter Bunyard. '&amp;#39;The Ecologist Online'&amp;#39;, 1st September, 2009 |publisher=Theecologist.org |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he was to become a leading proponent.&lt;ref&gt;Gaia, the Thesis, the Mechanisms and the Implications, edited by Peter Bunyard and Edward Goldsmith. Wadebridge Ecological Centre, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldsmith was also a critic of [[neo-Darwinism]]. He claimed that it is a [[reductionist]] theory and that if you understand [[evolution]], it is necessary to "abandon the reductionistic and mechanistic paradigm of science".&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 20 No. 2, March–April 1990 [http://www.edwardgoldsmith.org/890/evolution-neo-darwinism-and-the-paradigm-of-science/ Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Ecologist'' ===
{{main article|The Ecologist}}
Having established ''The Ecologist'' in 1969 with founding editors Robert Allen, [[Jean Liedloff]], and Peter Bunyard,&lt;ref name="VeldmanFirst"/&gt; Goldsmith was to use the journal as a platform for his theoretical concerns with regular articles appearing under the heading "Towards a Unified Science". The journal also became an important forum for the early [[green movement]], with articles focusing on the relevance and survival of hunter-gatherer societies, alternative technology and organic farming, together with prescient articles about climate change,&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 1 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 2 No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; resource depletion,&lt;ref&gt;Can Britain Survive? Edited by Edward Goldsmith. Tom Stacey, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and nuclear accidents. They were accompanied by the usual gamut of articles examining pollution, overpopulation, deforestation, soil erosion, corporate power, large dams, and, not least, the [[World Bank]]'s alleged role in "financing the destruction of our planet".&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol.1, Nos 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''A Blueprint For Survival'' ===
{{main article|A Blueprint for Survival}}
Signed by over thirty of the leading scientists of the day—l, including Sir [[Julian Huxley]], Sir [[Frank Fraser Darling]], Sir [[Peter Medawar]], Sir [[Peter Scott]], and [[C. H. Waddington]], Goldsmith and his fellow editor Robert Allen made headlines in January 1972 with ''A Blueprint for Survival''.

The ''Blueprint'' was a far reaching proposal for a radical [[Transition Towns|transition]] to a largely decentralised and deindustrialised society, an attempt to prevent what the authors referred to as " the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/page34.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1. Preface |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a key text for the early Green movement, selling over half a million copies, and it was translated into 16 different languages.&lt;ref name="Rev"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=3351185323669993067 |title=Edward Goldsmith—the Green Revolutionary. Goldhawk Films, 1990 |publisher=Video.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331100129/http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=3351185323669993067 |archivedate=31 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, it anticipated the concerns taken up by today's [[Transition Towns|Transition Movement]].

Goldsmith and Allen argued that rather than devise imaginary [[utopia]]s, as did Marxist and liberal political theorists of the time, they should instead look to the example of existing [[Indigenous peoples|tribal peoples]], who, the authors claimed, were real-life working models of societies perfectly adapted to both their long-term survival needs and the needs of the living world on which they depended. The tribal peoples alone, the authors argued, had demonstrated a viable means by which the most pressing problems facing humanity could be answered successfully.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p229-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Such societies were characterised by their small, human-scale communities, low-impact technologies, successful population controls, sustainable resource management, holistic and ecologically integrated worldviews and a high degree of social cohesion, physical health, psychological well-being and spiritual fulfilment of their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1 |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith. The Wadebridge Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Way: an ecological worldview by Edward Goldsmith, University of Georgia Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The People Party ===
{{main article|History of the Green Party of England and Wales}}
The ''Blueprint'' was a major inspiration for the embryonic political party called "People" (later to become the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://another-green-world.blogspot.com/2006/10/short-history-of-green-party-of.html |title=A short history of the Green Party of England and Wales by Derek Wall, 1993 |publisher=Another-green-world.blogspot.com |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which invited Goldsmith to stand for the [[Eye (UK Parliament constituency)|Eye]] constituency in Suffolk as their candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]].

The campaign focused on the threat of desertification from the intensive farming practised in the area, which Goldsmith emphasised with the help of a [[Bactrian camel]] supplied by Aspinall. Goldsmith was in turn accompanied by bearded supporters dressed in the garb of Arab sheiks, the implication being that if modern oil-intensive farming practises were allowed to continue, the camel would be the only viable means of transport left in [[Suffolk]]. Goldsmith lost his [[Deposit (politics)|deposit]], but his unorthodox campaign succeeded in attracting the media's attention and highlighted the issues.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt; He again stood for the now-renamed Ecology Party at the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (United Kingdom)|European elections in 1979]], now winning a more respectable portion of [[Cornwall and Plymouth (European Parliament constituency)#Results|the vote]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== Cornwall ===
In 1973, buoyed by the success of the ''Blueprint'' and a sudden rise in public awareness of ecological issues, partly brought about by the [[Stockholm Conference]] and the publication of the [[Club of Rome]]'s ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in the same year. Goldsmith and his editorial team moved from their offices in London to relocate to rural Cornwall, in the far west of England.&lt;ref&gt;Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p239&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith and his colleagues bought themselves farms, and for the following 17 years, they attempted to form a small-scale, relatively self-sufficient community of their own, and ''The Ecologist'' continued to be produced on-site, in between their other chores.&lt;ref name="Kingsnorth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/6089129/Teddy-Goldsmith.html |title=The Daily Telegraph Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, when the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) threatened to site a nuclear reactor on farmland in [[Luxulyan]], Cornwall, Goldsmith was among those who organised a continuous [[sit-in]] of the land, with local people blocking the entrance and staffing round-the-clock garrisons to prevent CEGB contractors from starting their drilling work.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; An early example of an environmental [[protest camp]], the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] of England and Wales eventually awarded in favour of CEGB allowing the drilling to go ahead. The CEGB never went on to develop the site, however.

=== The Gandhi Peace Foundation ===
In 1974, Goldsmith spent four months with the [[Gandhi Peace Foundation]] in [[New Delhi]], comparing the [[Gandhi]]an (''[[Sarvodaya]]'') movement with the Ecology movement in Europe.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt; This led Goldsmith to forge close links with Indian environmental activists, in particular with the [[Chipko]] movement, including [[Sunderlal Bahuguna]] and [[Vandana Shiva]]. That was to have a major influence on Goldsmith's approach to environmental activism and led to a [http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/exact/browse/307/308/5714/1/1/0/gandhi special issue of ''The Ecologist''] on the subject.&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ecologist Vol. 5 No. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Bank ===
In 1984, together with his colleague [[Nicholas Hildyard]], Goldsmith authored a multi-volume report on the destructive effects of large-scale, hydroelectric dams. It was the beginning of a long attack against the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[ World Bank]], which Goldsmith and his colleagues accused of financing the destruction of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/key41.html |title=The Social and Environmental Effects of Large Dams by Edward Goldsmith and Nicholas Hildyard. Wadebridge Ecological Centre, 1984 |publisher=Edwardgoldsmith.com |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830130051/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/key41.html |archivedate=30 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one episode, Goldsmith wrote an [https://web.archive.org/web/20100103211422/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page101.html open letter] to the then President of the World Bank, [[Alden W. Clausen]], demanding that the bank "stop financing the destruction of the tropical world, the devastation of its remaining forests, the extermination of its wildlife and the impoverishment and starvation of its human inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6809722.ece |title=The Times Obituary: Edward Goldsmith |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the connection between large-scale development projects and social and environmental destruction had not been widely recognised, even within the environmental movement.

=== Forests campaign ===
In 1989, Goldsmith helped to organise an international campaign calling for an immediate end to the [[deforestation|destruction of the world's remaining forests]] with its [[ethnocide|detrimental effects on indigenous cultures]], [[Biodiversity threats|biodiversity]] and [[global warming|global climate]]. The campaign raised over 3 million signatures, which were taken in wheelbarrows to the UN's headquarters in New York City. Goldsmith and a party of activists subsequently occupied the main lobby, refusing to move until the Secretary General, [[Perez de Cuellar]], agreed to see them. The group demanded for him to call an extraordinary general meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to tackle the global crisis of [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Rev"/&gt; Although failing, the campaign managed to organise a meeting in the [[US Senate]] with a group of senators, headed by [[Al Gore]], whom the activists called upon to end their support of the World Bank.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== The Goldsmith Foundation ===
In 1991, with the financial support of his brother James, Goldsmith established the Goldsmith (JMG) Foundation supporting a diverse range of non-governmental organisations campaigning against environmentally destructive activities, along with organisations providing sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

=== The Way ===
In 1990, urged on by [[Arne Næss]],&lt;ref name="WayIntro"/&gt; Goldsmith left the editorship of ''The Ecologist'' to Nicholas Hildyard, while taking time off to write his philosophical magnum opus ''The Way: an ecological worldview''.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;"The Ecologist Magazine 1970–2007: a case study" Master's thesis Kristen Harding. University of Plymouth, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Way'' (1992) was the culmination and synthesis of more than four decades of theoretical development,&lt;ref name="WayIntro"/&gt; embodying a "coherent worldview" by which Goldsmith would attempt to explain the self-inflicted problems facing the world and to propose a way out of them. Much of the work was already mature in Goldsmith's mind by the time that he published the first issues of ''The Ecologist'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Towards a Unified Science. The Ecologist Vol.1, Vol.2, Vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.info/key27.html |title=A Blueprint for Survival, The Ecologist Vol. 2, No. 1. Appendices A &amp; B |publisher=Theecologist.info |date=14 September 1972 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later life ===
In addition to the UK ''Ecologist'', Goldsmith later helped to found and support ''The Ecologist'' as independent enterprises in many parts of the world:

: ''Brazil'' (in Portuguese); ''France'' (in French); ''Asia'' (India); ''Italy'' (in Italian); ''Greece'' (in Greek); ''The Pacific'' (New Zealand); ''Lebanon'' (in Arabic); ''Latin America'' (in Spanish); and ''Colombia'' (in Spanish).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

He continued to attend key meetings around the world&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; and involved himself with a variety of campaign organisations by becoming President of the ''Climate Initiatives Fund'', Richmond, London;&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; a board member of the ''[[International Forum on Globalization]]'', San Francisco, USA;&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; a founder member of ''Marunui Conservation Ltd.'', [[Mangawhai]], New Zealand (1987);&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; and a founder member and vice-president of [[ECOROPA]], a European ecological club and think tank (1975).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
In 1997, after an acrimonious split with his editorial team, most notably with his former friend and colleague Nicholas Hildyard,&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt; Goldsmith was left to run ''The Ecologist'' on his own. Having been absent for some years, he brought in the [[International Society for Ecology and Culture]] (ISEC) to act as the editorial team. His nephew [[Zac Goldsmith|Zac]], who was then working for ISEC, eventually took over the editorship on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt;

The split with Hildyard led to a period of often-bitter criticism from some members of the political left in the environmental movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hildyard |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/item.shtml?x=51967 |title="Blood" and "Culture" by Nicholas Hildyard |publisher=Thecornerhouse.org.uk |date= |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monbiot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/04/30/black-shirts-in-green-trousers/ |title=Black Shirts in Green Trousers by George Monbiot |publisher=Monbiot.com |date=30 April 2002 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215053128/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html |archivedate=15 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, compounded with failing health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/gardens/article5623863.ece |title=The ecogardeners from Tuscany by Caroline Donald |publisher=Property.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a period of isolation from the British scene.

Goldsmith was accused of having affiliated himself with the [[Nouvelle Droite]], an intellectual voice of the European "New Right",{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} after addressing a symposium on Green issues organised in Paris by the GRECE (Research and Study Group on European Culture),&lt;ref&gt;"Eléments pour la Civilisation Européenne", quarterly issue 81, p. 51.

Later, in a controversial article for the ''Guardian'' newspaper, entitled "Black Shirts in Green Trousers", [[George Monbiot]] (a cofounder of the left-wing political party [[Respect – The Unity Coalition|Respect]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/17/iraq.iraq1 |title=Monbiot quits Respect over threat to Greens |work=The Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London | first=Matthew | last=Tempest | date=18 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accused Goldsmith of having "advocated the enforced separation of Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda and Protestants and Catholics in Ulster, on the grounds that they constitute 'distinct ethnic groups' and are thus culturally incapable of co-habitation"&lt;ref name="Monbiot"/&gt; (a point rejected by Goldsmith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldsmith |first=Edward |url=http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page197.html |title=Letter to the Guardian |publisher=Edward Goldsmith |date=2002-04-30 |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725090728/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page197.html |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). That, along with other attacks, eventually led Goldsmith to counter his critics with his indepth rebuttal [https://web.archive.org/web/20091215053128/http://www.edwardgoldsmith.com/page3.html ''My Answer''].&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;

Goldsmith's close association with his brother, Sir James Goldsmith, his lifelong friendship with the controversial casino owner and conservationist John Aspinall, along with his anti-[[modernity|modernist]] stance and support for [[indigenous peoples]], ensured that Goldsmith had many detractors throughout his life. Still, Goldsmith received affectionate support and respect from across the full spectrum of the environmental movement and from many of the people whose views and preoccupations were the focus of his theoretical and philosophical critique.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

Goldsmith's message continued to be sponsored around the world, in particular through his work with the [[International Forum on Globalization]] (IFG), and, regardless of their previous acrimony, Hildyard and Goldsmith went on to restore their former friendship.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Extinction''' is observed in both [[operant conditioning|operantly conditioned]] and [[classical conditioning|classically conditioned]] behavior. When operant behavior that has been previously reinforced no longer produces reinforcing consequences the behavior gradually stops occurring.&lt;ref name="milten"&gt;Miltenberger, R. (2012). ''Behavior modification, principles and procedures''. (5th ed., pp. 87-99). Wadsworth Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; In classical conditioning, when a conditioned stimulus is presented alone, so that it no longer predicts the coming of the unconditioned stimulus, conditioned responding gradually stops. For example, after [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov's]] dog was conditioned to salivate at the sound of a metronome, it eventually stopped salivating to the metronome after the metronome had been sounded repeatedly but no food came. Many [[anxiety disorders]] such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress disorder]] are believed to reflect, at least in part, a failure to extinguish conditioned fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = VanElzakker | first1 = M. B. | last2 = Dahlgren | first2 = M. K. | last3 = Davis | first3 = F. C. | last4 = Dubois | first4 = S. | last5 = Shin | first5 = L.

==Theories==
The dominant account of extinction involves associative models. However, there is debate over whether extinction involves simply "unlearning" the unconditional stimulus (US) – Conditional stimulus (CS) association (e.g., the [[Rescorla–Wagner model|Rescorla–Wagner account]]) or, alternatively, a "new learning" of an inhibitory association that masks the original excitatory association (e.g., Konorski, Pearce and Hall account). A third account concerns non-associative mechanisms such as habituation, modulation and response fatigue. Myers and Davis laboratory work with fear extinction in rodents has suggested that multiple mechanisms may be at work depending on the timing and circumstances in which the extinction occurs.&lt;ref name="Myers &amp; Davis 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 =  | last2 = Davis | first2 =  | year = 2007 | title = Mechanisms of Fear Extinction | url = | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 120–150 | doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001939 | pmid=17160066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the competing views and difficult observations for the various accounts researchers have turned to investigations at the cellular level (most often in rodents) to tease apart the specific brain mechanisms of extinction, in particular the role of the brain structures (amygdala, hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex), and specific neurotransmitter systems (e.g., [[GABA]], [[NMDA]]).&lt;ref name="Myers &amp; Davis 2007"/&gt; A recent study in rodents by Amano, Unal and Paré published in ''Nature Neuroscience'' found that extinction of a conditioned fear response is correlated with [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|synaptic inhibition]] in the [[fear]] output [[neuron]]s of the central [[amygdala]] that project to the [[periaqueductal gray]] that controls [[freezing behavior]]. They infer that inhibition derives from the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and suggest promising targets at the cellular level for new treatments of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amano | first1 = T | last2 = Unal | first2 = CT | last3 = Paré | first3 = D | year = 2010 | title = Synaptic correlates of fear extinction in the amygdala | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 489–494 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2499 | pmid = 20208529 | pmc=2847017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operant conditioning==
In the [[operant conditioning]] paradigm, extinction refers to the process of no longer providing the reinforcement that has been maintaining a behavior. '''Operant extinction''' &lt;!--bolded per MOS:BOLD - this term redirects here--&gt; differs from forgetting in that the latter refers to a decrease in the strength of a behavior over time when it has not been emitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Julie S.|title=Behavior Analysis for effective Teaching|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=52|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a child who climbs under his desk, a response which has been reinforced by [[attention]], is subsequently ignored until the [[attention-seeking]] behavior no longer occurs. In his autobiography, [[B.F. Skinner]] noted how he accidentally discovered the extinction of an operant response due to the malfunction of his laboratory equipment:
{{quote|My first extinction curve showed up by accident. A rat was pressing the lever in an experiment on satiation when the pellet dispenser jammed. I was not there at the time, and when I returned I found a beautiful curve. The rat had gone on pressing although no pellets were received. ... The change was more orderly than the extinction of a salivary reflex in Pavlov's setting, and I was terribly excited. It was a Friday afternoon and there was no one in the laboratory who I could tell. All that weekend I crossed streets with particular care and avoided all unnecessary risks to protect my discovery from loss through my accidental death.&lt;ref&gt;[[B.F. Skinner]] (1979). ''The Shaping of a Behaviorist: Part Two of an Autobiography'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the extinction of a response has occurred, the discriminative stimulus is then known as an extinction stimulus (SΔ&lt;!--was SÉ¢, assuming supposed to be a delta, not sure if it is uppercase delta or lowercase delta, fix if lowercase by lowercasing the delta--&gt; or ''S-delta''). When an S-delta is present, the reinforcing consequence which characteristically follows a behavior does not occur. This is the opposite of a [[discriminative stimulus]] which is a signal that reinforcement will occur. For instance, in an [[operant chamber]], if food pellets are only delivered when a response is emitted in the presence of a green light, the green light is a discriminative stimulus. If when a red light is present food will not be delivered, then the red light is an extinction stimulus (food here is used as an example of a [[reinforcer]]).
However, some make the distinction between extinction stimuli and "S-Delta" due to the behavior not having a reinforcement history, i.e. in an array of three items (phone, pen, paper) "Which one is the phone" the "pen" and "paper" will not produce a response in the teacher but is not technically extinction on the first trial due to selecting "pen" or "paper" missing a reinforcement history. This still would be considered as S-Delta. 

===Successful extinction procedures===
In order for extinction to work effectively, it must be done consistently. Extinction is considered successful when responding in the presence of an extinction stimulus (a red light or a teacher not giving a bad student attention, for instance) is zero. When a behavior reappears again after it has gone through extinction, it is called [[spontaneous recovery|resurgence]].

===Burst===
While extinction, when implemented consistently over time, results in the eventual decrease of the undesired behavior, in the short term the subject might exhibit what is called an ''extinction burst''. An extinction burst will often occur when the extinction procedure has just begun. This usually consists of a sudden and temporary ''increase'' in the response's frequency, followed by the eventual decline and extinction of the behavior targeted for elimination. Novel behavior, or emotional responses or aggressive behavior, may also occur.&lt;ref name="milten" /&gt;

Take, as an example, a pigeon that has been reinforced to peck an electronic button. During its training history, every time the pigeon pecked the button, it will have received a small amount of bird seed as a reinforcer. So, whenever the bird is hungry, it will peck the button to receive food. However, if the button were to be turned off, the hungry pigeon will first try pecking the button just as it has in the past. When no food is forthcoming, the bird will likely try again ... and again, and again. After a period of frantic activity, in which their pecking behavior yields no result, the pigeon's pecking will decrease in frequency.

Although not explained by [[reinforcement theory]], the extinction burst can be understood using control theory. In [[perceptual control theory]], the degree of output involved in any action is proportional to the discrepancy between the reference value (desired rate of reward in the operant paradigm) and the current input. Thus, when reward is removed, the discrepancy increases, and the output is increased. In the long term, 'reorganisation', the learning algorithm of control theory, would adapt the control system such that output is reduced.

The evolutionary advantage of this extinction burst is clear. In a natural environment, an animal that persists in a learned behavior, despite not resulting in immediate reinforcement, might still have a chance of producing reinforcing consequences if the animal tries again. This animal would be at an advantage over another animal that gives up too easily.

Despite the name, however, not every explosive reaction to adverse stimuli subsides to extinction. Indeed, a small minority of individuals persist in their reaction indefinitely.

===Extinction-induced variability===
Extinction-induced variability serves an adaptive role similar to the extinction burst. When extinction begins, subjects can exhibit variations in response topography (the movements involved in the response).  Response topography is always somewhat variable due to differences in environment or idiosyncratic causes but normally a subject's history of reinforcement keeps slight variations stable by maintaining successful variations over less successful variations. Extinction can increase these variations significantly as the subject attempts to acquire the reinforcement that previous behaviors produced. If a person attempts to open a door by turning the knob, but is unsuccessful, they may next try jiggling the knob, pushing on the frame, knocking on the door or other behaviors to get the door to open. Extinction-induced variability can be used in [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] to reduce problematic behaviors by reinforcing desirable behaviors produced by extinction-induced variability.

== Classical conditioning ==
Extinction learning can also occur in a [[classical conditioning]] paradigm. In this model, a neutral cue or context can come to elicit a conditioned response when it is paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An unconditioned stimulus is one that naturally and automatically triggers a certain behavioral response. A certain stimulus or environment can become a conditioned cue or a conditioned context, respectively, when paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An example of this process is a [[fear conditioning]] paradigm using a mouse. In this instance, a tone paired with a mild footshock can become a conditioned cue, eliciting a fear response when presented alone in the future. In the same way, the context in which a footshock is received such as a chamber with certain dimensions and a certain odor can elicit the same fear response when the mouse is placed back in that chamber in the absence of the footshock.

In this paradigm, extinction occurs when the animal is re-exposed to the conditioned cue or conditioned context in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. As the animal learns that the cue or context no longer predicts the coming of the unconditioned stimulus, conditioned responding gradually decreases, or extinguishes.

== Neurobiology ==

===Glutamate===
[[Glutamate receptor|Glutamate]] is a neurotransmitter that has been extensively implicated in the neural basis of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Glutamate receptor function in learning and memory|journal = Behavioural Brain Research|date = 2003-03-18|issn = 0166-4328|pmid = 12644276|pages = 1–47|volume = 140|issue = 1–2|first = Gernot|last = Riedel|first2 = Bettina|last2 = Platt|first3 = Jacques|last3 = Micheau|doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(02)00272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-[[Cycloserine]] (DCS) is an [[agonist]] for the glutamate receptor [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]], and has been trialed as an adjunct to conventional [[exposure-based treatment]]s based on the principle of cue extinction.

A role for glutamate has also been identified in the extinction of a cocaine-associated environmental stimuli through testing in rats. Specifically, the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGlu5) is important for the extinction of a cocaine-associated context&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extinction of a cocaine-taking context that protects against drug-primed reinstatement is dependent on the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/adb.12142/abstract|journal = Addiction Biology|date = 2015-05-01|issn = 1369-1600|pages = 482–489|volume = 20|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/adb.12142|first = Jee Hyun|last = Kim|first2 = Christina|last2 = Perry|first3 = Sophia|last3 = Luikinga|first4 = Isabel|last4 = Zbukvic|first5 = Robyn M.|last5 = Brown|first6 = Andrew J.|last6 = Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a cocaine-associated cue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor is necessary for extinction of cocaine associated cues|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.13437/abstract|journal = British Journal of Pharmacology|date = 2016-01-01|issn = 1476-5381|pages = 1085–1094|doi = 10.1111/bph.13437|first = Christina J|last = Perry|first2 = Felicia|last2 = Reed|first3 = Isabel C|last3 = Zbukvic|first4 = Jee Hyun|last4 = Kim|first5 = Andrew J|last5 = Lawrence|volume=173|pmid=26784278|pmc = 5341241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dopamine ===

=== Circuitry ===
The brain region most extensively implicated in extinction learning is the [[infralimbic cortex]] (IL) of the [[Prefrontal cortex|medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Revisiting the Role of Infralimbic Cortex in Fear Extinction with Optogenetics|url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/8/3607|journal = The Journal of Neuroscience|date = 2015-02-25|issn = 0270-6474|pmc = 4339362|pmid = 25716859|pages = 3607–3615|volume = 35|issue = 8|doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3137-14.2015|first = Fabricio H.|last = Do-Monte|first2 = Gabriela|last2 = Manzano-Nieves|first3 = Kelvin|last3 = Quiñones-Laracuente|first4 = Liorimar|last4 = Ramos-Medina|first5 = Gregory J.|last5 = Quirk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IL is important for the extinction of reward- and fear-associated behaviors, while the [[amygdala]] has been strongly implicated in the extinction of conditioned fear.&lt;ref name="Myers &amp; Davis 2007" /&gt; The [[posterior cingulate cortex]] (PCC) and [[temporoparietal junction]] (TPJ) have also been identified as regions that may be associated with impaired extinction in adolescents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganella|first=Despina E.|last2=Drummond|first2=Katherine D.|last3=Ganella|first3=Eleni P.|last4=Whittle|first4=Sarah|last5=Kim|first5=Jee Hyun|date=2018|title=Extinction of Conditioned Fear in Adolescents and Adults: A Human fMRI Study|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00647/full|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|language=English|volume=11|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2017.00647|issn=1662-5161}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Across development ==
There is a strong body of evidence to suggest that extinction alters across development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yap, C.S., Richardson, R.|first=|year=2007|title=Extinction in the developing rat: an examination of renewal effects|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.20244/abstract;jsessionid=362891689D581792E5E4D406FDE79EC4.f02t04|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=49|pages=565–575|via=Wiley Online LIbrary|doi=10.1002/dev.20244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Developmental rodent models of fear and anxiety: from neurobiology to pharmacology|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.12643/abstract|journal = British Journal of Pharmacology|date = 2014-10-01|issn = 1476-5381|pmc = 4209932|pmid = 24527726|pages = 4556–4574|volume = 171|issue = 20|doi = 10.1111/bph.12643|first = Despina E|last = Ganella|first2 = Jee Hyun|last2 = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, extinction learning may differ during infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5370">'''Frans van der Hoff''' (born 13 July 1939),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dekorhoen.nl/cmsms/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=60&amp;cntnt01returnid=63 Frans van der Hoff uit De Rips viert zijn 40-jarig priesterfeest ook in De Rips] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Francisco VanderHoff Boersma as he is called in Latin America, is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[missionary]] who, in collaboration with [[Nico Roozen]] and [[ecumenical]] [[development agency]] [[Solidaridad]], launched [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]], the first [[Fairtrade certification|Fairtrade]] label in 1988. Frans van der Hoff's contacts with disadvantaged Mexican coffee producers were key in securing the supply and ensuring the success of the very first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiative.

Frans van der Hoff was born as the 7th of 17th children of a disciplined farming family ''Van der Hoff-Boersma'' that had moved from [[Friesland]] to the village [[De Rips]] in the southern Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://culemborg.pvda.nl/2015/06/02/grondlegger-max-havelaar-keurmerk-komt-naar-culemborg/ Grondlegger Max Havelaar keurmerk komt naar Culemborg] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became politically active early on in student movements during his studies at [[Radboud University Nijmegen]]. He later received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[political economy]] and another one in [[theology]] while studying in [[Germany]]. In 1970, van der Hoff moved to [[Santiago de Chile]] to work in the [[barrio]]s as a [[worker-priest]]. During the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]], van der Hoff moved to [[Mexico]] to continue his work in the slums of [[Mexico City]]. Seven years later, he moved to [[Oaxaca]] in the Southern part of [[Mexico]]. As a worker-priest, he quickly integrated the community and started to learn about the misery and economic hardship of local [[coffee]] producers. In 1981, he participates in the launch of UCIRI ([[Union de Comunidades Indigenas de la Region del Istmo]]), a coffee producer [[cooperative]] created to bypass local traders (also called ''coyotes'') and pool resources.

In 1985, van der Hoff met [[Nico Roozen]] at the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] train station through a mutual friend. Roozen, who was then responsible for business development at [[ecumenical]] [[development agency]] [[Solidaridad]], quickly became interested in van der Hoff's work.&lt;ref&gt;Jan van der Kaaij (2004).

URL accessed on September 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 1988, the two launched together the first Fairtrade labelling initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]]. The initiative offered disadvantaged [[coffee]] producers following various social and environmental standards a fair price, significantly above the market price, for their crop. The [[coffee]], originating from the UCIRI cooperative, was imported by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company [[Van Weely]], roasted by [[Neuteboom]] and then sold directly to [[world shops]] and retailers across the [[Netherlands]]. The initiative was a great success and was replicated in several other markets.

In 2006, Fairtrade-certified sales amounted to approximately €1.6 billion worldwide&lt;ref name="URL accessed on May 24, 2007"&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2007). www.fairtrade.net.

==Awards==
Van der Hoff was awarded the 2006 [[North-South Prize]] by the [[Council of Europe]].

Van der Hoff was appointed Commander in the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)]] by the Belgian Minister of Development Cooperation in 2006.

Van der Hoff received in 2006 an honorary doctorate from the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium for his efforts to establish a 'different economy'.

In 2006 he was awarded the Groeneveldprize from the Groeneveld Foundation in the Netherlands, for his special efforts for nature and the preservation of the environment.

He was named [[Chevalier of the Legion of Honor]] by French president Chirac in 2005.

A '''heijunka box''' is a visual scheduling tool used in [[heijunka]], a concept originally created by [[Toyota]] for achieving a smoother production flow.  While heijunka is the smoothing of production, the heijunka box is the name of a specific tool used in achieving the aims of heijunka.

The heijunka box is generally a wall schedule which is divided into a grid of boxes or a set of 'pigeon-holes'/rectangular receptacles. Each column of boxes representing a specific period of time, lines are drawn down the schedule/grid to visually break the schedule into columns of individual shifts or days or weeks. Coloured cards representing individual jobs (referred to as [[kanban]] cards) are placed on the heijunka box to provide a visual representation of the upcoming production runs.

The heijunka box makes it easy to see what type of jobs are queued for production and for when they are scheduled. Workers on the process remove the kanban cards for the current period from the box in order to know what to do. These cards will be passed to another section when they process the related job.

==Implementation==
[[File:HeijunkaBox.svg|thumb|400px|An example of a Heijunka box.]]
The Heijunka box allows easy and visual control of a smoothed production schedule.

A typical heijunka box has horizontal rows for each product. It has vertical columns for identical time intervals of production. In the illustration on the right, the time interval is thirty minutes. Production control kanban are placed in the pigeon-holes provided by the box in proportion to the number of items to be built of a given product type during a time interval.

In this illustration, each time period builds an A and two Bs along with a mix of Cs, Ds and Es. What is clear from the box, from the simple repeating patterns of kanbans in each row, is that the production is smooth of each of these products.

This ensures that production capacity is kept under a constant pressure thereby eliminating many issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12189">The '''identity of indiscernibles''' is an [[ontology|ontological]] principle that states that there cannot be separate [[object (philosophy)|object]]s or [[entity|entities]] that have all their [[property (philosophy)|properties]] in common. That is, entities ''x'' and ''y'' are identical if every [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] possessed by ''x'' is also possessed by ''y'' and vice versa; to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. It states that no two distinct things (such as [[snowflake]]s) can be exactly alike, but this is intended as a metaphysical principle rather than one of natural science. A related principle is the indiscernibility of identicals, discussed below.

A form of the principle is attributed to the German philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].  It is one of his two great metaphysical principles, the other being the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. Both are famously used in his arguments with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Samuel Clarke|Clarke]] in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]]. Because of its association with Leibniz, the principle is sometimes known as '''Leibniz's law'''. 

Some philosophers have decided, however, that it is important to exclude certain predicates (or purported predicates) from the principle in order to avoid either triviality or contradiction. An example (detailed below) is the predicate that denotes whether an object is equal to ''x'' (often considered a valid predicate). As a consequence, there are a few different versions of the principle in the philosophical literature, of varying logical strength—and some of them are termed "the strong principle" or "the weak principle" by particular authors, in order to distinguish between them.&lt;ref name=Forrest2008&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Forrest | first=Peter | title=The Identity of Indiscernibles | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=Fall 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/identity-indiscernible/ |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] thought that the failure of [[substitutivity]] in intensional contexts (e.g., "Sally believes that ''p''" or "It is necessarily the case that ''q''") shows that [[modal logic]] is an impossible project.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. "Notes on Existence and Necessity." ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;40, No.&amp;nbsp;5 (March 4, 1943), pp. 113–127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] holds that this failure may be the result of the use of the [[disquotational principle]] implicit in these proofs, and not a failure of substitutivity as such.&lt;ref name="belief"&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief". First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A.&amp;nbsp;Margalit. Dordrecht: D.&amp;nbsp;Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of indiscernibles has been used to motivate notions of [[Quantum contextuality|noncontextuality]] within quantum mechanics.

Associated with this principle is also the question as to whether it is a [[logical]] principle, or merely an [[empirical]] principle.

==Identity and indiscernibility==
There are two principles here that must be distinguished (equivalent versions of each are given in the language of the predicate calculus).&lt;ref name=Forrest2008 /&gt; Note that these are all [[Second-order logic|second-order]] expressions. Neither of these principles can be expressed in [[first-order logic]] (are [[nonfirstorderizability|nonfirstorderizable]]).

#The indiscernibility of identicals
#*For any ''x'' and ''y'', if ''x'' is identical to ''y'', then ''x'' and ''y'' have all the same properties.
#*:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \forall y \, [x=y \rightarrow \forall P(Px \leftrightarrow Py)]&lt;/math&gt;

Principle 1 doesn't entail [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] of = (or any other relation ''R'' substituted for it), but both properties together entail [[Symmetric relation|symmetry]] and [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] (see proof box). Therefore, Principle 1 and reflexivity is sometimes used as a (second-order) [[Axiomatic system|axiomatization]] for the equality relation.

Principle 1 is taken to be a [[logical truth]] and (for the most part) uncontroversial.&lt;ref name=Forrest2008 /&gt; Principle&amp;nbsp;2, on the other hand, is controversial; [[Max Black]] famously argued against it.

The above formulations are not satisfactory, however: the second principle should be read as having an implicit side-condition excluding any predicates that are equivalent (in some sense) to any of the following:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
#"is identical to ''x''"
#"is identical to ''y''"
#"is not identical to ''x''"
#"is not identical to ''y''"
If all such predicates are included, then the second principle as formulated above can be trivially and uncontroversially shown to be a [[tautology (logic)|logical tautology]]: if ''x'' is non-identical to ''y'', then there will always be a putative "property" that distinguishes them, namely "being identical to ''x''".

On the other hand, it is incorrect to exclude all predicates that are [[materially equivalent]] (i.e., [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]]ly equivalent) to one or more of the four given above. If this is done, the principle says that in a universe consisting of two non-identical objects, because all distinguishing predicates are materially equivalent to at least one of the four given above (in fact, they are each materially equivalent to two of them), the two non-identical objects are identical—which is a contradiction.

==Critique==
===Symmetric universe===
[[Max Black]] has argued against the identity of indiscernibles by counterexample. Notice that to show that the identity of indiscernibles is false, it is sufficient that one provides a [[Model theory|model]] in which there are two distinct (numerically nonidentical) things that have all the same properties. He claimed that in a symmetric universe wherein only two symmetrical spheres exist, the two spheres are two distinct objects even though they have all their properties in common.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics: An Anthology''. eds. J. Kim and E. Sosa, Blackwell Publishing, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's argument appears significant because it shows that even relational properties (properties specifying distances between objects in space-time) fail to distinguish two identical objects in a symmetrical universe. Per his argument, two objects are, and will remain, equidistant from the universe's plane of symmetry and each other. Even bringing in an external observer to label the two spheres distinctly does not solve the problem, because it violates the symmetry of the universe.

===Indiscernibility of identicals===
As stated above, the principle of indiscernibility of identicals—that if two objects are in fact one and the same, they have all the same properties—is mostly uncontroversial. However, one famous application of the indiscernibility of identicals was by [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of himself (the famous ''[[Cogito ergo sum|cogito]]'' argument), but that he ''could'' doubt the existence of his body.

This argument is criticized by some modern philosophers on the grounds that it allegedly derives a conclusion about what is true from a premise about what people know.  What people know or believe about an entity, they argue, is not really a characteristic of that entity. A response may be that the argument in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' is that the inability of Descartes to doubt the existence of his mind is part of his mind's [[essence]]. One may then argue that identical things should have identical essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=8sN_sdfBpGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Between Two Worlds: A Reading of Descartes's Meditations | first=John Peter | last=Carriero | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous counterexamples are given to debunk Descartes' reasoning via ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', such as the following argument based on a [[secret identity]]:

#Entities ''x'' and ''y'' are identical if and only if any predicate possessed by ''x'' is also possessed by ''y'' and vice versa.
#Clark Kent is Superman's secret identity; that is, they're the same person (identical) but people don't know this fact.
#[[Lois Lane]] thinks that [[Clark Kent]] cannot fly.
#Lois Lane thinks that [[Superman]] can fly.
#Therefore Superman has a property that Clark Kent does not have, namely that Lois Lane thinks that he can fly.
#Therefore, Superman is not identical to Clark Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/dpitt/Egos.pdf | title=Alter Egos and Their Names | first=David | last=Pitt | journal=The Journal of Philosophy | volume=98 | issue=10 | date=October 2001 | pages=531–552, 550 | doi=10.2307/3649468 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508170350/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/dpitt/Egos.pdf | archivedate=2006-05-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Since in proposition&amp;nbsp;6 we come to a contradiction with proposition&amp;nbsp;2, we conclude that at least one of the premises is wrong. Either:
#* Leibniz's law is wrong; or
#* A person's knowledge about ''x'' is not a predicate of ''x''; or
#* The application of Leibniz's law is erroneous; the law is only applicable in cases of monadic, not polyadic, properties; or
#* What people think about are not the actual objects themselves; or
#* A person is capable of holding conflicting beliefs.
:::Any of which will undermine Descartes' argument.&lt;ref name="belief" /&gt;

He is a Fellow of the [[British Psychological Society]], the [[Academy of Medical Sciences]] and the [[British Academy]]. He was educated at Stockton Grammar School, [[Stockton-on-Tees]], and at [[St Peter's College, Oxford]].

His research is concerned with psychological models and treatment of depression and suicidal behaviour. He uses experimental cognitive psychology – in particular investigations into the specificity of [[autobiographical memory]] – to help understand the processes that increase risk of suicidal behaviour in depression.  With colleagues [[John D. Teasdale]] (Cambridge) and [[Zindel Segal]] (Toronto) he developed [[Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy]] (MBCT; [http://www.mbct.co.uk]) for prevention of relapse and recurrence in depression, and several RCTs have now found that MBCT significantly decreases the recurrence rate in those who have suffered three or more previous episodes of major depression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.octc.co.uk/content.asp?PageID=194 Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{BLP refimprove|date=May 2016}}
'''Jean Marie Syjuco''' (born June 26, 1952) is a [[Painting|painter]], [[installation artist]], and [[performance artist]] from [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].

Through the 1980s and the 1990s, Jean Marie brought attention and institutional support to the maverick art-form of [[Performance Art]] in the Philippines. Beginning in the 1970s as an extension of her work as a [[visual artist]], her performance works developed from conceptual pieces of marked brevity rooted in anti-narrative devices, to the thematic spectacles and large-scale collaborations and video documentations for which she is now better known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/25051&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 3 decades, she has balanced her roles as a painter of Abstract and Fantasy genres, sculptor, installation and performance artist.  Since she was awarded the ''Gold Medal for Sculpture in the 1980 AAP (Art Institution of the Philippines) Annual Art Competition'', her transmedia objects and installations have occupied a unique place in contemporary art for their [[avant-garde]] melding of folk and technological elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Castillones |first=Danny |url=http://cuadrofilipino.blogspot.com/2008/04/orphaned-egg-weapons-of-mass.html |title=CuadroFilipino: Weapons of Mass Destruction in Cesare &amp; Jean Marie Syjuco’s Aesthetics |website=Cuadrofilipino.blogspot.com |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Marie Syjuco was a recipient of the 1990 [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] Gawad CCP Para Sa Sining Biswal Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://fineartmanila.com/artists/biography/syjuco&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, she is building the ''New “Art Lab”'', a non-profit developmental art facility (founded with her husband, [[Cesare Syjuco]]), which served as the haven of experimental art in the 1990s. &lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/89493/a-home-or-a-gallery-or-both]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8105">[[File:Canute_rebukes_his_courtiers.png|thumb|  "Canute rebukes his courtiers" by [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville]]]]
The story of '''''King Canute and the tide''''' is an [[apocryphal]] anecdote illustrating the [[piety]] or [[humility]] of King [[Canute the Great]], recorded in the 12th century by  [[Henry of Huntingdon]].

In the story, Canute demonstrates to his flattering courtiers that he has no control over the elements (the incoming tide), explaining that secular power is vain compared to the [[omnipotence|supreme power]] of God.
The episode is frequently alluded to in contexts where the futility of "trying to stop the tide" of an inexorable event is pointed out, but usually misrepresenting Canute as believing he had supernatural powers, when Huntingdon's story in fact relates the opposite.

==The episode==
[[Henry of Huntingdon]] tells the story as one of three examples of Canute's "graceful and magnificent" behaviour (outside of his bravery in warfare),&lt;ref&gt;''Enimvero extra numerum bellorum, quibus maxime splenduit, tria gessit eleganter &amp; magnifice''&lt;/ref&gt; the other two being his arrangement of the marriage of [[Gunhilda of Denmark|his daughter]] to the later [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]], and the negotiation of a reduction in tolls on the roads  [[Arelat|across Gaul]] to Rome at the [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor#Imperial coronation|imperial coronation]] of 1027.

In Huntingdon's account, Canute set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the [[tide|incoming tide]] to halt and not wet his feet and robes. Yet "continuing to rise as usual [the tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.{{'"}} He then hung his gold crown on a [[crucifix]], and never wore it again "to the honour of God the almighty King".&lt;ref name="Henry of Hntdn., ''The Chronicle'', p. 199"&gt;Henry of Huntingdon, ''The Chronicle'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later historians repeated the story, most of them adjusting it to have Canute more clearly aware that the tides would not obey him, and staging the scene to rebuke the flattery of his courtiers.
There are also earlier parallels in Celtic stories of men who commanded the tides, namely Saint [[Illtud]] of [[Glamorgan]], [[Maelgwn Gwynedd|Maelgwn]], king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], and Tuirbe, of Tuirbe's Strand in [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]: "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2797899 Cnut and the Waves]": ''Man'', Vol. 60, (January 1960), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proverbial reference to the legend in modern journalism or politics usually casts the story in terms of "Canute's arrogance" of "attempting to stop the tide". 
It was cited, for example, by [[Stacy Head]] as typifying the [[New Orleans]] city council's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] (2005), or by [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]] in reference to [[Ryan Giggs]] as "the King Canute of football"  for his attempts of stopping "the unstoppable tide of information" on the internet in the [[2011 British privacy injunctions controversy]]. That is a misrepresentation of Huntingdon's account, whose Canute uses the tide to demonstrate his inability to control the elements and his deference to the greater authority of God.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13524677 Is King Canute misunderstood?] BBC news story&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodore Dalrymple]] refers to the story, without misattributing motives of arrogance to Canute, in the context of the [[international reaction to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|British reaction to the Ukraine crisis]] (2014), saying 
{{quote|Political power or office often gives those who possess it the illusion that they control events. That, after all, is the reason why the story of King Canute retains, and will always retain, its relevance to the current political situation.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Dalrymple, [http://www.salisburyreview.com/Theodore_Dalrymple/drone.html Droning over the Caucasus], The Salisbury Review, 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Warren Burger]], the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], mentions Canute in the 1980 decision ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'' (447 U.S. 303), stating the denial of a patent for a micro-organism "is not likely to put an end to genetic research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/447/303.html |title=Diamond V. Chakrabarty &amp;#124; Findlaw |website=Caselaw.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burger likens doing so to Canute commanding the tides.

==Historicity and possible location==
The contemporary ''[[Encomium Emmae]]'' has no mention of the episode, which has been taken as indicating its ahistoricity, as it would seem that so pious a dedication might have been recorded there, since the same source gives an "eye-witness account of his lavish gifts to the monasteries and poor of [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] when on the way to Rome, and of the tears and breast-beating which accompanied them".&lt;ref name="Lawson125"&gt;Lawson, M. K., ''Cnut – England's Viking King'', Stroud: Tempus (2nd ed. 2004), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Goscelin]], writing later in the 11th century, instead has Canute place his crown on a crucifix at Winchester one Easter, with no mention of the sea, and "with the explanation that the king of kings was more worthy of it than he". Nevertheless, there may be a "basis of fact, in a planned act of piety" behind this story.&lt;ref name="Lawson125"/&gt; 
On the other hand, [[Malcolm Godden]] says the story is simply "a 12th Century legend... and those 12th Century historians were always making up stories about kings from Anglo-Saxon times".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

The site of the episode is often identified as [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]] (now known as [[Westminster]]), where Canute set up a royal palace during his reign over [[Anglo-Saxon London|London]].&lt;ref&gt;The Palace of Westminster Factsheet G11, General Series, Revised March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/estatehistory/the-middle-ages/anglosaxon-royal-palace/ Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.] Living Heritage. History of the Parliamentary Estate: Anglo-Saxon origins&lt;/ref&gt; 
Conflictingly, a sign on [[Southampton]] city centre's Canute Road reads, "Near this spot AD 1028 Canute reproved his courtiers".&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite web|title=Canute Castle Hotel |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/archaeology/archaeology-unit/sitesbyarea/bargate-ward/canute-castle.aspx |work=Archaeological Sites |publisher=Southampton City Council |accessdate=21 March 2012 |date=January 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428024210/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/archaeology/archaeology-unit/sitesbyarea/bargate-ward/canute-castle.aspx |archivedate=28 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Maps, Canute Road Southampton|url=http://g.co/maps/q97zq|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosham]] in [[West Sussex]] also claims to be the site of this episode, as does [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. As Gainsborough is inland, if the story is true then Canute would have been trying to turn back the [[tidal bore]] known as the [[Trent aegir|aegir]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4539">In [[physics]], the '''meter water equivalent''' (often ''m.w.e.'' or ''mwe'') is a standard measure of [[cosmic ray]] attenuation in underground [[laboratory|laboratories]]. A laboratory at a depth of 1000 m.w.e is shielded from cosmic rays equivalent to a lab 1000&amp;nbsp;m below the surface of a body of water. Because laboratories at the same depth (in meters) can have greatly varied levels of cosmic ray penetration, the m.w.e. provides a convenient and consistent way of comparing cosmic ray levels in different underground locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepscience.org/contents/underground_universe.shtml|title=Deep Science|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=2014-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223150019/http://www.deepscience.org/contents/underground_universe.shtml|archivedate=2015-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic ray attenuation is dependent on the density of the material of the [[overburden]], so the m.w.e. is defined as the product of depth and density (also known as an interaction depth). Because the density of water is 1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 m of water gives an interaction depth of 1 hectogram per square centimeter (hg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Some publications use hg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; instead of m.w.e., although the two units are equivalent.&lt;ref name="Grieder2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. K. F. Grieder|title=Cosmic Rays at Earth: Researcher's Reference Manual and Data Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwwRhQ7qEAsC&amp;pg=PA482|year=2001|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=978-0-444-50710-5}} 482 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]], located 660&amp;nbsp;m ideep in a [[salt]] formation, achieves 1585&amp;nbsp;m.w.e. shielding.  [[Soudan Mine]], at 713&amp;nbsp;m depth is only 8% deeper, but because it is in iron-rich rock it achieves 2100&amp;nbsp;m.w.e. shielding, 32% more.

Another factor that must be accounted for is the ''shape'' of the overburden.  While some laboratories are located beneath a flat ground surface, many are located in tunnels in mountains.  Thus, the distance to the surface in directions other than straight up is less than it would be assuming a flat surface.

== Standard rock ==
In addition to m.w.e., underground laboratory depth can also be measured in meters of standard rock. Standard rock is defined to have [[mass number]] A&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;22, [[atomic number]] Z&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[sodium|11]], and density 2.65 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="PDG 28"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1674-1137/38/9/090001| title = Review of Particle Physics| url = http://pdg.lbl.gov/| journal = Chinese Physics C| volume = 38| issue = 9| pages = 090001| year = 2014| author =  K. A. Olive ''et al.'' (PDG)|bibcode = 2014ChPhC..38i0001O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most laboratories are under earth and not underwater, the depth in standard rock is often closer to the actual underground depth of the laboratory.

== Existing underground laboratories ==
Underground laboratories exist at depths ranging from just below ground level to approximately 6000 m.w.e. at [[SNOLAB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.73.053004 |title=Muon-induced background study for underground laboratories |journal=Physical Review D |volume=73 |issue=5 |year=2006 |last1=Mei |first1=D.-M. |last2=Hime |first2=A. |arxiv=astro-ph/0512125 |bibcode=2006PhRvD..73e3004M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6700 m.w.e. at the [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory|Jinping Underground Laboratory]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1088/1674-1137/37/8/086001 |arxiv=1305.0899 |bibcode=2013ChPhC..37h6001W |title=Measurement of cosmic ray flux in the China JinPing underground laboratory |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-1137/37/8/086001/pdf |journal=Chinese Physics C |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=086001 |date=August 2013 |last1=Wu |first1=Yu-Cheng |last2=Hao |first2=Xi-Qing |last3=Yue |first3=Qian |last4=Li |first4=Yuan-Jing |last5=Cheng |first5=Jian-Ping |last6=Kang |first6=Ke-Jun |last7=Chen |first7=Yun-Hua |last8=Li |first8=Jin |last9=Li |first9=Jian-Min |last10=Li |first10=Yu-Lan |last11=Liu |first11=Shu-Kui |last12=Ma |first12=Hao |last13=Ren |first13=Jin-Bao |last14=Shen |first14=Man-Bin |last15=Wang |first15=Ji-Min |last16=Wu |first16=Shi-Yong |last17=Xue |first17=Tao |last18=Yi |first18=Nan |last19=Zeng |first19=Xiong-Hui |last20=Zeng |first20=Zhi |last21=Zhu |first21=Zhong-Hua }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molecular dynamics''' ('''MD''') is a [[computer simulation]] method for studying the [[Motion (physics)|physical movements]] of [[atoms]] and [[molecules]]. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] evolution of the system. In the most common version, the [[trajectory|trajectories]] of atoms and molecules are determined by [[Numerical integration|numerically solving]] [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's equations of motion]] for a system of interacting particles, where [[Force (physics)|forces]] between the particles and their [[potential energy|potential energies]] are often calculated using [[interatomic potential]]s or [[molecular mechanics]] [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]].

Because molecular systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to determine the properties of such [[complex systems]] analytically; MD simulation circumvents this problem by using [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] methods. However, long MD simulations are mathematically [[condition number|ill-conditioned]], generating cumulative errors in numerical integration that can be minimized with proper selection of algorithms and parameters, but not eliminated entirely.

For systems which obey the [[ergodic hypothesis]], the evolution of one molecular dynamics simulation may be used to determine macroscopic [[thermodynamic]] properties of the system: the time averages of an ergodic system correspond to [[microcanonical ensemble]] averages. MD has also been termed "statistical mechanics by numbers" and "[[Laplace]]'s vision of [[Newtonian mechanics]]" of predicting the future by animating nature's forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== History ==
Following the earlier successes of [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s, the method was first developed by Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and [[Mary Tsingou|Tsingou]]&lt;ref name=fput /&gt; in the mid 50s. In 1957, [[Berni Alder|Alder]] and Wainwright used an [[IBM 704]] computer to simulate perfectly elastic collisions between [[hard spheres]].&lt;ref name=a&amp;w /&gt; In 1960, Gibson et al., simulated radiation damage of solid [[copper]] by using a Born-Mayer type of repulsive interaction along with a cohesive surface force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= J B |last1= Gibson |first2= A N |last2= Goland |first3= M |last3= Milgram |first4= G H |last4= Vineyard |year= 1960 |title= Dynamics of Radiation Damage |journal= Phys.

Calculations of system properties, such as the coefficient of [[self-diffusion]], compared well with experimental data.&lt;ref name=a.rahman /&gt;

Even before it became possible to simulate molecular dynamics with computers, some undertook the hard work of trying it with physical models such as macroscopic spheres. The idea was to arrange them to replicate the properties of a liquid. [[J.D. Bernal]] said, in 1962: "''... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches. I tried to do this in the first place as casually as possible, working in my own office, being interrupted every five minutes or so and not remembering what I had done before the interruption.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= J.D. |last= Bernal |year= 1964 |title= The Bakerian lecture, 1962: The structure of liquids |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume= 280 |issue= 1382 |pages= 299–322 |id= |url= |doi= 10.1098/rspa.1964.0147|bibcode= 1964RSPSA.280..299B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of application and limits ==

Beginning in theoretical [[physics]], the method of MD gained popularity in [[materials science]] and since the 1970s also in [[biochemistry]] and [[biophysics]]. MD is frequently used to refine 3-dimensional structures of [[protein]]s and other [[macromolecule]]s based on experimental constraints from [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]]. In physics, MD is used to examine the dynamics of atomic-level phenomena that cannot be observed directly, such as thin film growth and ion-subplantation, and also to examine the physical properties of [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] devices that have not or cannot yet be created. In biophysics and [[structural biology]], the method is frequently applied to study the motions of macromolecules such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s, which can be useful for interpreting the results of certain biophysical experiments and for modeling interactions with other molecules, as in [[ligand docking]]. In principle MD can be used for [[De novo protein structure prediction|ab initio prediction]] of [[protein structure]] by simulating [[protein folding|folding]] of the [[polypeptide chain]] from [[random coil]].

The results of MD simulations can be tested through comparison to experiments that measure molecular dynamics, of which a popular method is NMR spectroscopy. MD-derived structure predictions can be tested through community-wide experiments in Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ([[CASP]]), although the method has historically had limited success in this area. [[Michael Levitt]], who shared the [[Nobel Prize]] partly for the application of MD to proteins, wrote in 1999 that CASP participants usually did not use the method due to "''... a central embarrassment of molecular mechanics, namely that energy minimization or molecular dynamics generally leads to a model that is less like the experimental structure.''"&lt;ref name="Koehl"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Koehl |first1= P. |authorlink2= Michael Levitt |last2= Levitt |first2= Michael |year= 1999 |title= A brighter future for protein structure prediction |url= |journal= [[Nature Structural Biology]] |volume= 6 |issue= |pages= 108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in computational resources permitting more and longer MD trajectories, combined with modern improvements in the quality of [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] parameters, have yielded some improvements in both structure prediction and [[homology model]] refinement, without reaching the point of practical utility in these areas; many identify force field parameters as a key area for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raval|first1=A|last2=Piana|first2=S|last3=Eastwood|first3=MP|last4=Dror|first4=RO|last5=Shaw|first5=DE|title=Refinement of protein structure homology models via long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.|journal=Proteins|date=August 2012|volume=80|issue=8|pages=2071–9|pmid=22513870|doi=10.1002/prot.24098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=KA|last2=Lin|first2=YS|last3=Das|first3=R|last4=Pande|first4=VS|title=Are Protein Force Fields Getting Better?

Limits of the method are related to the parameter sets used, and to the underlying [[molecular mechanics]] force fields. One run of an MD simulation optimizes the [[potential energy]], rather than the [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] of the protein {{Dubious|date=July 2017}}, meaning that all [[Entropy|entropic contributions]] to [[thermodynamic stability]] of protein structure are neglected, including the [[conformational entropy]] of the polypeptide chain (the main factor that destabilizes protein structure) and [[hydrophobic effect]]s (the main driving forces of protein folding).&lt;ref&gt;Hydrophobic effects are mostly of entropic nature at room temperature.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important factor are intramolecular [[hydrogen bond]]s,&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Myers |first1= J.

This is a crude approximation because hydrogen bonds have a partially [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] nature. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions are usually calculated using the [[Relative permittivity|dielectric constant]] of [[vacuum]], although the surrounding aqueous solution has a much higher dielectric constant. Using the [[macroscopic]] dielectric constant at short interatomic distances is questionable. Finally, [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals interactions]] in MD are usually described by [[Lennard-Jones potential]]s based on the [[Fritz London]] theory that is only applicable in vacuum. However, all types of van der Waals forces are ultimately of electrostatic origin and therefore depend on [[Permittivity|dielectric properties of the environment]].&lt;ref name="Israelachvili"&gt;[[Jacob Israelachvili|Israelachvili, Jacob]] (1992). ''Intermolecular and surface forces.'' Academic Press, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; The direct measurement of attraction forces between different materials (as [[Hamaker constant]]) shows that "the interaction between hydrocarbons across water is about 10% of that across vacuum".&lt;ref name="Israelachvili" /&gt; The environment-dependence of van der Waals forces is neglected in standard simulations, but can be included by developing polarizable force fields.

== Design constraints ==

Design of a molecular dynamics simulation should account for the available computational power. Simulation size (n=number of particles), timestep, and total time duration must be selected so that the calculation can finish within a reasonable time period. However, the simulations should be long enough to be relevant to the time scales of the natural processes being studied. To make statistically valid conclusions from the simulations, the time span simulated should match the [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] of the natural process. Otherwise, it is analogous to making conclusions about how a human walks when only looking at less than one footstep. Most scientific publications about the dynamics of proteins and DNA &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite |author1=Cruz, F.J.A.L. |author2=de Pablo, J.J. |author3=Mota, J.P.B. |title=Endohedral confinement of a DNA dodecamer onto pristine carbon nanotubes and the stability of the canonical B form |journal=J.

To obtain these simulations, several CPU-days to CPU-years are needed. Parallel algorithms allow the load to be distributed among CPUs; an example is the spatial or force decomposition algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Plimpton, Steve. [http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/md.html Molecular Dynamics - Parallel Algorithms]. sandia.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

During a classical MD simulation, the most CPU intensive task is the evaluation of the [[Force field (chemistry)|potential]] as a function of the particles' internal coordinates. Within that energy evaluation, the most expensive one is the non-bonded or non-covalent part. In [[Big O notation]], common molecular dynamics simulations [[analysis of algorithms|scale]] by &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; if all pair-wise [[electrostatic]] and [[van der Waals forces|van der Waals interactions]] must be accounted for explicitly. This computational cost can be reduced by employing electrostatics methods such as particle mesh [[Ewald summation]] ( &lt;math&gt;O(n \log(n))&lt;/math&gt; ), particle–particle-particle–mesh ([[P3M]]), or good spherical cutoff methods ( &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; ). {{citation needed |date=December 2017}}

Another factor that impacts total CPU time needed by a simulation is the size of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid [[discretization]] errors (i.e., smaller than the period related to fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1&amp;nbsp;femtosecond (10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE [[constraint algorithm]], which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.&lt;ref name="Streett"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Streett WB, Tildesley DJ, Saville G |year=1978 |title=Multiple time-step methods in molecular dynamics |journal=Mol Phys |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=639–648 |doi=10.1080/00268977800100471|bibcode= 1978MolPh..35..639S |last2=Tildesley |last3=Saville}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckerman1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1991 |title=Molecular dynamics algorithm for multiple time scales: systems with long range forces |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=6811–6815 |doi=10.1063/1.460259|bibcode= 1991JChPh..94.6811T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckerman1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1992 |title=Reversible multiple time scale molecular dynamics |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=1990–2001 |doi=10.1063/1.463137|bibcode= 1992JChPh..97.1990T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For simulating molecules in a solvent, a choice should be made between [[Water model|explicit]] and [[implicit solvent]]. Explicit solvent particles (such as the [[TIP3P]], SPC/E and [[Flexible SPC water model|SPC-f]] water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is especially important to reproduce [[chemical kinetics]].

In all kinds of molecular dynamics simulations, the simulation box size must be large enough to avoid [[boundary condition]] artifacts. Boundary conditions are often treated by choosing fixed values at the edges (which may cause artifacts), or by employing [[periodic boundary conditions]] in which one side of the simulation loops back to the opposite side, mimicking a bulk phase (which may cause artifacts too).

=== Microcanonical ensemble (NVE) ===

In the [[microcanonical ensemble]], the system is isolated from changes in moles (N), volume (V), and energy (E). It corresponds to an [[adiabatic process]] with no heat exchange. A microcanonical molecular dynamics trajectory may be seen as an exchange of potential and kinetic energy, with total energy being conserved. For a system of N particles with coordinates &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and velocities &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the following pair of first order differential equations may be written in [[Newton's notation for differentiation|Newton's notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;F(X) = -\nabla U(X)=M\dot{V}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = \dot{X} (t).&lt;/math&gt;

The potential energy function &lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt; of the system is a function of the particle coordinates &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It is referred to simply as the ''potential'' in physics, or the ''force field'' in chemistry. The first equation comes from [[Newton's laws of motion]]; the force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; acting on each particle in the system can be calculated as the negative gradient of &lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

For every time step, each particle's position &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; may be integrated with a [[symplectic integrator]] method such as [[Verlet integration]]. The time evolution of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is called a trajectory. Given the initial positions (e.g., from theoretical knowledge) and velocities (e.g., randomized Gaussian), we can calculate all future (or past) positions and velocities.

One frequent source of confusion is the meaning of [[temperature]] in MD. Commonly we have experience with macroscopic temperatures, which involve a huge number of particles. But temperature is a statistical quantity. If there is a large enough number of atoms, statistical temperature can be estimated from the ''instantaneous temperature'', which is found by equating the kinetic energy of the system to nk&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T/2 where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

A temperature-related phenomenon arises due to the small number of atoms that are used in MD simulations. For example, consider simulating the growth of a copper film starting with a substrate containing 500 atoms and a deposition energy of 100 eV. In the real world, the 100 eV from the deposited atom would rapidly be transported through and shared among a large number of atoms (&lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; or more) with no big change in temperature. When there are only 500 atoms, however, the substrate is almost immediately vaporized by the deposition. Something similar happens in biophysical simulations. The temperature of the system in NVE is naturally raised when macromolecules such as proteins undergo exothermic conformational changes and binding.

=== Canonical ensemble (NVT) ===

In the [[canonical ensemble]], amount of substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved. It is also sometimes called constant temperature molecular dynamics (CTMD). In NVT, the energy of endothermic and exothermic processes is exchanged with a thermostat.

A variety of thermostat algorithms are available to add and remove energy from the boundaries of a MD simulation in a more or less realistic way, approximating the [[canonical ensemble]]. Popular methods to control temperature include velocity rescaling, the [[Nosé-Hoover thermostat]], Nosé-Hoover chains, the [[Berendsen thermostat]], the [[Andersen thermostat]] and [[Langevin dynamics]]. The Berendsen thermostat might introduce the [[flying ice cube]] effect, which leads to unphysical translations and rotations of the simulated system.

It is not trivial to obtain a [[canonical ensemble]] distribution of conformations and velocities using these algorithms. How this depends on system size, thermostat choice, thermostat parameters, time step and integrator is the subject of many articles in the field.

=== Isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble ===

In the [[isothermal–isobaric ensemble]], amount of substance (N), pressure (P) and temperature (T) are conserved. In addition to a thermostat, a barostat is needed. It corresponds most closely to laboratory conditions with a flask open to ambient temperature and pressure.

In the simulation of biological membranes, [[isotropic]] pressure control is not appropriate. For lipid bilayers, pressure control occurs under constant membrane area (NPAT) or constant surface tension "gamma" (NPγT).

=== Generalized ensembles ===

The [[replica exchange]] method is a generalized ensemble. It was originally created to deal with the slow dynamics of disordered spin systems. It is also called parallel tempering. The replica exchange MD (REMD) formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Potentials in MD simulations ==
{{Main|Interatomic potential|Force field (chemistry)|l2=Force field|Comparison of force field implementations}}
A molecular dynamics simulation requires the definition of a [[function (mathematics)|potential function]], or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact. In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] and in materials physics as an [[interatomic potential]]. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on [[molecular mechanics]] and embody a [[classical mechanics]] treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and [[conformational change]]s but usually cannot reproduce [[chemical reaction]]s.

The reduction from a fully quantum description to a classical potential entails two main approximations. The first one is the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which states that the dynamics of electrons are so fast that they can be considered to react instantaneously to the motion of their nuclei. As a consequence, they may be treated separately. The second one treats the nuclei, which are much heavier than electrons, as point particles that follow classical Newtonian dynamics. In classical molecular dynamics, the effect of the electrons is approximated as one potential energy surface, usually representing the ground state.

When finer levels of detail are needed, potentials based on [[quantum mechanics]] are used; some methods attempt to create hybrid [[QM/MM|classical/quantum]] potentials where the bulk of the system is treated classically but a small region is treated as a quantum system, usually undergoing a chemical transformation.

=== Empirical potentials ===

Empirical potentials used in chemistry are frequently called [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]], while those used in materials physics are called [[interatomic potential]]s.

Most [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] in chemistry are empirical and consist of a summation of bonded forces associated with [[chemical bond]]s, bond angles, and bond [[dihedral angle|dihedrals]], and non-bonded forces associated with [[van der Waals force]]s and [[electrostatic charge]]. Empirical potentials represent quantum-mechanical effects in a limited way through ad-hoc functional approximations. These potentials contain free parameters such as [[electrostatic charge|atomic charge]], van der Waals parameters reflecting estimates of [[atomic radius]], and equilibrium [[bond length]], angle, and dihedral; these are obtained by fitting against detailed electronic calculations (quantum chemical simulations) or experimental physical properties such as [[Young's modulus|elastic constants]], lattice parameters and [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements.

Because of the non-local nature of non-bonded interactions, they involve at least weak interactions between all particles in the system. Its calculation is normally the bottleneck in the speed of MD simulations. To lower the computational cost, [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] employ numerical approximations such as shifted cutoff radii, [[reaction field method|reaction field]] algorithms, particle mesh [[Ewald summation]], or the newer particle–particle-particle–mesh ([[P3M]]).

Chemistry force fields commonly employ preset bonding arrangements (an exception being ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]]'' dynamics), and thus are unable to model the process of chemical bond breaking and reactions explicitly. On the other hand, many of the potentials used in physics, such as those based on the [[bond order potential|bond order formalism]] can describe several different coordinations of a system and bond breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sinnott |first1= S.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered a fully reactive hybrid between bond order potentials and chemistry force fields.

=== Pair potentials versus many-body potentials ===

The potential functions representing the non-bonded energy are formulated as a sum over interactions between the particles of the system. The simplest choice, employed in many popular [[force field (chemistry)|force fields]], is the "pair potential", in which the total potential energy can be calculated from the sum of energy contributions between pairs of atoms. An example of such a pair potential is the non-bonded [[Lennard–Jones potential]] (also termed the 6–12 potential), used for calculating van der Waals forces.

:&lt;math&gt;
U(r) = 4\varepsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Another example is the Born (ionic) model of the ionic lattice. The first term in the next equation is [[Coulomb's law]] for a pair of ions, the second term is the short-range repulsion explained by Pauli's exclusion principle and the final term is the dispersion interaction term. Usually, a simulation only includes the dipolar term, although sometimes the quadrupolar term is also included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp054304p |pmid=16375450 |author1=Cruz, F.J.A.L. |author2=Canongia Lopes, J.N. |author3=Calado, J.C.G. |author4=Minas da Piedade, M.E. |title=A Molecular Dynamics Study of the Thermodynamic Properties of Calcium Apatites. 1.

&lt;/math&gt;

In [[many body problem|many-body potentials]], the potential energy includes the effects of three or more particles interacting with each other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justo|first1=J. F.|last2=Bazant|first2=M. Z.|last3=Kaxiras|first3=E.|last4=Bulatov|first4=V. V.|last5=Yip|first5=S.|title=Interatomic potential for silicon defects and disordered phases|journal=Phys. Rev.

In many-body potentials, the potential energy cannot be found by a sum over pairs of atoms, as these interactions are calculated explicitly as a combination of higher-order terms. In the statistical view, the dependency between the variables cannot in general be expressed using only pairwise products of the degrees of freedom. For example, the [[Tersoff potential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Semi-empirical potentials ===

[[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods|Semi-empirical]] potentials make use of the matrix representation from quantum mechanics. However, the values of the matrix elements are found through empirical formulae that estimate the degree of overlap of specific atomic orbitals. The matrix is then diagonalized to determine the occupancy of the different atomic orbitals, and empirical formulae are used once again to determine the energy contributions of the orbitals.

There are a wide variety of semi-empirical potentials, termed [[Tight binding (physics)|tight-binding]] potentials, which vary according to the atoms being modeled.

=== Polarizable potentials ===

{{Main|Force field (chemistry)|l1=Force field}}
Most classical force fields implicitly include the effect of [[polarizability]], e.g., by scaling up the partial charges obtained from quantum chemical calculations. These partial charges are stationary with respect to the mass of the atom. But molecular dynamics simulations can explicitly model polarizability with the introduction of induced dipoles through different methods, such as [[Drude particle]]s or fluctuating charges. This allows for a dynamic redistribution of charge between atoms which responds to the local chemical environment.

=== Potentials in ''ab initio'' methods ===
{{Main|Quantum chemistry|List of quantum chemistry and solid state physics software}}

In classical molecular dynamics, one potential energy surface (usually the ground state) is represented in the force field. This is a consequence of the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]]. In excited states, chemical reactions or when a more accurate representation is needed, electronic behavior can be obtained from first principles by using a quantum mechanical method, such as [[density functional theory]]. This is named Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). Due to the cost of treating the electronic degrees of freedom, the computational cost of these simulations is far higher than classical molecular dynamics. This implies that AIMD is limited to smaller systems and shorter times.

''[[Ab initio]]'' [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] methods may be used to calculate the [[potential energy surface|potential energy]] of a system on the fly, as needed for conformations in a trajectory. This calculation is usually made in the close neighborhood of the [[reaction coordinate]]. Although various approximations may be used, these are based on theoretical considerations, not on empirical fitting. ''Ab initio'' calculations produce a vast amount of information that is not available from empirical methods, such as density of electronic states or other electronic properties. A significant advantage of using ''ab initio'' methods is the ability to study reactions that involve breaking or formation of covalent bonds, which correspond to multiple electronic states.

=== Hybrid QM/MM ===
{{Main|QM/MM}}
QM (quantum-mechanical) methods are very powerful. However, they are computationally expensive, while the MM (classical or molecular mechanics) methods are fast but suffer from several limits (require extensive parameterization; energy estimates obtained are not very accurate; cannot be used to simulate reactions where covalent bonds are broken/formed; and are limited in their abilities for providing accurate details regarding the chemical environment). A new class of method has emerged that combines the good points of QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations. These methods are termed mixed or hybrid quantum-mechanical and molecular mechanics methods (hybrid QM/MM).&lt;ref&gt;The methodology for such methods was introduced by Warshel and coworkers. In the recent years have been pioneered by several groups including: [[Arieh Warshel]] ([[University of Southern California]]), Weitao Yang ([[Duke University]]), Sharon Hammes-Schiffer ([[The Pennsylvania State University]]), Donald Truhlar and Jiali Gao ([[University of Minnesota]]) and Kenneth Merz ([[University of Florida]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important advantage of hybrid QM/MM method is the speed. The cost of doing classical molecular dynamics (MM) in the most straightforward case scales O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where n is the number of atoms in the system. This is mainly due to electrostatic interactions term (every particle interacts with every other particle). However, use of cutoff radius, periodic pair-list updates and more recently the variations of the particle-mesh Ewald's (PME) method has reduced this to between O(n) to O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In other words, if a system with twice as many atoms is simulated then it would take between two and four times as much computing power. On the other hand, the simplest ''ab initio'' calculations typically scale O(n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or worse (restricted [[Hartree–Fock]] calculations have been suggested to scale ~O(n&lt;sup&gt;2.7&lt;/sup&gt;)). To overcome the limit, a small part of the system is treated quantum-mechanically (typically active-site of an enzyme) and the remaining system is treated classically.

In more sophisticated implementations, QM/MM methods exist to treat both light nuclei susceptible to quantum effects (such as hydrogens) and electronic states. This allows generating hydrogen wave-functions (similar to electronic wave-functions). This methodology has been useful in investigating phenomena such as hydrogen tunneling. One example where QM/MM methods have provided new discoveries is the calculation of hydride transfer in the enzyme liver [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]. In this case, [[quantum tunneling]] is important for the hydrogen, as it determines the reaction rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Coarse-graining and reduced representations ===

At the other end of the detail scale are [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained]] and lattice models. Instead of explicitly representing every atom of the system, one uses "pseudo-atoms" to represent groups of atoms. MD simulations on very large systems may require such large computer resources that they cannot easily be studied by traditional all-atom methods. Similarly, simulations of processes on long timescales (beyond about 1 microsecond) are prohibitively expensive, because they require so many time steps. In these cases, one can sometimes tackle the problem by using reduced representations, which are also called [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kmiecik|first=Sebastian|last2=Gront|first2=Dominik|last3=Kolinski|first3=Michal|last4=Wieteska|first4=Lukasz|last5=Dawid|first5=Aleksandra Elzbieta|last6=Kolinski|first6=Andrzej|date=2016-06-22|title=Coarse-Grained Protein Models and Their Applications|journal=Chemical Reviews|doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00163|issn=0009-2665|pmid=27333362|volume=116|issue=14|pages=7898–936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aliphatic tails of lipids are represented by a few pseudo-atoms by gathering 2 to 4 methylene groups into each pseudo-atom.

The parameterization of these very [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] must be done empirically, by matching the behavior of the model to appropriate experimental data or all-atom simulations. Ideally, these parameters should account for both [[enthalpy|enthalpic]] and [[entropy|entropic]] contributions to free energy in an implicit way. When coarse-graining is done at higher levels, the accuracy of the dynamic description may be less reliable. But very [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] have been used successfully to examine a wide range of questions in structural biology, liquid crystal organization, and polymer glasses.

Examples of applications of coarse-graining:
* [[protein folding]] and [[protein structure prediction]] studies are often carried out using one, or a few, pseudo-atoms per amino acid;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[liquid crystal]] phase transitions have been examined in confined geometries and/or during flow using the [[Gay-Berne potential]], which describes anisotropic species;
* [[Polymer]] glasses during deformation have been studied using simple harmonic or [[FENE]] springs to connect spheres described by the [[Lennard-Jones potential]];
* [[Supercoiling|DNA supercoiling]] has been investigated using 1–3 pseudo-atoms per basepair, and at even lower resolution;
* Packaging of [[DNA|double-helical DNA]] into [[bacteriophage]] has been investigated with models where one pseudo-atom represents one turn (about 10 basepairs) of the double helix;
* RNA structure in the [[ribosome]] and other large systems has been modeled with one pseudo-atom per nucleotide.
* Virtual cell simulation to study the interaction of cells and various substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Development of a Virtual Cell Model to Predict Cell Response to Substrate Topography |journal=ACS Nano |date=2017 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=9084–9092 |doi=10.1021/acsnano.7b03732 |pmid=28742318 |last1=Heydari |first1=Tiam |last2=Heidari |first2=Maziar |last3=Mashinchian |first3=Omid |last4=Wojcik |first4=Michal |last5=Xu |first5=Ke |last6=Dalby |first6=Matthew John |last7=Mahmoudi |first7=Morteza |last8=Ejtehadi |first8=Mohammad Reza }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest form of coarse-graining is the ''united atom'' (sometimes called ''extended atom'') and was used in most early MD simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. For example, instead of treating all four atoms of a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; methyl group explicitly (or all three atoms of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methylene group), one represents the whole group with one pseudo-atom. It must, of course, be properly parameterized so that its van der Waals interactions with other groups have the proper distance-dependence. Similar considerations apply to the bonds, angles, and torsions in which the pseudo-atom participates. In this kind of united atom representation, one typically eliminates all explicit hydrogen atoms except those that have the capability to participate in hydrogen bonds (''polar hydrogens''). An example of this is the [[CHARMM]] 19 force-field.

The polar hydrogens are usually retained in the model, because proper treatment of hydrogen bonds requires a reasonably accurate description of the directionality and the electrostatic interactions between the donor and acceptor groups. A hydroxyl group, for example, can be both a hydrogen bond donor, and a hydrogen bond acceptor, and it would be impossible to treat this with one OH pseudo-atom. About half the atoms in a protein or nucleic acid are non-polar hydrogens, so the use of united atoms can provide a substantial savings in computer time.

== Incorporating solvent effects ==
In many simulations of a solute-solvent system the main focus is on the behavior of the solute with little interest of the solvent behavior particularly in those solvent molecules residing in regions far from the solute molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications|last=Leach|first=Dr Andrew|date=30 January 2001|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780582382107|edition= 2nd|location=Harlow|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0582382106|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solvents may influence the dynamic behavior of solutes via random collisions and by imposing a frictional drag on the motion of the solute through the solvent. The use of non-rectangular periodic boundary conditions, stochastic boundaries and solvent shells can all help reduce the number of solvent molecules required and enable a larger proportion of the computing time to be spent instead on simulating the solute. It is also possible to incorporate the effects of a solvent without needing any explicit solvent molecules present. One example of this approach is to use a [[Potential of mean force|potential mean force]] (PMF) which describes how the free energy changes as a particular coordinate is varied. The free energy change described by PMF contains the averaged effects of the solvent.

== Long-range forces ==
A long range interaction is an interaction in which the spatial interaction falls off no faster than &lt;math&gt;r^{-d}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the dimensionality of the system. Examples include charge-charge interactions between ions and dipole-dipole interactions between molecules. Modelling these forces presents quite a challenge as they are significant over a distance which may be larger than half the box length with simulations of many thousands of particles. Though one solution would be to significantly increase the size of the box length, this brute force approach is less than ideal as the simulation would become computationally very expensive. Spherically truncating the potential is also out of the question as unrealistic behaviour may be observed when the distance is close to the cut off distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Computer Simulation of Liquids|last=Allen|first=Michael P.|last2=Tildesley|first2=Dominic J.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198803201|edition= 2nd|location=|pages=216|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0198803206|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) ==

Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, or force probe simulations, apply forces to a protein in order to manipulate its structure by pulling it along desired degrees of freedom. These experiments can be used to reveal structural changes in a protein at the atomic level. SMD is often used to simulate events such as mechanical unfolding or stretching.&lt;ref name="Nienhaus"&gt;{{cite book |title=Protein-ligand interactions: methods and applications |author=Nienhaus, Gerd Ulrich |year=2005 |pages=54–56 |isbn=978-1-61737-525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two typical protocols of SMD: one in which pulling velocity is held constant, and one in which applied force is constant. Typically, part of the studied system (e.g., an atom in a protein) is restrained by a harmonic potential. Forces are then applied to specific atoms at either a constant velocity or a constant force. [[Umbrella sampling]] is used to move the system along the desired reaction coordinate by varying, for example, the forces, distances, and angles manipulated in the simulation. Through umbrella sampling, all of the system's configurations—both high-energy and low-energy—are adequately sampled. Then, each configuration's change in free energy can be calculated as the [[potential of mean force]].&lt;ref name="Leszczyński"&gt;{{cite book |title=Computational chemistry: reviews of current trends, Volume 9 |author=Leszczyński, Jerzy |year=2005 |pages=54–56 |isbn=978-981-256-742-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular method of computing PMF is through the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), which analyzes a series of umbrella sampling simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Shankar|author2=Rosenberg, John M. |author3=Bouzida, Djamal |author4=Swendsen, Robert H. |author5=Kollman, Peter A. |title=The weighted histogram analysis method for free-energy calculations on biomolecules.

{{nihilism}}
'''Moral nihilism''' (also known as '''ethical nihilism''', '''amoralism''' or the '''error theory''') is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view that nothing is morally right or wrong.

Moral nihilism is distinct from [[moral relativism]], which allows for actions wrong relative to a particular culture or individual. It is also distinct from [[expressivism]], according to which when we make moral claims, "We are not making an effort to describe the way the world is [...] we are venting our emotions, commanding others to act in certain ways, or revealing a plan of action.".&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=The Fundamentals of Ethics|last=Shafer-Landau|first=Russ|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-532086-2|location=|pages=|doi=|id=|quote=|authorlink=|coauthors=}} p.&amp;nbsp;292–293.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nihilism does not imply that we should give up using moral or ethical language; some nihilists contend that it remains a useful tool.

==Forms of nihilism==
Moral nihilists agree that all claims such as 'murder is morally wrong' are false. But different nihilistic views differ in two ways.

Some may say that such claims are neither true nor false; others say that they are all false.

Nihilists differ in the ''scope'' of their theories. Error theorists typically claim that it is only distinctively moral claims which are false; practical nihilists claim that there are no reasons for action of any kind; some nihilists extend this claim to include reasons for belief.

=== Ethical language: false versus not truth-apt ===
[[J. L. Mackie]] argues that moral assertions are only true if there are moral properties, but because there are none, all such claims are false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackie|first1=J.L.|title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong|date=1977|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=0140219579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the theory claim that moral assertions are not true because they are neither true nor false. This form of moral nihilism claims that moral beliefs and assertions ''presuppose'' the existence of moral facts that do not exist. Consider, for example, the claim that [[The present King of France is bald|the present king of France is bald]]. Some argue that this claim is neither true nor false because it presupposes that there is currently a king of France, but there is not. The claim suffers from "presupposition failure". [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]] (2001) argues for this form of moral nihilism under the name "fictionalism".

===The scope question===
Error theory is built on three principles:

# There are no moral features in this world; nothing is right or wrong.
# Therefore, no moral judgements are true; however,
# Our sincere moral judgments try, but always fail, to describe the moral features of things.

Thus, we always lapse into error when thinking in moral terms. We are trying to state the truth when we make moral judgments. But since there is no moral truth, all of our moral claims are mistaken. Hence the error. These three principles lead to the conclusion that there is no moral knowledge. Knowledge requires truth. If there is no moral truth, there can be no moral knowledge. Thus moral values are purely chimerical.&lt;ref name='ethics'/&gt;

== Arguments for nihilism==
=== Argument from queerness&lt;!--'Argument from queerness' redirects here--&gt; ===
The most prominent argument for nihilism is the '''argument from queerness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

[[J. L. Mackie]] argues that there are no [[Moral realism|objective ethical values]], by arguing that they would be queer (strange):&lt;blockquote&gt;"If there were objective values, then they would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24729622|title=Ethics: inventing right and wrong|last=Mackie|first=John|publisher=|year=1977|isbn=0140135588|location=London|pages=38|oclc=24729622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For all those who also find such entities queer (''prima facie'' implausible), there is reason to doubt the existence of objective values.

In his book ''Morality without Foundations: A Defense of Ethical Contextualism'' (1999), Mark Timmons provides a reconstruction of Mackie's views in the form of the two related [[argument]]s. These are based on the rejection of properties, facts, and relationships that do not fit within the worldview of [[philosophical naturalism]], the idea "that everything—including any particular events, facts, properties, and so on—is part of the natural physical world that science investigates" (1999, p. 12). Timmons adds, "The undeniable attraction of this outlook in [[contemporary philosophy]] no doubt stems from the rise of modern science and the belief that science is our best avenue for discovering the nature of reality" (1999, pp. 12–13).

There are several ways in which moral properties are supposedly queer:
* our ordinary moral discourse purports to refer to intrinsically prescriptive properties and facts "that would somehow motivate us or provide us with reasons for action independent of our desires and aversions"—but such properties and facts do not comport with philosophical naturalism (page 50). 
* given that objective moral properties supposedly [[Supervenience#Value properties|supervene]] upon natural properties (such as biological or psychological properties), the relation between the moral properties and the natural properties is metaphysically mysterious and does not comport with philosophical naturalism (p. 51). 
* a moral realist who countenances the existence of metaphysically queer properties, facts, and relations must also posit some special faculty by which we have knowledge of them (Timmons, p. 51). 

==== Responses and criticisms ====
[[Christine Korsgaard]] (1996) responds to Mackie by saying: 

{{cquote|Of course there are entities that meet these criteria. It's true that they are queer sorts of entities and that knowing them isn't like anything else. But that doesn't mean that they don't exist.... For it is the most familiar fact of human life that the world contains entities that can tell us what to do and make us do it. They are people, and the other animals. (''The Sources of Normativity'', p. 166)}}

Other criticisms of the argument include noting that for the very fact that such entities would have to be something fundamentally different from what we normally experience—and therefore assumably outside our sphere of experience—we cannot ''[[prima facie]]'' have reason to either doubt or affirm their existence; therefore, if one had independent grounds for supposing such things to exist (such as, for instance, a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of the contrary) then the argument from queerness cannot give one any particular reason to think otherwise. An argument along these lines has been provided by e.g. [[Akeel Bilgrami]] (2006).

=== Argument from explanatory impotence ===
[[Gilbert Harman]] argued that we do not need to posit the existence of objective values in order to explain our 'moral observations'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2725781|title=The nature of morality : an introduction to ethics|last=Harman|first=Gilbert|date=1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195021431|location=New York|pages=chapter 1|oclc=2725781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10904">'''Narcissistic defenses''' are those processes whereby the idealized aspects of the self are preserved, and its limitations denied.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw J.A. (1999). ''Sexual Aggression'', American Psychiatric Publishing, pp. 28–9.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be rigid and totalistic.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Alper, ''Self Defence in a Narcissistic World'' (2003) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They are often driven by feelings of [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

Narcissistic defenses are among the earliest [[defense mechanisms]] to emerge, and  include [[denial]], [[cognitive distortion|distortion]], and [[psychological projection|projection]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry P.D., Farmer S. (2002). ''Mental Health and Mental Illness'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]] is another defense mechanism prevalent among individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]]—seeing people and situations in black and white terms, either as all bad or all good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lubit R | year = 2002 | title = The long-term organizational impact of destructively narcissistic managers | url = | journal = Academy of Management Executive | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 127–38 | doi=10.5465/ame.2002.6640218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A narcissistic defense, with the disorder's typical over-valuation of the self, can appear at any stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Wilber|Wilber K.]], Engler J., Brown D. (1986). ''Transformations of Consciousness: Conventional and Contemplative Perspective of Development'', Boston: New Science Library, New York City, NY, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freudians==
[[File:Freud 420a.jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] did not focus specifically on narcissistic defenses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissistic-defenses Elsa Schmid-Kitsikis, "Narcissistic Defenses"]&lt;/ref&gt; but did note in ''[[On Narcissism]]'' how "even great criminals and humorists, as they are represented in literature, compel our interest by the narcissistic consistency with which they manage to keep away from their ego anything that would diminish it".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud saw narcissistic [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] as a defensive answer to object loss – denying the loss of an important object by way of a substitutive identification with it.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'', p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud also considered social narcissism as a defence mechanism, apparent when communal identifications produce irrational panics at perceived threats to 'Throne and Altar' or 'Free Markets',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; or in English over-reaction to any questioning of [[Shakespeare authorship question|the status and identity of William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;James Shapiro, ''Contested Will'' (2010) p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fenichel===
[[Otto Fenichel]] considered that "identification, performed by means of [[introjection]], is the most primitive form of relationship to objects" a primitive mechanism only used "if the ego's function of reality testing is severely damaged by a narcissistic regression."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946), pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fenichel also highlighted "eccentrics who have more or less succeeded in regaining the security of [[primary narcissism]] and who feel 'Nothing can happen to me'....[failing] to give up the archaic stages of repudiating displeasure and to turn toward reality".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacan===
[[Jacques Lacan]], following out Freud's view of the ego as the result of identifications,&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Oxford 1997), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; came to consider the ego itself as a narcissistic defence, driven by what he called "the 'narcissistic passion' ...in the coming-into-being (''devenir'') of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleinians==
[[Melanie Klein]], emphasised [[projective identification]] in narcissism, and the manic defence against becoming aware of the damage done to objects in this way.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, "Foreword", in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; For Kleinians, at the core of manic defences in narcissism stood what [[Hanna Segal]] called "a triad of feelings—control, triumph and contempt".&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosenfeld===
[[Herbert Rosenfeld]] looked at the role of [[omnipotence]], combined with projective identification, as a narcissistic means of defending against awareness of separation between ego and  object.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''The Taming of Solitude'' (2004), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object relations theory==
In the wake of Klein, [[object relations theory]], including particularly the American schools of [[Otto Kernberg]] and [[Heinz Kohut]] has explored narcissistic defences through analysis of  such mechanisms as denial,  projective identification, and extreme idealization.&lt;ref name="Schmid-Kitsikis"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissistic-defenses Schmid-Kitsikis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kernberg emphasised the role of the splitting apart introjections, and identifications of opposing qualities, as a cause of ego weakness.&lt;ref&gt;Otto F. Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut too stressed the fact in narcissism "vertical splits are between self-structures (among others)—'I am grand' and 'I am wretched'—with very little communication between them".&lt;ref&gt;Kohut, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neville Symington]] however placed greater weight on the way "a person dominated by narcissistic currents...survives through being able to sense the emotional tone of the other...wearing the cloaks of others";&lt;ref&gt;Symington, pp. 52, 88&lt;/ref&gt; while for Spotnitz the key element is that the narcissist turns feelings in upon the self in narcissistic defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernpsychoanalysis.blogspot.com/2006/09/narcissistic-defense.html James G. Fennessy, "The Narcissistic Defense"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kernberg emphasised the positive side to narcissistic defenses,&lt;ref&gt;Elsa Ronningstam, ''Disorders of Narcissism'' (1997) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; while Kohut also stressed the necessity in early life for narcissistic positions to succeed each other in orderly maturational sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (Madison 1971) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Others like Symington would maintain that "it is a mistake to split narcissism into positive and negative...we do not get positive narcissism without self-hatred".&lt;ref&gt;Symington, pp. 58, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stigmatising attitude to psychiatric illness==
Arikan found that a [[Social stigma|stigmatising]] attitude to [[psychiatric]] patients is associated with narcissistic defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arikan, K. |title=A stigmatizating attitude towards psychiatric illnesses is associated with narcissistic personality traits |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=248–50 |year=2005 |format=PDF |url=http://www.kemalarikan.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/arikan_stigma_narsisizm.pdf |pmid=16618057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naive realism.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Naïve realism argues we perceive the world directly]]

In [[philosophy of mind]], '''naïve realism''', also known as '''direct realism''', '''common sense realism''' or '''perceptual realism''', is the idea that the [[senses]] provide us with direct [[awareness]] of [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s as they ''really'' are. Objects obey the laws of [[physics]] and retain all their properties whether or not there is anyone to observe them.&lt;ref name="tok"&gt;[http://www.theoryofknowledge.info/naiverealism.html Naïve Realism], ''Theory of Knowledge.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are composed of [[matter]], occupy [[space]] and have properties, such as size, shape, texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually [[Perception|perceived]] correctly.

In contrast, some forms of [[idealism]] claim that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas, and some forms of [[skepticism]] say we cannot trust our senses. Naïve realism is known as [[Direct and indirect realism|''direct'' as against ''indirect'' or ''representational'']] realism when its arguments are developed to counter the latter position,  also known as [[epistemological dualism]];&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that our conscious experience is not of the real world but of an internal representation of the world.

==History==
For a history of direct realist theories, see ''[[Direct and indirect realism#History|Direct and indirect realism § History]]''.

==Overview==

The naïve realist theory may be characterized as the acceptance of the following five [[belief]]s:

* There exists a world of [[Materialism|material]] objects
* Some statements about these objects can be known to be true through [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]]
* These objects exist not only when they are being perceived but also when they are not perceived. The objects of perception are largely [[Objectivity (philosophy)|perception-independent]].
* These objects are also able to retain properties of the types we perceive them as having, even when they are not being perceived. Their properties are perception-independent.
* By means of our senses, we perceive the world directly, and pretty much as it is. In the main, our claims to have [[Epistemology|knowledge]] of it are justified."&lt;ref name=uor&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/NaiveRealism.htm Naïve Realism], [[University of Reading]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[visual perception]] in [[psychology]], the leading direct realist theorist was [[J. J. Gibson]]. Other psychologists were heavily influenced by this approach, including William Mace, Claire Michaels,&lt;ref&gt;http://ione.psy.uconn.edu:16080/~corr/Pages/MichaelsProfile.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Reed,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/Cognitive/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195073010&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Shaw, and Michael Turvey. More recently, [[Carol Fowler]] has promoted a direct realist approach to [[speech perception]].

Among [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[analytic philosopher]]s who defended direct realism one might refer to, for example, [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445–518.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, &lt;!--November--&gt;1994, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen Strawson, [https://vimeo.com/91346935 "Real Direct Realism"], a lecture recorded 2014 at Marc Sanders Foundation, Vimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle, for instance, addresses the popular but perhaps mistaken assumption that ''we can only directly perceive our own subjective experiences, but never objects and states of affairs in the world themselves''. According to Searle, it has influenced many thinkers to reject direct realism. But Searle contends that the rejection of direct realism is based on a bad argument: the [[Argument from illusion]], which in turn relies on vague assumptions on the nature or existence of "[[sense data]]". Various sense data theories were deconstructed in 1962 by the British philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] in a book titled ''Sense and Sensibilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''Sense and Sensibilia'', Oxford: Clarendon. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk of sense data has been replaced by talk of representational perception in a broader sense, and scientific realists typically assume representational perception. But the assumption is philosophical, and arguably little prevents scientific realists from assuming direct perception, as in direct or "naïve" realism. In a blog-post on ''"Naive realism and color realism"'' Putnam&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam's blog 'Sardonic comment' at http://putnamphil.blogspot.se/2015/05/naive-realism-and-color-realism-in-1976.html. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; sums up with the following words:  &lt;br /&gt;
''"... Being an apple is not a natural kind in physics, but it is in biology, recall. Being complex and of no interest to fundamental physics isn't a failure to be "real".  I think green is as real as applehood.".''

[[Simon Blackburn]] has argued that whatever positions they may take in books, articles or lectures, naive realism is the view of "philosophers when they are off-duty."&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon (2008). Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (Second edition, revised), Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199541430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naïve and scientific realism or direct and indirect realism==
It is not uncommon to think of naïve realism as distinct from [[scientific realism]], which states that the [[universe]] contains just those properties that feature in a [[scientific]] description of it, not properties like colour ''per se'' but merely objects that reflect certain wavelengths owing to their microscopic surface texture. This lack of [[supervenience]] of experience on the physical world has influenced many thinkers to reject naïve realism as a physical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, Claire &amp; Carello, Claudia. (1981). ''[http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/~psy254/MC.pdf Direct Perception]''. Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

One should add, however, that naïve realism does not claim that reality is only what we see, hear, etc. Likewise, scientific realism does not claim that reality is only what can be described by fundamental physics. It follows that the relevant distinction to make is not between naïve and scientific realism but between ''[[direct and indirect realism]]''.

The direct realist claims that the experience of a sunset, for instance, is the real sunset that we directly experience. The indirect realist claims that our relation to reality is indirect, so the experience of a sunset is a subjective copy of what really is radiation as described by physics. But the direct realist does not deny that the sunset is radiation; the experience has a hierarchical structure,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, 'Seeing Things as They Are; A Theory of Perception', Oxford University Press. 2015. p.111-114&lt;/ref&gt; and the radiation is part of what amounts to the direct experience.

An example of a scientific realist is [[John Locke]], who held the world only contains the [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|primary qualities]] that feature in a corpuscularian scientific account of the world (see [[corpuscular theory]]), and that other properties were entirely [[Subjectivity|subjective]], depending for their [[existence]] upon some perceiver who can observe the objects."&lt;ref name=tok/&gt;

The modern philosopher of science Howard Sankey argues for a form of scientific realism which has commonsense realism as one of its foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Realism and quantum physics===

{{Main|Principle of locality}}

Realism in physics refers to the fact that physical systems must have definite properties when measured or observed. [[Physics]] until the 19th century was implicitly and sometimes explicitly based on philosophical realism.

Scientific realism in classical physics has remained compatible with the naïve realism of everyday thinking on the whole, but there is no consistent way to visualize the world underlying quantum theory in terms of ideas of the everyday world. "The general conclusion is that in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] naïve realism, although necessary at the level of observations, fails at the microscopic level."&lt;ref&gt;Gomatam, Ravi. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1536 Physics and Commonsense - Reassessing the connection in the light of the quantum theory], ''arXiv.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments such as the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] and quantum phenomena such as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] lead quantum physicists to conclude that "[w]e have no satisfactory reason for ascribing objective existence to physical quantities as distinguished from the numbers obtained when we make the measurements which we correlate with them. There is no real reason for supposing that a particle has at every moment a definite, but unknown, position which may be revealed by a measurement of the right kind .... On the contrary, we get into a maze of contradiction as soon as we inject into quantum mechanics such concepts as carried over from the language and philosophy of our ancestors .... It would be more exact if we spoke of 'making measurements' of this, that, or the other type instead of saying that we measure this, that, or the other 'physical quantity'."&lt;ref&gt;Kemble E. C. in Peres Asher, (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=-yLkUyCsb7cC Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods], Springer 1993 p. 17 {{ISBN|978-0-7923-2549-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer possible to adhere to both the [[principle of locality]] (that distant objects cannot affect local objects), and counterfactual definiteness, a form of ontological realism implicit in classical physics. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics hold that a system lacks an actualized property until it is measured, which implies that quantum systems exhibit a non-local behavior. [[Bell's theorem]] proved that every [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] must either violate [[Principle of locality|locality]] or [[counterfactual definiteness]]. This claim has given rise to a contentious debate of the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]]. Although locality and 'realism,' in the sense of counterfactual definiteness, are jointly false, it is possible to retain one of them. The majority of working physicists discard counterfactual definiteness in favor of locality, since non-locality is held to be contrary to relativity. The implications of this stance are rarely discussed outside of the microscopic domain but the [[thought experiment]] of [[Schrödinger's cat]] illustrates the difficulties presented. As quantum mechanics is applied to larger and larger objects, even a one-ton bar, proposed to detect gravity waves, must be analysed quantum mechanically, while in [[cosmology]] a wave function for the whole universe is written to study the [[Big Bang]]. It is difficult to accept the quantum world as somehow not physically real, so "Quantum mechanics forces us to abandon naïve realism",&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum, Bruce &amp; Kuttner, Fred. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hKrvv35-gcMC Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness], Oxford University Press US. p. 112. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517559-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though it can also be argued that the counterfactual definiteness 'realism' of physics is a much more specific notion than general [[philosophical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;"We examine the prevalent use of the phrase “local realism” in the context of Bell’s Theorem and associated experiments, with a focus on the
question: what exactly is the ‘realism’ in ‘local realism’ supposed to
mean?". [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0607057 Norsen, T.''Against 'Realism' '']&lt;/ref&gt;

"'[W]e have to give up the idea of realism to a far greater extent than most physicists believe today.' ([[Anton Zeilinger]]) .... By realism, he means the idea that objects have specific features and properties — that a ball is red, that a book contains the works of Shakespeare, or that an electron has a particular spin ... for objects governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, like photons and electrons, it may make no sense to think of them as having well-defined characteristics. Instead, what we see may depend on how we look."&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Philip. (2007). [http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070416/full/070416-9.html Physicists bid farewell to reality? Quantum mechanics just got even stranger], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', April 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual reality and realism==
"Virtual realism"&lt;ref&gt;Heim, Michael. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4nyKP2-KlXAC Virtual Realism], Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513874-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the above theories.

In the research paper ''The reality of virtual reality'' it is proposed that, "virtuality is itself a bona fide mode of reality, and that 'virtual reality' must be understood as 'things, agents and events that exist in cyberspace'. These proposals resolve the incoherences found in the ordinary uses of these terms... '[[virtual reality]]', though based on recent information technology, does not refer to mere technological equipment or purely mental entities, or to some fake environment as opposed to the real world, but that it is an [[Ontology|ontological]] mode of existence which leads to an expansion of our ordinary world."&lt;ref&gt;(Requires login) Yoh, Myeung-Sook. (2001). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/7657/20918/00969726.pdf?arnumber=969726 The reality of virtual reality], Virtual Systems and Multimedia. pp. 666-674.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The emergence of teleoperation and virtual environments has greatly increased interest in "synthetic experience", a mode of experience made possible by both these newer technologies and earlier ones, such as telecommunication and sensory prosthetics... understanding synthetic experience must begin by recognizing the fallacy of naïve realism and with the recognition that the phenomenology of synthetic experience is continuous with that of ordinary experience."&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Jack. (1993). [http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/~loomis/Loomis%20presence%20IEEE%2093.pdf Understanding Synthetic Experience Must Begin with the Analysis of Ordinary Perceptual Experience], ''IEEE 1993 Symposium on Research Frontiers in Virtual Reality'', 54-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged necessity to recognize a "fallacy of naïve realism" seems, however, unwarranted. One should not be misled by the word "naïve", for a naïve realist normally understands what a picture is: that the depicted face on a photograph, for instance, is not the real face, and that the things seen on a computer-screen are symbols or electronic depictions, and so on. A majority of the population arguably subscribes to naïve common sense notions of reality, without a recognizable loss in capacity to interact in cyberspace.

'''Paired opposites''' are an ancient, pre-Socratic method of establishing [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis and synthesis]] in terms of a standard for what is right and proper in [[natural philosophy]].

== Paired opposites in the proportions of units ==

[[Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar]] ranges and [[coordinate system]]s are paired opposites within [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Incorporating [[dimensions]] of positive and negative numbers and [[exponent]]s, or expanding x, y and z coordinates, by adding a fourth dimension of time allows a resolution of position relative to the standard of the [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] which is often taken as 0,0,0,0 with additional dimensions added as referential scales are expanded from space and time to mass and energy.

Ancient systems frequently scaled their degree of opposition by rate of increase or rate of decrease. [[Linear]] increase was enhanced by doubling systems. An [[acceleration]] in the rate of increase or decrease could be analyzed arithmetrically, geometrically, or through a wide range of other numerical and physical analysis. [[Arithmetic series|Arithmetic]] and [[geometric series]], and other methods of rating proportionate expansion or contraction could be thought of as [[wikt:convergent|convergent]] or [[divergence (statistics)|divergent]] toward a position.

Though unit quantities were first defined by [[spatial dimensions]], and then expanded by adding coordinates of time, the weight or mass a given spatial dimension could contain was also considered and even in antiquity, conditions under which the standard would be established such as at a given temperature, distance from sea level, or density were added.

Rates of change over time were then considered as either indexes of production or depletion

== Paired opposites as rhetorical device==

Paired opposites are used as poetic diction meaning "everything".  Common phrases incorporated paired opposites in English include "all creatures great and small," "working for the man every night and day," "more things in heaven and Earth" "searching high and low" "in sickness and in health".   In Greek literature, [[Homer]] uses the device when he lets [[Telemachus]] say, "I know all things, the good and the evil" (Od.20:309-10).&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Cyrus H.|last2=Rendsburg |first2=Gary A. |title=The Bible and the ancient Near East |year=1997 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. |location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-31689-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWmBUBre55QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Bible+and+the+Ancient+Near+East+gordon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UnLGWjWlY_&amp;sig=I0IV9A6pkpZjRWXR5rTCqfetph8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=as4xUNLHAsjNiwKCp4CYBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20merism&amp;f=false |edition=4th |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same phrase is used in Hebrew in text of Genesis, referring to the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Orlinsky]]'s notes to the NJPS Torah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space and Time in the Religious Life of the Near East |last=Wyatt |first=Nicolas |page=244 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-567-04942-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjugate Variables==

In [[quantum mechanics]], as well as some fields of mathematics, [[conjugate variables]] are a form of paired opposites, in which knowledge of one precludes knowledge of the other.  A standard example is the relation between position (x) and momentum (p), which can be expressed in terms of the [[uncertainty principle]] as &lt;math&gt; \Delta p \Delta x \geq \hbar&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36973">In [[philosophy]], '''physicalism''' is the [[metaphysical]] thesis that "everything is physical", that there is "nothing over and above" the physical,&lt;ref&gt;See Smart, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; or that everything [[supervenience|supervenes]] on the physical.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Physicalism is a form of ontological [[monism]]—a "one [[Substance theory|substance]]" view of the nature of reality as opposed to a "two-substance" ([[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]) or "many-substance" ([[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]) view. Both the definition of "physical" and the meaning of physicalism have been debated.

Physicalism is closely related to [[materialism]]. Physicalism grew out of materialism with advancements of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of physics describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law). Common arguments against physicalism include both the [[philosophical zombie]] argument&lt;ref name="Chalmers, D. 1996" /&gt; and the multiple observers argument,&lt;ref name="Zuboff1990" /&gt; that the existence of a physical being may imply zero or more distinct conscious entities.

== Definition of physicalism ==
The word "physicalism" was introduced into philosophy in the 1930s by [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/ Physicalism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "physical" in physicalism is a philosophical concept and can be distinguished from alternative definitions found in the literature (e.g. [[Karl Popper]] defined a physical proposition to be one which can at least in theory be denied by observation&lt;ref name="Popper2002" /&gt;). A "physical property", in this context, may be a metaphysical or logical combination of properties which are  physical in the ordinary sense. It is common to express the notion of "metaphysical or logical combination of properties" using the notion of [[supervenience]]: A property ''A'' is said to supervene on a property ''B'' if any change in ''A'' necessarily implies a change in ''B''.&lt;ref&gt;See Bennett and McLaughlin, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since any change in a combination of properties must consist of a change in at least one component property, we see that the combination does indeed supervene on the individual properties. The point of this extension is that physicalists usually suppose the existence of various abstract concepts which are non-physical in the ordinary sense of the word; so physicalism cannot be defined in a way that denies the existence of these abstractions. Also, physicalism defined in terms of supervenience does not entail that all properties in the actual world are [[type physicalism|type identical]] to physical properties. It is, therefore, compatible with [[multiple realizability]].&lt;ref&gt;See Putnam, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

From the notion of supervenience, we see that, assuming that mental, social, and biological properties supervene on physical properties, it follows that two hypothetical worlds cannot be identical in their physical properties but differ in their mental, social or biological properties.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt;

Two common approaches to defining "physicalism" are the theory-based and object-based approaches. The theory-based conception of physicalism proposes that "a property is physical if and only if it either is the sort of property that physical theory tells us about or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property that physical theory tells us about".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Likewise, the object-based conception claims that "a property is physical if and only if: it either is the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents".

Physicalists have traditionally opted for a "theory-based" characterization of the physical either in terms of current physics,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Smart, 1978; Lewis, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; or a future (ideal) physics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Poland, 1994; Chalmers, 1996; Wilson, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These two theory-based conceptions of the physical represent both horns of [[Hempel's dilemma]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Melnyk should apparently be credited with having introduced this name for Hempel's argument. See Melnyk, 1997, p.624&lt;/ref&gt; (named after the late philosopher of science and logical empiricist [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]): an argument against theory-based understandings of the physical. Very roughly, Hempel's dilemma is that if we define the physical by reference to current physics, then physicalism is very likely to be false, as it is very likely (by pessimistic meta-induction&lt;ref&gt;see Vincente, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) that much of current physics is false. But if we instead define the physical in terms of a future (ideal) or completed physics, then physicalism is hopelessly vague or indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;See Hempel, 1969, pp.180-183; Hempel, 1980, pp.194-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the force of Hempel's dilemma against theory-based conceptions of the physical remains contested,&lt;ref&gt;For a recent defence of the first horn see Melnyk, 1997. For a defence of the second, see Wilson, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; alternative "non-theory-based" conceptions of the physical have also been proposed. [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1998) for example, has argued in favour of the aforementioned "object-based" conception of the physical.&lt;ref&gt;See Jackson, 1998, p.7; Lycan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An objection to this proposal, which Jackson himself noted in 1998, is that if it turns out that [[panpsychism]] or [[panprotopsychism]] is true, then such a non-materialist understanding of the physical gives the counterintuitive result that physicalism is, nevertheless, also true since such properties will figure in a complete account of paradigmatic examples of the physical.

David Papineau&lt;ref&gt;See Papineau, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Montero&lt;ref&gt;See Montero, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; have advanced and subsequently defended&lt;ref&gt;See Papineau and Montero, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; a "via negativa" characterization of the physical. The gist of the via negativa strategy is to understand the physical in terms of what it is not: the mental. In other words, the via negativa strategy understands the physical as "the non-mental". An objection to the via negativa conception of the physical is that (like the object-based conception) it doesn't have the resources to distinguish [[neutral monism]] (or panprotopsychism) from physicalism.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Judisch, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervenience-based definitions of physicalism ===

Adopting a supervenience-based account of the physical, the definition of physicalism as "all properties are physical" can be unravelled to:

1) Physicalism is [[Truth|true]] at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is also a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"&gt;See Jackson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied to the actual world (our world), statement 1 above is the claim that physicalism is true at the actual world if and only if at ''every possible world'' in which the physical properties and laws of the actual  world are instantiated, the non-physical (in the ordinary sense of the word) properties of the actual world are instantiated as well. To borrow a metaphor from [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), the truth of physicalism at the actual world entails that once God has instantiated or "fixed" the physical properties and laws of our world, then God's work is done; the rest comes "automatically".

Unfortunately, statement 1 fails to capture even a necessary condition for physicalism to be true at a world ''w''. To see this, imagine a world in which there are ''only'' physical properties—if physicalism is true at any world it is true at this one. But one can conceive physical duplicates of such a world that are ''not'' also duplicates simpliciter of it: worlds that have the same physical properties as our imagined one, but with some additional property or properties. A world might contain "[[epiphenomenal ectoplasm]]", some additional pure experience that does not interact with the physical components of the world and is not necessitated by them (does not supervene on them).&lt;ref name="Lewis1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horgan1982" /&gt; To handle the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, statement 1 can be modified to include a "that's-all" or "totality" clause&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; or be restricted to "positive" properties.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting the former suggestion here, we can reformulate statement 1 as follows:

2) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a ''minimal'' physical duplicate of ''w'' is a duplicate of ''w simpliciter''.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt;

Applied in the same way, statement 2 is the claim that physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' (without any further changes), is duplicate of ''w'' without qualification. This allows a world in which there are only physical properties to be counted as one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are ''not'' "minimal" physical duplicates of such a world, nor are they minimal physical duplicates of worlds that contain some non-physical properties that are metaphysically necessitated by the physical.&lt;ref&gt;Where "metaphysical necessitation" here simply means that if "B" metaphysically necessitates "A" then any world in which B is instantiated is a world in which A is instantiated--a consequence of the metaphysical supervenience of A upon B. See Kripke, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

But while statement 2 overcomes the problem of worlds at which there is some extra stuff (sometimes referred to as the "epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem"&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt;) it faces a different challenge: the so-called "blockers problem".&lt;ref&gt;See Hawthorne, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a world where the relation between the physical and non-physical properties at this world (call the world ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') is slightly weaker than metaphysical necessitation, such that a certain kind of non-physical intervener—"a blocker"—could, were it to exist at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,'' prevent the non-physical properties in ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' from being instantiated by the instantiation of the physical properties at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.'' Since statement 2 rules out worlds which are physical duplicates of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' that also contain non-physical interveners by virtue of the minimality, or that's-all clause, statement 2 gives the (allegedly) incorrect result that physicalism is true at ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.'' One response to this problem is to abandon statement 2 in favour of the alternative possibility mentioned earlier in which supervenience-based formulations of physicalism are restricted to what [[David Chalmers]] (1996) calls "positive properties". A positive property is one that "...if instantiated in a world W, is also instantiated by the corresponding individual in all worlds that contain W as a proper part."&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this suggestion, we can then formulate physicalism as follows:

3) Physicalism is true at a possible world ''w'' if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of ''w'' is a positive duplicate of ''w''.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, 1996; Stoljar, 2009, section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the face of it, statement 3 seems able to handle both the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem and the blockers problem. With regard to the former, statement 3 gives the correct result that a purely physical world is one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are positive duplicates of a purely physical world. With regard to the latter, statement 3 appears to have the consequence that worlds in which there are blockers are worlds where positive non-physical properties of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be absent, hence ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' will not be counted as a world at which physicalim is true.&lt;ref&gt;see Hawthorne, 2002, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Stoljar]] (2010) objects to this response to the blockers problem on the basis that since the non-physical properties of ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' aren't instantiated at a world in which there is a blocker, they are not positive properties in Chalmers' (1996) sense, and so statement 3 will count ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' as a world at which physicalism is true after all.&lt;ref&gt;See Stoljar, 2010, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

A further problem for supervenience-based formulations of physicalism is the so-called "necessary beings problem".&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt; A necessary being in this context is a non-physical being that exists in all possible worlds (for example what theists refer to as [[God]]). A necessary being is compatible with all the definitions provided, because it is supervenient on everything; yet it is usually taken to contradict the notion that everything is physical. So any supervenience-based formulation of physicalism will at best state a [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] condition for the truth of physicalism.&lt;ref name="See Jackson, 1998"/&gt;

Additional objections have been raised to the above definitions provided for supervenience physicalism: one could imagine an alternate world that differs only by the presence of a single ammonium molecule (or physical property), and yet based on statement 1, such a world might be completely different in terms of its distribution of mental properties.&lt;ref name="Kim1993" /&gt; Furthermore, there are differences expressed concerning the modal status of physicalism; whether it is a necessary truth, or is only true in a world which conforms to certain conditions (i.e. those of physicalism).&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt;

=== Realisation physicalism ===

Closely related to supervenience physicalism, is realisation physicalism, the thesis that every instantiated property is either physical or realised by a physical property.&lt;ref name="Melnyk1997" /&gt;

=== Token physicalism ===
{{See also|Anomalous monism}}

Token physicalism is the proposition that "for every actual particular (object, event or process) x, there is some physical particular y such that x = y". It is intended to capture the idea of "physical mechanisms".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Token physicalism is compatible with [[property dualism]], in which all substances are "physical", but physical objects may have mental properties as well as physical properties. Token physicalism is not however equivalent to supervenience physicalism. Firstly, token physicalism does not imply supervenience physicalism because the former does not rule out the possibility of non-supervenient properties (provided that they are associated only with physical particulars). Secondarily, supervenience physicalism does not imply token physicalism, for the former allows supervenient objects (such as a "nation", or "soul") that are not equal to any physical object.

== Reductionism and emergentism ==

=== Reductionism ===

There are multiple versions of reductionism.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; In the context of physicalism, the reductions referred to are of a "linguistic" nature, allowing discussions of, say, mental phenomena to be translated into discussions of physics. In one formulation, every concept is analysed in terms of a physical concept. One counter-argument to this supposes there may be an additional class of expressions which is non-physical but which increases the expressive power of a theory.&lt;ref name="Smart1959" /&gt; Another version of reductionism is based on the requirement that one theory (mental or physical) be logically derivable from a second.&lt;ref name="Nagel1961" /&gt;

The combination of reductionism and physicalism is usually called reductive physicalism in the philosophy of mind. The opposite view is non-reductive physicalism. Reductive physicalism is the view that mental states are both nothing over and above physical states and reducible to physical states. One version of reductive physicalism is [[type physicalism]] or mind-body identity theory. Type physicalism asserts that "for every actually instantiated property F, there is some physical property G such that F=G".&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Unlike token physicalism, type physicalism entails supervenience physicalism.

A common argument against reductive physicalism is [[multiple realizability]], the possibility that a psychological process (say) could be instantiated by many different neurological processes (even non-neurological processes, in the case of machine or alien intelligence).&lt;ref name="Kim1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fodor1974" /&gt; For in this case, the neurological terms translating a psychological term must be disjunctions over the possible instantiations, and it is argued that no physical law can use these disjunctions as terms.&lt;ref name="Fodor1974" /&gt; Type physicalism was the original target of the multiple realizability argument.&lt;ref&gt;Bickle, J. (2006). Multiple realizability. In Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy. Available at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/.

=== Emergentism ===
{{main article|Emergentism}}

There are two versions of emergentism, the strong version and the weak version. Supervenience physicalism has been seen as a strong version of emergentism, in which the subject's psychological experience is considered genuinely novel.&lt;ref name="DStoljar" /&gt; Non-reductive physicalism, on the other side, is a weak version of emergentism because it does not need that the subject's psychological experience be novel. The strong version of emergentism is incompatible with physicalism. Since there are novel mental states, mental states are not nothing over and above physical states. However, the weak version of emergentism is compatible with physicalism. 

We can see that emergentism is actually a very broad view. Some forms of emergentism appear either incompatible with physicalism or equivalent to it (e.g. posteriori physicalism),&lt;ref name="Byrne1993" /&gt; others appear to merge both [[dualism (philosophy)|dualism]] and supervenience. Emergentism compatible with dualism claims that mental states and physical states are metaphysically distinct while maintaining the supervenience of mental states on physical states. This proposition however contradicts supervenience physicalism, which asserts a denial of dualism.

== A priori versus a posteriori physicalism ==
Physicalists hold that physicalism is true. A natural question for physicalists, then, is whether the truth of physicalism is deducible [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] from the nature of the physical world (i.e., the inference is justified independently of experience, even though the nature of the physical world can itself only be determined through experience) or can only be deduced [[A priori knowledge|a posteriori]] (i.e., the justification of the inference itself is dependent upon experience). So-called "a priori physicalists" hold that from knowledge of the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] of all physical truths, a totality or that's-all truth (to rule out non-physical epiphenomena, and enforce the closure of the physical world), and some primitive [[indexical]] truths such as "I am A" and "now is B", the truth of physicalism is knowable a priori.&lt;ref name="See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001"&gt;See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Let "P" stand for the conjunction of all physical truths and laws, "T" for a that's-all truth, "I" for the indexical "centering" truths, and "N" for any [presumably non-physical] truth at the actual world. We can then, using the [[material conditional]] "→", represent a priori physicalism as the thesis that PTI → N is knowable a priori.&lt;ref name="See Chalmers and Jackson, 2001"/&gt; An important wrinkle here is that the [[concept]]s in N must be possessed non-deferentially in order for PTI → N to be knowable a priori. The suggestion, then, is that possession of the concepts in the [[consequent]], plus the empirical information in the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is sufficient for the consequent to be knowable a priori.

An "a posteriori physicalist", on the other hand, will reject the claim that PTI → N is knowable a priori. Rather, they would hold that the inference from PTI to N is justified by metaphysical considerations that in turn can be derived from experience. So the claim then is that "PTI and not N" is metaphysically impossible.

One commonly issued challenge to a priori physicalism and to physicalism in general is the "conceivability argument", or [[zombie argument]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At a rough approximation, the conceivability argument runs as follows:

'''P1''') PTI and not Q (where "Q" stands for the conjunction of all truths about consciousness, or some "generic" truth about someone being "phenomenally" conscious [i.e., there is "something it is like"&lt;ref&gt;See Nagel, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; to be a person x] ) is conceivable (i.e., it is not knowable a priori that PTI and not Q is false).

'''P2''') If PTI and not Q is conceivable, then PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible.

'''P3''') If PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible then physicalism is false.

'''C''') Physicalism is false.&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Here proposition '''P3''' is a direct application of the supervenience of consciousness, and hence of any supervenience-based version of physicalism: If PTI and not Q is possible, there is some [[possible world]] where it is true. This world differs from [the relevant indexing on] our world, where PTIQ is true. But the other world is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, because PT is true there. So there is a possible world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, but not a full duplicate; this contradicts the definition of physicalism that we saw above.

Since a priori physicalists hold that PTI → N is a priori, they are committed to denying P1) of the conceivability argument. The a priori physicalist, then, must argue that PTI and not Q, on ideal rational reflection, is incoherent or [[contradictory]].&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of the different arguments for this conclusion (as well as responses to each), see Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A posteriori physicalists, on the other hand, generally accept P1) but deny P2)--the move from "conceivability to metaphysical possibility". Some a posteriori physicalists think that unlike the possession of most, if not all other [[empirical]] concepts, the possession of consciousness has the special property that the presence of PTI and the absence of consciousness will be conceivable—even though, according to them, it is knowable a posteriori that PTI and not Q is not metaphysically possible. These a posteriori physicalists endorse some version of what Daniel Stoljar (2005) has called "the [[phenomenal concept strategy]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Stoljar, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking, the phenomenal concept strategy is a label for those a posteriori physicalists who attempt to show that it is only the ''concept'' of consciousness—not the ''property''—that is in some way "special" or [[sui generis]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Stoljar, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other a posteriori physicalists&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Tye, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; eschew the phenomenal concept strategy, and argue that even ordinary macroscopic truths such as "water covers 60% of the earth's surface" are not knowable a priori from PTI and a non-deferential grasp of the concepts "water" and "earth" ''et cetera''. If this is correct, then we should (arguably) conclude that conceivability does not entail metaphysical possibility, and P2) of the conceivability argument against physicalism is false.&lt;ref&gt;For critical discussion, see Chalmers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strawsonian physicalism ===
[[Galen Strawson]]'s ''realistic physicalism'' (or "realistic monism") entails [[panpsychism]] – or at least [[micropsychism]].&lt;ref name="Strawson2006"&gt;{{cite book

I simply fix the reference of the term 'physical' by pointing at certain items and invoking the notion of a general kind of stuff. It is true that there is a sense in which this makes my use of the term vacuous, for, relative to our universe, 'physical stuff' is now equivalent to 'real and concrete stuff', and cannot be anything to do with the term 'physical' that is used to mark out a position in what is usually taken to be a substantive debate about the ultimate nature of concrete reality (physicalism vs immaterialism vs dualism vs pluralism vs…). But that is fine by me. If it's back to Carnap, so be it.

{{quote|Real physicalists must accept that at least some ultimates are intrinsically experience-involving.  They must at least embrace ''micropsychism''. Given that everything concrete is physical, and that everything physical is constituted out of physical ultimates, and that experience is part of concrete reality, it seems the only reasonable position, more than just an 'inference to the best explanation'... Micropsychism is not yet panpsychism, for as things stand realistic physicalists can conjecture that only some types of ultimates are intrinsically experiential.  But they must allow that panpsychism may be true, and the big step has already been taken with micropsychism, the admission that at least some ultimates must be experiential. 'And were the inmost essence of things laid open to us' I think that the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are experiential would look like the idea that some but not all physical ultimates are spatio-temporal (on the assumption that spacetime is indeed a fundamental feature of reality). I would bet a lot against there being such radical heterogeneity at the very bottom of things. In fact (to disagree with my earlier self) it is hard to see why this view would not count as a form of dualism... So now I can say that physicalism, i.e. real physicalism, entails panexperientialism or panpsychism. All physical stuff is energy, in one form or another, and all energy, I trow, is an experience-involving phenomenon. This sounded crazy to me for a long time, but I am quite used to it, now that I know that there is no alternative short of 'substance dualism'... Real physicalism, realistic physicalism, entails panpsychism, and whatever problems are raised by this fact are problems a real physicalist must face.&lt;ref name="Strawson2006"/&gt;|[[Galen Strawson]]|Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?}}

Phytoremediation is a cost-effective plant-based approach of remediation that takes advantage of the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissues. It refers to the natural ability of certain plants called [[hyperaccumulator]]s to bioaccumulate, degrade, or render harmless contaminants in soils, water, or air. Toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants are the major targets for phytoremediation. Knowledge of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of phytoremediation began to emerge in recent years together with biological and engineering strategies designed to optimize and improve phytoremediation. In addition, several field trials confirmed the feasibility of using plants for [[environmental cleanup]].&lt;ref name=Salt1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salt DE, Smith RD, Raskin I |title=PHYTOREMEDIATION |journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology |volume=49 |issue= |pages=643–668 |year=1998 |pmid=15012249 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.49.1.643 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Phytoremediation may be applied wherever the [[soil]] or static water environment has become polluted or is suffering ongoing chronic [[pollution]]. Examples where phytoremediation has been used successfully include the restoration of abandoned metal mine workings, and sites where [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s have been dumped during manufacture and mitigation of ongoing coal mine discharges reducing the impact of contaminants in soils, water, or air.

Many plants such as [[mustard plant]]s, [[Thlaspi caerulescens|alpine pennycress]], [[hemp]], and [[pigweed]] have proven to be successful at hyperaccumulating contaminants at [[toxic waste]] sites.

Not all plants are able to accumulate heavy metals or organics pollutants due to differences the physiology of the plant.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even cultivars within the same species have varying abilities to accumulate pollutants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Over the past 20 years, this technology has become increasingly popular and has been employed at sites with soils contaminated with lead, uranium, and arsenic.  While it has the advantage that environmental concerns may be treated in situ, one major disadvantage of phytoremediation is that it requires a long-term commitment, as the process is dependent on a plant's ability to grow and thrive in an environment that is not ideal for normal plant growth.

==Advantages and limitations==
*'''Advantages''':
** the cost of the phytoremediation is lower than that of traditional processes both ''in situ'' and ''ex situ''
** the plants can be easily monitored
** the possibility of the recovery and re-use of valuable metals (by companies specializing in "phyto mining")
** it is potentially the least harmful method because it uses naturally occurring organisms and preserves the environment in a more natural state.
** it preserves the topsoil, maintaining the fertility of the soil&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Hazrat|last2=Khan|first2=Ezzat|last3=Sajad|first3=Muhammad Anwar|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metals—Concepts and applications|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.075|journal=Chemosphere|volume=91|issue=7|pages=869–881|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==

=== Heavy metal remediation with ''Ficus microcarpa Field Scale Experiment'' ===
Phytoremediation of efficiency of metal by ''Ficus microcarpa'' was evaluated through a real scale experiment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Jie|last2=Cai|first2=Limei|last3=Qi|first3=Shihua|last4=Wu|first4=Jian|last5=Gu|first5=Xiaowen Sophie|date=February 2018|title=Heavy metal remediation with  Ficus microcarpa  through transplantation and its environmental risks through field scale experiment|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.024|journal=Chemosphere|volume=193|pages=244–250|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.11.024|issn=0045-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root biomass production of the species varied significantly from 3.68 to 5.43 g because of the spatial heterogeneity of different metals. According to the study it could take 4-93 years to purify excess Cd on the experimental site. Mercury was unable to be premeditated by ''F. microcarpa''. The species of plant was moved to unpolluted soil. When transplanted Cd and CU were transferred to the rhizosphere soil. Pb and Hg were not released.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Kaltag School oil seep (Alaska) ===
The [[Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v. EPA|Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation]] (ADEC) has been monitoring fuel oil spills at the Kaltag School in [[Kaltag, Alaska|Kaltag]], [[Alaska]], since 1991. The community has been working with ADEC to use a phytoremediation plan drafted by scientists at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. The ADEC continues to keep the public informed of the progress on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dec.alaska.gov/Applications/SPAR/PublicMVC/CSP/SiteReport/289|title=Division of Spill Prevention and Response|last=Alaska|first=Division of Spill Prevention and Response, Department of Environmental Conservation, State of|website=dec.alaska.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==
[[File:Phytoremediation Process - svg.svg|350px|thumb|Phytoremediation process]]
A range of processes mediated by plants or algae are useful in treating environmental problems:
=== Phytoextraction ===
{{See also|Phytoextraction process}}
Phytoextraction (or ''phytoaccumulation'' or ''phytosequestration'') uses plants or algae to remove contaminants from soil or water into harvestable plant biomass. The roots take up substances from the soil or water and concentrate it above ground in the plant biomass&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Organisms that can uptake extremely high amounts of contaminants from the soil are called '''[[hyperaccumulators]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rascio|first=Nicoletta|last2=Navari-Izzo|first2=Flavia|title=Heavy metal hyperaccumulating plants: How and why do they do it? And what makes them so interesting?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168945210002402|journal=Plant Science|volume=180|issue=2|pages=169–181|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoextraction can also be performed by plants (e.g.[[Populus]] and [[Salix]]) that take up lower levels of pollutants, but due to their high growth rate and biomass production, may remove a considerable amount of contaminants from the soil.&lt;ref&gt; Guidi Nissim W., Palm E., Mancuso S., Azzarello E. (2018) "Trace element phytoextraction from contaminated soil: a case study under Mediterranean climate". Environmental Science and Pollution Research https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1197-x &lt;/ref&gt; Phytoextraction has been growing rapidly in popularity worldwide for the last twenty years or so. Typically, phytoextraction is used for heavy metals or other inorganics.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilon-Smits|first=Elizabeth|date=2005-04-29|title=Phytoremediation|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144214|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|volume=56|issue=1|pages=15–39|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144214|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of disposal, contaminants are typically concentrated in the much smaller volume of the plant matter than in the initially contaminated soil or sediment. After harvest, a lower level of the contaminant will remain in the soil, so the growth/harvest cycle must usually be repeated through several crops to achieve a significant cleanup. After the process, the cleaned soil can support other vegetation. Mining of these extracted metals through '''phytomining''', is also being experimented with as a way of recovering the material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hyperaccumulators are plants that can naturally take up the contaminants in soil unassisted. In many cases these are [[metallophyte]] plants that can tolerate and incorporate high levels of toxic metals. Induced or assisted phytoextraction is a process where a conditioning fluid containing a [[chelator]] or another agent is added to soil to increase metal solubility or mobilization so that the plants can absorb them more easily.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doumett|first=S.|last2=Lamperi|first2=L.|last3=Checchini|first3=L.|last4=Azzarello|first4=E.|last5=Mugnai|first5=S.|last6=Mancuso|first6=S.|last7=Petruzzelli|first7=G.|last8=Bubba|first8=M.

Examples of plants that are known to accumulate the following contaminants:
*[[Arsenic]], using the sunflower (''[[Helianthus annuus]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.03.018 | title = Removal of trace metals by Sorghum bicolor and Helianthus annuus in a site polluted by industrial wastes: A field experience | year = 2007 | last1 = Marchiol | first1 = L. | last2 = Fellet | first2 = G. | last3 = Perosa | first3 = D. | last4 = Zerbi | first4 = G. | journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 379–87 | pmid = 17507235}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Chinese Brake fern (''[[Pteris vittata]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1104/pp.008185 | title = Mechanisms of Arsenic Hyperaccumulation in Pteris vittata.

*[[Cadmium]], using willow (''[[Salix viminalis]]''): In 1999, one research experiment performed by Maria Greger and Tommy Landberg suggested willow has a significant potential as a phytoextractor of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu), as willow has some specific characteristics like high transport capacity of heavy metals from root to shoot and huge amount of biomass production; can be used also for production of bio energy in the biomass energy power plant.&lt;ref name="Greger"&gt;{{Citation |last=Greger |first=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Landberg |first2=T. |title=Using of Willow in Phytoextraction |journal=International Journal of Phytoremediation |year=1999 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=115–123 |doi=10.1080/15226519908500010  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cadmium]] and [[zinc]], using alpine pennycress (''[[Thlaspi caerulescens]]''), a hyperaccumulator of these metals at levels that would be [[poison|toxic]] to many plants. On the other hand, the presence of copper seems to impair its growth (see table for reference).
*[[Lead]], using Indian mustard (''[[Brassica juncea]]''), ragweed (''[[Ambrosia artemisiifolia]]''), hemp dogbane (''[[Apocynum cannabinum]]''), or [[poplar trees]], which sequester lead in their biomass.

{{see also|List of hyperaccumulators|l1='Table of hyperaccumulators'}}
=== Phytostabilization ===
Phytostabilization reduces the mobility of substances in the environment, for example, by limiting the [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of substances from the [[soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on the long term stabilization and containment of the pollutant. The plant immobilizes the pollutants by binding them to soil particles making them less available for plant or human uptake.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike phytoextraction, phytostabilization focuses mainly on sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots but not in plant tissues. Pollutants become less bioavailable, resulting in reduced exposure. The plants can also excrete a substance that produces a chemical reaction, converting the heavy metal pollutant into a less toxic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stabilization results in reduced erosion, runoff, leaching, in addition to reducing the bioavailability of the contaminant.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; An example application of phytostabilization is using a vegetative cap to stabilize and contain [[mine tailings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Environ Health Perspect |year=2008 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=278–83 |title=Phytostabilization of Mine Tailings in Arid and Semiarid Environments—An Emerging Remediation Technology |vauthors=Mendez MO, Maier RM |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/10608/10608.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.10608 |pmid=18335091 |pmc=2265025 |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024115430/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/10608/10608.html |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phytodegradation ===
Phytodegradation (also called phytotransformation) uses plants or microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants in the soil or within the body of the plant. The organic compounds are broken down by enzymes that the plant roots secrete and these molecules are then taken up by the plant and released through transpiration.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.or.jp/Ietc/Publications/Freshwater/FMS2/2.asp|title=Phytoremediation Processes|website=www.unep.or.jp|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process works best with organic contaminants like herbicides, [[trichloroethylene]], and [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl ''tert''-butyl ether]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Phytotransformation results in the chemical modification of environmental substances as a direct result of plant [[metabolism]], often resulting in their inactivation, degradation (phytodegradation), or immobilization (phytostabilization). In the case of [[organic compounds|organic]] pollutants, such as [[pesticides]], [[explosives]], [[solvents]], industrial chemicals, and other [[xenobiotic]] substances, certain plants, such as [[Canna (plant)|Cannas]], render these substances non-toxic by their [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=Kvesitadze&gt;{{Citation |author=Kvesitadze, G. |title=Biochemical Mechanisms of Detoxification in Higher Plants |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Heidelberg |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-540-28996-8 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, [[microorganism]]s living in association with plant roots may metabolize these substances in soil or water. These complex and recalcitrant compounds cannot be broken down to basic molecules (water, carbon-dioxide, etc.) by plant molecules, and, hence, the term ''phytotransformation'' represents a change in chemical structure without complete breakdown of the compound.
The term "Green Liver" is used to describe phytotransformation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=H. |last=Sanderman |title=Higher plant metabolism of xenobiotics: the "green liver" concept |journal=Pharmacogenetics |volume=4 |pages=225–241 |year=1994 |doi=10.1097/00008571-199410000-00001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as plants behave analogously to the human [[liver]] when dealing with these [[xenobiotic]] compounds (foreign compound/pollutant).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Burken, J.G. |chapter=2.

This is known as Phase I metabolism, similar to the way that the human liver increases the polarity of drugs and foreign compounds ([[drug metabolism]]). Whereas in the human liver enzymes such as [[cytochrome P450]]s are responsible for the initial reactions, in plants enzymes such as peroxidases, phenoloxidases, esterases and nitroreductases carry out the same role.&lt;ref name=Kvesitadze /&gt;

In the second stage of phytotransformation, known as Phase II metabolism, plant biomolecules such as glucose and amino acids are added to the polarized xenobiotic to further increase the polarity (known as conjugation). This is again similar to the processes occurring in the human liver where [[glucuronidation]] (addition of glucose molecules by the UGT class of enzymes, e.g. [[UGT1A1]]) and [[glutathione]] addition reactions occur on reactive centres of the xenobiotic.

Phase I and II reactions serve to increase the polarity and reduce the toxicity of the compounds, although many exceptions to the rule are seen. The increased polarity also allows for easy transport of the xenobiotic along aqueous channels.

In the final stage of phytotransformation (Phase III metabolism), a sequestration of the xenobiotic occurs within the plant. The xenobiotics polymerize in a [[lignin]]-like manner and develop a complex structure that is sequestered in the plant. This ensures that the xenobiotic is safely stored, and does not affect the functioning of the plant. However, preliminary studies have shown that these plants can be toxic to small animals (such as snails), and, hence, plants involved in phytotransformation may need to be maintained in a closed enclosure.

Hence, the plants reduce toxicity (with exceptions) and sequester the xenobiotics in phytotransformation. [[Trinitrotoluene]] phytotransformation has been extensively researched and a transformation pathway has been proposed.&lt;ref name="Subra"&gt;{{Citation |first=Murali |last=Subramanian |first2=David J. |last2=Oliver |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=Jacqueline V. |last3=Shanks |title=TNT Phytotransformation Pathway Characteristics in Arabidopsis: Role of Aromatic Hydroxylamines |journal=Biotechnol.

=== Phytostimulation ===
Phytostimulation (or rhizodegradation) is the enhancement of [[soil life|soil microbial]] activity for the degradation of organic contaminants, typically by organisms that associate with [[root]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This process occurs within the [[rhizosphere]], which is the layer of soil that surrounds the roots.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plants release carbohydrates and acids that stimulate microorganism activity which results in the biodegradation of the organic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dzantor|first=E.

=== Phytovolatilization ===
Phytovolatilization is the removal of substances from soil or water with release into the air, sometimes as a result of phytotransformation to more volatile and/or less polluting substances. In this process, contaminants are taken up by the plant and through transpiration, evaporate into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the most studied form of phytovolatilization, where volatilization occurs at the stem and leaves of the plant, however indirect phytovolatilization occurs when contaminants are volatilized from the root zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Limmer|first=Matt|last2=Burken|first2=Joel|date=2016-07-05|title=Phytovolatilization of Organic Contaminants|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b04113|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=50|issue=13|pages=6632–6643|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b04113|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium (Se) and Mercury (Hg) are often removed from soil through phytovolatilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lone|first=Mohammad Iqbal|last2=He|first2=Zhen-li|last3=Stoffella|first3=Peter J.|last4=Yang|first4=Xiao-e|date=2008-03-01|title=Phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils and water: Progresses and perspectives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1631/jzus.B0710633|journal=Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=210–220|doi=10.1631/jzus.B0710633|issn=1673-1581|pmc=2266886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poplar trees are one of the most successful plants for removing VOCs through this process due to its high transpiration rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Rhizofiltration ===
[[Rhizofiltration]] is a process that filters water through a mass of roots to remove toxic substances or excess [[nutrients]]. The pollutants remain absorbed in or adsorbed to the roots.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This process is often used to clean up contaminated groundwater through planting directly in the contaminated site or through removing the contaminated water and providing it to these plants in an off-site location.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In either case though, typically plants are first grown in a greenhouse under precise conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-799937-1.00001-2|title=Phytoremediation of Soils|last=Surriya|first=Orooj|last2=Saleem|first2=Sayeda Sarah|last3=Waqar|first3=Kinza|last4=Kazi|first4=Alvina Gul|pages=1–36|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-799937-1.00001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological hydraulic containment ===
Biological [[hydraulic containment]] occurs when some plants, like poplars, draw water upwards through the soil into the roots and out through the plant, which decreases the movement of soluble contaminants downwards, deeper into the site and into the groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470975152.ch7/summary|title=Phytotechnology and Photosynthesis|last=Evans|first=Gareth M.|last2=Furlong|first2=Judith C.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470975152|pages=145–174|doi=10.1002/9780470975152.ch7/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phytodesalination ===
Phytodesalination uses halophytes (plants adapted to saline soil) to extract salt from the soil to improve its fertility&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Role of genetics ==
Breeding programs and [[genetic engineering]] are powerful methods for enhancing natural phytoremediation capabilities, or for introducing new capabilities into plants.  Genes for phytoremediation may originate from a [[micro-organism]] or may be transferred from one plant to another variety better adapted to the environmental conditions at the cleanup site. For example, genes encoding a nitroreductase from a bacterium were inserted into tobacco and showed faster removal of TNT and enhanced resistance to the toxic effects of TNT.&lt;ref name="Hannink"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hannink |first=N. |last2=Rosser |first2=S. J. |last3=French |first3=C. E. |last4=Basran |first4=A. |last5=Murray |first5=J. A. |last6=Nicklin |first6=S. |last7=Bruce |first7=N. C. |title=Phytodetoxification of TNT by transgenic plants expressing a bacterial nitroreductase |journal=Nature Biotechnology |year=2001 |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1168–72 |doi=10.1038/nbt1201-1168 |pmid=11731787 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers have also discovered a mechanism in plants that allows them to grow even when the pollution concentration in the soil is lethal for non-treated plants. Some natural, biodegradable compounds, such as exogenous [[polyamine]]s, allow the plants to tolerate concentrations of pollutants 500 times higher than untreated plants, and to absorb more pollutants.

== Hyperaccumulators and biotic interactions ==
A plant is said to be a [[hyperaccumulator]] if it can concentrate the pollutants in a minimum percentage which varies according to the pollutant involved (for example: more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of dry weight for [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[cobalt]], [[chromium]] or [[lead]]; or more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for [[zinc]] or [[manganese]]).&lt;ref name="BB89"&gt;{{Citation |first=A. J. M. |last=Baker |first2=R. R. |last2=Brooks |title=Terrestrial higher plants which hyperaccumulate metallic elements – A review of their distribution, ecology and phytochemistry |journal=Biorecovery |year=1989 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=81–126 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This capacity for accumulation is due to '''hypertolerance''', or ''phytotolerance'': the result of adaptative evolution from the plants to hostile environments through many generations. A number of interactions may be affected by metal hyperaccumulation, including protection, interferences with neighbour plants of different species, mutualism (including [[mycorrhiza]]e, [[pollen]] and seed dispersal), commensalism, and [[biofilm]].

== Phytoscreening ==
As plants are able to translocate and accumulate particular types of contaminants, plants can be used as [[biosensor]]s of subsurface contamination, thereby allowing investigators to quickly delineate contaminant plumes.&lt;ref name="Burken"&gt;{{Citation |last=Burken |first=J. |last2=Vroblesky |first2=D. |last3=Balouet |first3=J.C. |title=Phytoforensics, Dendrochemistry, and Phytoscreening: New Green Tools for Delineating Contaminants from Past and Present |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |year=2011 |volume=45 |issue=15 |pages=6218–6226 |doi=10.1021/es2005286 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorek"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sorek |first=A. |last2=Atzmon |first2=N. |last3=Dahan |first3=O. |last4=Gerstl |first4=Z. |last5=Kushisin |first5=L. |last6=Laor |first6=Y. |last7=Mingelgrin |first7=U. |last8=Nasser |first8=A. |last9=Ronen |first9=D. |last10=Tsechansky |first10=L. |last11=Weisbrod |first11=N. |last12=Graber |first12=E.R. |title="Phytoscreening": The Use of Trees for Discovering Subsurface Contamination by VOCs |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |year=2008 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=536–542 |doi=10.1021/es072014b }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorinated solvents, such as [[trichloroethylene]], have been observed in tree trunks at concentrations related to groundwater concentrations.&lt;ref name="Vroblesky"&gt;{{Citation |last=Vroblesky |first=D. |last2=Nietch |first2=C. |last3=Morris |first3=J. |title=Chlorinated Ethenes from Groundwater in Tree Trunks |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |year=1998 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=510–515 |doi=10.1021/es980848b }}.&lt;/ref&gt; To ease field implementation of phytoscreening, standard methods have been developed to extract a section of the tree trunk for later laboratory analysis, often by using an [[increment borer]].&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Vroblesky, D. |title=User's Guide to the Collection and Analysis of Tree Cores to Assess the Distribution of Subsurface Volatile Organic Compounds |year=2008 |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2008/5088/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoscreening may lead to more optimized site investigations and reduce contaminated site cleanup costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5826">This article contains proof of [[List of formulas in Riemannian geometry|formulas in Riemannian geometry]] that involve the [[Christoffel symbols]].

==Contracted Bianchi identities==

===Proof===
Start with the [[Curvature form#Bianchi identities|Bianchi identity]]&lt;ref name="syngeandschild"&gt;{{cite book |author=Synge J.L., Schild A.|title=Tensor Calculus|year=  1949|pages=87–89-90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{abmn;\ell} + R_{ab\ell m;n} + R_{abn\ell;m} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- The symbols \,\! exist to force PNG rendering; do not remove them. --&gt;

[[Tensor contraction|Contract]] both sides of the above equation with a pair of [[metric tensor]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;  g^{bn} g^{am} (R_{abmn;\ell} + R_{ab\ell m;n} + R_{abn\ell;m}) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; g^{bn} (R^m {}_{bmn;\ell} - R^m {}_{bm\ell;n} + R^m {}_{bn\ell;m}) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; g^{bn} (R_{bn;\ell} - R_{b\ell;n} - R_b {}^m {}_{n\ell;m}) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R^n {}_{n;\ell} - R^n {}_{\ell;n} - R^{nm} {}_{n\ell;m} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The first term on the left contracts to yield a Ricci scalar, while the third term contracts to yield a [[mixed tensor|mixed]] Ricci tensor,
:&lt;math&gt; R_{;\ell} - R^n {}_{\ell;n} - R^m {}_{\ell;m} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The last two terms are the same (changing dummy index ''n'' to ''m'') and can be combined into a single term which shall be moved to the right,
:&lt;math&gt; R_{;\ell} = 2 R^m {}_{\ell;m},&lt;/math&gt;
which is the same as
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_m R^m {}_\ell = {1 \over 2} \nabla_\ell R.&lt;/math&gt;
Swapping the index labels ''l'' and ''m'' yields
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell R^\ell {}_m = {1 \over 2} \nabla_m R,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''[[Q.E.D.]]'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''[[Riemannian geometry cheat sheet#Ricci and scalar curvatures|return to article]]'')

==The covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor vanishes==

===Proof===
The last equation in the proof above can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell R^\ell {}_m - {1 \over 2} \delta^\ell {}_m \nabla_\ell R = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where δ is the [[Kronecker delta]].  Since the mixed Kronecker delta is equivalent to the mixed metric tensor,
:&lt;math&gt; \delta^\ell {}_m = g^\ell {}_m,&lt;/math&gt;
and since the [[covariant derivative]] of the metric tensor is zero (so it can be moved in or out of the scope of any such derivative), then
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell R^\ell {}_m - {1 \over 2} \nabla_\ell g^\ell {}_m R = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Factor out the covariant derivative
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell\left(R^\ell {}_m - {1 \over 2} g^\ell {}_m R\right) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
then raise the index ''m'' throughout
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell \left(R^{\ell m} - {1 \over 2} g^{\ell m} R\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The expression in parentheses is the [[Einstein tensor]], so &lt;ref name="syngeandschild" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_\ell G^{\ell m} = 0,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''[[Q.E.D.]]'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(''[[Riemannian geometry cheat sheet#Einstein tensor|return to article]]'')

this means that the covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor vanishes.

==The Lie derivative of the metric==

===Proof===
Starting with the local [[coordinate]] formula for a covariant symmetric tensor field &lt;math&gt;g=g_{ab}(x^c)dx^a\otimes dx^b&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lie derivative]] along a [[vector field]] &lt;math&gt;X = X^a \partial_a&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab} &amp; = X^c \partial_c g_{ab}+g_{cb}\partial_a X^c + g_{ca}\partial_b X^c \\ &amp; = X^c \partial_c g_{ab} + g_{cb}\bigl(\partial_a X^c\pm \Gamma^{c}_{da}X^d\bigr) + g_{ca}\bigl(\partial_b X^c \pm \Gamma^{c}_{db}X^d\bigr) \\ &amp; = \bigl( X^c \partial_c g_{ab} - g_{cb}\Gamma^{c}_{da}X^d - g_{ca}\Gamma^{c}_{db}X^d\bigr)+ \bigl[  g_{cb}\bigl(\partial_a X^c + \Gamma^{c}_{da}X^d\bigr) + g_{ca}\bigl(\partial_b X^c + \Gamma^{c}_{db}X^d\bigr) \bigr] \\ &amp; = X^c\nabla_c g_{ab} + g_{cb}\nabla_a X^c + g_{ca}\nabla_b X^c \\ &amp; = 0 + g_{cb}\nabla_a X^c + g_{ca}\nabla_b X^c \\ &amp; = g_{cb}\nabla_a X^c + g_{ca}\nabla_b X^c \\ &amp; = \nabla_a X_b + \nabla_b X_a
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
here, the notation &lt;math&gt;\partial_a = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^a}&lt;/math&gt; means taking the [[partial derivative]] with respect to the coordinate &lt;math&gt; x^a&lt;/math&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''[[Q.E.D.]]'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''[[Riemannian geometry cheat sheet#Ricci and scalar curvatures|return to article]]'')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">'''Pseudolaw''' consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that are claimed to be based on accepted law or legal doctrine, but which deviate significantly from most conventional understandings of law and jurisprudence, or which originate from non-existent statutes or legal principals the advocate or adherent of incorrectly believes exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powell|first1=Corey|title=Here comes pseudolaw, a weird little cousin of pseudoscience|url=https://aeon.co/ideas/here-comes-pseudolaw-a-weird-little-cousin-of-pseudoscience|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]]|date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as "legalistic gibberish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T.C.

Followers of such ideologies can cause problems for courts and government administrators by filing unusual applications that are difficult to process. Courts in Canada refer to such arguments as '''Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments''', and have called them frivolous and vexatious.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571]''(CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 18 September 2012, para. 77&lt;/ref&gt; There is no recorded instance of such tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common among psudolegal beliefs is a belief that one is partially or fully sovereign from the country in which they live, and believe that no laws, or only certain laws, apply to them. Groups espousing such pseudolegal beliefs include [[freemen on the land]] and the [[sovereign citizen movement]]. Some believe that their state itself is illegitimate, such as [[Reichsbürgerbewegung]].

Also under the umbrella of pseudolegal arguments are [[conspiracy theorists]] who believe there is a secret parallel legal system that one can access through certain means, like using a secret phrase or by placing stamps on the right place on documents. For example, the [[redemption movement]] believes that a secret fund is created for everyone at birth by the government, and that a procedure exists to "redeem" or reclaim money from this fund. See [[tax protester conspiracy arguments]] for a discussion of these beliefs related to tax law. Many of these revolve around the "legal name fraud" movement, which believes that birth certificates give the state legal ownership of a [[personal name]] and refusing to use this name therefore removes oneself from a court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalgleish|first1=Katherine|title=Guns, border guards, and the Magna Carta: the Freemen-on-the-Land are back in Alberta courts|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=018e9df4-b9fe-4c88-9db9-d784f423348c|website=lexology.com|publisher=Lexology|accessdate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=John|title=The mystery of the 'legal name fraud' billboards|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36499750|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups advocate that one can avoid this state ownership by distinguishing between capitalized and non-capitalized versions of one's name, or by adding punctuation to one's name. See [[strawman theory]] (also known as the capital letters argument) for more information.

* A morphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma:X'\to X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''enrichment of the object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the class of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; by means of the class of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'', if &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and for any morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:B\to X&lt;/math&gt; from the class &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi':B\to X'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\sigma\circ\varphi'&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Refinement.jpg|thumb|Refinement]]
 
* An enrichment &lt;math&gt;\rho:E\to X&lt;/math&gt; of the object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the class of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; by means of the class of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''refinement of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; by means of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'', if for any other enrichment &lt;math&gt;\sigma:X'\to X&lt;/math&gt; (of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; by means of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) there is a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;\upsilon:E\to X'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sigma\circ\upsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The object &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is also called a ''refinement of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; by means of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''.
 
Notations:

: &lt;math&gt;
\rho=\operatorname{ref}_\Phi^\Gamma X, \qquad 
E=\operatorname{Ref}_\Phi^\Gamma X.
&lt;/math&gt;

In a special case when &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a class of all morphisms whose ranges belong to a given class of objects &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; it is convenient to replace &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in the notations (and in the terms):
 
: &lt;math&gt;
\rho=\operatorname{ref}_\Phi^L X, \qquad 
E=\operatorname{Ref}_\Phi^L X.
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a class of all morphisms whose ranges belong to a given class of objects &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; it is convenient to replace &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in the notations (and in the terms):
 
: &lt;math&gt;
\rho=\operatorname{ref}_M^\Gamma X, \qquad 
E=\operatorname{Ref}_M^\Gamma X.
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, one can speak about a ''refinement of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the class of objects &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by means of the class of objects &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'':

: &lt;math&gt;
\rho=\operatorname{ref}_M^L X, \qquad 
E=\operatorname{Ref}_M^L X.
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Revisionist school of Islamic studies''', (also '''Historical-Critical school of Islamic studies''') is a movement within Islamic studies which started in the 1970s and initiated a [[paradigm shift]] in Islamic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, edited by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main thesis and the concept of Revisionism ==

The core concern of the Revisionist School is to finally show consequence concerning the knowledge, practically available since [[Ignác Goldziher]]'s time, that the traditional Islamic accounts about [[Islam]]'s early times - written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad - are highly questionable as historical sources. This relates to [[Muhammad]]'s biography, the formation history of the [[Quran]], and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed by applying the [[historical criticism|historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation ''Revisionism'' was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a dismissive undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010. Judith Herrin, [https://www.opendemocracy.net/judith-herrin/patricia-crone-brief-memoir Patricia Crone: memoir of a superb Islamic Scholar], openDemocracy 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Today, also the adherents of the new movement use ''Revisionism'' to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Patricia Crone: [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/42023/among-the-believers Among the Believers], Tablet Magazine 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The major representatives ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The new movement originated at the [[SOAS, University of London]] by two publications of [[John Wansbrough]]: ''Quranic Studies'' (1977) and ''The Sectarian Milieu'' (1978). Among the students of Wansbrough are: [[Andrew Rippin]], [[Norman Calder]], [[G. R. Hawting]], [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]. With their work ''Hagarism'' (1977) Patricia Crone and Michael Cook set a milestone in Islamic Studies, since by provocative theses they provided maximal attention in the academic community. Later, both distanced themselves from their too far reaching theses in ''[[Hagarism]]''. Yet they adhered to the basically new academic approach. [[Martin Hinds]], too, studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. [[Robert G. Hoyland]] is a student of Patricia Crone.

A second local focus of the new movement is at the [[Saarland University]] in [[Saarbrücken]], Germany ({{ill|Saarbrücker Schule|de}}). Since the 1970s there is a focus on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran, by [[Günter Lüling]] und [[Gerd R. Puin|Gerd-Rüdiger Puin]]. Also in Saarbrücken, [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]] developed in the 2000s together with [[Volker Popp]], [[Christoph Luxenberg]] and [[Markus Groß]] a theory of Islam's earliest times which has no need for Muhammad as a historical person.

Further representatives are: [[Hans Jansen]] from the Netherlands who in 2005/7 published a work showing in detail why the known accounts of Muhammad's life are legends only. [[Yehuda D. Nevo]] published in 2003 his work ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' in which he denies the historicity of Muhammad. [[James A. Bellamy]] is known for his textual criticism of the Quran and for his proposals of emendations, i.e. proposals to correct the traditional text of the Quran. [[Fred Donner]] published in 2010 the first well-founded hypothesis on the early time of Islam without excessive exaggerations which found public attention.

[[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] studied history and became a renowned author of popular science publications on ancient history. With his work ''[[In the Shadow of the Sword (book)|In the Shadow of the Sword]]'' (2012) Tom Holland contributed heavily to the popularization of the new research results. Tom Holland depicts a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches, thus having like Fred Donner provided a well-founded hypothesis of Islam's early times which avoids exaggerations.

[[Sven Kalisch]] is a German Islamic theologian who rejected teaching Islamic theology without considering the new results of historical-critical research. Thereupon the German Islamic associations withdrew his allowance to teach future Islamic theologians and teachers. Later Kalisch left Islam. Today he is teaching the history of ideas in the Near East in Late Antiquity in [[Münster]].

== The thesis of the incredibility of the traditional Islamic accounts ==
The arguments against the credibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. [[Hans Jansen]] in his work ''De Historische Mohammed''. Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by [[Ibn Ishaq]] resp. [[Ibn Hisham]] which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.

Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jansen, ''De Historische Mohammed'', 2005/7&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although there were [[leap month]]s at the time of Muhammad which had to be intercalated frequently into the moon calendar and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq is in a leap month.
* The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later is not very credible.
* The depiction of a strong relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha is motivated politically resp. theologically: [[Aisha]] was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, [[Ali]]. In order to legitimate this succession against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that the prophet consummated marriage with Aisha allegedly at an astonishingly early age. 
* The depiction of slaughtering the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qurayza]] is motivated politically resp. theologically: As the "[[Constitution of Medina|treaty of Medina]]" shows, the Jews were initially part of the [[Umma]] and were addressed as "believers"; cf. the research of Prof. [[Fred Donner]]. When Islam later separated from Judaism, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished but not each single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the "treaty of Medina". Finally, such an mass slaughtering would not have gone unnoticed, even not in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews: Jews used to live in international trading networks, and Jews are known to write down their history. Most likely, the slaughtering of the Banu Quraiza never happened.
* The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to boldly exaggerate the capacities of the prophet. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad always kills more enemies than according to other traditions. Even the depiction of he prophet's male potency (who allegedly could satisfy all his wives in one night) is exaggerated in a questionable way. Of the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as an illiterate person. The [[revelation]] of the [[Quran]]ic text is all the more miraculous and the capacity of the prophet is all the more astonishing if Muhammad was an illiterate person.
* The account of [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State]] including the emperor of Byzantium, that they should convert to Islam, retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion.

Jansen points out that the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation of the Quran. The Quran mostly does not reveal the situation for which a revelation was made. The historical context is merely indicated, at best. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.

In her work ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' Patricia Crone gave a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This examination is much cited in literature yet discusses only a few aspects of Muhammad's biography meant to be exemplary for the nature of all the Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: ''""These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there ''was'' an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities."''&lt;ref name="crone-encounter"&gt;Patricia Crone: Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, 1987, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

== The new theses about the true beginnings of Islam ==
Starting point for all researchers is the awareness that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:

* The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later resp. were reworked later. In addition to that many small deviations came into the text as usual with ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.&lt;ref&gt;John Wansbrough: ''Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation'' (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd-Rüdiger Puin: ''Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San’a’'', in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur’an as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence and meaning of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially with the question whether any and how many parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or, whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time. The researchers' opinions differ in this question.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003); Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Donner suggests an early date for the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'' (1998), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Quran is not written in a "pure" Arabic yet the syriac Aramaic language seems to have a certain influence on the language of the Quran which was forgotten later. This could be a possible explanation why a fifth of the Quranic text is difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 377 ff.; Christoph Luxenberg: ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran – A Contribution to the Decoding of the Koran'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Islam did not rise among polytheistic pagans in the desert, yet in a milieu where Jewish and Christian texts were well-known. The "infidels" were no pagan polytheists yet monotheists who were considered to deviate slightly from monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Hawting: ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Rise of Islam: From Polemic to History'' (1999); Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* The geographical descriptions in the Quran and later traditions do not fit to Mecca. They rather point to  a place somewhere in north-western Arabia, e.g. to Petra in Jordania.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) pp. 22-24; Patricia Crone: ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' (1987); and the private researcher Dan Gibson: ''Quranic Geography'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The connection of Muslims and Jews was very close in the early times of Islam. Also Jews were called "believers" and were part of the umma. Antisemitic texts as e.g. the slaughtering of the Jewish tribe of the Banu Qurayza came into being long after Muhammad when Islam separated from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) pp. 68 ff.; cf. also Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7) pp. 311-317 (German edition 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the beginning, secular and spiritual power were united in the person of the caliph. There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: ''God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Islamic expansion probably was no Islamic, religiously motivated expansion, yet a secular, Arabic expansion. The expansion did not yet result in an oppression of the non-Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Hoyland: ''In God's Path. The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Muhammad there were at least two phases which were of major importance for the formation of Islam in its later shape:
** Under the Umayyad caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was built. There the word "Islam" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply "believers", and coins ware minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003) pp. 410-413; Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 336 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
** During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest to legitimize their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone: ''Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity'' (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: ''Mohammed'' (2005/7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Revisionism ==

The consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book ''Hagarism'' (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.
&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism is expressed by researchers like [[Tilman Nagel]], who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/islamwissenschaft-befreit-den-propheten-aus-seiner-religioesen-umklammerung-1464313.html Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religiösen Umklammerung!] in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
A certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to "revisionism" alone but to "extreme revisionism" or "ultra-revisionism".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: [https://books.google.de/books?id=xI_7uosa4FMC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=EMLqEHO3nI&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity] (2012), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregor Schoeler]] discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: "To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schoeler, ''Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen Überlieferung über das Leben Mohammeds'', de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: "dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance comes partly from older academics who still live in their thoughts in the world of the Islamic legends.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/rezensionen/rezension-tilman-nagel-eine-sackgasse-ohlig/ Review of: Mohammed. Leben und Legende, by Tilman Nagel], in:  imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] in his famous work [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962) described, a new paradigm prevails in academia often not by convincing current academics but by convincing the next generation of academics.

Continuous resistance against the new paradigm comes from researchers who fundamentally reject the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. They argue that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too. Adherents of Revisionism doubt whether this still is a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam ==
{{POV check|section|date=October 2016}}
The [[relationship between religion and science]] had always been shaped by conflicts...{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} It is always a hurting process for every religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself;{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious [[reform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion (2010) pp. 292 f. - Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;

By nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/wissenschaftliches-arbeiten-in-der-islamwissenschaft/ Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft], in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):
* As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[Patricia Crone]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], [[Fred Donner]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[Günter Lüling]].
* As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[John Wansbrough]], [[Hans Jansen]], [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]], [[Yehuda D. Nevo]].

Besides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:&lt;ref&gt;Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;
* Traditional texts which had shaped Islam for centuries - yet ''not'' from the beginning - are not true.
* The Quranic text has not been handed down to our times unchanged.
* Even in the Quran, God's word is in many respects clothed in human words.
* Muhammad did not live in Mecca.
* The relationship between Muhammad and Jews and Christians was different than always thought it had been.

==Revisionism by non-specialists==
[[Ibn Warraq]], an author known for his criticism of Islam, has complied several revisionist essays in his book, ''[[The Quest for the Historical Muhammad (Ibn Warraq)|The Quest for the Historical Muhammad]].'' [[Fred Donner]], reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough school of revisionism, the author presents a "one-sided selection" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The results is "a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader."&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-middle-east-studies/article/the-quest-for-the-historical-muhammad-edited-and-translated-by-warraqibn-554-pages-glossary-list-of-tribes-and-individuals-chronology-amherst-ny-prometheus-books-2000-3495-cloth-isbn-1-57392-787-2/4C3D7FD138EF645D933ADDB0BCB33D6B Review of: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, by Ibn Warraq],  Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, 35(1), pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], in this book ''Did Muhammad Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam's Obscure Origins,'' advances the thesis that Islam was a state-religion created by the [[Abbasids]] to justify the empire.

[[File:Rossport five 1 oct 2005.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rossport Five address a rally in [[Dublin]] after their release]]
The '''Rossport Five''' ({{lang-ga|Cúigear Ros Dumhach}}) are [[Willie Corduff]], brothers Philip and Vincent McGrath, Micheál Ó Seighin and James Brendan Philbin, from [[Kilcommon]] parish, [[Erris]], [[County Mayo]], [[Ireland]]. 

==History==
Justice Finnegan, President of the [[High Court of the Republic of Ireland]], jailed the five on 29 June 2005 by for civil [[contempt of court]] after refusing to obey a temporary court [[injunction]] forbidding them to interfere with work being undertaken by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] on their land. The committal order was sought by Shell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.ie/Gazette/oct05.pdf|title=Law Society of Ireland|date=October 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119065646/http://www.lawsociety.ie/Gazette/oct05.pdf|archivedate=2007-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who intended to build a high pressure raw [[Natural gas|gas]] pipeline across land in [[Rossport]] to pipe gas from the offshore [[Corrib Gas Field]]. Three of the five men own land in Rossport: Vincent McGrath and Ó Seighin were brought to court along with them as they had assisted in blocking the Shell workers. About thirty others who had done the same were not charged.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

There were protests all over Ireland during the period of the men's imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;'10,000 to march in support of jailed pipeline protesters', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 26 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The West's awake: The Battle of Rossport", ''[[Hot Press]]'', July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fermanagh supports Rossport Five", ''[[Daily Ireland]]'', 21 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"FF Cavan ‘think-in’ draws Rossport 5 protest", ''Daily Ireland'', 6 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; with filling stations of Shell, and its junior partner [[Statoil]], being picketed and blockaded by both political activists and ordinary members of the public.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The protests were driven by the Shell to Sea campaign (then TD [[Jerry Cowley]] liaised with the men in prison) which took its name following a meeting with Burren campaigners in January 2005 [[Shell to Sea]].{{cn|date=August 2012}} Defending his company's stance, [[Shell Ireland]]'s CEO Andy Pyle said: ''"The fact is that we've gone through a process, and we have five people who don't like the outcome."'' All Shell sites around Rossport and Bellinaboy were blockaded by the men's neighbours, preventing work.&lt;ref&gt;"Shell gets it badly wrong in the 'arse end of nowhere'", ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'', 31 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The battle of the bog", [[The Herald (Glasgow)|''The Herald'' (Glasgow)]], 8 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Michael Ring]] said that Ireland was now a "[[dictatorship]] within a [[democracy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/18/oil.ireland|title=Jailing of Irish villagers sparks anger as farmers defy Shell in Battle of the Bog|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=18 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an unusual{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} move by the Irish judiciary, the men were told that a judge would be on hand at any time of day or night if they wanted to purge their contempt, by promising they would no longer hinder Shell employees.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

The men were released from [[Cloverhill Prison]] on 30 September 2005, after 94 days, when Shell applied to the High Court to have the injunction lifted. This came after intense media and political scrutiny of the case.&lt;ref&gt;"Cowley expelled during Rossport row", [[RTÉ Online]], 28 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since==
The five men and their supporters have continued to campaign on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Áine|last=Ryan|url=http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=420&amp;Itemid=38|title=Up to 170 Gardaí facilitated the entry of Shell workers to the Bellanaboy terminal site|newspaper=Mayo News|date=3 October 2006|accessdate=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, a [[TNS/MRBI]] poll of adults in Mayo, commissioned by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], showed 66% supported the stance taken by the five men in their defiance of the court order, 20% did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corribsos.com/uploads/nuachtmayopollrossport%5B1%5D.pdf|title=Nuacht Mayo Poll Rossport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006,an account of events leading up their imprisonment was published by the Rossport Five. There was a second printing of the book (Our Story,The Rossport 5)in January 2007.

In April 2007, Willie Corduff won the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] on behalf of [[Europe]]. No government representative was present, though representatives were present from other countries for their winners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In April 2008, Vincent McGrath, Mícheál Ó Seighin, his wife Caitlín and son-in-law John Monaghan, among a few others, split from Shell to Sea and set up[[Pobal Chill Chomáin]] (PCC), a parochial grouping concerned primarily with health and safety issues. PCC have not held a public meeting in the parish or elsewhere since early 2011 and are, to all intents and purposes, defunct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29891">A '''round-robin tournament''' (or '''all-play-all tournament''') is a [[competition]] in which each [[contestant]] meets all other contestants in turn.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1971, G. &amp; C. Merriam Co), p.1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Official Lawn Tennis Bulletin|last = Orcutt|first = William Dana|publisher = The Editors|year = 1895|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 1, 3|volume = 2|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Official_Lawn_Tennis_Bulletin.html?id=s7gsAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contrasts with an [[elimination tournament]].

==Terminology==
The term ''round-robin'' is derived from the French term ''ruban'', meaning "ribbon". Over a long period of time, the term was [[Folk etymology|corrupted and idiomized]] to ''robin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Standardizing Terminology for Better Communication: Practice, Applied Theory, and Results|date = 1993|editor1-last = Strehlov|editor1-first = Richard A|editor2-last = Wright|editor2-first = Sue Ellen|volume = 1166|isbn = 0-8031-1493-1|pages = 336–337|publisher = ASTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable]]|last = |first = |publisher = Harper &amp; Brother Publishers|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = 786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''single round-robin'' schedule, each participant plays every other participant once. If each participant plays all others twice, this is frequently called a ''double round-robin''. The term is rarely used when all participants play one another more than twice,&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt; and is never used when one participant plays others an unequal number of times (as is the case in almost all of the major United States professional sports leagues – see [[American Football League (1940)|AFL (1940–41)]] and [[All-America Football Conference]] for exceptions).

In the United Kingdom, a round-robin tournament is often called an American tournament in sports such as tennis or billiards which usually have [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 1912|title=A Glossary of Terms Used in Connection with Billiards|journal=Billiard Monthly|publisher=English Amateur Billiards Association|quote=American Tournament: A tournament in which each player must meet in turn every other player.|url=http://www.eaba.co.uk/mags/bm/1912/02/termsUsedInConnectionWithBilliards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allied"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allied|first=|title=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D37Cd3Ad7eIC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=1 August 2012|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-0550106254|page=38|chapter=American tournament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mead1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mead|first=Shepherd|title=How to succeed in tennis without really trying: the easy tennismanship way to do all the things no tennis pro can teach you|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPkafr1X4p8C|accessdate=1 August 2012|year=1977|publisher=McKay|isbn=9780679507499|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italian it is called {{lang|it|girone all'italiana}} (literally "Italian-style circuit"). In [[Serbian language|Serbian]] it is called the Berger system ({{lang|sr|Бергеров систем}}, {{lang|sh|Bergerov sistem}}), after chess player [[Johann Berger]]. A round-robin [[tournament]] with four players is sometimes called "quad" or "foursome".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.uschess.org/docs/forms/IntroToTournaments.pdf |title=An Introduction to USCF-Rated Tournaments | date=23 Feb 2006 |website = The United States Chess Federation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
In sports with a large number of competitive matches per season, double round-robins are common. Most [[association football]] leagues in the world are organized on a double round-robin basis, in which every team plays all others in its league once at home and once away. This system is also used in qualification for major tournaments such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the continental tournaments (e.g. [[UEFA European Championship]], [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]]). There are also round-robin [[Duplicate bridge|bridge]], [[chess]], [[draughts]], [[Go (game)|go]], [[curling]] and [[Scrabble]] tournaments. The [[World Chess Championship]] decided in 2005 and in 2007 on an eight-player double round-robin tournament where each player faces every other player once as white and once as black.

[[Group tournament ranking system|Group tournaments rankings]] usually go by number of matches won and drawn, with any of a variety of tiebreaker criteria.

Frequently, [[tournament#Multi-stage tournaments|pool stages within a wider tournament]] are conducted on a round-robin basis. Examples with single round-robin scheduling include the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA European Football Championship]], and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] (2004–2009) in football, [[Super Rugby]] ([[rugby union]]) in the Southern Hemisphere during its past iterations as Super 12 and Super 14 (but ''not'' in its later 15- and 18-team formats), the [[Cricket World Cup]], [[Indian Premier League]] Twenty-20 Cricket, [[The International (Dota 2)]] and many [[American football|American Football]] [[list of college athletic conferences|college conferences]], such as the [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] (which currently has 10 members).  The group phases of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[Copa Libertadores de América]] are contested as a double round-robin, as are most [[basketball]] leagues outside the United States, including the regular-season and Top 16 phases of the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]]; the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] has used a double round-robin for both its [[2009 UFL season|2009]] and [[2010 UFL season|2010]] seasons.

Season ending tennis tournaments also use a round robin format prior to the semi on stages

==Evaluation==
In theory, a round-robin tournament is the fairest way to determine the champion from among a known and fixed number of participants. Each participant, whether player or team, has equal chances{{clarifyme|date=May 2017}} against all other opponents. The element of luck is seen to be reduced as compared to a [[Elimination tournament|knockout system]] since one or two bad performances need not cripple a competitor's chance of ultimate victory. Final records of participants are more accurate as they represent the results over a longer period against the same opposition. This can also be used to determine which teams are the poorest performers and thus subject to [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] if the format is used in a multi-tiered league. This is also helpful to determine the final rank of all competitors, from strongest to weakest, for purposes of qualification for another stage or competition as well as for prize money. In [[team sport]] the (round-robin) major league champions are generally regarded as the "best" team in the land, rather than the ([[Single-elimination|elimination]]) cup winners.

Moreover, in tournaments such as the FIFA or ICC world cups, a first round stage consisting of a number of mini round robins between groups of 4 teams guards against the possibility of a team travelling possibly thousands of miles only to be eliminated after just one poor performance in a straight knockout system. The top one, two, or occasionally three teams in these groups then proceed to a straight knockout stage for the remainder of the tournament.

===Disadvantages of the format===
Round-robins can suffer from being too long compared to other tournament types, and with later scheduled games potentially not having any substantial meaning. They may also require tiebreaking procedures.

[[Swiss system tournament]]s attempt to combine elements of the round-robin and elimination formats, to provide a worthy champion using fewer rounds than a round-robin, while allowing draws and losses.

====Tournament length====
The main disadvantage of a round robin tournament is the time needed to complete it. Unlike a knockout tournament where half of the participants are eliminated after each round, a round robin requires one round less than the number of participants if the number of participants is even, and as many rounds as participants if the number of participants is odd. For instance, a tournament of 16 teams can be completed in just 4 rounds (i.e. 15 matches) in a knockout format; a round-robin would require 15 rounds (i.e. 120 matches) to finish. Other issues stem from the difference between the theoretical fairness of the round robin format and practice in a real event. Since the victor is gradually arrived at through multiple rounds of play, teams who perform poorly, who might have been quickly eliminated from title contention, are forced to play out their remaining games. Thus games are played late in the competition between competitors with no remaining chance of success. Moreover, some later matches will pair one competitor who has something left to play for against another who does not. It may also be possible for a competitor to play the strongest opponents in a round robin in quick succession while others play them intermittently with weaker opposition. This asymmetry means that playing the same opponents is not necessarily completely equitable: the same opponents in a different order may play harder or easier matches, while other teams are presented with more adversity during periods of the competition.{{clarifyme|date=September 2017}} There is also no scheduled showcase final match. Only by coincidence would two competitors meet in the final match of the tournament where the result of that match determined the championship. A notable instance of such an event was the [[Liverpool F.C. 0–2 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|May 26th, 1989]] match between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

====Qualified teams====
Further issues arise where a round-robin is used as a qualifying round within a larger tournament. A competitor already qualified for the next stage before its last game may either not try hard (in order to conserve resources for the next phase) or even deliberately lose (if the scheduled next-phase opponent for a lower-placed qualifier is perceived to be easier than for a higher-placed one). Four pairs in the [[Badminton at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's doubles|2012 Olympics Women's doubles badminton]], having qualified for the next round, were disqualified for attempting to lose in the round robin stage to avoid compatriots and better ranked opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/01/london-2012-badminton-disqualified-olympics|title=Eight Olympic badminton players disqualified for 'throwing games'|date=1 August 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The round robin stage at the Olympics were a new introduction and potential problems were readily known prior to the tournament.

====Circle of death====
Another disadvantage, especially in smaller round-robins, is the "circle of death," where teams cannot be separated on a head-to-head record. In a three-team round-robin, where A defeats B, B defeats C, and C defeats A, all three competitors will have a record of one win and one loss, and a tiebreaker will need to be used to separate the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~quizbowl/schedules.html|title=UC Berkeley Quiz Bowl: How To Make Schedules|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This famously happened during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group E]], where all four teams finished with a record of one win, one draw, and one loss.

==Scheduling algorithm==
[[File:Round-robin tournament_10teams_en.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Example of a round-robin tournament with 10 participating teams]]
If  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of competitors, a pure round robin tournament requires &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2} \end{matrix}(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; games.  If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, then in each of &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; rounds, &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; games can be run concurrently, provided there exist sufficient resources (e.g. courts for a [[tennis]] tournament).  If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd, there will be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rounds, each with &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n - 1}{2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; games, and one competitor having no game in that round.

The circle method is the standard [[algorithm]] to create a schedule for a round-robin tournament. All competitors are assigned to numbers, and then paired in the first round:

{| class="wikitable" summary="A table with 2 rows and seven columns. Each column is a pair of teams that play each other"
|+ style="white-space: nowrap" | Round 1. (1 plays 14, 2 plays 13, ... )
|- style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"
| '''1'''
| style="color: hsl(0, 90%, 30%)" | 2
| style="color: hsl(28, 90%, 30%)" | 3
| style="color: hsl(55, 90%, 30%)" | 4
| style="color: hsl(83, 90%, 30%)" | 5
| style="color: hsl(111, 90%, 30%)" | 6
| style="color: hsl(138, 90%, 30%)" | 7
|- style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"
| style="color: hsl(332, 90%, 30%)" | 14

| style="color: hsl(222, 90%, 30%)" | 10
| style="color: hsl(194, 90%, 30%)" | 9
| style="color: hsl(166, 90%, 30%)" | 8
|}
Next, one of the contributors in the first or last column of the table is fixed (number one in this example) and the others rotated clockwise one position

{| class="wikitable" summary="A table with 2 rows and seven columns. Each column is a pair of teams that play each other"

| style="color: hsl(138, 90%, 30%)" | 7
|}

{| class="wikitable" summary="A table with 2 rows and seven columns. Each column is a pair of teams that play each other"

| style="color: hsl(138, 90%, 30%)" | 7
| style="color: hsl(111, 90%, 30%)" | 6
|}

This is repeated until you end up almost back at the initial position:

{| class="wikitable" summary="A table with 2 rows and seven columns. Each column is a pair of teams that play each other"
|+ style="white-space: nowrap" | Round 13. (1 plays 2, 3 plays 14, ... )

| style="color: hsl(83, 90%, 30%)" | 5
| style="color: hsl(111, 90%, 30%)" | 6
| style="color: hsl(138, 90%, 30%)" | 7
| style="color: hsl(166, 90%, 30%)" | 8
|- style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"
| style="color: hsl(0, 90%, 30%)" | 2
| style="color: hsl(332, 90%, 30%)" | 14
| style="color: hsl(305, 90%, 30%)" | 13
| style="color: hsl(277, 90%, 30%)" | 12
| style="color: hsl(249, 90%, 30%)" | 11
| style="color: hsl(222, 90%, 30%)" | 10
| style="color: hsl(194, 90%, 30%)" | 9
|}

If there are an odd number of competitors, a dummy competitor can be added, whose scheduled opponent in a given round does not play and has a [[bye (sports)|bye]]. The schedule can therefore be computed as though the dummy were an ordinary player, either fixed or rotating. Instead of rotating one position, any number [[relatively prime]] to &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; will generate a complete schedule.
The upper and lower rows can indicate home/away in sports, white/black in [[chess]], etc.; to ensure fairness, this must alternate between rounds since competitor 1 is always on the first row.  If, say, competitors 3 and 8 were unable to fulfil their fixture in the third round, it would need to be rescheduled outside the other rounds, since both competitors would already be facing other opponents in those rounds.  More complex scheduling constraints may require more complex algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.emba.uvm.edu/~jdinitz/preprints/design_tourney_talk.pdf|title = Designing Schedules for Leagues and Tournaments|date = 13 November 2004|website = Home Page for Jeff Dinitz|last = Dinitz|first = Jeff|publication-place = Mount Saint Mary College|publisher = GRAPH THEORY DAY 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This schedule is applied in chess and draughts tournaments of rapid games, where players physically move round a table. In France this is called the [[Carousel]]-Berger system (Système Rutch-Berger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Le livre de l'arbitre : édition 2008|last = |first = |publisher = Fédération Française des Échecs|year = |isbn = 978-2-915853-01-8|location = |pages = 56|url = http://www.echecs.asso.fr/LivreArbitre/Livre_arbitre.pdf#page=56|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schedule can also be used for "asynchronous" round-robin tournaments where all games take place at different times (for example, because there is only one venue). The games are played from left to right in each round, and from the first round to the last. When the number of competitors is even, this schedule performs well with respect to quality and fairness measures such as the amount of rest between games. On the other hand, when the number of competitors is odd, it does not perform so well and a different schedule is superior with respect to these measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suksompong |first1=Warut |title=Scheduling asynchronous round-robin tournaments

Alternatively Berger tables,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Table de Berger|Table de Berger]] {{fr icon}}, examples of round robin schedules up to 30 participants.&lt;/ref&gt; named after the [[Austria]]n [[chess]] [[Chess master|master]] [[Johann Berger]], are widely used in the planning of tournaments. Berger published the pairing tables in his two Schachjahrbucher,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Schach-Jahrbuch für 1892/93 |last = Berger|first = Johann|publisher = |year = 1893|oclc = 651254787 |location = Leipzig|pages = |editor-last = |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Schach-Jahrbuch für 1899/1900 : fortsetzung des schach-jahrbuches für 1892/93|last = Berger|first = Johann | publisher = |year = 1899| oclc = 651254792 |location = Leipzig|pages =21–27 |editor-last = |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; with due reference to its inventor Richard Schurig.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Richard Schurig|Richard Schurig]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SchurigTables&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Die Paarung der Theilnehmer eines Turniers|date = |last = Schurig| first = Richard | journal = Deutsche Schachzeitung| issue = |publication-date = 1886|language = German|volume = 41|pages = 134–137|oclc = 556959107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This constitutes a schedule where player 14 has a fixed position, and all other players are rotated clockwise &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; positions. This schedule alternates colours and is easily generated manually. To construct the next round, the last player, number 8 in the first round, moves to the head of the table, followed by player 9 against player 7, player 10 against 6, until player 1 against player 2. Arithmetically, this equates to adding &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; to the previous row, with the exception of player &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. When the result of the addition is greater than &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;, then subtract &lt;math&gt;(\begin{matrix} \frac{n}{2}\end{matrix}-1)&lt;/math&gt;.

This schedule can also be represented as a (n-1, n-1) table, expressing a round in which players meets each other. For example, player 7 plays against player 11 in round 4. If a player meets itself, then this shows a bye or a game against player n. All games in a round constitutes a diagonal in the table.

The above schedule can also be represented by a graph, as shown below:
[[Image:Round-robin-schedule-span-diagram.svg|thumb|none|Round Robin Schedule Span Diagram]]

Both the graph and the schedule were reported by [[Édouard Lucas]] in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Récréations Mathématiques|last = Lucas|first = Edouard|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|year = 1883|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 161–197|url = https://archive.org/stream/p2rcrationsm00lucauoft#page/176/mode/2up|chapter = Les jeux de demoiselles|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a recreational mathematics puzzle.
Lucas, who describes the method as ''simple and ingenious'', attributes the solution to Felix Walecki, a teacher at [[Lycée Condorcet]]. Lucas also included an alternative solution by means of a [[sliding puzzle]].

=== Original construction of pairing tables by Richard Schurig (1886) ===

For 7 or 8 players, Schurig&lt;ref name="SchurigTables" /&gt; builds a table with &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; vertical rows and &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; horizontal rows, as follows:
{| style="text-align:right; margin-left:6em;"
 |-
 |              | 1.
 |              | Round
 | width="40pt" | 1
 | width="40pt" | 2 
 | width="40pt" | 3
 | width="40pt" | 4
 |-
 |              | 2. || align = "center" | ,, || 5 || 6 || 7 || 1 
 |-
 |              | 3. || align = "center" | ,, || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
 |-
 |              | 4. || align = "center" | ,, || 6 || 7 || 1 || 2
 |-
 |              | 5. || align = "center" | ,, || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6
 |-
 |              | 6. || align = "center" | ,, || 7 || 1 || 2 || 3
 |-
 |              | 7. || align =" center" | ,, || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7
 |}

Then a second table is constructed (with counting from the end) as shown below: 
{| style="text-align:right; margin-left:6em;"
 |-
 |              | 1.
 |              | Round
 | width="40pt" | . 1
 | width="40pt" | . 7 
 | width="40pt" | . 6
 | width="40pt" | . 5
 |-
 |              | 2. || align = "center" | ,, || . 5 || . 4 || . 3 || . 2 
 |-
 |              | 3. || align = "center" | ,, || . 2 || . 1 || . 7 || . 6
 |-
 |              | 4. || align = "center" | ,, || . 6 || . 5 || . 4 || . 3
 |-
 |              | 5. || align = "center" | ,, || . 3 || . 2 || . 1 || . 7
 |-
 |              | 6. || align = "center" | ,, || . 7 || . 6 || . 5 || . 4
 |-
 |              | 7. || align =" center" | ,, || . 4 || . 3 || . 2 || . 1
 |}

By merging above tables we arrive at:

{| style="text-align:right; margin-left:6em;"
 |-
 |              | 1.
 |              | Round

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10399">The '''Schweizeische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit''' ('''SAFFA''', English: Swiss Exhibition for Women's Work) was an exhibition that took place in [[Bern]] in 1928 and in [[Zürich]] in 1958. SAFFA was organized by the [[Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine]] (BFS, the Federation of Swiss Women's Associations), the Swiss Catholic Women's League (SKF), and 28 other Swiss women's associations, to highlight the precarious situation of working women in the postwar years.

The predecessor of Saffa was the first exhibition on women's work, organized by [[Rosa Neuenschwander]] in [[Bern]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="Saffa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frauennet.ch/index.php/frauen-bewegung/21-saffa-1928-und-1958|title=Mutige Manifestation der Frauen: Die SAFFA 1928|website=frauennet.ch|language=german}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|language=french|title=La vie de Rosa Neuenschwander (PDF)|magazine=Femmes Suisses et le mouvement féministe|issue=51|year=1963|url=http://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=emi-002:1963:51::65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '"Viererfeld" area (today Länggasse-Felsenau) in Bern, the first Saffa was held from 26 August until 30 September 1928. 
[[Lux Guyer|Louise (Lux) Guyer]],&lt;ref name="hds-LuxGuyer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9326.php|title=9326|publisher=HDS|author=Dagmar Böcker|language=German|date=2006-03-10|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Swiss women architect, was the chief organizator, and she completed the buildings in only three months using prefabricated elements made of wood.&lt;ref name="saffahaus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saffahaus.ch/|title=SAFFAhaus|publisher=saffahaus.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fair opened, her reputation was firmly established. Focus of the exhibition were the services of women in family, working life, science and art; the representation of women's work and their importance for the Swiss economy and society. Saffa also promoted the female self-confidence and campaigned –for the so far not related – political rights to the Swiss women and the right to a gainful employment, as well as for their recognition as Swiss citizens with all political rights,&lt;ref name="hds-saffa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D17336.php|title=Saffa|publisher=HDS|author=Yvonne Voegeli|language=German|date=2011-12-09|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless the Women's suffrage in Switzerland was realized in the last cantons in 1990.

== Saffa 1958 ==
[[File:Saffa-Insel - Zürichsee in Zürich - Landiwiese 2015-05-06 14-26-41.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Saffa-Insel]]'' on [[Zürichsee]] lakeshore in Wollishofen]]
From 17 July until 15 September 1958, the BSF led the second Saffa with over a hundred national and cantonal women's organisations on the ''[[Landiwiese]]'' in Zürich-[[Wollishofen]]. Before, the ''[[Saffa-Insel]]'', an artificial island was poured, being still a popular meeting place that is also used as lido in the summer and for events. As chief architect of the exhibition, which stood under the motto "Life circle of women in family, occupation, and country", acted Annemarie Hubacher-Constam.&lt;ref name="hds-"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D27366.php|title=Hubacher [-Constam], Annemarie|publisher=HDS|author=Dagmar Böcker|language=German|date=2012-08-27|accessdate=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFFA presented the women, who were wanted in the booming economy as consumers and workers, possibilities in the areas of education, employment, shopping and leisure. In accordance with the needs of economic and sociopolitical needs, SAFFA promoted the then three-phase model as an 'ideal female curriculum': employment prior to the marriage, motherhood, and return to the labour market. In addition, the women had to absorb negative impacts of the rapidly changing world, nevertheless, by spreading harmony inside and outside of their families. The men should be made aware of 'women services' in the service of the general public on the indispensability and so motivated to fix the social discrimination against women. With the profits from the two exhibitions, solidarity works were established for women.&lt;ref name="hds-saffa"/&gt;

Having 1.9 million visitors, the exhibition was organized exclusively and also designed by women, including [[ETH Zurich]] alumnae [[Berta Rahm]] and Claire Rufer-Eckmann.&lt;ref name="IAWA_V11"&gt;Jakob, Evelyne Lang. "The Life and Work of Berta Rahm, 1910 - 1998," &lt;i&gt;IAWA Newsletter&lt;/i&gt;, Fall 1999, V. 11, p. 1. {{cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/news/news11.pdf|title=Berta Rahm and Clair Rufer|accessdate=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frauennet2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Berta Rahm|url=http://www.frauennet.ch/index.php/frauen-geschichten/8-berta-rahm|website=Frauennet|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An innovation and particularly startling were the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotundas]], which were planned as manifestation of the solidarity of women.  Topics such as "my home – my world", "needle and thread" and "in the realm of the kitchen" attracted the then housewives. The Saffa 1958 was marked by the upcoming vote to women's suffrage, thus the promoters did not practice an overly combative appearance and even created a "men paradise" (''Männerparadies'') department.&lt;ref name="stiftung-frauenarbeit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stiftung-frauenarbeit.ch/index.php/de/stiftung/geschichte/ausstellungen|title=Die Ausstellungen|publisher=stiftung-frauenarbeit.ch|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion of the ''Saffatheater'' [[Jörg Schneider]] played in the cabaret comedy ''Lysistrata''.&lt;ref name="zol-20150822"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zol.ch/bezirk-hinwil/wetzikon/joerg-schneider-ist-tot/story/13778801|title=Jörg Schneider ist tot|publisher=[[Zürcher Oberländer]]|author=|language=German|date=2015-08-22|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For that time, the women excelled with innovative ideas, among the Saffa Women's Orchestra at the opening concert, of course, exclusively from women musicians, and directed by the first women conductor who graduated in Switzerland, [[Hedi Salquin]], who conducted the concerto for orchestra ''Intrada'' by [[Fernande Peyrot]] (1888–1978) in the [[Wasserkirche]] auditorium.&lt;ref name="stiftung-frauenarbeit"/&gt;

The exhibition was a great success and generated a substantial financial surplus that was used for solidarity associations for women. The Saffa island was dedicated to women, and is part of the water lot owned by the canton of Zürich.&lt;ref name="frauennet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frauennet.ch/index.php/frauen-bewegung/20-saffa-schweizerische-ausstellung-fuer-frauenarbeit|title=Die SAFFA – Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit|publisher=frauennet.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saffa 2020 ==
The Swiss Federal Council signed the optional protocol as an addition to the Women Convention for the legal and formal recognition of the full human rights of women in Switzerland in February 2007. The Internet platform ''frauennet.ch'' proposed the decision to organise a third SAFFA on the occasion of their women picnic brunches on the Swiss national holiday on the ''Saffa-Island'' in Zürich. For financial reasons, the project could not be started for the time being. [[Alliance F]], as before better known as [[Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine]] (BFS), prepares a third Saffa, founded the "2020" association for this purpose, and initiated the project "2020 – der weibliche blick auf die zukunft" (literally: 2020 – the female looks to the future). The project seeks to capture ideas and visions for the future of our society from the perspective of women and in an appropriate manner of the public present. A first web presentation was 2013 and started the realization phase to SAFFA 2020.

The project ''2020 – der weibliche blick auf die zukunft'' is under the patronage of the three federal councillors (''Bundesrat'') [[Doris Leuthard]], [[Simonetta Sommaruga]] and [[Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf]] as well as by the former councillor (''aBR'') [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]].&lt;ref name="2020-patronat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2020.ch/site/?page_id=13=|title=Patronat|publisher=2020.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223701/http://www.2020.ch/site/?page_id=13%3D|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9219">'''S''' is an [[axiomatic set theory]] set out by [[George Boolos]] in his 1989 article, "Iteration Again". '''S''', a [[first order logic|first-order]] theory, is two-sorted because its [[ontology]] includes “stages” as well as [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. Boolos designed '''S''' to embody his understanding of the “iterative conception of set“ and the associated [[iterative hierarchy]]. '''S''' has the important property that all axioms of [[Zermelo set theory]] ''Z'', except the [[axiom of extensionality]] and the [[axiom of choice]], are theorems of '''S''' or a slight modification thereof.

==Ontology==
Any grouping together of [[mathematical object|mathematical]], [[abstract object|abstract]], or concrete objects, however formed, is a ''collection'', a synonym for what other [[set theory|set theories]] refer to as a [[Class (set theory)|class]]. The things that make up a collection are called [[element (mathematics)|element]]s or members. A common instance of a collection is the [[domain of discourse]] of a [[first-order theory]]. 

All sets are collections, but there are collections that are not sets. A synonym for collections that are not sets is [[proper class]]. An essential task of [[axiomatic set theory]] is to distinguish sets from proper classes, if only because mathematics is grounded in sets, with proper classes relegated to a purely descriptive role.

The [[Von Neumann universe]] implements the “iterative conception of set” by stratifying the universe of sets into a series of "stages", with the sets at a given stage being possible members of the sets formed at all higher stages. The notion of stage goes as follows. Each stage is assigned an [[ordinal number]]. The lowest stage, stage 0, consists of all entities having no members. We assume that the only entity at stage 0 is the [[empty set]], although this stage would include any [[urelement]]s we would choose to admit. Stage ''n'', ''n''&gt;0, consists of all possible sets formed from elements to be found in any stage whose number is less than ''n''. Every set formed at stage ''n'' can also be formed at every stage greater than ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998:88).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence the stages form a nested and [[well-ordered]] sequence, and would form a [[hierarchy (mathematics)|hierarchy]] if set membership were [[transitive relation|transitive]]. The iterative conception has gradually become more accepted, despite an imperfect understanding of its historical origins.

The iterative conception of set steers clear, in a well-motivated way, of the well-known [[paradox]]es of [[Russell's paradox|Russell]], [[Burali-Forti paradox|Burali-Forti]], and [[Cantor's paradox|Cantor]]. These paradoxes all result from the [[unrestricted comprehension|unrestricted use of the principle of comprehension]] of [[naive set theory]]. Collections such as "the class of all sets" or "the class of all [[ordinal number|ordinals]]" include sets from all stages of the iterative hierarchy. Hence such collections cannot be formed at any given stage, and thus cannot be sets.

==Primitive notions==
This section follows Boolos (1998: 91). The variables ''x'' and ''y'' range over sets, while ''r'', ''s'', and ''t'' range over stages. There are three [[primitive notion|primitive]] two-place [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]]:
* Set–set: ''x''∈''y'' denotes, as usual, that set ''x'' is a member of set ''y'';
* Set–stage: ''Fxr'' denotes that set ''x'' “is formed at” stage ''r'';
* Stage–stage: ''r''&lt;''s'' denotes that stage ''r'' “is earlier than” stage ''s''.

The axioms below include a defined two-place set-stage predicate, ''Bxr'', which abbreviates:
:&lt;math&gt;\exist s[s&lt;r \land Fxs].&lt;/math&gt;
''Bxr'' is read as “set ''x'' is formed before stage ''r''.”

[[identity (mathematics)|Identity]], denoted by infix ‘=’, does not play the role in '''S''' it plays in other set theories, and Boolos does not make fully explicit whether the background [[first-order logic|logic]] includes identity. '''S''' has no [[axiom of extensionality]] and identity is absent from the other '''S''' axioms. Identity does appear in the axiom schema distinguishing '''S+''' from '''S''',&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 97).&lt;/ref&gt; and in the derivation in '''S''' of the [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of empty set|null set]], and [[axiom of infinity|infinity]] axioms of '''[[Zermelo set theory|Z]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 103–04).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
The symbolic axioms shown below are from Boolos (1998: 91), and govern how sets and stages behave and interact. The natural language versions of the axioms are intended to aid the intuition.
&lt;!-- The symbolic axioms should not be changed without discussion on the talk page. Altering these axioms would constitute original research. However the English descriptions may be changed.--&gt;

The axioms come in two groups of three. The first group consists of axioms pertaining solely to stages and the stage-stage relation ‘&lt;’.

'''Tra''': &lt;math&gt; \forall r \forall s \forall t[r&lt;s \land s&lt;t \rightarrow r&lt;t] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

“Earlier than” is transitive.

'''Net''': &lt;math&gt; \forall s \forall t \exist r[t&lt;r \land s&lt;r] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

A consequence of ''Net'' is that every stage is earlier than some stage.

'''Inf''': &lt;math&gt; \exist r \exist u [u&lt;r \land \forall t[t&lt;r \rightarrow \exist s[t&lt;s \land s&lt;r]]] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The sole purpose of ''Inf'' is to enable deriving in '''S''' the [[axiom of infinity]] of other set theories.

The second and final group of axioms involve both sets and stages, and the predicates other than '&lt;':

'''All''': &lt;math&gt;  \forall x \exist r Fxr \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Every set is formed at some stage in the hierarchy.

'''When''': &lt;math&gt; \forall r \forall x [Fxr \leftrightarrow [\forall y (y \in x \rightarrow Byr) \land \lnot Bxr] ] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

A set is formed at some stage [[iff]] its members are formed at earlier stages.

Let ''A''(''y'') be a formula of '''S''' where ''y'' is free but ''x'' is not. Then the following axiom schema holds:

'''Spec''': &lt;math&gt; \exist r \forall y[A(y) \rightarrow Byr] \rightarrow \exist x \forall y[y \in x \leftrightarrow A(y)] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If there exists a stage ''r'' such that all sets satisfying ''A''(''y'') are formed at a stage earlier than ''r'', then there exists a set ''x'' whose members are just those sets satisfying ''A''(''y''). The role of ''Spec'' in '''S''' is analogous to that of the [[axiom schema of specification]] of [[Z]].

==Discussion==
Boolos’s name for [[Zermelo set theory]] minus extensionality was ''Z-''. Boolos derived in '''S''' all axioms of ''Z-'' except the [[axiom of choice]].&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 95–96; 103–04).&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this exercise was to show how most of conventional set theory can be derived from the iterative conception of set, assumed embodied in '''S'''. [[Extensionality]] does not follow from the iterative conception, and so is not a theorem of '''S'''. However, '''S''' + Extensionality is free of contradiction if '''S''' is free of contradiction.

Boolos then altered ''Spec'' to obtain a variant of '''S''' he called '''S+''', such that the [[axiom schema of replacement]] is derivable in '''S+'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Extensionality. Hence '''S+''' + Extensionality has the power of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]]. Boolos also argued that the [[axiom of choice]] does not follow from the iterative conception, but did not address whether Choice could be added to '''S''' in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 97).&lt;/ref&gt; Hence '''S+''' + Extensionality cannot prove those theorems of the conventional set theory [[ZFC]] whose proofs require Choice.

'''Inf''' guarantees the existence of stages ω, and of ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' for finite ''n'', but not of stage ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω. Nevertheless, '''S''' yields enough of [[transfinite number|Cantor's paradise]] to ground almost all of contemporary mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;”…the overwhelming majority of 20th century mathematics is straightforwardly representable by sets of fairly low infinite ranks, certainly less than ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;20.” (Potter 2004: 220). The exceptions to Potter's statement presumably include [[category theory]], which requires the weakly [[inaccessible cardinal]]s afforded by [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], and the higher reaches of set theory itself.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boolos compares '''S''' at some length to a variant of the system of [[Frege]]’s ''Grundgesetze'', in which [[Hume's principle]], taken as an axiom, replaces Frege’s Basic Law V, an [[unrestricted comprehension]] axiom which made Frege's system inconsistent; see [[Russell's paradox]].

The idea of '''self-replicating spacecraft''' has been applied – in theory – to several distinct "tasks". The particular variant of this idea applied to the idea of [[space exploration]] is known as a '''von Neumann [[Space probe|probe]]'''. Other variants include the [[#Berserkers|Berserker]] and an automated [[terraforming]] seeder ship.

== Theory ==
In theory, a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighbouring planetary system, where it would seek out raw materials (extracted from [[asteroid]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[gas giant]]s, etc.) to create replicas of itself. These replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems. The original "parent" probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.

Given this pattern, and its similarity to the reproduction patterns of bacteria, it has been pointed out that von Neumann machines might be considered a form of life. In his short story, "Lungfish" (see [[Self-replicating machines in fiction]]), [[David Brin]] touches on this idea, pointing out that self-replicating machines launched by different species might actually compete with one another (in a [[Darwinism|Darwinistic]] fashion) for raw material, or even have conflicting missions. Given enough variety of "species" they might even form a type of [[ecology]], or – should they also have a form of [[artificial intelligence]] – a society. They may even mutate with untold thousands of "generations".

The first quantitative engineering analysis of such a spacecraft was published in 1980 by [[Robert Freitas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=33|date=July 1980| pages=251–264| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm| bibcode=1980JBIS...33..251F}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the non-replicating [[Project Daedalus]] design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a "seed" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, over a 500-year period, and then use the resulting [[automatic factory|automated industrial complex]] to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

It has been theorized&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ComparisonReproNov1980.htm Comparison of Reproducing and Nonreproducing Starprobe Strategies for Galactic Exploration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a self-replicating starship utilizing relatively conventional theoretical methods of interstellar travel (i.e., no exotic [[faster-than-light]] propulsion, and speeds limited to an "average cruising speed" of 0.1'''[[Speed of light|c]]'''.) could spread throughout a [[galaxy]] the size of the [[Milky Way]] in as little as half a million years.

==Implications for Fermi's paradox==
In 1981, [[Frank Tipler]]&lt;ref name="Tipler"&gt;"Extraterrestrial Beings Do Not Exist", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 21, number 267 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; put forth an argument that [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] intelligences do not exist, based on the absence of von Neumann probes. Given even a moderate rate of replication and the history of the galaxy, such probes should already be common throughout space and thus, we should have already encountered them. Because we have not, this shows that extraterrestrial intelligences do not exist. This is thus a resolution to the [[Fermi paradox]] – that is, the question of why we have not ''already'' encountered extraterrestrial intelligence if it is common throughout the universe.

A response&lt;ref name="Sagan and Newman"&gt;Sagan, Carl and Newman, William: "The Solipsist Approach to Extraterrestrial Intelligence", ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society'', vol. 24, number 113 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; came from [[Carl Sagan]] and William Newman. Now known as ''Sagan's Response'', it pointed out that in fact Tipler had underestimated the rate of replication, and that von Neumann probes should have already started to consume most of the mass in the galaxy. Any intelligent race would therefore, Sagan and Newman reasoned, not design von Neumann probes in the first place, and would try to destroy any von Neumann probes found as soon as they were detected. As Robert Freitas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=Extraterrestrial Intelligence in the Solar System: Resolving the Fermi Paradox| journal=J. Brit. Interplanet. Soc.| volume=36|date=November 1983| pages=496–500| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ResolvingFermi1983.htm| bibcode=1983JBIS...36..496F}}&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out, the assumed capacity of von Neumann probes described by both sides of the debate are unlikely in reality, and more modestly reproducing systems are unlikely to be observable in their effects on our Solar System or the Galaxy as a whole.

Another objection to the prevalence of von Neumann probes is that civilizations of the type that could potentially create such devices may have inherently short lifetimes, and self-destruct before so advanced a stage is reached, through such events as [[biological warfare|biological]] or [[nuclear warfare]], [[grey goo|nanoterrorism]], [[resource depletion|resource exhaustion]], [[environmental disaster|ecological catastrophe]], or [[pandemic]]s.

Simple workarounds exist to avoid the over-replication scenario. [[Radio]] transmitters, or other means of wireless communication, could be used by probes programmed not to replicate beyond a certain density (such as five probes per cubic [[parsec]]) or arbitrary limit (such as ten million within one century), analogous to the [[Hayflick limit]] in cell reproduction.  One problem with this defence against uncontrolled replication is that it would only require a single probe to malfunction and begin unrestricted reproduction for the entire approach to fail – essentially a technological cancer – unless each probe also has the ability to detect such malfunction in its neighbours and implements a seek and destroy protocol (which in turn could lead to probe-on-probe space wars if faulty probes first managed to multiply to high numbers before they were found by sound ones, which could then well have programming to replicate to matching numbers so as to manage the infestation).  Another workaround is based on the need for spacecraft heating during long interstellar travel.  The use of plutonium as a thermal source would limit the ability to self-replicate.  The spacecraft would have no programming to make more plutonium even if it found the required raw materials.  Another is to program the spacecraft with a clear understanding of the dangers of uncontrolled replication.

== Applications for self-replicating spacecraft ==
The details of the mission of self-replicating starships can vary widely from proposal to proposal, and the only common trait is the self-replicating nature.

=== Von Neumann probes ===
A von Neumann probe is a spacecraft capable of replicating itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is named after [[Hungarian American]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] [[John von Neumann]], who rigorously studied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called "Universal Assemblers" and which are often referred to as "[[Self-replicating machine|von Neumann machines]]".  While von Neumann never applied his work to the idea of spacecraft, theoreticians since then have done so.

If a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life (or a primitive, low-level culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attempt to make contact (this variant is known as a [[Bracewell probe]]), or even interfere with or guide the evolution of life in some way.

Physicist [[Paul Davies]] of [[Arizona State University]] has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own [[Moon]], having arrived at some point in Earth's ancient prehistory and remained to monitor Earth{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which is very reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'' and the [[Stanley Kubrick]] [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'']].

A variant idea on the interstellar von Neumann probe idea is that of the "[[Astrochicken]]", proposed by [[Freeman Dyson]]. While it has the common traits of self-replication, exploration, and communication with its "home base", Dyson conceived the Astrochicken to explore and operate within our own [[planetary system]], and not explore interstellar space.

Oxford-based philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] discusses the idea that future powerful [[superintelligence]]s will create efficient cost-effective space travel and interstellar Von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom 2003 Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anders Sandberg]] and Stuart Armstrong argued that launching the colonization of the entire reachable universe through self-replicating probes is well within the capabilities of a star-spanning civilization, and proposed a theoretical approach for achieving it in 32 years, by mining planet Mercury for resources and constructing a [[Dyson sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson Swarm]] around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf Eternity in six hours: intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox]. Stuart Armstrong, Anders Sandberg, Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berserkers ===
{{noref|section|date=September 2018}}
&lt;!-- [[Berserker probe]] section-redirects here --&gt;

A variant of the self-replicating starship is the ''Berserker''. Unlike the benign probe concept, Berserkers are programmed to seek out and exterminate lifeforms and life-bearing [[exoplanets]] whenever they are encountered.

The name is derived from the ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' series of novels by [[Fred Saberhagen]] which describe a war between humanity and such machines. Saberhagen points out (through one of his characters) that the Berserker warships in his novels are not von Neumann machines themselves, but the larger complex of Berserker machines – including automated shipyards – ''do'' constitute a von Neumann machine. This again brings up the concept of an ecology of von Neumann machines, or even a von Neumann hive entity.

It is speculated in fiction that Berserkers could be created and launched by a [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] civilization (see ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', by [[Greg Bear]], in the section [[#In fiction|In fiction]] below) or could theoretically "mutate" from a more benign probe. For instance, a von Neumann ship designed for [[terraforming]] processes – mining a planet's surface and adjusting its atmosphere to more human-friendly conditions – might malfunction and attack inhabited planets, killing their inhabitants in the process of changing the planetary environment, and then self-replicate and dispatch more ships to attack other planets.

=== Replicating seeder ships ===
Yet another variant on the idea of the self-replicating starship is that of the seeder ship. Such starships might store the genetic patterns of lifeforms from their home world, perhaps even of the species which created it. Upon finding a habitable [[exoplanet]], or even one that might be [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed, it would try to replicate such lifeforms – either from [[embryo space colonization|stored embryos]] or from stored information using [[molecular nanotechnology]] to build [[zygotes]] with varying genetic information from local raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Tipler, Frank J. "Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist."  Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 21 (1980): page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such ships might be terraforming vessels, preparing colony worlds for later colonization by other vessels, or – should they be programmed to recreate, raise, and educate individuals of the species that created it – self-replicating colonizers themselves. Seeder ships would be a suitable alternative to [[Generation ship]]s as a way to colonize worlds too distant to travel to in one lifetime.

==In fiction==
	
{{See also|Self-replicating machines in fiction}}
	 
=== Von Neumann probes ===
	 
* ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'': The [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]]s in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[book]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[film]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' were intended to be self-replicating probes, though the artifacts in "[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]", Clarke's original short story upon which 2001 was based, were not.  The film was to begin with a series of scientists explaining how probes like these would be the most efficient method of exploring outer space. Kubrick cut the opening segment from his film at the last minute, however, and these monoliths became almost mystical entities in both the film and Clarke's novel.
	 
* ''[[Cold as Ice (novel)|Cold As Ice]]'': In the novel by [[Charles Sheffield]], there is a segment where the author (a physicist) describes Von Neumann machines harvesting [[sulfur]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[helium-4]], and various metals from the atmosphere of [[Jupiter]].
	 
* ''[[Destiny's Road]]'': [[Larry Niven]] frequently refers to Von Neumann probes in many of his works. In his 1998 book ''Destiny's Road'', Von Neumann machines are scattered throughout the human colony world Destiny and its moon Quicksilver in order to build and maintain technology and to make up for the lack of the resident humans' technical knowledge; the Von Neumann machines primarily construct a stretchable fabric cloth capable of acting as a [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]] which serves as the humans' primary energy source. The Von Neumann machines also engage in ecological maintenance and other exploratory work.

* ''[[No Man's Sky]]'': In the video game ''No Man's Sky'' mysterious probes called Sentinels roam all the planets in the entire galaxy, analyzing the fauna and flora and protecting them from extinction. It is likely these probes have self-replicated for centuries and managed to spread through the galaxy.
	 
* ''[[The Devil's Blind Spot]]'': See also [[Alexander Kluge]], ''The Devil's Blind Spot'' (New Directions; 2004.)
	 
* ''[[Spin (novel)|Spin]]'': In the novel by [[Robert Charles Wilson]], Earth is veiled by a temporal field. Humanity tries to understand and escape this field by using Von Neumann probes. It is later revealed that the field itself was generated by Von Neumann probes from another civilization, and that a competition for resources had taken place between earth's and the aliens' probes.
	 
* ''[[The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000-3000]]'': In the book by [[Brian Stableford]] and [[David Langford]] (published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], Inc. 1985) humanity sends cycle-limited Von Neumann probes out to the nearest stars to do open-ended exploration and to announce humanity's existence to whoever might encounter them.
	 
* ''[[Von Neumann's War]]'': In ''Von Neumann's War'' by [[John Ringo]] and [[Travis S. Taylor]] (published by [[Baen Books]] in 2007) Von Neumann probes arrive in the solar system, moving in from the outer planets, and converting all metals into gigantic structures. Eventually, they arrive on Earth, wiping out much of the population before being beaten back when humanity [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineers]] some of the probes.
	 
* ''[[Grey Goo (video game)|Grey Goo]]'': In the video game ''Grey Goo'', the "Goo" faction is composed entirely of Von Neumann probes sent through various microscopic wormholes to map the Milky Way Galaxy. The faction's units are configurations of nanites used during their original mission of exploration, which have adapted to a combat role. The Goo starts as an antagonist to the Human and Beta factions, but their true objective is revealed during their portion of the single-player campaign. Related to, and inspired by, the [[Grey Goo]] doomsday scenario.

* ''We Are Legion (We Are Bob)'' by [[Dennis E. Taylor]]: Bob Johansson, the former owner of a software company, dies in a car accident, only to wake up a hundred years later as a computer emulation of Bob. Given a Von Neumann probe by America's religious replacement, he is sent out to explore, exploit, expand, and experiment for the good of the human race.

=== Berserkers ===
	 
* In the science fiction short story collection ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' by [[Fred Saberhagen]], a series of short stories include accounts of battles fought against extremely destructive Berserker machines. This and subsequent books set in the same [[fictional universe]] are the origin of the term "Berserker probe".
	 
* In the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|2003 miniseries]] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (and the subsequent [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|2004 series]]) the Cylons are similar to Berserkers in their wish to destroy human life. They were created by humans in a group of fictional planets called the Twelve Colonies. The Cylons created special models that look like humans in order to destroy the twelve colonies and later, the fleeing fleet of surviving humans.
	 
* The [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' – a self-replicating bio-mechanical race that is dedicated to the task of achieving perfection through the assimilation of useful technology and lifeforms. Their ships are massive mechanical cubes (a close step from the Berserker's massive mechanical Spheres).
	 
* Science fiction author [[Larry Niven]] later borrowed this notion in his short story "[[Limits (novel)|A Teardrop Falls]]".
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Star Control II]]'', the [[Slylandro]] Probe is an out-of-control self-replicating probe that attacks [[starship]]s of other races. They were not originally intended to be a berserker probe; they sought out intelligent life for peaceful contact, but due to a programming error, they would immediately switch to "resource extraction" mode and attempt to dismantle the target ship for raw materials. While the plot claims that the probes reproduce "at a geometric rate", the game itself caps the frequency of encountering these probes. It is possible to deal with the menace in a side-quest, but this is not necessary to complete the game, as the probes only appear one at a time, and the player's ship will eventually be fast and powerful enough to outrun them or destroy them for resources – although the probes will eventually dominate the entire game universe.
	 
* In [[Iain Banks]]' novel ''[[Excession]]'', hegemonising swarms are described as a form of [[Outside Context Problem]]. An example of an "Aggressive Hegemonising Swarm Object" is given as an uncontrolled self-replicating probe with the goal of turning all matter into copies of itself.  After causing great damage, they are somehow transformed using unspecified techniques by the [[Zetetic Elench]] and become "Evangelical Hegemonising Swarm Objects". Such swarms (referred to as "smatter") reappear in the later novels ''[[Surface Detail]]'' (which features scenes of space combat against the swarms) and ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.
	 
* The [[Inhibitors (Revelation Space)|Inhibitors]] from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' ''[[Revelation Space]]'' series are self-replicating machines whose purpose is to inhibit the development of intelligent star-faring cultures.  They are dormant for extreme periods of time until they detect the presence of a space-faring culture and proceed to exterminate it even to the point of sterilizing entire planets.  They are very difficult to destroy as they seem to have faced every type of weapon ever devised and only need a short time to 'remember' the necessary counter-measures.
	 
* Also from [[Alastair Reynolds]]' books, the "Greenfly" terraforming machines are another form of berserker machines. For unknown reasons, but probably an error in their programming, they destroy planets and turn them into trillions of domes filled with vegetation – after all, their purpose is to produce a habitable environment for humans, however in doing so they inadvertently decimate the human race. By 10,000, they have wiped out most of the Galaxy.
	 
* The [[Reapers (Mass Effect)|Reapers]] in the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' are also self-replicating probes bent on destroying any advanced civilization encountered in the galaxy. They lie dormant in the vast spaces between the galaxies and follow a cycle of extermination. It is seen in ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' that they assimilate any advanced species.
	 
* [[Mantrid]] Drones from the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Lexx]]'' were an extremely aggressive type of self-replicating Berserker machine, eventually converting the majority of the matter in the universe into copies of themselves in the course of their quest to thoroughly exterminate humanity.
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Infection (Babylon 5)|Infection]]" showed a smaller scale berserker in the form of the Icarran War Machine. After being created with the goal of defeating an unspecified enemy faction, the War Machines proceeded to exterminate all life on the planet Icarra VII because they had been programmed with standards for what constituted a 'Pure Icaran' based on religious teachings, which no actual Icaran could satisfy. Because the Icaran were pre-starflight, the War Machines became dormant after completing their task rather than spreading. One unit was reactivated on-board Babylon 5 after being smuggled past quarantine by an unscrupulous archaeologist, but after being confronted with how they had rendered Icara VII a dead world, the simulated personality of the War Machine committed suicide. 
	 
* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[A Day in the Strife]]" features a probe that threatens the station with destruction unless a series of questions designed to test a civilization's level of advancement are answered correctly. The commander of the station correctly surmises that the probe is actually a berserker and that if the questions are answered the probe would identify them as a threat to its originating civilization and detonate.
	 
* [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[The Forge of God]]'' deals directly with the concept of "Berserker" von Neumann probes and their consequences.  The idea is further explored in the novel's sequel, ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'', which explores the reaction other civilizations have to the creation and release of Berserkers.
	 
* In [[Gregory Benford]]'s ''[[Galactic Center Saga]]'' series, an antagonist berserker machine race is encountered by Earth, first as a probe in ''[[In the Ocean of Night]]'', and then in an attack in ''[[Across the Sea of Suns]]''.  The berserker machines do not seek to completely eradicate a race if merely throwing it into a primitive low technological state will do as they did to the EMs encountered in ''Across the Sea of Suns''.  The alien machine Watchers would not be considered von Neumann machines themselves, but the collective machine race could.
	 
* On ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s were a vicious race of insect-like robots that were originally created by an android named Reese to serve as toys. They grew beyond her control and began evolving, eventually spreading throughout at least two galaxies. In addition to ordinary autonomous evolution they were able to analyze and incorporate new technologies they encountered into themselves, ultimately making them one of the most advanced "races" known. 
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', a second race of replicators created by the Ancients were encountered in the Pegasus Galaxy. They were created as a means to defeat the Wraith. The Ancients attempted to destroy them after they began showing signs of sentience and requested that their drive to kill the wraith be removed. This failed, and an unspecified length of time after the Ancients retreated to the Milky Way Galaxy, the replicators nearly succeeded in destroying the Wraith. The Wraith were able to hack into the replicators and deactivate the extermination drive, at which point they retreated to their home world and were not heard from again until encountered by the Atlantis Expedition. After the Atlantis Expedition reactivated this dormant directive, the replicators embarked on a plan to kill the Wraith by removing their food source, i.e. all humans in the Pegasus Galaxy.
	 
* In ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' Season 2, a galaxy billions of light years distant from the Milky Way is infested with drone ships that are programmed to annihilate intelligent life and advanced technology. The drone ships attack other space ships (including [[List of starships in Stargate#Destiny|Destiny]]) as well as humans on planetary surfaces, but don't bother destroying primitive technology such as buildings unless they are harboring intelligent life or advanced technology.
	 
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[List of Justice League episodes#ep10|Dark Heart]]", an alien weapon based on this same idea lands on Earth.
	 
* In the ''[[Homeworld: Cataclysm]]'' video game, a bio-mechanical virus called ''Beast'' has the ability to alter organic and mechanic material to suit its needs, and the ships infected become self-replicating hubs for the virus.
	 
* In the SF [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] ''[[EVE Online]]'', experiments to create more autonomous drones than the ones used by player's ships accidentally created 'rogue drones' which form hives in certain parts of space and are used extensively in missions as difficult opponents.
	 
* In the computer game ''[[Sword of the Stars]]'', the player may randomly encounter "Von Neumann". A Von Neumann mothership appears along with smaller Von Neumann probes, which attack and consume the player's ships.  The probes then return to the mothership, returning the consumed material.  If probes are destroyed, the mothership will create new ones.  If all the player's ships are destroyed, the Von Neumann probes will reduce the planets resource levels before leaving.  The probes appear as blue octahedrons, with small spheres attached to the apical points.  The mothership is a larger version of the probes. In the 2008 expansion ''A Murder of Crows'', Kerberos Productions also introduces the VN Berserker, a combat oriented ship, which attacks player planets and ships in retaliation to violence against VN Motherships. If the player destroys the Berserker things will escalate and a System Destroyer will attack.
	 
* In the ''[[X (computer game series)|X Computer Game Series]]'', the [[X (game series)#Featured races|Xenon]] are a malevolent race of [[AI|artificially intelligent]] machines descended from terraforming ships sent out by humans to prepare worlds for eventual colonization; the result caused by a bugged software update.  They are continual antagonists in the [[X (computer game series)#The X Universe|X-Universe]].
	 
* In the comic ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' a character mentions "Von Neumann rectal infestations" which are apparently caused by "Shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks that build more shit-ticks".
	 
* In the anime ''[[Vandread]]'', harvester ships attack vessels from both male- and female-dominated factions and harvest hull, reactors, and computer components to make more of themselves. To this end, Harvester ships are built around mobile factories. Earth-born humans also view the inhabitants of the various colonies to be little more than spare parts.
	 
* In ''[[Earth 2160]]'', the Morphidian Aliens rely on {{Not a typo|Mantain}} strain aliens for colonization. Most {{Not a typo|Mantain}}-derived aliens can absorb water, then reproduce like a colony of cells. In this manner, even one {{Not a typo|Mantain}} Lady (or Princess, or Queen) can create enough clones to cover the map. Once they have significant numbers, they "choose an evolutionary path" and swarm the enemy, taking over their resources.
	 
* In the European comic series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' No 20 &amp; 21 goes over this subject. A kind of bezerk von Neumann is set to collision course with the pandarve system.
	 
* In PC role-playing game ''[[Space Rangers (video game)|Space Rangers]]'' and its sequel ''[[Space Rangers 2: Dominators]]'', a league of 5 nations battles three different types of Berserker robots. One that focuses on invading planets, another that battles normal space and third that lives in hyperspace.
	 
* In the ''[[Star Wolves]]'' video game series, Berserkers are a self-replicating machine menace that threatens the known universe for purposes of destruction and/or assimilation of humanity.
	 
* The [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] features the World Devastators, large ships designed and built by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] that tear apart planets to use its materials to build other ships or even upgrade or replicate themselves.
	 
* The Tet in the 2013 film ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' is revealed to be a Berserker of sorts: a sentient machine that travels from planet to planet, exterminating the indigenous population using armies of robotic drones and cloned members of the target species. The Tet then proceeds to harvest the planet's water in order to extract hydrogen for [[nuclear fusion]].
	 
* In ''[[Eclipse Phase]]'', an ETI probe is believed to have infected the TITAN computer systems with the Exsurgent virus to cause them to go berserk and wage war on humanity. This would make ETI probes a form of berserker, albeit one that uses pre-existing computer systems as its key weapons.
	 
* In ''[[Herr aller Dinge]]'' by [[Andreas Eschbach]], an ancient nano machine complex is discovered buried in a glacier off the coast of Russia. When it comes in contact with materials it needs to fulfill its mission, it creates a launch facility and launches a space craft. It is later revealed that the nano machines were created by a pre-historic human race with the intention of destroying other interstellar civilizations (for an unknown reason). It is purposed that the reason there is no evidence of the race is because of the nano-machines themselves and their ability to manipulate matter at an atomic level. It is even suggested that viruses could be ancient nano machines that have evolved over time.
	 
=== Replicating Seeder Ships ===
	 
* ''[[Code of the Lifemaker]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]] describes the evolution of a society of humanoid-like robots who inhabit Saturn's moon Titan. The sentient machines are descended from an unmanned factory ship that was to be self replicating, but suffered radiation damage and went off course, eventually landing on Titan around 1,000,000 BC.
	 
* ''[[Manifold: Space]]'', [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s novel, starts with the discovery of alien self-replicating machines active within the Solar system.
	 
* In the ''[[Metroid Prime: Trilogy|Metroid Prime]]'' subseries of games, the massive Leviathans are probes routinely sent out from the planet Phaaze to infect other planets with Phazon radiation and eventually turn these planets into clones of Phaaze, where the self-replication process can continue.
	 
* In [[David Brin]]'s short story collection, ''[[The River of Time]]'' (1986), the short story "Lungfish" prominently features von Neumann probes.&lt;ref&gt;The complete text of the story has been placed on the author's website at [http://www.davidbrin.com/lungfish1.html davidbrin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does he explore the concept of the probes themselves, but indirectly explores the ideas of competition between different designs of probes, evolution of von Neumann probes in the face of such competition, and the development of a type of ecology between von Neumann probes. One of the vessels mentioned is clearly a Seeder type.
	 
* In ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], humanity on a future Earth facing imminent destruction creates automated seedships that act as [[fire and forget]] lifeboats aimed at distant, habitable worlds. Upon landing, the ship begins to create new humans from stored genetic information, and an onboard computer system raises and trains the first few generations of new inhabitants. The massive ships are then broken down and used as building materials by their "children".
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode "[[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)#ep95|Remnants]]", the Atlantis team finds an ancient probe that they later learn was launched by a now-extinct, technologically advanced race in order to seed new worlds and re-propagate their silicon-based species. The probe communicated with inhabitants of Atlantis by means of hallucinations.
	 
* On the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' episode "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 4)#ep75|Scorched Earth]]", a species of newly relocated humanoids face extinction via an automated terraforming colony seeder ship controlled by an [[Artificial Intelligence]].
	 
* On ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', the human adventurers live on a ship called ''Destiny''. Its mission was to connect a network of [[Stargate (device)|Stargates]], placed by preceding seeder ships on planets capable of supporting life to allow instantaneous travel between them.
	 
* The trilogy of albums which conclude the comic book series ''[[Storm (Don Lawrence)|Storm]]'' by [[Don Lawrence]] (starting with ''Chronicles of Pandarve 11: The Von Neumann machine'') is based on self-replicating conscious machines containing the sum of all human knowledge employed to rebuild human society throughout the universe in case of disaster on Earth. The probe malfunctions and although new probes are built, they do not separate from the motherprobe, which eventually results in a cluster of malfunctioning probes so big that it can absorb entire moons.

The term '''social identity approach''' refers to research and theory pertaining to two intertwined, but distinct, [[social psychology|social psychological]] theories.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=J. C.|title=Some current issues in research on social identity and self-categorization theories|journal=Social identity|year=1999|pages=6–34|editor1-first=N.|editor1-last=Ellemers|editor2-first=R.|editor2-last=Spears|editor3-first=B.|editor3-last=Doosje|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A.

Rediscovering Social Identity: Core Sources. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These being: [[social identity theory]] and [[self-categorization theory]]. The social identity approach has been applied to a wide variety of fields and continues to be very influential. There is a high citation rate for key social identity papers and that rate continues to increase.&lt;ref name="Postmes, T. &amp; Branscombe, N. (2010)"/&gt;

==Aspects==
[[Image:SIT approach.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=A graphical representation of the content overlap or self-categorization and social identity theories.|Figure 1. The explanatory profiles of social identity and self-categorization theories.]]The term "social identity approach" arose as an attempt to mitigate against the tendency to conflate the two theories,&lt;ref name="brown2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Rupert|title=Social Identity Theory: past achievements, current problems and future challenges|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1 November 2000 |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=745–778 |doi=10.1002/1099-0992(200011/12)30:6&lt;745::AID-EJSP24&gt;3.0.CO;2-O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al., (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = S.

T. | editor1-last = Postmes | editor1-first = T. | editor2-last = Branscombe | editor2-first = N. R. | year = 2010 | title = The social identity perspective today: An overview of its defining ideas | journal = Rediscovering social identity | pages = 341–356 | publisher =  Psychology Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the tendency to mistakenly believe one theory to be a component of the other. Instead these theories should be thought of as overlapping in the manner demonstrated in Fig 1.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; That is, while there are similarities, self categorisation theory has greater explanatory scope (i.e. is less focused on intergroup relationships specifically) and has been investigated in a broader range of empirical conditions. Self-categorization theory can also be thought of as developed to address limitations of social identity theory.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt; Specifically the limited manner in which social identity theory deals with the cognitive processes that underpin the behaviour it describes.

Although this term may be useful when contrasting broad social psychological movements, when applying either theory it is thought of as beneficial to distinguish carefully between the two theories in such a way that their specific characteristics can be retained.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;

==Implications==

===Social groups===
The social identity approach has been contrasted with the [[Social group#Social cohesion approach|social cohesion approach]] when it comes to defining [[social group]]s. The social identity approach describes the state of people thinking of themselves and others as a group. Therefore three intrapsychological processes proceed. Firstly, social categorization (see [[self-categorization theory]]) means that people organize social information by categorizing people into groups. Secondly, social comparison (see [[social comparison theory]]) means that people give a meaning to those categories in order to understand the task of the group in the specific situation. Thirdly, social identification is the process in which people relate the self to one of those categories.

Regarding the relation between collective identification and work motivation, several propositions have been made regarding situational influences, the acceptance of the leader and the self-definition of a collective. As a situational influence, research says that individuals are activated by situations that challenge their inclusion to the group. The acceptance of the leader is another proposition. The so-called ingroup-favoring-bias (see [[in-group favoritism]]) means that if the team leader is interpreted as an ingroup member, the other team members will attribute his or her good behavior internally while they will attribute bad behavior externally. For self-definition of a collective the value of the group as well as the belief in current and future success is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellemers, Gilder &amp; Haslam|first=|year=2004|title=Motivating Individuals and Groups at Work: A Social Identity Perspective on Leadership and Group Performance|url=|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=29 |issue=3|pages=459–478|via=|doi=10.2307/20159054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely linked to self-definition to a collective, [[Group cohesiveness|cohesion]] is another construct that has an impact on the development of group motivation and in a broader sense also to the group performance.

On the topic of social groups, some social psychologists draw a distinction between different types of group phenomenon. Specifically, "those that derive from interpersonal relationships and [[interdependence]] with specific others and those that derive from membership in larger, more impersonal collectives or social categories".&lt;ref name="Brewer &amp; Gardner (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = M. B. | last2 = Gardner | first2 = W. | year = 1996 | title = Who is this ''we''? Levels of collective identity and self representations | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | series = | pages = 83–93 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social identity approach however does not anticipate this distinction. Instead it anticipates that the same psychological processes underlie intergroup and intragroup phenomenon involving both small and large groups. Relatedly, the persistent perception that the social identity approach is only relevant to large group phenomenon has led some social identity theorists to specifically reassert (both theoretically and empirically) the relevance of the social identity approach to small group interactions.&lt;ref name="postmes2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Postmes|first=Tom|last2=Haslam |first2=S. Alexander |last3=Swaab |first3=Roderick I. |title=Social influence in small groups: An interactive model of social identity formation|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|date=1 January 2005 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1–42 |doi=10.1080/10463280440000062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Leadership===
{{main|Leadership}}

According to the social identity approach, leadership is a function of the group instead of the individual.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="hogg2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A. |title=A social identity theory of leadership |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |date=1 August 2001 | volume=5| issue=3| pages=184–200| doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0503_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who are leaders in their groups tend to be closer to the prototypical group member than are followers.&lt;ref name="Platow et al. (1997)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Platow | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Hoar | first2 = S. | last3 = Reid | first3 = S. | last4 = Harley | first4 = K. | last5 = Morrison | first5 = D. | year = 1997 | title = Endorsement of distributively fair and unfair leaders in interpersonal and intergroup situations | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 465–496 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199707)27:4&lt;465::aid-ejsp817&gt;3.0.co;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, they tend to be more socially attractive, which makes it easier for group members to accept their authority and comply with their decisions.   Finally, leaders tend to be viewed by others as the leader.  In this final distinction, group members attribute leadership traits to the person and not the situation, furthering the distinction between the leader and others in the group by viewing him or her as special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A.|last2=Terry |first2=Deborah J. |title=Social identity and self-categorization processes in organizational contexts|journal=Academy of Management Review |date=1 January 2000 | volume=25| issue=1| pages=121–140| doi=10.2307/259266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent with this view of leadership, researchers have found that individuals can manipulate their own leadership status in groups by portraying themselves as prototypical to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haslam |first=S. Alexander |last2=Reicher |first2=Stephen D. |last3=Platow |first3=Michael J. |title=The new psychology of leadership: Identity, influence and power |year=2011 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-84169-610-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Social identity concepts have been applied to [[economics]] resulting in what is now known as [[identity economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Garai, Laszlo: [http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Identity_Economics.htm Identity Economics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akerlof3"&gt;Akerlof, George A., and Rachel E. Kranton (2010). ''Identity Economics: How Our Identities Shape Our Work, Wages, and Well-Being'', Princeton University Press, "Introduction," pp. [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9108.pdf 3–8], and [https://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=1gKUpITuf00C preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two separate papers and a book by [[George Akerlof|Akerlof]] and [[Rachel Kranton|Kranton]] incorporate social identity as a factor in the [[principal–agent problem|principal–agent model]]. The main conclusion is that when agents consider themselves insiders, they will maximize their identity utility by exerting greater effort compared to the prescription behavior. On the other hand, if they consider themselves outsiders, they will require a higher wage to compensate their loss for behavior difference with prescribed behaviors.&lt;ref name="Akerlof3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akerlof1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akerlof | first1 = George A. | last2 = Kranton | first2 = Rachel E. | year = 2000 | title = Economics and Identity | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 115 | issue = 3| pages = 715–53 | doi=10.1162/003355300554881}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akerlof2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akerlof | first1 = George A. | last2 = Kranton | first2 = Rachel E. | year = 2005 | title = Identity and the Economics of Organizations | url = http://econ.duke.edu/~rek8/identityandtheeconomicsoforganizations.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 9–32 | doi=10.1257/0895330053147930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social identity model of deindividuation effects===
{{main|Social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE)}}

The social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) was developed from further research on the social identity theory and the self-categorization theory, further specifying the effects of situational factors on the functioning of  processes proposed by the two theories. The SIDE model uses this framework to explain cognitive effects of visibility and anonymity in intra-group and inter-group contexts. The model is based on the idea that the self-concept is flexible and different in different situations or contexts. The theory consists of a range of different self-categories that define people as unique individuals or in terms of their membership to specific social groups and other, broader social categories based on the context of the situation. The SIDE model proposes that anonymity shifts both the focus of self-awareness from the individual self to the group self and the perceptions of others from being mostly interpersonal to being group-based (stereotyping).&lt;ref name=lea2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lea|first=Martin|author2=Spears, R., de Groot, D.|title=Knowing Me, Knowing You: Anonymity Effects on Social Identity Processes within Groups|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 May 2001|volume=27|issue=5|pages=526–537|doi=10.1177/0146167201275002|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/27/5/526|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has suggested that visual anonymity not only increases negative behavior towards others, but can also promote positive social relations. In one study, all volunteers participated individually in group discussion based on three different topics. In the visually anonymous condition, all communications between participants were text-based while in the visually identifiable condition, the communication was also supplemented by two-way video cameras. The study resulted in the findings that showed anonymity significantly increased group attraction.&lt;ref  name=lea2001 /&gt;

===Intergroup emotion theory===

Intergroup emotion theory further expands on the concept of personally significant group memberships as posed by social identity and self-categorization theories. This theory is primarily based on the concept of [[Self-categorization theory#Depersonalization and self-stereotyping|depersonalization]] and the interchangeability of the self with other [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]]  members. This causes cognitive representations of the self and the group to become inevitably connected, and therefore the group obtains an emotional significance. This means that individuals not only categorize themselves as members of the ingroup but also "react emotionally when situations or events affect the ingroup".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=D. A.|title=Effects of Intergroup Contact and Political Predispositions on Prejudice: Role of Intergroup Emotions|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|date=1 July 2004|volume=7|issue=3|pages=221–237|doi=10.1177/1368430204046109|url=http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/7/3/221|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people often report that their group is being discriminated against, even though they feel that they personally are not subject to that discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J. A.|title=The relationship between the contact variable and racial stereotyping in school-aged children|journal=U South Carolina, Dissertation Abstracts International|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Social identity vs. interdependence===
Some researchers have claimed that the majority of results in research using the [[minimal group paradigm]] can be derived from self-interest and interdependence and that this poses a serious problem for social identity theory and self-categorization theory, and in particular self-categorization theory's account of social groups.&lt;ref name="Rabbie et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1485) [[Accademia, Venice]]]]
'''Somatocentrism''' is a [[cultural]] [[value system]] in which [[biological determinism]] is the basis for social organization.  The [[phenotypical]] variation of an individual in this system determines the individual’s [[social identity]] and [[social relations]], although it doesn’t necessarily denote their [[social position]].  
== Definition ==

The term ‘somatocentric’ is derived from 
* “soma”, [[New Latin]], meaning ‘[[Human body|body]]’
* and “centric” from the [[Greek language|Greek]] “kentrikos”, meaning of the center.  
In this system, the [[physical body]] of an individual is heavily emphasized, and valued in determining the [[social identity]] of the individual.

== Perception ==
A necessary precondition for individuals in a somatocentric system is the privileging of [[Visual perception|sight]] over other [[senses]] in perceiving [[reality]].  Using vision as the primary sense for constructing [[reality]] may cause one to miss complex and hidden nuances of [[existence]], limiting [[perception]].&lt;ref&gt;Coetzee, Pieter Hendrik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eJCkw7e05p4C&amp;pg=PA467 ''Race and Gender''], 28 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  A comparison of [[Visual perception|sight]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] shows that sight is mono-directional and exclusive, while sound is proximate, fluid, and inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, David: ''History of Bourgeois Perception''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982, pp. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Privileging [[Visual perception|sight]] over other senses facilitates a type of [[self-image]] that focus on the individual's body, as vision is the primary means to delineate phenotypical difference.  Identifying these differences this way may lead to attributing social value to individuals who look a certain way.

=== Body Image ===
[[Body image]] is a [[subjectivity|subjective]] picture of one’s own [[human physical appearance|physical appearance]] established both by [[self-awareness]] and by noting the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online, ''Body image'', "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/body%20image]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Preoccupation with body image and the physical appearance of one’s body denotes how much value one ascribes to their phenotypical traits.  Body image may be valued highly, and more often than not, dissatisfaction with one’s own body image perverts that value with other social effects.

==== Body Dysmorphic Disorder ====
People who suffer from [[Body Dysmorphic Disorder]] (or BDD) fixate on a defect in their appearance.  People with BDD are affected daily with [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[anxiety]], which may impair their role in the social and occupational areas of their life. The amount of social value ascribed to the importance of body image affects the level of stress someone suffering from BDD feels. &lt;ref&gt;Fox, Kate. ''Body Image Studies'', 1997. "[http://www.mybodybeautiful.co.uk/body_image/BodyImage_Studies.htm]", 25 September 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; 
==== Height ====
Studies show that in some cultures, people who are relatively taller than others get relatively better treatment by their peers. 

A study conducted in [[Australia]] found that tall people earn higher [[wages]] than their equally competent shorter co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Kathy. ''Tall men earn $1000 more than short ones'', 17 May 2009. "[http://www.news.com.au/features/tall-men-earn-1000-more-than-short-ones/story-e6frfl49-1225713033720]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted in [[Southampton]] of ninety two normal teens who were shorter than their peers revealed that the shorter boys were twice as likely to be [[bullied]] than their average height controls matched by sex and age.&lt;ref&gt;Voss, Linda D. and Mulligan, Jean. ''Bullying in school: are short pupils at risk?'', 1 November 2000. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32258/]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of these studies reveal a [[correlation]] between height and social value, indicating somatocentric issues.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists define ‘short stature’ as being two [[standard deviations]] below the [[average]] for a particular age and sex; in [[United States|America]], a male shorter than 5’7’’ and a female shorter than 5’2’’ are both short statured.&lt;ref&gt;"NOSSA, What is short statured?", 2011, "{{cite web |url=http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus/whatisshortstatured.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926233901/http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus/whatisshortstatured.html |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups have been formed by people who feel short, such as [[National Organization of Short Statured Adults|The National Organization of Short Statured Adults (NOSSA)]].  One of the primary functions of this group is to inform its members of the [[sociological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of being short statured as research continues.&lt;ref&gt;"NOSSA, About Us", 2011, "{{cite web |url=http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004121828/http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racism ===
[[Racism]] is defined by a belief that [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online, ''Racism'', "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism?show=0&amp;t=1316986204]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial differences are most easily compared by the phenotypical differences between peoples of a different race, i.e. [[Human skin color|skin tone]], facial features, [[hair color]], and [[body type]].  To place social value on any trait, whether positive or negative, is a product of somatocentric values.

=== Gender ===
A somatocentric culture may create [[Social constructionism|social constructs]] based on the interpretation of biological differences between its individuals.  The concept of ‘[[gender]]’ is an example of a [[social construct|construct]] that may arise from somatocentricity.  [[Sex and gender distinction|Sex and gender]] are loosely related as they both deal with the [[male]] and the [[female]]; however, one considers [[empirical]] distinction, while the other considers [[social]] distinction.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"&gt;[[Oyèrónkẹ́ Oyěwùmí|Oyewumi, Oyeronke]], ''The Invention of Women'', 1997, 5 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A sex refers to biological distinctions between males and females.  Certain [[Organ (anatomy)|biological structures]] are unique to either females or males; in humans, the [[ovary]] being unique to the former, the [[prostate gland]] being unique to the latter.  Biological differences between males and females govern the action of [[reproduction]] in any [[species]] that repopulates via [[sexual reproduction]], and in some cases, influence the action of child-rearing.

By contrast, [[gender roles]], [[gender identities]], and the concepts of [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] are all [[social constructs]] which may be extrapolated from phenotypical differences between men and women.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"/&gt;

For example, in [[Western culture]], women may fill domestic [[Role|social roles]], with an emphasis on [[Parenting|childcare]].  Women are also unique members of a population that are outfitted with [[breasts]] which help feed [[infants]], while men lack these [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].  While it is logical to assert that women may be biologically better suited for [[postnatal]] care of an [[infant]] than men, it does not follow from the ability to [[Breastfeeding|breast-feed]] that women are better suited to domestic [[Role|social roles]] than men.

==== Masculinity and Femininity ====
[[Masculinity]] and [[femininity]] are also engendered concepts that may draw from phenotypical difference between male and female.  A person who exhibits [[physical strength]] may be deemed [[masculine]], while a person who exhibits [[gentleness]] may be deemed [[feminine]].  Attributing significance to the phenotypical difference between the size or shape of men and women creates a [[binary opposition|binary]] between the two that allows the casual observer to presume social significance of a person in terms of this [[arbitrary]] scale.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"/&gt;

A '''sustainability report''' is an organizational report that gives information about economic, environmental, social and governance performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalreporting.org/information/sustainability-reporting/Pages/default.aspx |title=Sustainability Reporting |publisher=Globalreporting.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainability reporting''' is not just report generation from collected data; instead it is a method to internalize and improve an organization’s commitment to [[sustainable development]] in a way that can be demonstrated to both internal and external stakeholders.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== History ==
Corporate ''sustainability reporting'' has a history going back to [[environmental reporting]]. The first environmental reports were published in the late 1980s by companies in the [[chemical industry]] which had serious [[image problem]]s. The other group of early reporters was a group of committed small and medium-sized businesses with very advanced environmental management systems. Additionally, the [[tobacco industry]] adopted such reporting much earlier than the rest of the corporate world, in an attempt to attract new investors at a time when ethical investing was becoming increasingly popular.

Non-financial reporting, such as sustainability and [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] reporting, is a fairly recent trend which has expanded over the last twenty years. Many companies now produce an annual sustainability report and there are a wide array of ratings and standards around. There are a variety of reasons that companies choose to produce these reports, but at their core they are intended to be "vessels of transparency and accountability". Often they also intended to improve internal processes, engage stakeholders and persuade investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosie Bristow for the Guardian Professional Network |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/online-panel-discussion-sustainability-reporting |title=Online discussion: sustainability reporting &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiatives ==
Organizations can improve their sustainability performance by measuring ([[EthicalQuote|EthicalQuote (CEQ))]], monitoring and reporting on it, helping them have a positive impact on society, the economy, and a sustainable future. The key drivers for the quality of sustainability reports are the guidelines of the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalreporting.org/NewsEventsPress/PressResources/2011/G3.1SustainabilityReportingMostCompleteGuidanceEver.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425140841/http://www.globalreporting.org/NewsEventsPress/PressResources/2011/G3.1SustainabilityReportingMostCompleteGuidanceEver.htm |date=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (ACCA) award schemes or rankings.

'''Utopian socialism''' is a label used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Étienne Cabet]] and [[Robert Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html|title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism|publisher=Public Broadcasting System|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian socialism is often described as the presentation of visions and outlines for imaginary or futuristic ideal societies, with positive ideals being the main reason for moving society in such a direction. Later socialists and critics of utopian socialism viewed "utopian socialism" as not being grounded in actual material conditions of existing society and in some cases as reactionary. These visions of ideal societies competed with [[Marxist]]-inspired revolutionary social democratic movements.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;{{cite book|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0853457980|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label "utopian" by later socialists as a [[pejorative]] in order to imply ''naiveté'' and to dismiss their ideas as fanciful and unrealistic.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar school of thought that emerged in the early 20th century is [[ethical socialism]], which makes the case for socialism on moral grounds.

However, one key difference between utopian socialists and other socialists (including most [[anarchists]]) is that utopian socialists generally do not believe any form of class struggle or political revolution is necessary for socialism to emerge. Utopians believe that people of all classes can voluntarily adopt their plan for society if it is presented convincingly.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt; They feel their form of cooperative socialism can be established among like-minded people within the existing society and that their small communities can demonstrate the feasibility of their plan for society.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

== Definition ==
{{see also|Utopia}}
The thinkers identified as utopian socialist did not use the term "utopian" to refer to their ideas. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were the first thinkers to refer to them as "utopian", referring to all socialist ideas that simply presented a vision and distant goal of an ethically just society as utopian. This utopian mindset which held an integrated conception of the goal, the means to produce said goal and an understanding of the way that those means would inevitably be produced through examining social and economic phenomena can be contrasted with [[scientific socialism]], which has been likened to [[Taylorism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

This distinction was made clear in Engels' work ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' (1892, part of an earlier publication, the ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' from 1878). Utopian socialists were seen as wanting to expand the principles of the French revolution in order to create a more "rational" society. Despite being labeled as utopian by later socialists, their aims were not always utopian and their values often included rigid support for the scientific method and the creation of a society based upon scientific understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Chpt. 1)|author=Frederick Engels|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The term "utopian socialism" was introduced by Karl Marx in "For a Ruthless Criticism of Everything" in 1843 (and then developed in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in 1848), although shortly before its publication Marx had already attacked the ideas of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in ''[[The poverty of philosophy|Das Elend der Philosophie]]'' (originally written in French, 1847). The term was used by later socialist thinkers to describe early socialist or quasi-socialist intellectuals who created hypothetical visions of [[egalitarian]], [[communalist]], [[meritocratic]], or other notions of "perfect" societies without considering how these societies could be created or sustained.

In ''Das Elend der Philosophie'', English title ''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Marx criticized the [[Economics|economic]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] arguments of Proudhon set forth in ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]''. Marx accused Proudhon of wanting to rise above the [[bourgeoisie]]. In the history of Marx's thought and [[Marxism]], this work is pivotal in the distinction between the concepts of utopian socialism and what Marx and the Marxists claimed as scientific socialism.

Although utopian socialists shared few political, social, or economic perspectives, Marx and Engels argued that they shared certain intellectual characteristics. In ''The Communist Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich and Marx, Karl Heinrich. »Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei«. Edited by Sálvio M. Soares. MetaLibri, October 31, 2008, v1.0s.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels wrote: "The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favored. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see it in the best possible plan of the best possible state of society? Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, and endeavor, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel".

Marx and Engels used the term "scientific socialism" to describe the type of socialism they saw themselves developing. According to Engels, socialism was not "an accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain, but the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically developed classes{{spaced ndash}}the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Its task was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible, but to examine the historical-economic succession of events from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung, and to discover in the economic conditions thus created the means of ending the conflict".

Critics have argued that utopian socialists who established experimental communities were in fact trying to apply the [[scientific method]] to human social organization and were therefore not utopian. For instance, [[Joshua Muravchik]] on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s definition of science as "the practice of experimentation, of hypothesis and test" argued that "Owen and Fourier and their followers were the real ‘scientific socialists.’ They hit upon the idea of socialism, and they tested it by attempting to form socialist communities". Muravchik further argued that in contrast Marx made untestable predictions about the future and that Marx's view that socialism would be created by impersonal historical forces may lead one to conclude that it is unnecessary to strive for socialism because it will happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publication/the-rise-and-fall-of-socialism/ The Rise and Fall of Socialism] Joshua Muravchik SPEECHES AEI Bradley Lecture Series Publication Date: February 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]] overtook utopian socialism in terms of intellectual development and number of adherents. At one time almost half the population of the world lived under regimes that claimed to be Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/marx.html|author=Steven Kreis|title=Karl Marx, 1818-1883|publisher=The History Guide|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currents like [[Saint-Simonianism]] and [[Fourierism]] attracted the interest of numerous later authors but failed to compete with the now dominant Marxist, Proudhonist, or Leninist schools on a political level. It has been noted that they exerted a significant influence on the emergence of new religious movements such as [[spiritualism]] and [[occult]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, Julian (2016). "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926 Socialist Religion and the Emergence of Occultism: A Genealogical Approach to Socialism and Secularization in 19th-Century France]."

''Aries'' 16/1, pp. 13–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and in practice ==
Perhaps the first utopian socialist was [[Thomas More]] (1478–1535), who wrote about an imaginary socialist society in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516. The contemporary definition of the English word "utopia" derives from this work and many aspects of More's description of Utopia were influenced by life in [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C. Davis|title=Utopia and the Ideal Society: A Study of English Utopian Writing 1516-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5T-LVB-6tIC&amp;pg=PA58|date=28 July 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27551-4|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Robert Owen.png|thumb|[[Robert Owen]] was one of the founders of utopian socialism]]
[[File:Ehrerbietige Vorstellung und Einladung an meine lieben Mitmenschen.pdf|thumb|Utopian socialist pamphlet of Swiss social medical doctor [[Rudolf Sutermeister]] (1802–1868)]]
[[Saint-Simonianism]] was a [[France|French]] political and social movement of the first half of the 19th century, inspired by the ideas of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825). His ideas influenced [[Auguste Comte]] (who was, for a time, Saint-Simon's secretary), [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and many other thinkers and social theorists.

[[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858) was a successful Welsh businessman who devoted much of his profits to improving the lives of his employees. His reputation grew when he set up a textile factory in [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]], co-funded by his teacher, the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] and introduced shorter working hours, schools for children and renovated housing. He wrote about his ideas in his book ''A New View of Society'' which was published in 1813 and ''An Explanation of the Cause of Distress which pervades the civilized parts of the world'' in 1823. He also set up an [[Owenite]] commune called [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in [[Indiana]]. This collapsed when one of his business partners ran off with all the profits. Owen's main contribution to socialist thought was the view that human social behavior is not fixed or absolute and that humans have the free will to organize themselves into any kind of society they wished.

[[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) rejected the [[industrial revolution]] altogether and thus the problems that arose with it, Fourier made various fanciful claims about the ideal world he envisioned. Despite some clearly non-socialist inclinations,{{Clarify|date=November 2010}} he contributed significantly even if indirectly to the socialist movement. His writings about turning work into play influenced the young Karl Marx and helped him devise his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]. Also a contributor to [[feminism]], Fourier invented the concept of ''[[phalanstère]]'', units of people based on a theory of passions and of their combination. Several colonies based on Fourier's ideas were founded in the United States by [[Albert Brisbane]] and [[Horace Greeley]].

[[Étienne Cabet]] (1788–1856), influenced by Robert Owen, published a book in 1840 entitled ''Travel and adventures of Lord William Carisdall in Icaria'' in which he described an ideal [[communalist]] society. His attempts to form real socialist communities based on his ideas through the [[Icarians|Icarian movement]] did not survive, but one such community was the precursor of [[Corning, Iowa]]. Possibly inspired by [[Christianity]], he coined the word "communism" and influenced other thinkers, including Marx and Engels.

[[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898) published ''[[Looking Backward]]'' in 1888, a utopian romance novel about a future socialist society. In Bellamy's utopia, property was held in common and money replaced with a system of equal credit for all. Valid for a year and non-transferable between individuals, credit expenditure was to be tracked via "credit-cards" (which bear no resemblance to modern credit cards which are tools of debt-finance). Labour was compulsory from age 21 to 40 and organised via various departments of an Industrial Army to which most citizens belonged. Working hours were to be cut drastically due to technological advances (including organisational). People were expected to be motivated by a Religion of Solidarity and criminal behavior was treated as a form of mental illness or "atavism". The book ranked as second or third best seller of its time (after ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and ''Ben Hur''). In 1897, Bellamy published a sequel entitled ''Equality'' as a reply to his critics and which lacked the Industrial Army and other authoritarian aspects.

[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) published ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' in 1890, partly as a response to Bellamy's ''Looking Backwards'', which he equated with the socialism of Fabians such as Sydney Webb. Morris' vision of the future socialist society was centred around his concept of useful work as opposed to useless toil and the redemption of human labour. Morris believed that all work should be artistic, in the sense that the worker should find it both pleasurable and an outlet for creativity. Morris' conception of labour thus bears strong resemblance to Fourier's, while Bellamy's (the reduction of labour) is more akin to that of Saint-Simon or in aspects Marx.

The [[Brotherhood Church]] in Britain and the [[Life and Labor Commune]] in Russia were based on the [[Christian anarchist]] ideas of [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) and [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921) wrote about anarchist forms of socialism in their books. Proudhon wrote ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) and ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1847). Kropotkin wrote ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' (1892) and ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]'' (1912). Many of the anarchist collectives formed in [[Spain]], especially in [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]], during the [[Spanish Civil War]] were based on their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sam Dolgoff|authorlink=Sam Dolgoff|title=[[The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' Self-Management in the Spanish Revolution, 1936–1939]]|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many participants in the historical [[kibbutz]] movement in [[Israel]] were motivated by utopian socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=From utopia to total institution in a single generation: the kibbutz and Bruderhof|author=Sheldon Goldenberg and Gerda R. Wekerle|journal=International Review of Modern Sociology|volume=2|issue=2|date=September 1972|pages=224–232|jstor=41420450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustin Souchy]] (1892–1984) spent most of his life investigating and participating in many kinds of socialist communities. Souchy wrote about his experiences in his autobiography ''Beware! Anarchist!''.

[[Behavioral psychologist]] [[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) published ''[[Walden Two]]'' in 1948. The [[Twin Oaks Community]] was originally based on his ideas.

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (born 1929) wrote about an impoverished anarchist society in her book ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' published in 1974 and in which the anarchists agree to leave their home planet and colonize a barely habitable moon in order to avoid a bloody revolution.

== Related concepts ==
Some communities of the modern [[intentional community]] movement, such as [[kibbutzim]], could be categorized as utopian socialist.

For example, religious sects whose members live communally such as the [[Hutterites]] or [[Bruderhof Communities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not usually called "utopian socialists", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1VwVSDBleUC&amp;pg=PA61|title=America's Economic Moralists: A History of Rival Ethics and Economics|author=Donald E. Frey|publisher=SUNY Press|date=2009|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classless modes of production in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies are referred to as "[[primitive communism]]" by Marxists to stress their classless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/33429/Primitive+communism%3A+life+before+class+and+oppression|title=Primitive communism: life before class and oppression|publisher=Socialist Worker|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept is that of a socialist utopia, usually depicted in works of fiction as possible ways society can turn out to be in the future and often combined with notions of a technologically revolutionized economy.

'''Vapor pressure''' (or vapour pressure in British spelling) or '''equilibrium vapor pressure''' is defined as the [[pressure]] exerted by a [[vapor]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its [[Condensation|condensed]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a [[Thermodynamic system#Closed system|closed system]]. The equilibrium vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's [[evaporation]] rate. It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often referred to as ''[[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]''. The pressure exhibited by vapor present above a liquid surface is known as vapor pressure. As the temperature of a liquid increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. As the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, the number of molecules transitioning into a vapor also increases, thereby increasing the vapor pressure.

The vapor pressure of any substance increases non-linearly with temperature according to the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]]. The [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome [[atmospheric pressure]] and lift the liquid to form vapor bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher temperature due to the higher fluid pressure, because fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases. More important at shallow depths is the higher temperature required to start bubble formation. The surface tension of the bubble wall leads to an overpressure in the very small, initial bubbles. Thus, thermometer calibration should not rely on the temperature in boiling water.

The vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure]]. For example, air at sea level, and saturated with water vapor at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, has partial pressures of about 2.3 kPa of water, 78 kPa of [[nitrogen]], 21 kPa of [[oxygen]] and 0.9 kPa of [[argon]], totaling 102.2 kPa, making the basis for [[atmosphere (unit)|standard atmospheric pressure]].

==Measurement and units==
Vapor pressure is measured in the standard units of [[pressure]]. The [[International System of Units]] (SI) recognizes pressure as a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] with the dimension of force per area and designates the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa) as its standard unit. One pascal is one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square meter]] (N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Experimental measurement of vapor pressure is a simple procedure for common pressures between 1 and 200 kPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capec.kt.dtu.dk/documents/overview/Vapor-pressure-Ruzicka.pdf |title=Vapor Pressure of Organic Compounds. Measurement and Correlation |author1=Růžička, K. |author2=Fulem, M. |author3=Růžička, V. |lastauthoramp=yes |access-date=2009-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226095004/http://www.capec.kt.dtu.dk/documents/overview/Vapor-pressure-Ruzicka.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most accurate results are obtained near the boiling point of substances and large errors result for measurements smaller than {{gaps|1|kPa}}. Procedures often consist of purifying the test substance, isolating it in a container, evacuating any foreign gas, then measuring the equilibrium pressure of the gaseous phase of the substance in the container at different temperatures. Better accuracy is achieved when care is taken to ensure that the entire substance and its vapor are at the prescribed temperature. This is often done, as with the use of an [[isoteniscope]], by submerging the containment area in a liquid bath.

Very low vapor pressures of solids can be measured using the [[Knudsen effusion cell]] method.

In a medical context, vapor pressure is sometimes expressed in other units, specifically [[Millimeter of mercury|millimeters of mercury (mmHg)]]. This is important for [[volatile anesthetics]], most of which are liquids at body temperature, but with a relatively high vapor pressure. Anesthetics with a higher vapor pressure at body temperature will be excreted more quickly, as they are exhaled from the lungs.

==Estimating vapor pressures with Antoine equation==

The [[Antoine equation]]&lt;ref name=frostburg&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/liquids/faq/antoine-vapor-pressure.shtml What is the Antoine Equation?] (Chemistry Department, [[Frostburg State University]], [[Maryland]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnot&gt;{{cite book|author=Sinnot, R.K.|title=Chemical Engineering Design]|edition=4th|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2005|page=331|isbn=0-7506-6538-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJaxUL3numgC&amp;pg=PA331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mathematical expression of the relation between the vapor pressure and the temperature of pure liquid or solid substances. The basic form of the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\log P = A-\frac{B}{C+T}&lt;/math&gt;

and it can be transformed into this temperature-explicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{B}{A-\log P} - C&lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the absolute vapor pressure of a substance&lt;br&gt;
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the temperature of the substance&lt;/span&gt;
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are substance-specific coefficients (i.e., constants or parameters)
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:-30%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; is typically either &lt;math&gt;\log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\log_e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnot/&gt;

A simpler form of the equation with only two coefficients is sometimes used:

:&lt;math&gt;\log P = A-\frac{B}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be transformed to:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{B}{A-\log P}&lt;/math&gt;

Sublimations and vaporizations of the same substance have separate sets of Antoine coefficients, as do components in mixtures.&lt;ref name=frostburg/&gt; Each parameter set for a specific compound is only applicable over a specified temperature range. Generally, temperature ranges are chosen to maintain the equation's accuracy of a few up to 8–10 percent. For many volatile substances, several different sets of parameters are available and used for different temperature ranges. The Antoine equation has poor accuracy with any single parameter set when used from a compound's melting point to its critical temperature. Accuracy is also usually poor when vapor pressure is under 10 Torr because of the limitations of the apparatus used to establish the Antoine parameter values.

The Wagner equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Wagner|first= W.|title= New vapour pressure measurements for argon and nitrogen and a new method for establishing rational vapour pressure equations|journal= Cryogenics|volume= 13|issue= 8|pages= 470–482 |year= 1973|doi=  10.1016/0011-2275(73)90003-9|bibcode = 1973Cryo...13..470W }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives "one of the best"&lt;ref&gt;Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 7th Ed. pp. 4–15&lt;/ref&gt; fits to experimental data but is quite complex. It expresses reduced vapor pressure as a function of reduced temperature.

==Relation to boiling point of liquids==
{{further|Boiling point}}
[[Image:vapor_pressure_chart.svg|thumb|right|A log-lin vapor pressure chart for various liquids]]
As a general trend, vapor pressures of liquids at ambient temperatures increase with decreasing boiling points. This is illustrated in the vapor pressure chart (see right) that shows graphs of the '''vapor pressures versus temperatures''' for a variety of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book||editor=Perry, R.H. |editor2=Green, D.W. |title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|isbn= 0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the normal boiling point of a liquid, the vapor pressure is equal to the standard atmospheric pressure defined as 1 atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Petrucci, Ralph H. |author2=Harwood, William S. |author3=Herring, F.Geoffrey |title=General Chemistry |edition=8th|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn= 0-13-014329-4|page=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; (760 Torr or 101.325 kPa or 14.69595 PSI).

For example, at any given temperature, [[methyl chloride]] has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2&amp;nbsp;°C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure.

Although the relation between vapor pressure and temperature is non-linear, the chart uses a logarithmic vertical axis to produce slightly curved lines, so one chart can graph many liquids. A nearly straight line is obtained when the logarithm of the vapor pressure is plotted against 1/(T+230)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dreisbach, R. R.  |author2=Spencer, R. S. |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Infinite Points of Cox Chart Families and dt/dP Values at any Pressure|journal=Industrial and Engineering Chemistry,|volume=41|number=1|page=176|date= 1949|doi=10.1021/ie50469a040}}&lt;/ref&gt; where T is the temperature in degrees Celsius. The vapor pressure of a liquid at its boiling point equals the pressure of its surrounding environment.

==Liquid mixtures==
[[Raoult's law]] gives an approximation to the vapor pressure of mixtures of liquids. It states that the activity (pressure or [[fugacity]]) of a single-phase mixture is equal to the mole-fraction-weighted sum of the components' vapor pressures:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{\rm tot} =\sum_i P y_i = \sum_i P_i^{\rm sat} x_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the mixture's vapor pressure, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mole fraction]] of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the liquid phase and &lt;math&gt;y
_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mole fraction]] of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the vapor phase respectively. &lt;math&gt;P_i^{\rm sat}&lt;/math&gt; is the vapor pressure of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Raoult's law is applicable only to non-electrolytes (uncharged species); it is most appropriate for non-polar molecules with only weak intermolecular attractions (such as [[London force]]s).

Systems that have vapor pressures higher than indicated by the above formula are said to have positive deviations. Such a deviation suggests weaker intermolecular attraction than in the pure components, so that the molecules can be thought of as being "held in" the liquid phase less strongly than in the pure liquid. An example is the [[azeotrope]] of approximately 95% ethanol and water. Because the azeotrope's vapor pressure is higher than predicted by Raoult's law, it boils at a temperature below that of either pure component.

There are also systems with negative deviations that have vapor pressures that are lower than expected. Such a deviation is evidence for stronger intermolecular attraction between the constituents of the mixture than exists in the pure components. Thus, the molecules are "held in" the liquid more strongly when a second molecule is present. An example is a mixture of trichloromethane (chloroform) and 2-propanone (acetone), which boils above the boiling point of either pure component.

The negative and positive deviations can be used to determine [[thermodynamic activity]] coefficients of the components of mixtures.

==Solids==
[[Image:Vapor Pressure Curve of Liquid and Solid Benzene.png|thumb|300px|Vapor pressure of liquid and solid benzene]]
Equilibrium vapor pressure can be defined as the pressure reached when a condensed phase is in equilibrium with its own vapor. In the case of an equilibrium solid, such as a [[crystal]], this can be defined as the pressure when the rate of [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] of a solid matches the rate of deposition of its vapor phase. For most solids this pressure is very low, but some notable exceptions are [[naphthalene]], [[dry ice]] (the vapor pressure of dry ice is 5.73 MPa (831 psi, 56.5 atm) at 20 °C, which causes most sealed containers to rupture), and ice. All solid materials have a vapor pressure. However, due to their often extremely low values, measurement can be rather difficult. Typical techniques include the use of [[thermogravimetry]] and gas transpiration.

There are a number of methods for calculating the sublimation pressure (i.e., the vapor pressure) of a solid. One method is to estimate the sublimation pressure from extrapolated liquid vapor pressures (of the supercooled liquid), if the [[Enthalpy of fusion|heat of fusion]] is known, by using this particular form of the Clausius–Clapeyron relation:&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Moller B. |author2=Rarey J. |author3=Ramjugernath D. |title=Estimation of the vapour pressure of non-electrolyte organic compounds via group contributions and group interactions|journal=Journal of Molecular Liquids|volume=143|pages=52|doi=10.1016/j.molliq.2008.04.020 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ln\,P^{\rm sub}_{\rm s} = \ln\,P^{\rm sub}_{\rm l} - \frac{\Delta_{\rm fus}H}{R} \left( \frac{1}{T_{\rm sub}} - \frac{1}{T_{\rm fus}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;P^{\rm sub}_{\rm s}&lt;/math&gt; is the sublimation pressure of the solid component at the temperature &lt;math&gt; T_{\rm sub} &lt; T_{\rm fus} &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; P^{\rm sub}_{\rm l}&lt;/math&gt; is the extrapolated vapor pressure of the liquid component at the temperature &lt;math&gt; T_{\rm sub} &lt; T_{\rm fus} &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\rm fus}H &lt;/math&gt; is the heat of fusion.
* &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas constant]].
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm sub}&lt;/math&gt; is the sublimation temperature.
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm fus}&lt;/math&gt; is the melting point temperature.

This method assumes that the heat of fusion is temperature-independent, ignores additional transition temperatures between different solid phases, and it gives a fair estimation for temperatures not too far from the melting point. It also shows that the sublimation pressure is lower than the extrapolated liquid vapor pressure (Δ&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' &gt; 0) and the difference grows with increased distance from the melting point.

==Boiling point of water==
[[Image:Water vapor pressure graph.jpg|thumb|right|Graph of water vapor pressure versus temperature. At the normal boiling point of 100 °C, it equals the standard atmospheric pressure of 760 [[Torr]] or 101.325 [[kPa]].]]
{{main|Vapor pressure of water}}
Like all liquids, water boils when its vapor pressure reaches its surrounding pressure. In nature, the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher elevations and water boils at a lower temperature. The boiling temperature of water for atmospheric pressures can be approximated by the [[Antoine equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}P = 8.07131 - \frac{1730.63}{233.426 + T_b}&lt;/math&gt;

or transformed into this temperature-explicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;T_b = \frac{1730.63}{8.07131 - \log_{10}P} - 233.426&lt;/math&gt;

where the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_b&lt;/math&gt; is the boiling point in degrees [[Celsius]] and the pressure &lt;math&gt;P_{ } &lt;/math&gt; is in [[Torr]].

==Dühring's rule==
{{main|Dühring's rule}}
Dühring's rule states that a linear relationship exists between the temperatures at which two solutions exert the same vapor pressure.

==Meaning in meteorology==
In [[meteorology]], the term ''vapor pressure'' is used to mean the partial pressure of [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, even if it is not in equilibrium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=vapor-pressure1 Glossary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415075010/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=vapor-pressure1 |date=2011-04-15 }} (Developed by the [[American Meteorological Society]])&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''equilibrium vapor pressure'' is specified otherwise. Meteorologists also use the term ''saturation vapor pressure'' to refer to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water or [[brine]] above a flat surface, to distinguish it from equilibrium vapor pressure, which takes into account the shape and size of water droplets and particulates in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/people/babin/vapor/index.html A Brief Tutorial]. jhuapl.edu (An article about the definition of equilibrium vapor pressure)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''western lowland gorilla''' (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') is one of two subspecies of the [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla'') that lives in [[montane forest|montane]], [[primary forest|primary]] and [[secondary forest]]s and lowland swamps in central Africa in [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Gabon]]. It is the [[nominate subspecies]] of the western gorilla, and smallest of the four [[gorilla]] subspecies.

The Western lowland gorilla is the only subspecies kept in zoos with the exception of Amahoro, a female [[Eastern lowland gorilla]] at [[Antwerp Zoo]] and a few [[Mountain gorilla]]s kept captive in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name="Prince-Hughes66"&gt;{{cite book |title= Songs of the Gorilla Nation|last= Prince-Hughes|first= Dawn|authorlink= Dawn Prince-Hughes|year= 1987|publisher= Harmony|location= |isbn=1-4000-5058-8|page= 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Gorilla Male Global.jpg|thumb|left|Skull of a male subject]]
The western lowland gorilla is the smallest subspecies of gorilla but nevertheless still a primate of exceptional size and strength. This species of gorillas exhibits pronounced [[sexual dimorphism]]. They possess no tails and have jet black skin along with coarse black hair that covers their entire body except for the face, ears, hands and feet. The hair on the back and rump of males takes on a grey coloration and is also lost as they get progressively older. This coloration is the reason why older males are known as "silverbacks". Their hands are proportionately large with nails on all digits, similar to that of a human's, and very large thumbs. They have short muzzles, a prominent brow ridge, large nostrils and small eyes and ears. Other features are large muscles in the jaw region along with broad and strong teeth. Among these teeth are strong sets of frontal canines and large molars in the back of the mouth for grinding fruits&lt;ref name="Remis1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remis|first1=Melissa J.|title=Western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') as seasonal frugivores: Use of variable resources|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=43|issue=2|year=1997|pages=87–109|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2345(1997)43:2&lt;87::AID-AJP1&gt;3.0.CO;2-T|pmid=9327094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vegetables.&lt;ref name="Csomos"&gt;{{cite web|last=Csomos|first=Rebecca Ann|title=Gorilla gorilla western gorilla|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Gorilla_gorilla/#lifespan_longevity|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western gorillas frequently stand upright, but walk in a hunched, quadrupedal fashion, with hands curled and knuckles touching the ground. This style of movement requires long arms, which works for western gorillas because the arm span of gorillas is larger than their standing height.

===Albinism===
[[File:Snowflake - Barcelona Zoo White Gorilla3.jpg|thumb|[[Snowflake (gorilla)|Snowflake]], in the [[Barcelona Zoo]]]]
The only known [[albinism|albino]] gorilla – named [[Snowflake (gorilla)|Snowflake]] – was a wild-born western lowland gorilla originally from [[Equatorial Guinea]]. Snowflake, a male gorilla, was taken from the wild and brought to the [[Barcelona Zoo]] in 1966 at a very young age. Snowflake presented the typical traits and characteristics of albinism typically seen in humans, including white hair, pinkish skin, light colored eyes, reduced [[visual perception]] and [[photophobia]] (discomfort in bright light). Snowflake was diagnosed by scientists as having non-syndromic albinism. The genetic variant for Snowflake’s albinism was identified by the scientists as a non-synonymous [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] located in a [[transmembrane region]] of [[SLC45A2]]. This transporter is also known to be involved in [[oculocutaneous albinism type 4]] in humans. This information revealed the first evidence of [[inbreeding]] in western lowland gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prado-Martinez|first=Javier|last2=Hernando-Herraez|first2=Irene|last3=Lorente-Galdos|first3=Belen|last4=Dabad|first4=Marc|last5=Ramirez|first5=Oscar|last6=Baeza-Delgado|first6=Carlos|last7=Morcillo-Suarez|first7=Carlos|last8=Alkan|first8=Can|last9=Hormozdiari|first9=Fereydoun|date=14 January 2013|title=The genome sequencing of an albino Western lowland gorilla reveals inbreeding in the wild|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=14|issue=363|pages=363|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-363|pmc=3673836|pmid=23721540|last10=Raineri|first10=Emanuele|last11=Estellé|first11=Jordi|last12=Fernandez-Callejo|first12=Marcos|last13=Valles|first13=Mònica|last14=Ritscher|first14=Lars|last15=Schöneberg|first15=Torsten|last16=de la Calle-Mustienes|first16=Elisa|last17=Casillas|first17=Sònia|last18=Rubio-Acero|first18=Raquel|last19=Melé|first19=Marta|last20=Engelken|first20=Johannes|last21=Caceres|first21=Mario|last22=Gomez-Skarmeta|first22=Jose|last23=Gut|first23=Marta|last24=Bertranpetit|first24=Jaume|last25=Gut|first25=Ivo G|last26=Abello|first26=Teresa|last27=Eichler|first27=Evan E|last28=Mingarro|first28=Ismael|last29=Lalueza-Fox|first29=Carles|last30=Navarro|first30=Arcadi|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==

===Social structure===
[[File:Westernlowlandgorilla-ueno2009.ogv|thumb|left|250px|Western lowland gorillas at a [[Ueno Zoo]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan]]

Western lowland gorilla groups travel within a home range averaging {{convert|8|-|45|sqkm|abbr=on|}}. Gorillas do not display territorial behavior, and neighboring groups often overlap ranges.&lt;ref name="Bermejo2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bermejo|first1=M.|title=Home-range use and intergroup encounters in western gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) at Lossi forest, North Congo|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=64|issue=2|year=2004|pages=223–232|doi=10.1002/ajp.20073|pmid=15470740|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/primat/ebola_workshop/pdf/Bermejo_gorilla_ranging.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doran-SheehyGreer2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doran-Sheehy|first1=Diane M.|last2=Greer|first2=David|last3=Mongo|first3=Patrice|last4=Schwindt|first4=Dylan|title=Impact of ecological and social factors on ranging in western gorillas|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=64|issue=2|year=2004|pages=207–222|doi=10.1002/ajp.20075|pmid=15470743|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/primat/ebola_workshop/pdf/Doran_mondika_ranging_paper.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group usually favours a certain area within the home range but seems to follow a seasonal pattern depending upon the availability of ripening fruits and, at some sites, localised large open clearings (swamps and "bais"). Gorillas normally travel {{convert|3|-|5|km|abbr=on}} per day. Populations feeding on high-energy foods that vary spatially and seasonally tend to have greater day ranges than those feeding on lower-quality but more consistently available foods. Larger groups travel greater distances in order to obtain sufficient food.&lt;ref name="Remis1997"/&gt;

It was found that it is easier for males to travel alone and move between groups as a result of the solidarity they experienced before finding their own breeding group. Before reaching the age of sexual maturity, males leave their natal group and go through a “bachelor stage” that can last several years either in solitary or in a nonbreeding group.&lt;ref name=Douadi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Douadi|first=Melanie|title=Sex-biased dispersal in western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'')|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=June 2007|volume=16|issue=11|pages=2247–2259|pmid=17561888|last2=Gatti|first2=S|last3=Levrero|first3=F|last4=Duhamel|first4=G|last5=Bermejo|first5=M|last6=Vallet|first6=D|last7=Menard|first7=N|last8=Petit|first8=E. J.|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while both sexes leave their birth group, females are never found alone; they just travel from breeding group to breeding group. It was also found that males like to settle with other male members of their family. Their breeding groups consist of one silverback male, three adult females and their offspring.&lt;ref name=Douadi/&gt; The male gorilla takes on the role of the protector. Females tend to make bonds with other females in their natal group only, but rather form strong bonds with males. Males also compete aggressively with each other for contact with females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maestripieri, Dario |author2=Ross, Stephen |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sex differences in play among western lowland gorilla (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') infants: Implications for adult behavior and social structure|journal= American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume= 123|issue=1 |year=2004|pages= 52–61|doi=10.1002/ajpa.10295|pmid=14669236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of gorillas is led by one or more adult males. In cases where there are more than one silverback males in a group, they are most likely father and son. Groups containing only one male are believed to be the basic unit of the social group, gradually growing in size due to reproduction and new members migrating in. In the study done at Lope, gorillas harvest most of their food arboreally, but less than half of their night nests are built in trees.&lt;ref&gt;Tutin, Caroline. "Ranging and social structure of lowland gorillas in the Lope Reserv, Gabon." Great Ape Societies. (1996): 58–70. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They are often found on the ground and are made up of up to 30 gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live in the smallest family groups of all gorillas, with an average of 4 to 8 members in each. The leader (the silverback) organizes group activities, like eating, nesting and travelling in their home range. Those who challenge this alpha male are apt to be cowed by impressive shows of physical power. He may stand upright, throw things, make aggressive charges, and pound his huge chest with open or cupped hands while barking out powerful hoots or unleashing a frightening roar. Despite these displays and the animals' obvious physical power, gorillas are generally calm and nonaggressive unless they are disturbed. Young gorillas, from three to six years old, remind human observers of children. Much of their day is spent in play, climbing trees, chasing one another and swinging from branches.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/lowland-gorilla/|title=Western Lowland Gorilla|work=National Geographic|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Female western lowland gorillas do not produce many offspring due to the fact that they do not reach sexual maturity until the age of 8 or 9.&lt;ref name="Western Lowland Gorilla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcs.org/saving-wildlife/great-apes/western-lowland-gorillas.aspx|title=Western Lowland Gorilla|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female gorillas give birth to one infant after a gestation period of nearly nine months. Female gorillas do not show signs of pregnancy. Unlike their powerful parents, newborns are tiny—weighing four pounds—and able only to cling to their mothers' fur. These infants ride on their mothers' backs from the age of four months through the first two or three years of their lives.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; Infants can be dependent on their mother for up to five years.&lt;ref name="Western Lowland Gorilla" /&gt;

A study of over 300 births to captive female gorillas revealed that older females tend to give birth to more male offspring as opposed to females under 8 years old. This pattern is likely to result from selective pressures on females to have males at a time when they can provision them most effectively, as male reproductive success probably varies more than that of females and depends more on the maternal role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1990|title=Birth Sex Ratio and Infant Mortality Rates in Captive Western Lowland Gorillas|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=55|issue=3–4|pages=156|doi=10.1159/000156511|author=Mace, G.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ZOO Praha - Moja 03.jpg|thumb|right|A young western lowland gorilla at [[Prague Zoo|Praha Zoo]]]]
Female western lowland gorillas living in a group led by a single male have been observed to display sexual behavior during all stages of their reproductive cycle and during times of non-fertility. Three out of four females have been observed to engaged in sexual behavior while pregnant and two out of three females have been observed to engage in sexual behavior while lactating. Females are significantly more likely to engage and participate in sexual behavior and activity on a day when another female is sexually active. It has been found that female western lowland gorillas participate in non-reproductive sexual behavior in order to increase her reproductive success through sexual competition. By increasing the female’s own reproductive success, she then decreases the reproductive success of others female gorillas, regardless of their reproductive state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoinski|first=Tara|date=July 2009|title=Sexual behavior in female western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla''): evidence for sexual competition|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=71|issue=7|pages=587–593|doi=10.1002/ajp.20692|pmid=19399838|author2=Bonnie Perdue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infanticide has occasionally been observed within the species. Infanticide is when an adult male gorilla kills an infant gorilla. Victims are never related to the killer. A male does this in order to have the opportunity to mate with the mother, who otherwise would have been unavailable while caring for her young offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stokes |first1=Emma J |last2=Parnell |first2=Richard J |last3=Olejniczak |first3=Claudia |title=Female dispersal and reproductive success in wild western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date=1 September 2003 |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=329–339 |doi=10.1007/s00265-003-0630-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence==

===Use of tools===
Their intelligence is displayed through their ability to fashion natural materials into tools that help them gather food more conveniently. While the use and manufacture of tools to extract ants and termites is a well-documented behavior in wild chimpanzees, it has never been observed in other great apes in their natural habitat and never seen to be done by other primates in captivity.
[[File:Gorilla tool use.png|thumb|A female gorilla measuring depth of water with a branch at [[Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park]], northern [[Republic of the Congo]], an example of tool use]]
In terms of manufacturing tools for the use of extracting for western lowland gorillas, gorillas are able to adapt tools to a particular use by selecting branches, removing projections such as leaves and bark and adapting their length to the depth of the holes. It appears that they also anticipate the use of the tool since they begin with biggest sticks available and progressively modify it until it is the perfect fit for inserting into a hole that contains food. This demonstrates the gorillas' acquisition of high level sensorimotor intelligence similar to that of young human children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pouydebat|first=Emmanuelle|author2=Berge, Christine |author3=Gorce, Philippe |title=Use and Manufacture of Tools to Extract Food by Captive ''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'': Experimental Approach|journal=Folia Primatologica|year=2004|volume=76|issue=3|pages=180–183|doi=10.1159/000084381|last4=Coppens|first4=Yves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, there was a gorilla that used a stick to measure the depth of water. In 2009, a western lowland gorilla at [[Buffalo Zoological Gardens]] used a bucket to collect water. In an experiment, one adult male gorilla and three adult female gorillas were given five-gallon buckets near a standing pool. Two of the younger females were able to fill the buckets with water. This is the first record of gorillas spontaneously using tools to drink in zoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kleinfelder III|first1=Raymond E.|last2=Margulis|first2=Susan W.|last3=Steele|first3=Gary R.|title=Use of Buckets as Tools by Western Lowland Gorillas|doi=10.1002/zoo.21001|pmid=22290615|volume=31|journal=Zoo Biol|pages=260–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
Another example of gorillas' significant intelligence is their ability to comprehend simple sign language.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; In the mid-1970s, researchers turned their attention to communicating with gorillas via sign language. One gorilla, [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], was born in [[San Francisco Zoo]] on July 4, 1971. A woman named [[Francine Patterson]] officially started working with Koko on July 12, 1972, with the goal of teaching her sign language. In the beginning, Dr. Petterson focused on teaching Koko only three basic signs: "food", "drink", and "more". Koko would learn signs through observation, Dr. Patterson, or one of her colleagues by molding Koko's hands into the correct sign. On August 7, Patterson began a more formal routine of teaching Koko the signs, "food", "drink", and "more". In the couple weeks before that, Koko had been using gestures that seemed like attempts at the signs taught, but were deemed as coincidental and random and not intended for the actual purpose. Only two days after they started the more formal routine, Koko started responding consistently with the sign "food" when prompted to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Education of Koko|last=Patterson|first=Francine|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|year=1981|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first three months, Koko made 16 different combinations of signs and was also starting to form simple questions by using eye contact and different positioning of signs by the body. Koko mastered more than 1,000 signs and was said to be able to connect up to 8 words together to form a statement expressing wants, needs, thoughts, or simple responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanly|first=Elizabeth|date=June 18, 2004|title=LISTENING TO KOKO|url=|journal=Commonweal|volume= 131| issue = 12|pages=pgs 14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koko passed away, in her sleep, at [[The Gorilla Foundation]] in Woodside, California on June 19, 2018 at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elkin |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Ahmed |first2=Saeed |title=Koko, the gorilla who mastered sign language, has died |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/health/koko-gorilla-death-trnd/index.html |accessdate=2018-08-25 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a study examining the ability of western lowland gorillas to give to and exchange with humans. This involved humans holding objects such as fruit, leaves or peanuts in one hand. Once the gorillas had given twigs to the humans, they would receive one of these objects. If the gorillas did not give them a twig, they would not get their desired object. The gorillas were shown to quickly learn about receiving rewards as mistakes made by the gorillas in the beginning of the experiments gradually decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02557563|title=Exchange of objects between humans and captive western lowland gorillas|journal=Primates|volume=39|issue=4|pages=389|year=1998|last1=Chalmeau|first1=Raphaël|last2=Peignot|first2=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the mental capacity of western lowland gorillas continue.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
Western lowland gorillas primarily live in rain forests, swamp forest, brush, secondary vegetation, clearing and forest edges, abandoned farming fields and riverine forests. They live in primary and secondary lowland tropical forests that have elevations that extend from sea level up to 1,300 meters. The average amount of rainfall in the areas where western lowland gorillas typically reside is about 1,500 millimetres a year with the greatest rainfall between the months of August and November. Western lowland gorillas are not typically observed in areas that are close to human settlements and villages. They have been known to avoid areas with roads and farms that show signs of human activity. These gorillas favor areas where edible plants are more copious. Swamp forests are now considered important feeding areas and habitats for the western lowland gorilla. These areas support the gorillas in both the wet and the dry season of the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yog2009.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=46%3Agorillaspecies&amp;id=63%3Awlgspeciesinfo&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=70|title=Western Lowland Gorillas|publisher=YoG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914094937/http://www.yog2009.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=46%3Agorillaspecies&amp;id=63%3Awlgspeciesinfo&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=70|archivedate=14 September 2011|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forests of the Republic of Congo are currently considered to host the majority of the western lowland gorilla population. The forests of the Republic of Congo serve as protection to the gorillas with the isolation of the large swampy forest areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/great_apes/gorillas/western_lowland_gorilla/|title=Western lowland gorilla|publisher=WWF Global|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
As primarily herbivores, the main diet of western lowland gorilla groups is roots, shoots, fruit, wild celery, tree bark and pulp which is provided for in the thick forests of central and west Africa.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; During the wet season gorillas commonly consume fruits. While in the dry season, there is a decrease in the consumption of fleshy fruits, but they still continue to eat other kinds of fruits. The diversity of fruits consumed was higher in the poor fruit year,when favored fruit species, failed to produce large crops.&lt;ref name="Remis1997"/&gt; They may also eat insects from time to time. The common food item within fibers are the herbaceous stems.&lt;ref name="Remis1997"/&gt; Important food species have been divided into three categories. Staple foods which are eaten on a daily/weekly basis throughout the year, seasonal foods which are present in the majority of resources when available and fallback foods which are always available, but eaten only or mainly during fruit-scarce months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=M.

E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorillas will climb trees up to 15 meters in height in search of food. They never completely strip vegetation from a single area since the rapid regrowth of the vegetation allows them to stay within a reasonably confined home range for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Gorilla_gorilla/#lifespan_longevity|title=Gorilla gorilla western gorilla|last=Csomos|first=Rebecca Ann|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western lowland gorilla eats a combination of fruits and foliage, providing a balance of nutrients, depending on the time of year. However, when ripe fruit is available, they tend to eat more fruit as opposed to foliage. When ripe fruit is in scarce supply, they eat leaves, herbs and bark. During the rainy months of July and August, fruit is ripe; however, in the dry seasons, ripe fruit is scarce. Gorillas choose fruit that is high in sugar for energy, as well as fibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Dierenfeld|first2=E. S.|last3=Mowry|first3=C. B.|last4=Carroll|first4=R.

J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
The presence of western lowland gorillas has allowed humans to further the study of how gorillas compare with humans in regards to human diseases, behavior, linguistic and psychological aspects of their lives. They are hunted illegally for their skins and meat in Africa and captured to be sold to zoos. While defended as being economically profitable for restaurants and local people, it is a large contributor to the endangered status of the western lowland gorilla. They are also seen as a crop pest in western Africa because they raid native plantations and therefore destroy what would have otherwise been valuable crops.&lt;ref name="Csomos"/&gt;

===Threats===

====Hunting and logging====
In tropical forests, gorillas are hunted to provide meat for the bushmeat trade. Logging also destroys gorilla habitats. Although logging diminishes gorilla habitats, it may also provide for increased herbaceous vegetation as a result of gaps in the tree cover. Destruction of gorilla habitat may harm the overall forest ecosystem. Western lowland gorillas are seed dispersers, which mean they carry seeds from one place to another, and this trait is beneficial to many of the animals in the forest. Therefore, if there are no western lowland gorillas to disperse the needed seeds to other animals, not only will the gorillas become extinct but so will many other animals, which could over time destroy an entire ecosystem.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{cite journal|last-author-amp=yes|year=2013|title=Impacts of logging and hunting on western lowland gorilla (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') populations and consequences for forest regeneration.

====Population decline and recovery====
[[File:Western Lowland Gorilla at Bronx Zoo 4.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Western lowland gorilla at Bronx Zoo|[[Bronx Zoo]]]]
The western lowland gorilla population in the wild is faced by a number of factors that threaten its extinction. Such factors include deforestation, farming, grazing and the expanding human settlements that cause forest loss. There is a correlation between human intervention in the wild with the destruction of habitats and increase in bushmeat hunting.&lt;ref name="animals.nationalgeographic.com" /&gt; Another of these factors is infertility. Generally, female gorillas mature at 10–12 years of age (or earlier at 7–8 years) and their male counterparts mature more slowly, rarely strong and dominant enough to reproduce before 15–20 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/gorilla/reproduction.htm|title=GORILLAS- Reproduction|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fecundity]] of females, or capacity of producing young in great numbers, appears to decline by the age of 18. Of one half of captive females of viable reproductive age, approximately only 30% of those had only a single birth. However, these non-reproductive gorillas may prove to be a valuable resource since the use of assisted reproductive techniques aid in the maintaining of genetic diversity in the limited populations in zoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatasaka|first=Harry H.|date=February 1997|title=Strategies for ovulation induction and oocyte retrieval in the lowland gorilla|journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics|volume=14|issue=2|pages=102–110|doi=10.1007/bf02765779|pmc=3454829|pmid=9048241|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, a census of the gorilla populations in equatorial [[Africa]] was thought to be 100,000. Researchers later adjusted the figure to less than half because of poaching and diseases.&lt;ref name="wcs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wcs.org/news-and-features-main/motherlode-of-gorillas-discovered-in-central-africa.aspx|title=Motherlode of Gorillas Discovered in Central Africa|date=5 August 2008|publisher=[[Wildlife Conservation Society]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65k99YIRS|archivedate=26 February 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys conducted by the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] in 2006 and 2007 found about 125,000 previously unreported gorillas have been living in the swamp forests of [[Lake Télé Community Reserve]] and in neighboring [[Marantaceae]] (dryland) forests in the Republic of the Congo. However, gorillas remain vulnerable to [[Ebola]], [[deforestation]] and [[poaching]].&lt;ref name="wcs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2008-08-05/world/congo.gorillas_1_gorillas-researchers-congolese?_s=PM:WORLD|title=More than 100,000 rare gorillas found in Congo|date=5 August 2008|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65k9ABWt7|archivedate=26 February 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 and 2003, there was an Ebola outbreak in the Lossi sanctuary population, and in 2004, there was an Ebola outbreak in the Lokoué forest clearing in [[Odzala-Kokoua National Park]], both in the Republic of the Congo. The Ebola outbreak in the Lokoué forest clearing negatively affected the individuals living in groups and the adult females more than the solitary males, resulting in an increase in the proportion of solitary males to those living in groups. This population decreased from 377 individuals to 38 individuals two years after the outbreak and to 40 individuals six years after the outbreak. The population is still slowly recovering, even today, it is hoped towards a population that has the same demographic structure of an unaffected population, because of new births and breeding groups. This Ebola outbreak also affected the Maya Nord population (52 kilometres northwest from Lokoué) from 400 individuals to considerably fewer. Because of these outbreaks, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) updated the status of western lowland gorillas from "endangered" to "critically endangered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genton|first=Céline|year=2012|title=Recovery Potential of a Western Lowland Gorilla Population following a Major Ebola Outbreak: Results from a Ten Year Study|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=5|pages=e37106|bibcode=2012PLoSO...737106G|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037106|pmc=3359368|pmid=22649511|author2=Cristescu, Romane|author3=Gatti, Sylvain|author4=Levréro, Florence|author5=Bigot, Elodie|author6=Caillaud, Damien|author7=Pierre, Jean-Sébastien|author8=Ménard, Nelly|author9=Hayward, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the northeastern part of the Republic of the Congo, even though poaching is illegal, western lowland gorillas are still being hunted for their bushmeat and the young for pets; five percent of the species is killed each year because of this. Deforestation of this area allows for the trade of bushmeat and even more poaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwildlife.org/species/western-lowland-gorilla "Western Lowland Gorilla."] World Wildlife Fund. Ed. Matthew Lewis and Richard Carroll. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial poaching of chimpanzees, forest elephants and western gorillas in The Republic of the Congo resulted from the increased amount of commercial logging and infrastructure. Deforestation and logging allowed for the creation of roads which allowed hunters to hunt deeper into the forests, increasing the amount of poaching and bushmeat trade in the area. The Republic of the Congo has put in place a conservation effort to conserve different species such as chimpanzees, forest elephants and western gorillas from poaching and deforestation. This conservation effort would allow these species to benefit from vegetation and ecologically important resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last3=Bakabana|first3=Parfait C.|last4=Elkan|first4=Paul W.|last5=Iyenguet|first5=Fortuné C.|last6=Madzoké|first6=Bola|last7=Malanda|first7=Guy Aimé F.|last8=Mowawa|first8=Brice S.|last9=Moukoumbou|first9=Calixte|year=2010|title=Monitoring Great Ape and Elephant Abundance at Large Spatial Scales: Measuring Effectiveness of a Conservation Landscape|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5|issue=4|pages=e10294|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510294S|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010294|pmc=2859051|pmid=20428233|author12=Getz, Wayne M.|last1=Stokes|first1=Emma J.|author2=Strindberg, Samantha|last10=Ouakabadio|first10=Franck K.|last11=Rainey|first11=Hugo J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush meat hunting and timber harvesting in the western lowland gorilla’s habitat have negatively affected the probability of its survival. The western lowland gorilla is considered to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The western lowland gorillas, like many gorillas, are essential to the composition of the rainforest due to their seed distribution.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt; The conservation of the Western Lowland gorilla has been made a priority by many organizations. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has been working with the local community in the Congo Basin to establish wildlife management programs. The WCS is also working in Congo and surrounding countries to limit the bush meat trade by enforcing laws and hunting restrictions and also helping the local people find new sources of protein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcs.org/saving-wildlife/great-apes/western-lowland-gorillas.aspx "Western Lowland Gorilla."] – Saving Wildlife.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoos worldwide have a population of 550 western lowland gorillas, and the [[Cincinnati Zoo]] leads the United States in western lowland gorilla births.&lt;ref name="Prince-Hughes66" /&gt;

==In captivity==

===Stress===
Stress has been known to cause both physiological and behavioral chronic issues for captive species including, but not limited to, altered reproductive cycling and behavior, reduced immune responses, disrupted hormone and growth levels, reduced body weight, heightened abnormal activities and aggression and decreased exploratory behavior with increased hiding behaviors.&lt;ref name="Morgan2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morgan | first1 = K | last2 = Tromborg | first2 = C | year = 2007 | title = Sources of stress in captivity | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 102 | issue = 3–4| pages = 262–302 | doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2006.05.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such stress reactions could be caused by sounds, light conditions, odors, temperature and humidity conditions, material make-up of enclosures, habitat size constraints, lack of proper hiding areas, forced closeness to humans, routine husbandry and feeding conditions, or abnormal social groups to name a few.&lt;ref name="Morgan2007"/&gt; Use of both internal and external privacy screens on exhibit windows has been shown to alleviate stresses from visual effects of high crowd densities, leading to decreased stereotypic behaviors in the gorillas.&lt;ref name="Clark2011" /&gt; Playing naturalistic auditory stimuli as opposed to classical music, rock music, or no auditory enrichment (which allows for crowd noise, machinery, etc. to be heard) has been noted to reduce stress behavior as well.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins L, Margulis S. The effects of auditory enrichment on gorillas. Zoo Biology. 2014 [accessed 2015 Oct 12];33(3):197–203.&lt;/ref&gt; Enrichment modifications to feed and foraging, where clover-hay is added to an exhibit floor, decrease stereotypic activities while simultaneously increasing positive food-related behaviors.&lt;ref name="Clark2011" /&gt;

===Stereotypic behaviors===
[[Stereotypy (non-human)|Stereotypic behaviors]] are abnormal or compulsive behaviors. In captive gorillas, such common aberrant behaviors include eating disorders—such as regurgitation, reingestion and [[coprophagy]]—self injurious or conspecific aggression, pacing, rocking, sucking of fingers or lip smacking, and overgrooming &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = D.L. | year = 2005 | title = A note on the influence of visitors on the behaviour and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 13–17 | doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative vigilance of visitor behaviors have been identified as starting, posturing and charging at visitors.&lt;ref name="Clark2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = F | last2 = Fitzpatrick | first2 = M | last3 = Hartley | first3 = A | last4 = King | first4 = A | last5 = Lee | first5 = T | last6 = Routh | first6 = A | last7 = Walker | first7 = S | last8 = George | first8 = K | year = 2011 | title = Relationship between behavior, adrenal activity, and environment in zoo-housed western lowland gorillas (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') | url = | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 306–321 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.20396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of bachelor gorillas containing young silverbacks have significantly higher levels of aggression and wounding rates than mixed age and sex groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leeds | first1 = A | last2 = Boyer | first2 = D | last3 = Ross | first3 = S | last4 = Lukas | first4 = K | year = 2015 | title = The effects of group type and young silverbacks on wounding rates in western lowland gorilla (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') groups in North American zoos | url = | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 296–304 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.21218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular abnormal behavior is hair-plucking, which occurs across many species of mammals and birds. Studies made on the topic show that of all the western lowland gorillas housed in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) population, 15% of the surveyed population displayed hair-plucking behavior with 62% of all institutions housing a hair-plucker. Individual gorillas, particularly those of a more solitary nature, are more likely to self-pluck using their fingers and pick up this behavior if they were exposed to a group member that plucked their hair as a youngster and not yet mature gorilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Less |first=E. H. |last2=Kuhar |first2=C. W. |last3=Lukas |first3=K.

Recent research on captive gorilla welfare emphasizes a need to shift to individual assessments instead of a one size fits all group approach to understanding how welfare increases or decreases based on a variety of factors.&lt;ref name="Stoinski2011"/&gt; Individual characteristics such as age, sex, personality and individual histories are essential in understanding that stressors will affect each individual gorilla and their [[animal welfare|welfare]] differently.&lt;ref name="Clark2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoinski2011"/&gt;

Furthermore, in 2013, a study was conducted in order to better understand the genetic variation in gorillas by using reduced representation sequencing. This study consisted of a sample of 12 western lowland gorillas and two eastern lowland gorillas all in captivity. The study found that western lowland gorillas are more likely to be heterozygous than homozygous. Most pure (meaning they are not inbred) western lowland gorillas have a hom/het ratio that ranges from 0.5 to 0.7. Therefore, because of variation in these gorillas, it has been concluded that they display a moderate substructure within the western lowland population in general.

Finally, the study sought out to analyze the allele frequency spectrum (AFS) in western lowland gorillas. The reason why is that AFS knowledge can help give information regarding demographics and evolutionary processes. The AFS has determined that western lowland gorillas display a deficit of rare alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler-Smith|first=Chris|last2=Yngvadottir|first2=Bryndis|last3=Xue|first3=Yali|last4=Ayub|first4=Qasim|last5=Durbin|first5=Richard|last6=Tyler-Smith|first6=Chris|date=June 2013|title=A Genome-Wide Survey of Genetic Variation in Gorillas Using Reduced Representation Sequencing|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=6|pages=1–9|bibcode=2013PLoSO...865066S|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0065066|pmc=3672199|pmid=23750230|arxiv=1301.1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
Western lowland gorillas are believed to be one of the [[zoonotic]] origins of [[HIV/AIDS]]. The SIV or [[Simian immunodeficiency virus]] that infects them is similar to a certain strain of HIV-1.&lt;ref name="VanHeuv"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Li|first2=Yingying|last3=Neel|first3=Cecile|last4=Bailes|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Keele|first5=Brandon F.|last6=Liu|first6=Weimin|last7=Loul|first7=Severin|last8=Butel|first8=Christelle|last9=Liegeois|first9=Florian|year=2006|title=Human immunodeficiency viruses: SIV infection in wild gorillas|journal=Nature|volume=444|issue=7116|page=164|bibcode=2006Natur.444..164V|doi=10.1038/444164a|pmid=17093443|last1=Van Heuverswyn|first1=Fran|last10=Bienvenue|first10=Yanga|last11=Ngolle|first11=Eitel Mpoudi|last12=Sharp|first12=Paul M.|last13=Shaw|first13=George M.|last14=Delaporte|first14=Eric|last15=Hahn|first15=Beatrice H.|last16=Peeters|first16=Martine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plantier"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Leoz|first2=Marie|last3=Dickerson|first3=Jonathan E|last4=De Oliveira|first4=Fabienne|last5=Cordonnier|first5=François|last6=Lemée|first6=VéRonique|last7=Damond|first7=Florence|last8=Robertson|first8=David L|last9=Simon|first9=François|year=2009|title=A new human immunodeficiency virus derived from gorillas|journal=Nature Medicine|volume=15|issue=8|pages=871–72|doi=10.1038/nm.2016|pmid=19648927|last1=Plantier|first1=Jean-Christophe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharp2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bailes|first2=E.|last3=Chaudhuri|first3=R.

This clustering allows us to pinpoint the probable geographic origins of two of the human virus clades. In the southern part of Cameroon, the populations of western lowland gorillas have had examinations of their feces. Out of 2,934 gorilla samples, 70 reacted with at least one HIV-1 antigen. These samples came from four field sites, all located in southern Cameroon.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'arc|first=Mirela|last2=Ayouba|first2=Ahidjo|last3=Esteban|first3=Amandine|last4=Learn|first4=Gerald H.|last5=Boué|first5=Vanina|last6=Liegeois|first6=Florian|last7=Etienne|first7=Lucie|last8=Tagg|first8=Nikki|last9=Leendertz|first9=Fabian H.|date=2015|title=Origin of the HIV-1 group O epidemic in western lowland gorillas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=112|issue=11|pages=E1343–E1352|bibcode=2015PNAS..112E1343D|doi=10.1073/pnas.1502022112|pmc=4371950|pmid=25733890|url=http://www.documentation.ird.fr/hor/fdi:010064059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of AIDS has been linked to a virus known to infect more than 40 species of nonhuman primates in Africa. HIV-1, is composed of four phylogenetic lineages, which at some point in time have independently gone through cross-species transmission of the SIV (simian immune-deficiency virus). The simian immunodeficiency virus infected various African primates such as apes, gorillas and chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="origin" /&gt;

Disease has also been a factor in the survival of the western lowland gorilla. The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa has caused more than 90% mortality rate in western lowland gorillas. From 2003–2004, two epizootics infected the western lowland gorilla, which caused two thirds of their population to disappear. The outbreak was monitored in the Republic of Congo by [[Magdalena Bermejo]] and other field-based primatologists, as it also spread to humans through contact with bushmeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2009|title=How Ebola Impacts Genetics of Western Lowland Gorilla Populations|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=12|pages=e8375|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.8375L|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0008375|pmc=2791222|pmid=20020045|author1=Le Gouar, Pascaline|author2=Vallet, Dominique|author3=David, Laetitia|author4=Bermejo, Magdalena|author5=Gatti, Sylvain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catastrophe led the World Conservation Union to designate the western lowland gorilla a critically endangered species. [[Malaria]] is also an issue that has been arising for the western lowland gorillas. Out of 51 faecal samples from habituated individuals, 25 were shown to have ''[[Plasmodium]]'' DNA. ''[[Laverania]]'', which is a subgenus of the parasitic [[protozoa]]n genus ''Plasmodium'', was found in these studies. Varying exposure to different ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes transmitting ''Plasmodium'' species is known to be the origin of malaria in western lowland gorillas.

Wild western lowland gorillas are known to consume the seeds of the [[Aframomum melegueta#Uses|"grains of paradise"]] plant, apparently conferring healthy cardiovascular conditions from their consumption — the occasionally poor cardiovascular health of lowland gorillas in zoos has been postulated to be due to the lack of availability of the ''[[Aframomum]]'' seeds in zoo gorillas' diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asknature.org/strategy/23ec7287a4207c835d8bf162ff26afcb|title=Gorilla diet protects heart: grains of paradise|date=20 February 2012|publisher=Asknature.org|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult male gorillas are prone to [[cardiomyopathy]], a degenerative [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name="Schulman"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulman|first=F.

In [[theoretical physics]], the composition of two non-[[collinear]] [[Lorentz boost]]s results in a [[Lorentz transformation]] that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a boost and a rotation. This rotation is called '''Thomas rotation''', '''Thomas–Wigner rotation''' or '''Wigner rotation'''. The rotation was discovered by [[Llewellyn Thomas]] in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derived by Wigner in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigner|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a sequence of non-collinear boosts returns an object to its initial  velocity, then the sequence of Wigner rotations can combine to produce a net rotation called the [[Thomas precession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|Semon|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still ongoing discussions about the correct form of equations for the Thomas rotation in different reference systems with contradicting results.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebilas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Goldstein|Goldstein]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The spatial rotation resulting from the successive application of two non-collinear Lorentz transformations have been declared every bit as paradoxical as the more frequently discussed apparent violations of common sense, such as the [[twin paradox]].''
Einstein's principle of velocity reciprocity (EPVR) reads&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''We postulate that the relation between the coordinates of the two systems is linear. Then the inverse transformation is also linear and the complete non-preference of the one or the other system demands that the transformation shall be identical with the original one, except for a change of {{mvar|v}} to {{math|−v}}''
With less careful interpretation, the EPVR is seemingly violated in some models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mocanu|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, of course, no true paradox present.

===Two general boosts===

When studying the Thomas rotation at the fundamental level, one typically uses a setup with three coordinate frames, {{math|Σ, Σ&amp;prime; Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}. Frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} has velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ}}, and frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} has velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}.

The axes are, by construction, oriented as follows. Viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, the axes of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} and {{math|Σ}} are parallel (the same holds true for the pair of frames when viewed from {{math|Σ}}.) Also viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, the spatial axes of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} and {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} are parallel (and the same holds true for the pair of frames when viewed from {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ungar|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an application of EVPR: If {{math|'''u'''}} is the velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}}, then {{math|'''u'''&amp;prime; {{=}} −'''u'''}} is the velocity of {{math|Σ}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}. The velocity {{nowrap|{{math|3}}-vector}} {{math|'''u'''}} makes the ''same'' angles with respect to coordinate axes in both the primed and unprimed systems. This does ''not'' represent a snapshot taken in any of the two frames of the combined system at any particular time, as should be clear from the detailed description below.

This is possible, since a boost in, say, the positive {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-direction}}, preserves orthogonality of the coordinate axes. A general boost {{math|''B''('''w''')}} can be expressed as {{math|''L'' {{=}} ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;('''w''')''R''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')}}, where {{math|''R''('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''w''')}} is a rotation taking the {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} into the direction of {{math|'''w'''}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a boost in the new {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-direction}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|pp=68&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cushing|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sard|1970|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each rotation retains the property that the spatial coordinate axes are orthogonal. The boost will stretch the (intermediate) {{nowrap|{{math|''z''}}-axis}} by a factor {{mvar|γ}}, while leaving the {{nowrap|intermediate {{math|''x''}}-axis}} and {{nowrap|{{math|''y''}}-axis}} in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that coordinate axes are non-parallel in this construction after ''two'' consecutive non-collinear boosts is a precise expression of the phenomenon of Thomas precession.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This preservation of orthogonality of ''coordinate axes'' should not be confused with preservation of angles between spacelike vectors taken at one and the same time in one system, which, of course, does not hold. The coordinate axes transform under the ''passive'' transformation presented, while the vectors transform under the corresponding ''active'' transformation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} as seen in {{math|Σ}} is denoted {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''u''' ⊕ '''v'''}}, where ⊕ refers to the [[velocity addition formula|relativistic addition of velocity]] (and not ordinary [[vector addition]]), given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ungar|1988|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v}{c^2}} \left[\left(1 + 
\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}}{1+\gamma_\mathbf{u}} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v \right)\mathbf u +
\frac{1}{\gamma_\mathbf{u}} \mathbf v \right],&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|VA 2}}}}

and

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{|\mathbf{u}|^2}{c^2} } }&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]] of the velocity {{math|'''u'''}} (the vertical bars {{math|{{abs|'''u'''}}}} indicate the [[Norm (mathematics)|magnitude of the vector]]). The velocity {{math|'''u'''}} can be thought of the velocity of a frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}} relative to a frame {{math|Σ}}, and {{math|'''v'''}} is the velocity of an object, say a particle or ''another frame'' {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}. In the present context, all velocities are best thought of as relative velocities of frames unless otherwise specified. The result {{math|'''w''' {{=}} '''u''' ⊕ '''v'''}} is then the relative velocity of frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to a frame {{math|Σ}}.

Although velocity addition is [[nonlinear]], non-[[associative property|associative]], and non-[[commutative property|commutative]], the result of the operation correctly obtains a velocity with a magnitude less than {{math|''c''}}. If ordinary vector addition was used, it would be possible to obtain a velocity with a magnitude larger than {{math|''c''}}. The [[Lorentz factor]] {{math|''γ''}} of both composite velocities are equal,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \gamma_{\mathbf {u} \oplus \mathbf{v}} = \gamma_{\mathbf {v} \oplus \mathbf{u}} = \gamma_\mathbf{u} \gamma_\mathbf{v}\left(1+ \frac{\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} }{c^2}\right) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s are equal under interchange of velocity vectors

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v| = |\mathbf v \oplus \mathbf u| = \frac{c}{\gamma}\sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the two possible composite velocities have equal magnitude, but different directions, one must be a rotated copy of the other. More detail and other properties of no direct concern here can be found in the main article.

===Reversed configuration===

Consider the reversed configuration, namely, frame {{math|Σ}} moves with velocity {{math|−'''u'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, and frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;}}, in turn, moves with velocity {{math|−'''v'''}} relative to frame {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}}. In short, {{math|'''u''' → − '''u'''}} and {{math|'''v''' → −'''v'''}} by EPVR. Then the velocity of {{math|Σ}} relative to {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} is {{math|(−'''v''') ⊕ (−'''u''') ≡ −'''v''' ⊕ '''u'''}}. By EPVR again, the velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}} is then {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''v''' ⊕ '''u'''}}. {{EquationRef|(A)}}

One finds {{math|'''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. While they are equal in magnitude, there is an angle between them. For a single boost between two inertial frames, there is only one unambiguous relative velocity (or its negative). For two boosts, the peculiar result of ''two'' inequivalent relative velocities instead of one seems to contradict the symmetry of relative motion between any two frames. Which is the correct velocity of {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} relative to {{math|Σ}}? Since this inequality may be somewhat unexpected and potentially breaking EPVR, this question is warranted.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This is sometimes called the "Mocanu paradox". Mocanu himself didn't name it a paradox, but rather a "difficulty" within the framework of relativistic electrodynamics in a 1986 paper. He was also quick to acknowledge that the problem is explained by Thomas precession {{harvtxt|Mocanu|1992}}, but the name lingers on.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation in terms of Lorentz transformations==

[[File:Lorentz boosts and Thomas rotation 1.svg|310px|thumb|A frame Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime; is boosted with velocity {{math|'''v'''}} relative to another frame Σ&amp;prime;, which is boosted with velocity {{math|'''u'''}} relative to another frame Σ.]]

===Two boosts equals a boost and rotation===

The answer to the question lies in the Thomas rotation, and that one must be careful in specifying which coordinate system is involved at each step. When viewed from {{math|Σ}}, the coordinate axes of {{math|Σ}} and {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} are ''not'' parallel. While this can be hard to imagine since both pairs {{math|(Σ, Σ&amp;prime;)}} and {{math|(Σ&amp;prime;, Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;)}} have parallel coordinate axes, it is easy to explain mathematically.

Velocity addition does not provide a complete description of the relation between the frames. One must formulate the complete description in terms of [[Lorentz transformation]]s corresponding to the velocities. A Lorentz boost with any velocity {{math|'''v'''}} (magnitude less than {{math|''c''}}) is given symbolically by

:&lt;math&gt;X' = B(\mathbf{v})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the coordinates and transformation matrix are compactly expressed in [[block matrix]] form

:&lt;math&gt;X' = \begin{bmatrix} c t' \\ \mathbf{r}' \end{bmatrix} \quad B(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma_\mathbf{v} &amp; - \dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{c}\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T} \\ -\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}}{c}\mathbf{v} &amp; \mathbf{I} + \dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1} \dfrac{\mathbf{vv}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2} \\ \end{bmatrix} \quad X = \begin{bmatrix} c t \\ \mathbf{r} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and in turn, {{math|'''r''', '''r'''&amp;prime;, '''v'''}} are [[column vector]]s (the [[matrix transpose]] of these are row vectors), and {{math|''γ''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Lorentz factor]] of velocity {{math|'''v'''}}. The boost matrix is a [[symmetric matrix]]. The inverse transformation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf {v} )^{-1}=B(-\mathbf {v} )\quad \Rightarrow \quad X=B(-\mathbf {v} )X' &lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that to each admissible velocity {{math|'''v'''}} there corresponds a ''pure'' Lorentz boost,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \leftrightarrow B(\mathbf{v}).&lt;/math&gt;

Velocity addition {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} corresponds to the composition of boosts {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} in that order. The {{math|''B''('''u''')}} acts on {{math|''X''}} first, then {{math|''B''('''v''')}} acts on {{math|''B''('''u''')''X''}}. Notice succeeding operators act on the ''left'' in any composition of operators, so {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}} should be interpreted as a boost with velocities {{math|'''u'''}} then {{math|'''v'''}}, not {{math|'''v'''}} then {{math|'''u'''}}. Performing the Lorentz transformations by block matrix multiplication,

:&lt;math&gt;X'' = B(\mathbf{v}) X' \,,\quad X' = B(\mathbf{u}) X \quad \Rightarrow \quad X'' = \Lambda X &lt;/math&gt;

the composite transformation matrix is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = B(\mathbf{v}) B(\mathbf{u}) = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma &amp; -\mathbf{a}^\mathrm{T}\\
-\mathbf{b} &amp; \mathbf{M}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and in turn

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\gamma_\mathbf{v}\gamma_\mathbf{u}\left(1+\frac{\mathbf{v}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{u}}{c^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} =\frac{\gamma}{c} \mathbf{u}\oplus\mathbf{v} \,, \quad \mathbf{b} = \frac{\gamma}{c} \mathbf{v}\oplus\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}=\gamma_\mathbf{u}\gamma_\mathbf{v}\frac{\mathbf{vu}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}+\left(\mathbf{I}+\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{v}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1}\frac{\mathbf{vv}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}\right)\left(\mathbf{I}+\dfrac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}^2}{\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1}\frac{\mathbf{uu}^\mathrm{T}}{c^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''γ''}} is the composite Lorentz factor, and {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are 3×1 [[column vector]]s proportional to the composite velocities. The 3×3 matrix {{math|'''M'''}} will turn out to have geometric significance.

The inverse transformations are

:&lt;math&gt; X = B(-\mathbf{u}) X' \,,\quad X' = B(-\mathbf{v}) X'' \quad \Rightarrow \quad X = \Lambda^{-1} X'' &lt;/math&gt;

and the composition amounts to a negation ''and'' exchange of velocities,

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{-1} = B(-\mathbf{u}) B(-\mathbf{v}) = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma &amp; \mathbf{b}^\mathrm{T}\\
\mathbf{a} &amp; \mathbf{M}^\mathrm{T}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the relative velocities are exchanged, looking at the blocks of {{math|Λ}}, one observes the composite transformation to be the [[matrix transpose]] of {{math|Λ}}. This is not the same as the original matrix, so the composite Lorentz transformation matrix is not symmetric, and thus not a single boost. This in turn translates to the incompleteness of velocity composition from the result of two boosts, symbolically;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf u \oplus \mathbf v) \ne B(\mathbf v)B(\mathbf u) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

To make the description complete, it is necessary to introduce a rotation, before or after the boost. This rotation is the '''Thomas rotation'''. A rotation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;X' = R(\boldsymbol{\theta})X&lt;/math&gt;

where the 4×4 rotation matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})={\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;\mathbf {R} ({\boldsymbol {\theta }})\end{bmatrix}} &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|'''R'''}} is a 3×3 [[rotation matrix]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In the literature, the 3d rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} may be denoted by other letters, others use a name and the relative velocity vectors involved, e.g., {{math|tom['''u''', '''v''']}} for "Thomas rotation" or {{math|gyr['''u''', '''v''']}} for "gyration" (see [[gyrovector space]]). Correspondingly the 4d rotation matrix {{math|''R''}} (non-bold italic) in this article may be denoted

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tom} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathrm{tom}[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathrm{Gyr} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathrm{gyr}[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this article the [[axis-angle representation]] is used, and {{math|'''θ''' {{=}} ''θ'''''e'''}} is the "axis-angle vector", the angle {{math|''θ''}} multiplied by a unit vector {{math|'''e'''}} parallel to the axis. Also, the ''right-handed'' convention for the spatial coordinates is used (see [[orientation (vector space)]]), so that rotations are positive in the anticlockwise sense according to the [[right-hand rule]], and negative in the clockwise sense. With these conventions; the rotation matrix rotates any 3d vector about the axis {{math|'''e'''}} through angle {{math|''θ''}} anticlockwise (an [[active transformation]]), which has the equivalent effect of rotating the coordinate frame clockwise about the same axis through the same angle (a passive transformation).

The rotation matrix is an [[orthogonal matrix]], its transpose equals its inverse, and negating either the angle or axis in the rotation matrix corresponds to a rotation in the opposite sense, so the inverse transformation is readily obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{-1}=R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{\mathrm {T} }= R(-{\boldsymbol {\theta }}) \quad \Rightarrow \quad X=R(-\boldsymbol{\theta})X'\,. &lt;/math&gt;

A boost followed or preceded by a rotation is also Lorentz transformation, since these operations leave the spacetime interval invariant. The same Lorentz transformation has two decompositions for appropriately chosen rapidity and axis-angle vectors;

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\boldsymbol{\theta},\mathbf{u})=R(\boldsymbol{\theta})B(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\mathbf{v},\boldsymbol{\theta})=B(\mathbf{v})R(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

and if these are two decompositions are equal, the two boosts are related by

:&lt;math&gt;B(\mathbf{u})=R(-\boldsymbol{\theta})B(\mathbf{v})R(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

so the boosts are related by a [[matrix similarity]] transformation.

It turns out the equality between two boosts and a rotation followed or preceded by a single boost is correct: the rotation of frames matches the angular separation of the composite velocities, and explains how one composite velocity applies to one frame, while the other applies to the rotated frame. The rotation also breaks the symmetry in the overall Lorentz transformation making it nonsymmetric. For this specific rotation, let the angle be {{math|''ε''}} and the axis be defined by the unit vector {{math|'''e'''}}, so the axis-angle vector is {{math|'''ε''' {{=}} ''ε'''''e'''}}.

Altogether, two different orderings of two boosts means there are two inequivalent transformations. Each of these can be split into a boost then rotation, or a rotation then boost, doubling the number of inequivalent transformations to four. The inverse transformations are equally important; they provide information about what the other observer perceives. In all, there are eight transformations to consider, just for the problem of two Lorentz boosts. In summary, with subsequent operations acting on the left, they are

Matching up the boosts followed by rotations, in the original setup, an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} then rotate clockwise (first diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime; notices {{math|Σ}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}} then rotate anticlockwise (second diagram). If the velocities are exchanged an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to move with velocity {{math|'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}} then rotate anticlockwise (third diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}} then rotate clockwise (fourth diagram).

The cases of rotations then boosts are similar (no diagrams are shown). Matching up the rotations followed by boosts, in the original setup, an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to rotate clockwise then move with velocity {{math|'''v'''&amp;oplus;'''u'''}}, and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}. If the velocities are exchanged an observer in {{math|Σ}} notices {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity {{math|'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}, and because of the rotation an observer in {{math|Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;}} notices {{math|Σ}} to rotate clockwise then move with velocity {{math|−'''u'''&amp;oplus;'''v'''}}.

===Finding the axis and angle of the Thomas rotation===

The above formulae constitute the relativistic velocity addition and the Thomas rotation explicitly in the general Lorentz transformations. Throughout, in every composition of boosts and decomposition into a boost and rotation, the important formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{R}+\frac1{\gamma+1}\mathbf{ba}^\mathrm{T} &lt;/math&gt;

holds, allowing the rotation matrix to be defined completely in terms of the relative velocities {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}. The angle of a rotation matrix in the axis–angle representation can be found from the [[Rotation matrix#Determining the angle|trace of the rotation matrix]], the general result for ''any'' axis is {{math|tr('''R''') {{=}} 1 + 2 cos''ε''}}. Taking the trace of the equation gives&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macfarlane|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|pages=4, 11, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gourgoulhon|2013|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\epsilon = \frac{(1+\gamma+\gamma_\mathbf{u}+\gamma_\mathbf{v})^2}{(1+\gamma)(1+\gamma_\mathbf{u})(1+\gamma_\mathbf{v})} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The angle {{math|''ε''}} between {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} is ''not'' the same as the angle {{math|''α''}} between {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}}.

In both frames Σ and Σ&amp;prime;&amp;prime;, for every composition and decomposition, another important formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{Ra} &lt;/math&gt;

holds. The vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are indeed related by a rotation, in fact by the same rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} which rotates the coordinate frames. Starting from {{math|'''a'''}}, the matrix {{math|'''R'''}} rotates this into {{math|'''b'''}} anticlockwise, it follows their [[cross product]] (in the right-hand convention)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}= \frac{\gamma_\mathbf{u}\gamma_\mathbf{v}(\gamma^2 -1)(\gamma+\gamma_\mathbf{v}+\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1)}{c^2(\gamma_\mathbf{v}+1)(\gamma_\mathbf{u}+1)(\gamma+1)} \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

defines the axis correctly, therefore the axis is also parallel to {{math|'''u'''×'''v'''}}. The magnitude of this pseudovector is neither interesting nor important, only the direction is, so it can be normalized into the [[unit vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e} = \frac{\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}|}&lt;/math&gt;

which still completely defines the direction of the axis without loss of information.

The rotation is simply a "static" rotation and there is no relative [[rotational motion]] between the frames, there is relative translational motion in the boost. However, if the frames accelerate, then the rotated frame rotates with an angular velocity. This effect is known as the [[Thomas precession]], and arises purely from the kinematics of successive Lorentz boosts.

== Finding the Thomas rotation ==
{{quote|text=The decomposition process described (below) can be carried through on the product of two pure Lorentz transformations to obtain explicitly the rotation of the coordinate axes resulting from the two successive "boosts". In general, the algebra involved is quite forbidding, more than enough, usually, to discourage any actual demonstration of the rotation matrix|source={{harvtxt|Goldstein|1980|p=286}}}}

In principle, it is pretty easy. Since every Lorentz transformation is a product of a boost and a rotation, the consecutive application of two pure boosts is a pure boost, either followed by or preceded by a pure rotation. Thus suppose

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = B(\mathbf w)R.&lt;/math&gt;

The task is to glean from this equation the boost velocity {{math|'''w'''}} and the rotation {{math|''R''}} from the matrix entries of {{math|Λ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of events are related by

:&lt;math&gt;x'^\mu = {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu x^\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

Inverting this relation yields

:&lt;math&gt;{(\Lambda^{-1})^\nu}_\mu{\Lambda^\mu}_\rho x^\rho = {(\Lambda^{-1})^\nu}_\mu x'^\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x^\nu = {\Lambda_\mu}^\nu x'^\mu.&lt;/math&gt;

Set {{math|''x''&amp;prime; {{=}} (''ct''&amp;prime;, 0, 0, 0).}} Then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ν''&lt;/sup&gt;}} will record the spacetime position of the origin of the primed system,

:&lt;math&gt;x^\nu = {\Lambda_0}^\nu x'^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{pmatrix}ct \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}{\Lambda_0}^0 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^1 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^2 ct' \\ {\Lambda_0}^3 ct'\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{-1} = (B(\mathbf w)R)^{-1} = R^{-1}B(-\mathbf{w}),&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying this matrix with a pure rotation will not affect the zeroth columns and rows, and

:&lt;math&gt;x = \begin{pmatrix}ct \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}\gamma ct' \\ \gamma\beta_x ct' \\ \gamma\beta_y ct' \\ \gamma\beta_z ct'\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}\gamma ct' \\ \gamma w_x t' \\ \gamma w_y t' \\ \gamma w_z t'\end{pmatrix}
= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} ct' \\  w_x t' \\ w_y t' \\ w_z t'\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

which could have been anticipated from the formula for a simple boost in the {{math|''x''}}-direction, and for the relative velocity vector

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ct}\mathbf x = \frac{\mathbf w}{c} = \boldsymbol \beta = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x_1} {ct} \\ \frac{x_2} {ct} \\ \frac{x_3} {ct}\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} \beta_x \\ \beta_y \\ \beta_z \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}{\Lambda_0}^1/{\Lambda_0}^0 \\ {\Lambda_0}^2/{\Lambda_0}^0 \\ {\Lambda_0}^3/{\Lambda_0}^0 \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus given with {{math|Λ}}, one obtains {{math|'''β'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} by little more than inspection of {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. (Of course, {{math|'''w'''}} can also be found using velocity addition per above.) From {{math|'''w'''}}, construct {{math|''B''(−'''w''')}}. The solution for {{math|''R''}} is then

:&lt;math&gt;R = B(-\mathbf w)\Lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

With the ansatz

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = RB(\mathbf w),&lt;/math&gt;

one finds by the same means

:&lt;math&gt;R = \Lambda B(-\mathbf w).&lt;/math&gt;

Finding a formal solution in terms of velocity parameters {{math|'''u'''}} and {{math|'''v'''}} involves first ''formally'' multiplying {{math|''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}}, formally inverting, then reading off {{math|'''β'''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt;}} form the result, ''formally'' building {{math|''B''(−'''w''')}} from the result, and, finally, formally multiplying {{math|''B''(−'''w''')''B''('''v''')''B''('''u''')}}. It should be clear that this is a daunting task, and it is difficult to interpret/identify the result as a rotation, though it is clear a priori that it is. It is these difficulties that the Goldstein quote at the top refers to. The problem has been thoroughly studied under simplifying assumptions over the years.

==Group theoretical origin==

{{main|Lorentz group|Representation theory of the Lorentz group}}

Another way to explain the origin of the rotation is by looking at the generators of the [[Lorentz group]].

=== Boosts from velocities ===

The passage from a velocity to a boost is obtained as follows. An arbitrary boost is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1999|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol \zeta) = e^{-\boldsymbol \zeta \cdot \mathbf K},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''ζ'''}} is a triple of real numbers serving as coordinates on the boost subspace of the Lie algebra {{math|'''so'''(3, 1)}} spanned by the matrices

:&lt;math&gt;(K_1, K_2, K_3) = \left( 
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right],
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right],
\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix} \right]
\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The vector

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \zeta = \frac{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \tanh^{-1}\beta&lt;/math&gt;

is called the ''boost parameter'' or ''boost vector'', its norm is the [[rapidity]]. Here {{mvar|β}} is the ''velocity parameter'', the magnitude of the vector {{math|'''β''' {{=}} '''u'''/''c''}}. While for {{mvar|ζ}} one has {{math|0 ≤ ''ζ'' &lt; ∞}} the {{mvar|β}} is confined by {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' &lt; 1}}, and hence {{math|0 ≤ ''u'' &lt; ''c''}}. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;B(\boldsymbol \zeta) = e^{-(\tanh^{-1}\beta) \frac{ \boldsymbol{\beta}}{\beta} \cdot \mathbf K}
 = e^{-{\tanh^{-1}\beta \over c\beta} \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf K} \equiv B(\mathbf u).&lt;/math&gt;

The set of velocities satisfying {{math|0 ≤ ''u'' &lt; ''c''}} is an open ball in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is called the space of '''admissible velocities''' in the literature. It is endowed with a [[Velocity-addition formula#Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic geometry]] described in the linked article.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|2002|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commutators===

The [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Explicit formulas|generators of boosts, {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}]], in different directions do not commute. This has the effect that two consecutive boosts is not a pure boost in general, but a rotation preceding a boost.

Consider a succession of boosts in the x direction, then the y direction, expanding each boost to first order&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ryder|1996|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\zeta_y K_y}e^{\zeta_x K_x} = (I-\zeta_y K_y+\cdots)(I-\zeta_x K_x+\cdots)= I-\zeta_x K_x -\zeta_y K_y + \zeta_x\zeta_y K_y K_x+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\zeta_y K_y}e^{-\zeta_x K_x} = I+\zeta_x K_x +\zeta_y K_y + \zeta_x\zeta_y K_y K_x +\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[group commutator]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e^{-\zeta_y K_y}e^{-\zeta_x K_x}e^{\zeta_y K_y}e^{\zeta_x K_x} = I &amp; + \zeta_x\zeta_y[K_y,K_x]-(\zeta_xK_x)^2-(\zeta_yK_y)^2 \\
&amp; +\zeta_x^2\zeta_y[K_x,K_y]K_x+\zeta_x\zeta_y^2K_y[K_y,K_x]\\
&amp; +(\zeta_x\zeta_y)^2K_yK_xK_yK_x +\cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Three of the [[commutation relation]]s of the Lorentz generators are
:&lt;math&gt; [J_x ,J_y ] =  J_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [K_x ,K_y ] = - J_z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [J_x ,K_y ] = K_z &lt;/math&gt;

where the bracket {{math|[''A'', ''B''] {{=}} ''AB'' − ''BA''}} is a [[binary operation]] known as the ''[[commutator]]'', and the other relations can be found by taking [[cyclic permutation]]s of x, y, z components (i.e. change x to y, y to z, and z to x, repeat).

Returning to the group commutator, the commutation relations of the boost generators imply for a boost along the x then y directions, there will be a rotation about the z axis. In terms of the rapidities, the rotation angle {{mvar|θ}} is given by
::&lt;math&gt; \tan \frac{\theta}{2}=\tanh \frac{\zeta_x}{2}\tanh \frac{\zeta_y}{2}  .&lt;/math&gt;

==Spacetime diagrams for non-collinear boosts==

The familiar notion of vector addition for velocities in the [[Euclidean plane]] can be done in a triangular formation, or since vector addition is commutative, the vectors in both orderings geometrically form a parallelogram (see "[[parallelogram law]]"). This does not hold for relativistic velocity addition; instead a [[hyperbolic triangle]] arises whose edges are related to the rapidities of the boosts. Changing the order of the boost velocities, one does not find the resultant boost velocities to coincide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Varićak|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;
