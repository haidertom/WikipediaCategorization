'''Association of ideas''', or '''mental association''', is a process by which representations arise in [[consciousness]], and also for a principle put forward by an important historical school of thinkers to account generally for the succession of mental phenomena.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}} The term is now used mostly in the [[history of philosophy]] and of [[History of psychology|psychology]]. One idea was thought to follow another in consciousness if it were associated by some principle. The three commonly asserted principles of association were similarity, contiguity, and contrast, numerous others had been added by the nineteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century [[physiological psychology]] was so altering the approach to this subject that much of the older associationist theory was rejected.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

Everyday observation of the association of one idea or memory with another gives a face validity to the notion. In addition, the notion of association between ideas and behavior gave some early impetus to [[Behaviorism|behaviorist thinking]]. The core ideas of associationist thinking recur in some recent thought on [[cognition]], especially consciousness.

==Early theory==
The associationist theory is anticipated in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', as part of the doctrine of [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The idea of Simmias is recalled by the picture of Simmias (similarity) and that of a friend by the sight of the lyre on which he played (contiguity).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}} But [[Aristotle]] is credited with originating associationist thinking based on this passage:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

{{Quote|
"When, therefore, we accomplish an act of Reminiscence, we pass through a certain series of precursive movements, until we arrive at a movement, on which the one we are in quest of is habitually consequent. Hence too it is, that we hunt through the mental train, excogitating from the present or some other, and from its similar or contrary or coadjacent. Through this process Reminiscence is effected. For the movements are, in these cases, sometimes at the same, sometimes at the same time, sometimes parts of the same whole; so that the subsequent movement is already more than half accomplished."|
Aristotle as translated by W. Hamilton|&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[On Memory|De Memoria et Reminiscentia]]'', as translated by Sir William Hamilton and appended to his edition of Reid's Works: [https://archive.org/details/worksnowfullyco02reiduoft|The Works of Thomas D.D. Reid by Sir William Hamilton], Vol 2., 8th Edition, Edinburgh, Maclachlan and Stewart, 1880, pp. 897-900.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The passage is obscure, but it indicates the principles known as contiguity, similarity, and contrast. Similar principles are stated by [[Zeno the Stoic]], by [[Epicurus]] (see ''Diogenes Laertius'' vii. § 52, x. § 32), and by St [[Augustine of Hippo]] (''Confessions'', x. c. 19). Aristotle's doctrine was expanded and illustrated during throughout the Middle Ages, and in some cases even into the 17th century. [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] listed philosophical authorities who gave prominence to the general fact of mental association - the Spanish philosopher [[Ludovicus Vives]] (1492-1540) especially being exhaustive in his account of memory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

In [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s psychology much importance is assigned to what he called, variously, the succession, sequence, series, consequence, coherence, train of imaginations or thoughts in mental discourse. But not before [[David Hume]] is there an express question as to what are the distinct principles of association. [[John Locke]] had, meanwhile, introduced the phrase "association of ideas" as the title of a supplementary chapter incorporated with the fourth edition of his ''Essay'', though with little or no suggestion of its general psychological import. Hume reduced the principles of association to three: similarity, contiguity in time and place, and cause and/or effect. [[Dugald Stewart]] suggested resemblance, contrariety, and vicinity in time and place, though he added, as another obvious principle, accidental coincidence in the sounds of words, and further noted three other cases of relation: cause and effect, means and end, and premise and conclusion, as connecting trains of thought under circumstances of special attention. [[Thomas Reid]], made light of association, remarking that it seems to require only the power of habit to explain the spontaneous recurrence of trains of thinking, which become familiar by frequent repetition (''Intellectual Powers'', p.&amp;nbsp;387).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

Hamilton's own theory of mental reproduction, suggestion, or association is a development of his ideas in ''Lectures on Metaphysics'' (vol. ii. p.&amp;nbsp;223, seq.), which reduced the principles of association to simultaneity and affinity, and these further to one supreme principle of [[Redintegration]] or totality. In the final scheme he sets out four general laws of mental succession:
*(1) Associability or possible co-suggestion (all thoughts of the same mental subject are associable or capable of suggesting each other);
*(2) Repetition or direct remembrance (thoughts identical in a modification, but differing in time, tend to suggest each other);
*(3) Redintegration, indirect remembrance or reminiscence (thoughts once identical in time, but different as mental modes, are suggestive of each other in the order they originally held);
*(4) Preference (thoughts are suggested not merely by the general subjective relation subsisting between them, they are also suggested in proportion to the amount of interest they hold to the individual mind).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

These special laws logically follow from the general laws above:
*A - Primary - modes of the laws of Repetition and Redintegration:
**(1) law of Similars (Analogy, Affinity);
**(2) law of Contrast; and
**(3) law of Coadjacency (Cause and Effect, etc.).
*B - Secondary - modes of the law of Preference, under the law of Possibility:
**(1) laws of Immediacy and Homogeneity and
**(2) law of Facility.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

==The Associationist School==
The "Associationist School" includes the English psychologists who aimed at explaining all mental acquisitions and the more complex mental processes generally under laws under the associations which their predecessors applied only to simple reproduction. Hamilton, though professing to deal with reproduction only, formulates a number of still more general laws of mental succession: law of Succession, law of Variation, law of Dependence, law of Relativity or Integration (involving law of Conditioned), and, finally, law of Intrinsic or Objective Relativity. These he posits as the highest to which human consciousness is subject, but it is in a sense quite different that the psychologists of the Associationist School intend their appropriation of the principle or principles commonly signalized. In this regard, as far as can be judged from imperfect records, they were anticipated to some extent by the experientialists of ancient times, both Stoic and Epicurean (cf. ''Diogenes Laertius'', as above).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

In the period that led to modern philosophy, Hobbes was the first thinker of permanent note to whom this doctrine may be traced. Although he took a narrow view of the phenomena of mental succession, he (after dealing with trains of imagination or "mental discourse") sought in the higher departments of intellect to explain reasoning as a discourse in words, dependent upon an arbitrary system of marks, each associated with or standing for a variety of imaginations. Except for a general assertion that reasoning is a reckoning (otherwise, a compounding and resolving), he had no other account of knowledge to give. The whole emotional side of mind ("the passions") he similarly resolved into an expectation of consequences based on past experience of pleasures and pains of sense. Thus, though he made no serious attempt to justify his analysis in detail, he is undoubtedly to be classed with the associationists of the next century. They, however, were wont to trace their psychological theory no further back than to Locke's ''Essay''. [[Bishop Berkeley]] was driven to posit expressly a principle of suggestion or association in these terms:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"That one idea may suggest another to the mind, it will suffice that they have been observed to go together, without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence, or so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist''." (''New Theory of Vision'', § 25)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and, to support the obvious application of the principle to the case of the sensations of sight and touch before him, he constantly urged that association of sound and sense of language which the later school has always put in the foreground, whether as illustrating the principle in general or in explanation of the supreme importance of language for knowledge. It was natural, then, that Hume, coming after Berkeley and assuming Berkeley's results (though he reverted to the larger inquiry of Locke), should be more explicit in his reference to association. But Hume was original also, when he spoke of it as a "kind of attraction which in the mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural, and to show itself in as many and as various forms''." (''Human Nature'', i. 1, § 4){{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

Other inquirers about the same time conceived of association with this breadth of view, and set themselves to track, as psychologists, its effects in detail.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

===David Hartley===
[[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]] is the thinker most precisely identified with the Associationist School. In his ''Observations on Man'', published in 1749 (11 years after Hume's ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' and one year after the better known ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]''), opened the path for all the investigations of like nature that have been so characteristic of English psychology. A physician by profession, he sought to combine with an elaborate theory of mental association a minutely detailed hypothesis as to the corresponding action of the nervous system, based upon the suggestion of a vibratory motion within the nerves thrown out by [[Isaac Newton]] in the last paragraph of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. So far, however, from promoting the acceptance of the psychological theory, this physical hypothesis proved to have rather the opposite effect, and it began to be dropped by Hartley's followers (as [[Joseph Priestley]], in his abridged edition of the ''Observations'', 1775) before it was seriously impugned from without. When it is studied in the original, and not taken upon the report of hostile critics, who would not, or could not understand it, no little importance must still be accorded to the first attempt, not seldom a curiously felicitous one, to carry through that parallelism of the physical and psychical, which since then has come to count for more and more in the science of mind. Nor should it be forgotten that Hartley himself, for all his paternal interest in the doctrine of vibrations, was careful to keep separate from its fortunes the cause of his other doctrine of mental association. Of this the point lay in no mere restatement, with new precision, of a principle of coherence among "ideas" (which were also called by Hartley "vestiges", "types" and "images"), but in its being taken as a clue by which to follow the progressive development of the mind's powers. Holding that mental states could be scientifically understood only as they were analysed, Hartley sought for a principle of synthesis to explain the complexity exhibited not only in trains of representative images, but alike in the most involved combinations of reasonings and (as Berkeley had seen) in the apparently simple phenomena of objective perception, as well as in the varied play of the emotions, or, again, in the manifold conscious adjustments of the motor system. One principle appeared to him sufficient for all, running, as enunciated for the simplest case, thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Any sensations A, B, C, etc., by being associated with one another a sufficient number of times, get such a power over the corresponding ideas a, b, c, etc., that any one of the sensations A, when impressed alone, shall be able to excite in the mind b, c, etc., the ideas of the rest."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To render the principle applicable in the cases where the associated elements are neither sensations nor simple ideas of sensations, Hartley's first care was to determine the conditions under which states other than these simplest ones have their rise in the mind, becoming the matter of ever higher and higher combinations. The principle itself supplied the key to the difficulty, when coupled with the notion, already implied in Berkeley's investigations, of a coalescence of simple ideas of sensation into one complex idea, which may cease to bear any obvious relation to its constituents. So far from being content, like Hobbes, to make a rough generalization to all mind from the phenomena of developed memory, as if these might be straightway assumed, Hartley made a point of referring them, in a subordinate place of their own, to his universal principle of mental synthesis. He expressly put forward the law of association, endued with such scope, as supplying what was wanting to Locke's doctrine in its more strictly psychological aspect, and thus marks by his work a distinct advance on the line of development of the experiential philosophy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

===Continuing reception===
The new doctrine received warm support from some, as [[William Law]] and Priestley, who both, like Hume and Hartley himself, took the principle of association as having the like import for the science of mind that gravitation had acquired for the science of matter. The principle began also, if not always with direct reference to Hartley, yet, doubtless, owing to his impressive advocacy of it, to be applied systematically in special directions, as by [[Abraham Tucker]] (1768) to [[morals]], and by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] (1790) to [[aesthetics]]. [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]] (d. 1820) subjected anew to discussion the question of theory. Hardly less unjust to Hartley than Reid or Stewart had been, and forward to proclaim all that was different in his own position, Brown must yet be ranked with the associationists before and after him for the prominence he assigned to the associative principle in [[sensory perception]] (what he called "external affections of mind"), and for his reference of all other mental states ("internal affections") to the two generic capacities or susceptibilities of Simple and Relative Suggestion. He preferred the word "[[suggestion]]" to "association", which seemed to him to imply some prior connecting process, for which there was no evidence in many of the most important cases of suggestion, nor even, strictly speaking, in the case of contiguity in time where the term seemed least inapplicable. According to him, all that could be assumed was a general constitutional tendency of the mind to exist successively in states that have certain relations to each other, of itself only, and without any external cause or any influence previous to that operating at the moment of the suggestion. Brown's chief contribution to the general doctrine of mental association, besides what he did for the theory of perception, was, perhaps, his analysis of voluntary reminiscence and constructive [[imagination]], faculties that appear at first sight to lie altogether beyond the explanatory range of the principle. In [[James Mill]]'s ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind'' (1829), the principle, much as Hartley had conceived it, was carried out, with characteristic consequence, over the psychological field. With a much enlarged and more varied conception of association, [[Alexander Bain]] reexecuted the general psychological task, while Herbert Spencer revised the doctrine from the new point of view of the evolution hypothesis. [[John Stuart Mill]] made only occasional excursions into the region of psychology proper, but sought, in his ''System of Logic'' (1843), to determine the conditions of objective truth from the point of view of the associationist theory, and, thus or otherwise being drawn into general philosophical discussion, spread wider than any one before him its repute.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

===French and German associationists and Kant===
The Associationist School was composed chiefly of British thinkers, but in France also it had distinguished representatives. Of these it will suffice to mention [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], who professed to explain all knowledge from the single principle of association (liaison) of ideas, operating through a previous association with signs, verbal or other. In Germany, before the time of [[Immanuel Kant]], mental association was generally treated in the traditional manner, as by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

Kant's inquiry into the foundations of knowledge, agreeing in its general purport with Locke's, however it differed in its critical procedure, brought him face to face with the newer doctrine that had been grafted on Locke's philosophy. To account for the fact of synthesis in cognition, in express opposition to associationism, as represented by Hume, was, in truth, his prime object, starting, as he did, from the assumption that there was in knowledge that which no mere association of experiences could explain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

To the extent, therefore, that his influence prevailed, all inquiries made by the English associationists were discounted in Germany. Notwithstanding, under the very shadow of his authority a corresponding, if not related, movement was initiated by [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]]. As peculiar and widely different from anything conceived by the associationists as Herbart's metaphysical opinions were, he was at one with them and at variance with Kant in assigning fundamental importance to the psychological investigation of the development of consciousness. Further, his conception of the laws determining the interaction and flow of mental presentations and representations, when taken in its bare psychological import, was essentially similar to theirs. In [[Friedrich Eduard Beneke]]'s psychology also and in more recent inquiries conducted mainly by physiologists, mental association has been understood in its wider scope, as a general principle of explanation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

===Differences among versions of associationist thought===
The associationists differ among themselves in the statement of their principle and, when they adduce several principles, in their conception of the relative importance of these.
* Hartley took account only of Contiguity, or the repetition of impressions synchronous or immediately successive.
* The same is true of James Mill, though, incidentally, he made an express attempt to resolve the received principle of Similarity and, through this, the other principle of Contrast, into his fundamental law (the law of Frequency, as he sometimes called it, because upon frequency, in conjunction with vividness of impressions, the strength of association, in his view, depended).
* In a sense of his own, Brown also, while accepting the common Aristotelian enumeration of principles, inclined to the opinion that "all suggestion may be found to depend on prior coexistence, or at least on such proximity as is itself very probably a modification of coexistence", provided account be taken of
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:"the influence of emotions and other feelings that are very different from ideas, as when an analogous object suggests an analogous object by the influence of an emotion which each separately may have produced before, and which is, therefore, common to both".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* To the contrary effect, Spencer maintained that the fundamental law of all mental association is that presentations aggregate or cohere with their like in past experience, and that, besides this law, there is in strictness no other, all further phenomena of association being incidental. Thus in particular, he would have explained association by Contiguity as due to the circumstance of imperfect assimilation of the present to the past in consciousness.
* [[Alexander Bain]] regarded Contiguity and Similarity logically, as perfectly distinct principles, though in actual psychological occurrence blending intimately with each other, contiguous trains being started by a first (it may be, implicit) representation through Similarity, while the express assimilation of present to past in consciousness is always, or tends to be, followed by the revival of what was presented in contiguity with that past.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

===Inseparable association===
The highest philosophical interest, as distinguished from that which is more strictly psychological, attaches to the mode of mental association called Inseparable. The coalescence of mental states noted by Hartley, as it had been assumed by Berkeley, was farther formulated by James Mill in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Some ideas are by frequency and strength of association so closely combined that they cannot be separated; if one exists, the other exists along with it in spite of whatever effort we make to disjoin them." (''Analysis of the Human Mind'', 2nd ed., vol. i, p. 93)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
John Stuart Mill's statement was more guarded and particular:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When two phenomena have been very often experienced in conjunction, and have not, in any single instance, occurred separately either in experience or in thought, there is produced between them what has been called inseparable, or, less correctly, indissoluble, association; by which is not meant that the association must inevitably last to the end of life - that no subsequent experience or process of thought can possibly avail to dissolve it; but only that as long as no such experience or process of thought has taken place, the association is irresistible; it is impossible for us to think the one thing disjoined from the other." (''Examination of Hamilton's Philosophy'', 2nd ed., p. 191)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is chiefly by John Stuart Mill that the philosophical application of the principle has been made. The first and most obvious application is to so-called necessary truths, those that are not merely analytic judgments but involve a synthesis of distinct notions. Again, the same thinker sought to prove Inseparable Association the ground of belief in an external objective world. The former application, especially, is facilitated, when the experience through which the association is supposed to be constituted is understood as cumulative in the race, and transmissible as original endowment to individuals - endowment that may be expressed either, subjectively, as latent intelligence or, objectively, as fixed nervous connexions. Spencer, as suggested before, is the author of this extended view of mental association.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

==Criticism in the 19th century==
In the later part of the 19th century the associationist theory was subjected to searching criticism, and it was maintained by many writers that the laws are both unsatisfactorily expressed and insufficient to explain the facts. Among the most vigorous and comprehensive of these investigations is that of [[F. H. Bradley]] in his ''Principles of Logic'' (1883). Having admitted the psychological fact of mental association, he attacks the theories of Mill and Bain primarily on the ground that they purport to give an account of mental life as a whole, a metaphysical doctrine of existence. According to this doctrine, mental activity is ultimately reducible to particular feelings, impressions, ideas, which are disparate and unconnected, until chance Association brings them together. On this assumption, the laws of Association naturally emerge in the following form:
* The law of Contiguity
:"Actions, sensations and states of feeling, occurring together or in close connexion, tend to grow together, or cohere, in such a way that, when any one of them is afterwards presented to the mind, the others are apt to be brought up in idea." (A. Bain, ''Senses and Intellect'', p. 327)
* The law of Similarity
:"Present actions, sensation, thoughts or emotions tend to revive their like among previous impressions or states." (A. Bain, ''Senses and Intellect'', p. 457{{snd}}compare J. S. Mill, ''Logic'', 9th ed., ii, p. 440){{sfn|Chisholm|pp=785–786}}

The fundamental objection to the law of Contiguity is that ideas and impressions, once experienced, do not recur; they are particular existences, and, as such, do not persevere to recur or be presented. So Mill is wrong in speaking of two impressions being "frequently experienced." Bradley claims thus to reduce the law to
:"When we have experienced (or even thought of) several pairs of impressions (simultaneous or successive), which pairs are like one another; then whenever an idea occurs which is like all the impressions on one side of these pairs, it tends to excite an idea which is like all the impressions on the other side."
This statement is destructive of the title of the law, because it appears that what were contiguous (the impressions) are not associated, and what are associated (the ideas) were not contiguous; in other words, the association is not due to contiguity at all.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

Proceeding to the law of Similarity (which in Mill's view is at the back of association by contiguity), and having made a similar criticism of its phrasing, Bradley maintains that it involves an even greater absurdity; if two ideas are to be recognized as similar, they must both be present in the mind; if one is to call up the other, one must be absent. To the obvious reply that the similarity is recognized ex post facto, and not while the former idea is being called up, Bradley replies simply that such a view reduces the law to the mere statement of a phenomenon and deprives it of any explanatory value, though he hardly makes it clear in what sense this necessarily invalidates the law from a psychological point of view. He further points out with greater force that in point of fact mere similarity is not the basis of ordinary cases of mental reproduction, inasmuch as in any given instance there is more difference than similarity between the ideas associated.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

Bradley himself bases association on identity plus contiguity:
:"Any part of a single state of mind tends, if reproduced, to re-instate the remainder."
or
:"Any element tends to reproduce those elements with which it has formed one state of mind."
This law he calls by the name "[[redintegration]]", understood, of course, in a sense different from that in which Hamilton used it. The radical difference between this law and those of Mill and Bain is that it deals not with particular units of thoughts but with universals or identity between individuals. In any example of such reproduction, the universal appears in a particular form which is more or less different from that in which it originally existed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

==Psychophysical researches==
[[F. H. Bradley]]'s discussion deals with the subject purely from the metaphysical side, and the total result practically is that association occurs only between universals. From the point of view of empirical psychologists Bradley's results are open to the charge which he made against those who impugned his view of the law of similarity, namely that they are merely a statement - not in any real sense an explanation. The relation between the mental and the physical phenomena of association has occupied the attention of all the leading psychologists (see Psychology). [[William James]] holds that association is of "objects" not of "ideas," is between "things thought of" - so far as the word stands for an effect. "So far as it stands for a cause it is between processes in the brain." Dealing with the law of Contiguity he says that the "most natural way of accounting for it is to conceive it as a result of the laws of habit in the nervous system; in other words to ascribe it to a physiological cause." Association thus results because when a nerve current has once passed by a given way, it will pass more easily by that way in future; and this fact is a physical fact. He further seeks to maintain the important deduction that the only primary or ultimate law of association is that of neural [[Habit (psychology)|habit]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

The objections to the associationist theory are summed up by [[George Stout|George F. Stout]] (''Analytic Psychol.'', vol. ii. pp.&amp;nbsp;47 seq.) under three heads. Of these the first is that the theory as stated, e.g., by [[Alexander Bain]], lays far too much stress on the mere connexion of elements hitherto entirely separate; whereas, in fact, every new mental state or synthesis consists in the development or modification of a pre-existing state or psychic whole. Secondly, it is quite false to regard an association as merely an aggregate of disparate units; in fact, the form of the new idea is quite as important as the elements which it comprises. Thirdly, the phraseology used by the associationists seems to assume that the parts that go to form the whole retain their identity unimpaired; in fact, each part or element is ipso facto modified by the very fact of its entering into such combination.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

The experimental methods in vogue in the early part of the 20th century to a large extent removed the discussion of the whole subject of association of ideas, depending in the case of the older writers on introspection, into a new sphere. In such a work as [[Edward B. Titchener]]'s ''Experimental Psychology'' (1905), association was treated as a branch of the study of mental reactions, of which association reactions are one division.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

Today the field is studied by neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers as well as philosophers and psychologists.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">'''Avoided burden''' is an approach used in [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA), especially in the context of allocating environmental burden in the presence of [[recycling]] or [[reuse]]. When determining the overall [[environmental impact]] of a product, the product is given "credit" for the potential recycled material included. For instance, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles may be given environmental credit for the PET they contain, as this material will eventually be recycled back into further PET products.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Anna|title=LCA allocation methods in open-loop recycling: incentivizing recycled material sourcing and creation of recyclable products|url=http://www.lcacenter.org/LCAX/presentations-final/212.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This credit is termed "avoided burden" because it refers to the impact of virgin material production that is avoided by the use of recycled material.

==Material displacement==
The extent to which recycled material displaces production of virgin material of a similar or different type is the subject of current research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blomberg|author2=Hellmer|title=Short-run demand and supply elasticities in the West European market for secondary aluminium|journal=Resources Policy|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case studies, practitioners typically utilize [[heuristic]], arbitrary rules, such as assigning 100%, 50%, or 0% displacement of virgin material by recycled material.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=geyer1&gt;{{cite web|last=Geyer |first=Roland |title=Life Cycle Inventory Analysis |url=http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/282/Lectures/5-IE-14-Oct-08.ppt |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709231634/https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/282/Lectures/5-IE-14-Oct-08.ppt |archivedate=9 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, accurate information on the displacement rates of various materials is largely unknown. This information is important to LCA practitioners, as it can often tip the balance between two compared alternative products or materials.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Calculation==
Although the calculation of avoided burden is not without some degree of subjectivity, it is usually calculated as follows:&lt;ref name=geyer1 /&gt; 
:''Avoided Burden = (Material Recycling Rate) × ([[Life cycle assessment#Life cycle inventory|Functional Unit]]) × [(Impact of Virgin Production) − (Impact of Recycling)]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18725">[[File:Category_SVG.svg|thumbnail|This is a category with a collection of objects A, B, C and collection of morphisms denoted f, g, {{nowrap|g ∘ f}}, and the loops are the identity arrows. This category is typically denoted by a boldface '''3'''.]]
{{Group-like structures}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''category''' (sometimes called an '''abstract category''' to distinguish it from a [[concrete category]]) is an [[algebraic structure]] similar to a [[group (mathematics)|group]] but without requiring [[inverse element|inverse]] or [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] properties.  It comprises "objects" that are linked by "arrows". A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows [[Associativity|associatively]] and the existence of an identity arrow for each object.  A simple example is the [[category of sets]], whose objects are [[set (mathematics)|sets]] and whose arrows are [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. 

''[[Category theory]]'' is a branch of mathematics that seeks to generalize all of mathematics in terms of categories, independent of what their objects and arrows represent.  Virtually every branch of modern mathematics can be described in terms of categories, and doing so often reveals deep insights and similarities between seemingly different areas of mathematics.  As such, category theory provides an alternative foundation for mathematics to [[set theory]] and other proposed axiomatic foundations.  In general, the objects and arrows may be abstract entities of any kind, and the notion of category provides a fundamental and abstract way to describe mathematical entities and their relationships. 

In addition to formalizing mathematics, category theory is also used to formalize many other systems in computer science, such as the [[semantics of programming languages]].

Two categories are the same if they have the same collection of objects, the same collection of arrows, and the same associative method of composing any pair of arrows. Two ''different'' categories may also be considered "[[equivalence of categories|equivalent]]" for purposes of category theory, even if they do not have precisely the same structure.

Well-known categories are denoted by a short capitalized word or abbreviation in bold or italics:  examples include '''[[category of sets|Set]]''', the category of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[function (mathematics)|set functions]]; '''[[category of rings|Ring]]''', the category of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[ring homomorphism]]s; and '''[[category of topological spaces|Top]]''', the category of [[topological space]]s and [[continuous map]]s. All of the preceding categories have the [[identity function|identity map]] as identity arrow and [[function composition|composition]] as the associative operation on arrows.

The classic and still much used text on category theory is ''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]'' by [[Saunders Mac Lane]]. Other references are given in the [[#References|References]] below. The basic definitions in this article are contained within the first few chapters of any of these books.

Any [[monoid]] can be understood as a special sort of category (with a single object whose self-morphisms are represented by the elements of the monoid), and so can any [[preorder]].

==History==
Category theory first appeared in a paper entitled "General Theory of Natural Equivalences", written by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;S. Eilenberg and S. Mac Lane "General Theory of Natural Equivalences", Transactions of The American Mathematical Society 01/1945; 58(2):231-231. {{doi|10.2307/1990284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There are many equivalent definitions of a category.&lt;ref&gt;Barr &amp; Wells, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; One commonly used definition is as follows.  A '''category''' ''C'' consists of
* a [[Class (set theory)|class]] ob(''C'') of '''objects'''
* a class hom(''C'') of '''[[morphism]]s''', or '''arrows''', or '''maps''', between the objects. Each morphism ''f'' has a ''source object a'' and a ''target object b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are in ob(''C''). We write ''f'': ''a'' → ''b'', and we say "''f'' is a morphism from ''a'' to ''b''". We write hom(''a'', ''b'') (or hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') when there may be confusion about to which category hom(''a'', ''b'') refers) to denote the '''hom-class''' of all morphisms from ''a'' to ''b''. (Some authors write Mor(''a'', ''b'') or simply ''C''(''a'', ''b'') instead.)
* for every three objects ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', a binary operation hom(''a'', ''b'') × hom(''b'', ''c'') → hom(''a'', ''c'') called ''composition of morphisms''; the composition of ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'' and ''g'' : ''b'' → ''c'' is written as ''g'' ∘ ''f'' or ''gf''.  (Some authors use "diagrammatic order", writing ''f;g'' or ''fg''.)

such that the following axioms hold:
* ([[associativity]]) if ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'', ''g'' : ''b'' → ''c'' and ''h'' : ''c'' → ''d'' then ''h'' ∘ (''g'' ∘ ''f'') = (''h'' ∘ ''g'') ∘ ''f'', and
* ([[identity (mathematics)|identity]]) for every object ''x'', there exists a morphism 1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''x'' → ''x'' (some authors write ''id''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) called the ''identity morphism for x'', such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''a'' → ''x'' and every morphism ''g'' : ''x'' → ''b'', we have 1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' = ''f'' and ''g'' ∘ 1&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''.

From these axioms, one can prove that there is exactly one identity morphism for every object. Some authors use a slight variation of the definition in which each object is identified with the corresponding identity morphism.

==Small and large categories==

A category ''C'' is called '''small''' if both ob(''C'') and hom(''C'') are actually [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and not [[proper class]]es, and '''large''' otherwise. A '''locally small category''' is a category such that for all objects ''a'' and ''b'', the hom-class hom(''a'', ''b'') is a set, called a '''homset'''. Many important categories in mathematics (such as the category of sets), although not small, are at least locally small.

==Examples==
The [[class (set theory)|class]] of all sets (as objects) together with all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s between them (as morphisms), where the composition of morphisms is the usual [[function composition]], forms a large category, '''[[category of sets|Set]]'''. It is the most basic and the most commonly used category in mathematics. The category '''[[category of relations|Rel]]''' consists of all [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] (as objects) with [[binary relation]]s between them (as morphisms).  Abstracting from [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] instead of functions yields [[Allegory (category theory)|allegories]], a special class of categories.

Any class can be viewed as a category whose only morphisms are the identity morphisms. Such categories are called [[discrete category|discrete]]. For any given [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''I'', the ''discrete category on I'' is the small category that has the elements of ''I'' as objects and only the identity morphisms as morphisms. Discrete categories are the simplest kind of category.

Any [[Preorder|preordered set]] (''P'', ≤) forms a small category, where the objects are the members of ''P'', the morphisms are arrows pointing from ''x'' to ''y'' when ''x'' ≤ ''y''. Furthermore, if ''≤'' is [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], there can be at most one morphism between any two objects. The existence of identity morphisms and the composability of the morphisms are guaranteed by the [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] and the [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of the preorder. By the same argument, any [[partially ordered set]] and any [[equivalence relation]] can be seen as a small category. Any [[ordinal number]] can be seen as a category when viewed as an [[total order|ordered set]].

Any [[monoid]] (any [[algebraic structure]] with a single [[associative]] [[binary operation]] and an [[identity element]]) forms a small category with a single object ''x''. (Here, ''x'' is any fixed set.) The morphisms from ''x'' to ''x'' are precisely the elements of the monoid, the identity morphism of ''x'' is the identity of the monoid, and the categorical composition of morphisms is given by the monoid operation.  Several definitions and theorems about monoids may be generalized for categories.

Similarly any [[group (mathematics)|group]] can be seen as a category with a single object in which every morphism is ''invertible'', that is, for every morphism ''f'' there is a morphism ''g'' that is both [[Morphism#Some specific morphisms|left and right inverse]] to ''f'' under composition. A morphism that is invertible in this sense is called an [[isomorphism]].

A [[groupoid]] is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. Groupoids are generalizations of groups, [[group action]]s and [[equivalence relation]]s.

[[File:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A directed graph.]]
Any [[directed graph]] [[Generating set|generates]] a small category: the objects are the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the graph, and the morphisms are the paths in the graph (augmented with [[loop (graph theory)|loop]]s as needed) where composition of morphisms is concatenation of paths. Such a category is called the ''[[free category]]'' generated by the graph.

The class of all preordered sets with [[monotonic function]]s as morphisms forms a category, '''[[category of preordered sets|Ord]]'''. It is a [[concrete category]], i.e. a category obtained by adding some type of structure onto '''Set''', and requiring that morphisms are functions that respect this added structure.

The class of all groups with [[group homomorphism]]s as [[morphism]]s and [[function composition]] as the composition operation forms a large category, '''[[Category of groups|Grp]]'''. Like '''Ord''', '''Grp''' is a concrete category. The category '''[[category of abelian groups|Ab]]''', consisting of all [[abelian group]]s and their group homomorphisms, is a [[full subcategory]] of '''Grp''', and the prototype of an [[abelian category]]. Other examples of concrete categories are given by the following table.

[[Fiber bundle]]s with [[bundle map]]s between them form a concrete category.

The category '''[[category of small categories|Cat]]''' consists of all small categories, with [[functor]]s between them as morphisms.

== Construction of new categories ==

=== Dual category ===
Any category ''C'' can itself be considered as a new category in a different way: the objects are the same as those in the original category but the arrows are those of the original category reversed. This is called the [[Opposite category|''dual'' or ''opposite category'']] and is denoted ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Product categories ===
If ''C'' and ''D'' are categories, one can form the ''product category'' ''C'' × ''D'': the objects are pairs consisting of one object from ''C'' and one from ''D'', and the morphisms are also pairs, consisting of one morphism in ''C'' and one in ''D''. Such pairs can be composed [[N-tuple|componentwise]].

==Types of morphisms==
A [[morphism]] ''f'' : ''a'' → ''b'' is called
* a ''[[monomorphism]]'' (or ''monic'') if it is left-cancellable, i.e. ''fg&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''fg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' implies ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all morphisms ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''x'' → ''a''.
* an ''[[epimorphism]]'' (or ''epic'') if it is right-cancellable, i.e. ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;f'' = ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;f'' implies ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all morphisms ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''b'' → ''x''.
* a ''[[bimorphism]]'' if it is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism.
* a ''[[retract (category theory)|retraction]]'' if it has a right inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism ''g'' : ''b'' → ''a'' with ''fg'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* a ''[[section (category theory)|section]]'' if it has a left inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism ''g'' : ''b'' → ''a'' with ''gf'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* an ''[[isomorphism]]'' if it has an inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism ''g'' : ''b'' → ''a'' with ''fg'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''gf'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* an ''[[endomorphism]]'' if ''a'' = ''b''. The class of endomorphisms of ''a'' is denoted end(''a'').
* an ''[[automorphism]]'' if ''f'' is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. The class of automorphisms of ''a'' is denoted aut(''a'').

Every retraction is an epimorphism. Every section is a monomorphism. The following three statements are equivalent:
* ''f'' is a monomorphism and a retraction;
* ''f'' is an epimorphism and a section;
* ''f'' is an isomorphism.

Relations among morphisms (such as ''fg'' = ''h'') can most conveniently be represented with [[commutative diagram]]s, where the objects are represented as points and the morphisms as arrows.

==Types of categories==
* In many categories, e.g. '''[[category of abelian groups|Ab]]''' or [[K-Vect|'''Vect'''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;]], the hom-sets hom(''a'', ''b'') are not just sets but actually [[abelian group]]s, and the composition of morphisms is compatible with these group structures; i.e. is [[Bilinear form|bilinear]]. Such a category is called [[preadditive category|preadditive]]. If, furthermore, the category has all finite [[product (category theory)|products]] and [[coproduct]]s, it is called an [[additive category]]. If all morphisms have a [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] and a [[cokernel]], and all epimorphisms are cokernels and all monomorphisms are kernels, then we speak of an [[abelian category]]. A typical example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups.
* A category is called [[complete category|complete]] if all small [[limit (category theory)|limits]] exist in it. The categories of sets, abelian groups and topological spaces are complete.
* A category is called [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]] if it has finite direct products and a morphism defined on a finite product can always be represented by a morphism defined on just one of the factors. Examples include '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' and '''CPO''', the category of [[complete partial order]]s with [[Scott continuity|Scott-continuous functions]].
* A [[topos]] is a certain type of cartesian closed category in which all of mathematics can be formulated (just like classically all of mathematics is formulated in the category of sets). A topos can also be used to represent a logical theory.

{{Criminal law}}
'''Causation''' is the "causal relationship between conduct and result". In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury. In criminal law, it is defined as the ''[[actus reus]]'' (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with ''[[mens rea]]'' (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. Causation only applies where a result has been achieved and therefore is immaterial with regard to [[inchoate offense]]s.

==Background concepts==
Legal systems more or less try to uphold the notions of [[Equity (law)|fairness]] and [[justice]]. If a [[State (polity)|state]] is going to penalize a person or require that person pay compensation to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according to the idea that those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of [[strict liability]], in which the ''[[mens rea]]'' is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss.

Even the youngest children quickly learn that, with varying degrees of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability to the extent that the extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.

===Relationship between causation and liability===
Causation of an event alone is insufficient to create legal liability.

Sometimes causation is one part of a multi-stage test for legal liability. For example, for the defendant to be held liable for the tort of negligence, the defendant must have owed the plaintiff a [[duty of care]], breached that duty, by so doing caused [[Property damage|damage]] to the plaintiff, and that damage must not have been too remote. Causation is just one component of the tort.

On other occasions, causation is the only requirement for legal liability (other than the fact that the outcome is proscribed). For example, in the law of [[product liability]], the courts have come to apply to principle of ''strict liability'' : the fact that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm is the only thing that matters. The defendant need not also have been negligent.

On still other occasions, causation is irrelevant to legal liability altogether. For example, under a contract of [[Indemnity|indemnity insurance]], the [[Insurance|insurer]] agrees to indemnify the [[Victimology|victim]] for harm not caused by the insurer, but by other parties.

Because of the difficulty in establishing causation, it is one area of the law where the case law overlaps significantly with general doctrines of analytic philosophy to do with causation. The two subjects have long been intermingled.

== Establishing causation ==
Where establishing causation is required to establish legal liability, it usually involves a two-stage inquiry, firstly establishing 'factual' causation, then 'legal' causation.

‘Factual’ causation must be established before inquiring into legal causation, perhaps by assessing if the defendant acted in the plaintiff’s loss.

Determining ‘legal’ causation often involves a question of public policy regarding the sort of situation in which, despite the outcome of the factual enquiry,  the defendant might nevertheless be released from liability, or impose liability.

==Establishing factual causation==
The usual method of establishing factual causation is the ''but-for test''. The but for test inquires ‘But for the defendant’s act, would the harm have occurred?’ A shoots and wounds B. We ask ‘But for A's act, would B have been wounded?’ The answer is ‘No.’ So we conclude that A caused the harm to B. The but for test is a test of necessity. It asks was it ‘necessary’ for the defendant’s act to have occurred for the harm to have occurred. In New South Wales, this requirement exists in s 5D of the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' (NSW),&lt;ref name="CLA 5D"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|5D}} General principles.&lt;/ref&gt; reinforcing established common law principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|2009|litigants=Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem |parallelcite= |date=10 November 2009 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One weakness in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes impossible to say that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally in such a case would seem to make neither A nor B responsible for C's death.

The courts have generally accepted the but for test notwithstanding these weaknesses, qualifying it by saying that causation is to be understood “as the man in the street” would,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yorkshire Dale Steamship Co v Minister of War Transport]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|1942||AC|691|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, or by supplementing it with “common sense”.&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1993|litigants=[[March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto |date=24 April 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This dilemma was handled in the [[United States]] in ''[[State v. Tally]]'', {{West|S|15||722|Ala.|1894|738}}, where the court ruled that: “The assistance given ... need not contribute to criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it.” Using this logic, A and B are liable in that no matter who was responsible for the fatal shot, the other "facilitated" the criminal act even though his shot was not necessary to deliver the fatal blow.

However, legal scholars have attempted to make further inroads into what explains these difficult cases. Some scholars have proposed a test of sufficiency instead of a test of necessity. [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Tony Honoré]], and later [[Richard W. Wright (Professor, Chicago-Kent College of Law)|Richard Wright]], have said that something is a cause if it is a ‘necessary element of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for the result’. This is known as the [[NESS test]]. In the case of the [[Summers v. Tice|two hunters]], the set of conditions required to bring about the result of the victim's injury would include a gunshot to the eye, the victim being in the right place at the right time, gravity, etc. In such a set, either of the hunters' shots would be a member, and hence a cause. This arguably gives us a more theoretically satisfying reason to conclude that something was a cause of something else than by appealing to notions of intuition or common sense.

Hart and Honore, in their famous work ''Causation in the Law'', also tackle the problem of 'too many causes'. For them, there are degrees of causal contribution.  A member of the NESS set is a "causally relevant condition". This is elevated into a "cause" where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. So, returning to our [[Hunting|hunter]] example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a "cause". On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated to the status of "cause". An intermediate position can be occupied by those who "occasion" harm, such as accomplices. Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal to the scene of the crime. Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a "cause" (on the but for or NESS test). So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. However, the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. They consider that once something is a "but for" (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a question of policy.

==Establishing legal causation==
Notwithstanding the fact that causation may be established in the above situations, the law often intervenes and says that it will nevertheless not hold the defendant liable because in the circumstances the defendant is not to be understood, in a legal sense, as having caused the loss. In the United States, this is known as the doctrine of [[proximate cause]]. The most important doctrine is that of ''novus actus interveniens'', which means a ‘new intervening act’ which may ‘cut the chain of causation’.

===Proximate cause===
{{Main|Proximate cause}}
The but-for test is factual causation and often gives us the right answer to causal problems, but sometimes not. Two difficulties are immediately obvious. The first is that under the but-for test, almost anything is a cause. But for a tortfeasor's grandmother's birth, the relevant tortious conduct would not have occurred. But for the victim of a crime missing the [[bus]], he or she would not have been at the site of the crime and hence the crime would not have occurred.  Yet in these two cases, the grandmother's birth or the victim's missing the bus are not intuitively causes of the resulting harm. This often does not matter in the case where cause is only one element of liability, as the remote actor will most likely not have committed the other elements of the test. The legally liable cause is the one closest to or most proximate to the injury. This is known as the Proximate Cause rule. However, this situation can arise in strict liability situations.

===Intervening cause===
Imagine the following. A critically injures B. As B is wheeled to an ambulance, she is struck by lightning. She would not have been struck if she had not been injured in the first place. Clearly then, A caused B's whole injury on the ‘but for’ or NESS test.&lt;ref name="CLA 5D"/&gt;&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"/&gt; However, at law, the intervention of a supervening event renders the defendant not liable for the injury caused by the lightning.

The effect of the principle may be stated simply:
:if the new event, whether through human agency or natural causes, does not break the chain, the original actor is liable for all the consequences flowing naturally from the initial circumstances. But if the new act breaks the chain, the liability of the initial actor stops at that point, and the new actor, if human, will be liable for all that flows from his or her contribution.

Note, however, that this does not apply if the [[Eggshell skull]] rule is used.&lt;ref&gt;''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'' (1985) 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite=(1998) 45 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 588 |courtname=auto |date=23 December 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For details, see article on the Eggshell Skull doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/camplr24&amp;div=6&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals# J. Stanley McQuade, The Eggshell Skull Rule and Related Problems in Recovery for Mental Harm in the Law of Torts, 24 Campbell L. Rev. 1, 46 (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;
actus interveniens

===Independent sufficient causes===
When two or more negligent parties, where the consequence of their negligence joins together to cause damages, in a circumstance where either one of them alone would have caused it anyway, each is deemed to be an "Independent Sufficient Cause," because each could be deemed a "substantial factor,"  and both are held legally responsible for the damages. For example, where negligent firestarter A's fire joins with negligent firestarter B's fire to burn down House C, both A and B are held responsible. (e.g., ''Anderson v. Minneapolis, St: P. &amp; S. St. R.R. Co''., 146 Minn. 430, 179 N.W. 45 (1920).)  This is an element of Legal Cause.

===''Summers v. Tice'' Rule===

The other problem is that of overdetermination.  Imagine two hunters, A and B, who each negligently fire a shot that takes out C's eye.  Each shot on its own would have been sufficient to cause the damage.  But for A's shot, would C's eye have been taken out?  Yes.  The same answer follows in relation to B's shot.  But on the but-for test, this leads us to the counterintuitive position that neither shot caused the injury. However, courts have held that in order to prevent each of the defendants avoiding liability for lack of actual cause, it is necessary to hold both of them responsible, See ''[[Summers v. Tice]]'', 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948).  This is known, simply, as the ''Summers v. Tice'' Rule.

===Concurrent actual causes===
Suppose that two actors' negligent acts combine to produce one set of damages, where but for either of their negligent acts, no damage would have occurred at all.  This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes.  These are "concurrent actual causes".  In such cases, courts have held both defendants liable for their negligent acts. Example:  A leaves truck parked in the middle of the road at night with its lights off.  B fails to notice it in time and plows into it, where it could have been avoided, except for want of negligence, causing damage to both vehicles.  Both parties were negligent. (''Hill v. Edmonds'', 26 A.D.2d 554, 270 N.Y.S.2d 1020 (1966).)

===Foreseeability===

Legal Causation is usually expressed as a question of 'foreseeability'.  An actor is liable for the foreseeable, but not the unforeseeable, consequences of his or her act.  For example, it is foreseeable that if I shoot someone on a beach and they are immobilized, they may drown in a rising tide rather than from the trauma of the gunshot wound or from loss of blood.  However it is not (generally speaking) foreseeable that they will be struck by lightning and killed by that event.

This type of causal foreseeability is to be distinguished from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which is a question of remoteness of damage, not causation.  For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, it would be hard to construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage.  There is no ''novus actus interveniens''.  However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence.&lt;ref name= "PC"&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd]] (Wagon Mound No. 1) |year=1961 |court=UKPC |num=2 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1961] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 388; [1961] 1 [[All England Law Reports |All ER]] 404 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=18 January 1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.{{or|date=September 2011}}

==Example==
An example of how foreseeability does not apply to the extent of an injury is the [[eggshell skull rule]].  If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will need to go to the hospital for.  However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment.  Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.

== Other relevant considerations ==
Because causation in the law is a complex amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as foreseeability and risk.  Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always be alert to these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events.

===Foreseeability tests===
Some aspects of the physical world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to [[imputation (law)|impute]] knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any [[reasonable person]] would consider safe but a [[storm surge]] caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a ''novus actus''. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a [[flash flood]], an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a ''novus actus''.

The question of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B is only slightly injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say that he ''ought'' to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.

Similarly, in the quantification of damages generally and/or the partitioning of damages between two or more defendants, the extent of the liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.

===Risk===
Sometimes the reverse situation to a ''novus actus'' occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved but the court nevertheless does want to hold the defendant liable.  In ''Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories'', {{West|P|607|2|924|Cal.|1980|}} the plaintiff's mother consumed [[diethylstilbestrol]] as a miscarriage preventative.&lt;ref name="Sindell5945"&gt;''Sindell'', at 594-95.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medicine, later re-called from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture.&lt;ref name="Sindell5945"/&gt; However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market.  The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.&lt;ref&gt;''Sindell'', at 596.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court held that the defendant was liable in proportion to its market share.&lt;ref name="Sindell6112"&gt;''Sindell'', at 611-12.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a ‘risk based’ approach to liability.  The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm.&lt;ref name="Sindell6112"/&gt;  Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.  However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In ''R v Miller'' {{Oscola|NEUT|1982|||6|UKHL|}}, the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.

===Evidence proving causation===
To be acceptable, any rule of law must be capable of being applied consistently, thus a definition of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B on the road and by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a [[Autopsy|post mortem]] to determine the initial degree of injury and the extent to which B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a ''novus actus'' breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a ''novus actus'' and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.

Roads are, by their nature, used by vehicles and it is clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is at risk of being further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more [[proximate cause]]. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] objectively.

== The future? ==
A difficult issue that has arisen recently is the case where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor increases the risk of its occurrence.  In ''[[Chester v Afshar]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|2004|4|All ER|587|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}, a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically [[cauda equina syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Chester5"&gt;''Chester'' [5].{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury.&lt;ref name="Chester5"/&gt;  It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time.&lt;ref&gt;''Chester'' [7].{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The risk of the injury would be the same at both times.  Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way).  Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable.  Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law.

==English criminal case law examples==

===''[[Breaking the chain|Novus actus interveniens]]''===
*'''Victim's contribution''' ''R v Dear'' (1996) CLR 595. Believing that the victim had sexually interfered with his 12-year-old daughter, the defendant attacked the victim with a Stanley knife. The defendant argued that the chain of causation had been broken because, two days later, the victim had committed suicide either by reopening his wounds or because he had failed to take steps to staunch the blood flow after the wounds had reopened spontaneously (i.e. the potential suicide constituted a ''novus actus interveniens''). It was held that the real question was whether the injuries inflicted by the defendant were an operating and significant cause of or contribution to the death. Distinctions between the victim's mere self-neglect (no break in the chain) and the victim's gross self-neglect (break in the chain) were not helpful. The victim's death resulted from bleeding from the artery severed by the defendant. Whether the resumption or continuation of that bleeding was deliberately caused by the victim, the defendant's conduct remained the operative and significant cause of the victim's death.
*'''Third party's inadvertent contribution''' ''[[R v Smith]]'' (1959) 2 QB 35 the defendant stabbed his victim twice in a barrack room brawl. Another soldier carried him to the medical centre but dropped him twice. The medical captain was very busy and failed to recognise the extent of the injuries. If the soldier had received proper treatment, he would have had a good chance of a complete recovery. Smith was convicted of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] because the wound was the "operating and substantial cause of death".  In ''R v Cheshire'' (1991) 3 AER 670, the victim was shot in the leg and stomach. In hospital, he suffered pneumonia and respiratory problems in intensive care so had a tracheotomy. After two months, he died. There was some medical negligence because the tracheotomy had caused a thickening of tissue ultimately causing suffocation. In upholding the conviction for [[murder in English law|murder]], [[Roy Beldam|Beldam LJ]] laid down the following test:
:Even though negligence in the treatment of the victim was the immediate cause of his death, the jury should not regard it as excluding the responsibility of the accused unless the negligent treatment was so independent of his acts, and in itself so potent in causing death, that they regard the contribution made by his acts as insignificant.
*'''Third party's deliberate intervention''' ''R v Malcherek'' (1981) 73 Cr. App. R. 173. The victim was placed on a life support machine and, after determining that she was brain dead, the doctors turned off the machine. The defendant appealed the conviction of murder arguing that the doctors had broken the chain of causation  by deliberately switching off the life support machine. It was held that the original wounds were the operating and substantial cause of death, and that a life support machine does no more than hold the effect of the injuries in suspension and when the machine is switched off, the original wounds continue to cause the death no matter how long the victim survives after the machine's disconnection. In ''R v Pagett'' (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279, to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen. The police instinctively fired back and killed the girl. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant's act caused the death and that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in [[self-defence in English law|self-defence]] could not be regarded as a ''novus actus interveniens'' because self-defence is a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation.

The defendant visited the home of a Jehovah's Witness and demanded sex. When she refused, he stabbed her four times. At hospital, she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. There was no suggestion that the doctors had acted improperly. Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful act, namely [[grievous bodily harm|wounding with intent]]. "But for" his actions, she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them (albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable).

The '''centimetre–gram–second system of units''' (abbreviated '''CGS''' or '''cgs''') is a variant of the [[metric system]] based on the [[centimetre]] as the unit of [[length]], the [[gram]] as the unit of [[mass]], and the [[second]] as the unit of [[time]]. All CGS [[mechanics|mechanical]] units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/centimetre-gram-second-system|title=Centimetre-gram-second system {{!}} physics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=article is about viscosity, not electromagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=Units/CGS|title=The Centimeter-Gram-Second (CGS) System of Units - Maple Programming Help|website=www.maplesoft.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1506/1506.01951.pdf | title = Babel of units: The evolution of units systems in classical electromagnetism | access-date = 31 March 2018 | last = Carron | first = Neal J.| date = 21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGS system has been largely supplanted by the [[MKS system of units|MKS system]] based on the [[metre]], [[kilogram]], and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the [[International System of Units]] (SI). In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use but there remain certain subfields where CGS is prevalent.

In measurements of purely mechanical systems (involving units of length, mass, [[force]], [[energy]], [[pressure]], and so on), the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the [[Unit conversion|unit-conversion factors]] are all [[Exponentiation#Powers of ten|powers of 10]] as {{nowrap|1=100 cm = 1 m}} and {{nowrap|1=1000 g = 1 kg}}. For example, the CGS unit of force is the [[dyne]] which is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 g⋅cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so the SI unit of force, the [[newton (unit)|newton]] ({{nowrap|1=1 kg⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), is equal to 100,000 dynes.

On the other hand, in measurements of electromagnetic phenomena (involving units of [[charge (physics)|charge]], electric and magnetic fields, [[voltage]], and so on), converting between CGS and SI is more subtle. Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on which system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one correspondence]] between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit "sub-systems", including [[Gaussian units]], "ESU", "EMU", and [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and  "CGS units" often used   specifically refers to CGS-Gaussian units.

==History==
The CGS system goes back to a proposal in 1832 by the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] to base a system of absolute units on the three fundamental units of length, mass and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = C.

[http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/translations/gaussMagnetic.pdf English translation].&lt;/ref&gt;  Gauss chose the units of millimetre, milligram and second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, including British physicists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] recommended the general adoption of centimetre, gram and second as fundamental units, and to express all derived electromagnetic units in these fundamental units, using the prefix "C.G.S. unit of ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The sizes of many CGS units turned out to be inconvenient for practical purposes. For example, many everyday objects are hundreds or thousands of centimetres long, such as humans, rooms and buildings. Thus the CGS system never gained wide general use outside the field of science. Starting in the 1880s, and more significantly by the mid-20th century, CGS was gradually superseded internationally for scientific purposes by the MKS (metre–kilogram–second) system, which in turn developed into the modern [[SI]] standard.

Since the international adoption of the MKS standard in the 1940s and the SI standard in the 1960s, the technical use of CGS units has gradually declined worldwide, in the United States more slowly than elsewhere. CGS units are today no longer accepted by the house styles of most scientific journals, textbook publishers, or standards bodies, although they are commonly used in astronomical journals such as ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]''. CGS units are still occasionally encountered in technical literature, especially in the United States in the fields of [[material science]], [[electrodynamics]] and [[astronomy]]. The continued usage of CGS units is most prevalent in magnetism and related fields because the B and H fields have the same units in free space and there is a lot of potential for confusion when converting published measurements from cgs to MKS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=L.

The units [[gram]] and [[centimetre]] remain useful ''as [[Metric prefix|prefix]]ed units'' within the SI system, especially for instructional physics and chemistry experiments, where they match the small scale of table-top setups. However, where [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s are needed, the SI ones are generally used and taught instead of the CGS ones today. For example, a physics lab course might ask students to record lengths in centimetres, and masses in grams, but force (a derived unit) in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, a usage consistent with the SI system.

==Definition of CGS units in mechanics==
In mechanics, the CGS and SI systems of units are built in an identical way. The two systems differ only in the scale of two out of the three base units (centimetre versus metre and gram versus kilogram, respectively), while the third unit (second as the unit of time) is the same in both systems.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the base units of mechanics in CGS and SI, and the laws of mechanics are not affected by the choice of units. The definitions of all [[derived unit]]s in terms of the three base units are therefore the same in both systems, and there is an unambiguous one-to-one correspondence of derived units:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (definition of [[velocity]])
:&lt;math&gt;F=m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]])
:&lt;math&gt;E = \int \vec{F}\cdot \mathrm{d\,}\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[energy]] defined in terms of [[Mechanical work|work]])
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{F}{L^2} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[pressure]] defined as force per unit area)
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \tau/\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (dynamic [[viscosity]] defined as [[shear stress]] per unit velocity [[gradient]]).

Thus, for example, the CGS unit of pressure, [[barye]], is related to the CGS base units of length, mass, and time in the same way as the SI unit of pressure, [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], is related to the SI base units of length, mass, and time:

:1&amp;nbsp;unit of pressure = 1&amp;nbsp;unit of force/(1&amp;nbsp;unit of length)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;unit of mass/(1&amp;nbsp;unit of length⋅(1&amp;nbsp;unit of time)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:1 Pa = 1&amp;nbsp;kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Expressing a CGS derived unit in terms of the SI base units, or vice versa, requires combining the scale factors that relate the two systems:

:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/(10&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

==Derivation of CGS units in electromagnetism==

===CGS approach to electromagnetic units===
The conversion factors relating [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] units in the CGS and SI systems are made more complex by the differences in the formulae expressing physical laws of electromagnetism as assumed by each system of units, specifically in the nature of the constants that appear in these formulae. This illustrates the fundamental difference in the ways the two systems are built: 
* In SI, the unit of [[electric current]], the ampere (A), was historically defined such that the [[magnetism|magnetic]] force exerted by two infinitely long, thin, parallel wires 1 [[metre]] apart and carrying a current of 1 [[ampere]] is exactly 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[newton (unit)|N]]/[[metre|m]]. This definition results in all [[International System of Units#Derived units|SI electromagnetic units]] being consistent (subject to factors of some [[integer]] powers of 10) with the EMU CGS system described in further sections. The ampere is a base unit of the SI system, with the same status as the metre, kilogram, and second. Thus the relationship in the definition of the ampere with the metre and newton is disregarded, and the ampere is not treated as dimensionally equivalent to any combination of other base units. As a result, electromagnetic laws in SI require an additional constant of proportionality (see [[Vacuum permittivity]]) to relate electromagnetic units to kinematic units. (This constant of proportionality is derivable directly from the above definition of the ampere.) All other electric and magnetic units are derived from these four base units using the most basic common definitions: for example, [[charge (physics)|electric charge]] ''q'' is defined as current ''I'' multiplied by time ''t'',
::&lt;math&gt;q=I\cdot t&lt;/math&gt;,
:therefore the unit of electric charge, the [[coulomb]] (C), is defined as 1&amp;nbsp;C = 1&amp;nbsp;A⋅s.
* The CGS system avoids introducing new base quantities and units, and instead ''derives'' all electric and magnetic units directly from the centimetre, gram, and second by specifying the form of the expression of physical laws that relate electromagnetic phenomena to mechanics.

===Alternate derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism===
Electromagnetic relationships to length, time and mass may be derived by several equally appealing methods. Two of them rely on the forces observed on charges. Two fundamental laws relate (seemingly independently of each other) the electric charge or its [[derivative|rate of change]] (electric current) to a mechanical quantity such as force. They can be written&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;{{cite book 
| author=Jackson, John David 
| title=Classical Electrodynamics

| pages=775–784
| location=New York 
| publisher=Wiley 
| year=1999 
| isbn=0-471-30932-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in system-independent form as follows:

*The first is [[Coulomb's law]], &lt;math&gt;F = k_{\rm C} \frac{q \cdot q^\prime}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the electrostatic force ''F'' between electric charges &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, separated by distance ''d''. Here &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant which depends on how exactly the unit of charge is derived from the base units.
*The second is [[Ampère's force law]], &lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{dL} = 2 k_{\rm A}\frac{I \, I^\prime}{d}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the magnetic force ''F'' per unit length ''L'' between currents ''I'' and ''I&amp;prime;'' flowing in two straight parallel wires of infinite length, separated by a distance ''d'' that is much greater than the wire diameters. Since &lt;math&gt;I=q/t\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I^\prime=q^\prime/t&lt;/math&gt;, the constant &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; also depends on how the unit of charge is derived from the base units.

[[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] relates these two laws to each other. It states that the ratio of proportionality constants &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; must obey &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} / k_{\rm A} = c^2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]]. Therefore, if one derives the unit of charge from the Coulomb's law by setting &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}=1&lt;/math&gt; then Ampère's force law will contain a prefactor &lt;math&gt;2/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, deriving the unit of current, and therefore the unit of charge, from the Ampère's force law by setting &lt;math&gt; k_{\rm A} = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A} = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, will lead to a constant prefactor in the Coulomb's law.

Indeed, both of these mutually exclusive approaches have been practiced by the users of CGS system, leading to the two independent and mutually exclusive branches of CGS, described in the subsections below. However, the freedom of choice in deriving electromagnetic units from the units of length, mass, and time is not limited to the definition of charge. While the electric field can be related to the work performed by it on a moving electric charge, the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge, and thus the work performed by the magnetic field on any charge is always zero. This leads to a choice between two laws of magnetism, each relating magnetic field to mechanical quantities and electric charge:
* The first law describes the [[Lorentz force]] produced by a magnetic field '''B''' on a charge '''q''' moving with velocity '''v''':
:: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} =  \alpha_{\rm L} q\;\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\;. &lt;/math&gt;
* The second describes the creation of a static magnetic field '''B''' by an electric current ''I'' of finite length d'''l''' at a point displaced by a vector '''r''', known as [[Biot–Savart law]]:
:: &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{B} =  \alpha_{\rm B}\frac{I d\mathbf{l} \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}\;,&lt;/math&gt; where ''r'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; are the length and the unit vector in the direction of vector '''r''' respectively.
These two laws can be used to derive [[Ampère's force law]] above, resulting in the relationship: &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}  = \alpha_{\rm L} \cdot \alpha_{\rm B}\;&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, if the unit of charge is based on the [[Ampère's force law]] such that &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, it is natural to derive the unit of magnetic field by setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L} = \alpha_{\rm B}=1\;&lt;/math&gt;. However, if it is not the case, a choice has to be made as to which of the two laws above is a more convenient basis for deriving the unit of magnetic field.

Furthermore, if we wish to describe the [[electric displacement field]] '''D''' and the [[magnetic field]] '''H''' in a medium other than vacuum, we need to also define the constants ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which are the [[vacuum permittivity]] and [[magnetic constant|permeability]], respectively. &lt;!-- These two values are related by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}=\alpha_{\rm B} / c&lt;/math&gt;. // removed this statement - seems impossible to prove! --&gt; Then we have&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; (generally) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \lambda \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{B} / \mu_0 - \lambda^\prime \mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;, where '''P''' and '''M''' are [[polarization density]] and [[magnetization]] vectors. The units of '''P''' and '''M''' are usually so chosen that the factors λ and λ′ are equal to the "rationalization constants" &lt;math&gt;4 \pi k_{\rm C} \epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4 \pi \alpha_{\rm B} / (\mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L})&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. If the rationalization constants are equal, then &lt;math&gt;c^2 = 1 / (\epsilon_0 \mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L}^2)&lt;/math&gt;. If they are equal to one, then the system is said to be "rationalized":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the laws for systems of [[spherical geometry]] contain factors of 4π (for example, [[point charge]]s), those of cylindrical geometry – factors of 2π (for example, [[wire]]s), and those of planar geometry contain no factors of π (for example, parallel-plate [[capacitor]]s). However, the original CGS system used λ = λ′ = 4π, or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} \epsilon_0 = \alpha_{\rm B} / (\mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, Gaussian, ESU, and EMU subsystems of CGS (described below) are not rationalized.

The constant ''b'' in SI system is a unit-based scaling factor defined as: &lt;math&gt;b=10^7\,\mathrm{A}^2/\mathrm{N} = 10^7\,\mathrm{m/H}=4\pi/\mu_0=4\pi\epsilon_0 c^2=c^2 / k_{\rm C}\;&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, note the following correspondence of the above constants to those in Jackson&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; and Leung:&lt;ref name=leu/&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}=k_1=k_{\rm E}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm B}=\alpha\cdot k_2=k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}=k_2=k_{\rm E}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L}=k_3=k_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;

In system-independent form, [[Maxwell's equations]] can be written as:&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt;&lt;ref name=leu&gt;{{cite journal

Note that of all these variants, only in Gaussian and Heaviside–Lorentz systems &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; rather than 1. As a result, vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt; of an [[electromagnetic wave]] propagating in vacuum have the same units and are equal in [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude]] in these two variants of CGS.

==={{anchor|ESU}}Electrostatic units (ESU)===
{{main|Electrostatic units}}
In one variant of the CGS system, '''Electrostatic units''' ('''ESU'''), charge is defined via the force it exerts on other charges, and current is then defined as charge per time. It is done by setting the [[Coulomb force constant]] &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that [[Coulomb's law]] does not contain an explicit [[Proportionality (mathematics)|prefactor]].

The ESU unit of charge, '''franklin''' ('''Fr'''), also known as '''[[statcoulomb]]''' or '''esu charge''', is therefore defined as follows:&lt;ref name=cardsgc&gt;{{cite book
| author = Cardarelli, F.

| title = Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins
| publisher = Springer
| edition = 2nd

| isbn= 1-85233-682-X
| url= https://books.google.com/?id=6KCx8Ww75VkC
}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=two equal point charges spaced 1 [[centimetre]] apart are said to be of 1 franklin each if the electrostatic force between them is 1 [[dyne]].}} Therefore, in '''electrostatic CGS units''', a franklin is equal to a centimetre times square root of dyne:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Fr = 1\,statcoulomb = 1\,esu\; charge = 1\,cm\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit of current is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Fr/s = 1\,statampere = 1\,esu\; current = 1\,(cm/s)\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dimensionally in the ESU CGS system, charge ''q'' is therefore equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;t&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence, neither charge nor current is an independent physical quantity in ESU CGS. This reduction of units is the consequence of the [[Buckingham π theorem]].

====ESU notation====
All electromagnetic units in ESU CGS system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix "stat" or with a separate abbreviation "esu".&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;

==={{anchor|EMU}}Electromagnetic units (EMU)===
In another variant of the CGS system, '''electromagnetic units''' ('''EMU'''), current is defined via the force existing between two thin, parallel, infinitely long wires carrying it, and charge is then defined as current multiplied by time. (This approach was eventually used to define the SI unit of [[ampere]] as well). In the EMU CGS subsystem, this is done by setting the Ampere force constant &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that [[Ampère's force law]] simply contains 2 as an explicit [[Proportionality (mathematics)|prefactor]] (this prefactor 2 is itself a result of integrating a more general formulation of Ampère's law over the length of the infinite wire).

The EMU unit of current, '''biot''' ('''Bi'''), also known as '''[[abampere]]''' or '''emu current''', is therefore defined as follows:&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;
{{quote|text=The '''biot''' is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one [[centimetre]] apart in [[vacuum]], would produce between these conductors a force equal to two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length.}} Therefore, in '''electromagnetic CGS units''', a biot is equal to a square root of dyne:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Bi = 1\,abampere = 1\,emu\; current= 1\,\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2} \cdot s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit of charge in CGS EMU is:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Bi\cdot s = 1\,abcoulomb = 1\,emu\, charge= 1\,s\cdot\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dimensionally in the EMU CGS system, charge ''q'' is therefore equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence, neither charge nor current is an independent physical quantity in EMU CGS.

====EMU notation====
All electromagnetic units in EMU CGS system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix "ab" or with a separate abbreviation "emu".&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;

===Relations between ESU and EMU units===
The ESU and EMU subsystems of CGS are connected by the fundamental relationship &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} / k_{\rm A} = c^2&lt;/math&gt; (see above), where ''c'' = 29,979,245,800 ≈ 3⋅10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum in centimetres per second. Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding "primary" electrical and magnetic units (e.g. current, charge, voltage, etc. – quantities proportional to those that enter directly into [[Coulomb's law]] or [[Ampère's force law]]) is equal either to ''c''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''c'':&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statcoulomb}{1\,abcoulomb}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,statampere}{1\,abampere}}=c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statvolt}{1\,abvolt}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,stattesla}{1\,gauss}}=c&lt;/math&gt;.
Units derived from these may have ratios equal to higher powers of ''c'', for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statohm}{1\,abohm}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,statvolt}{1\,abvolt}}\times\mathrm{\frac{1\,abampere}{1\,statampere}}=c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Practical cgs units===
The practical cgs system is a hybrid system that uses the [[volt]] and the [[ampere]] as the unit of voltage and current respectively.  Doing this avoids the inconveniently large and small quantities that arise for electromagnetic units in the esu and emu systems.  This system was at one time widely used by electrical engineers because the volt and amp had been adopted as international standard units by the International Electrical Congress of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tunbridge, ''Lord Kelvin: His Influence on Electrical Measurements and Units'', pp. 34-40, IET, 1992 {{ISBN|0863412378}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as the volt and amp, the [[farad]] (capacitance), [[ohm]] (resistance), [[coulomb]] (electric charge), and [[henry (unit)|henry]] are consequently also used in the practical system and are the same as the SI units.  However, [[intensive properties]] (that is, anything that is per unit length, area, or volume) will not be the same as SI since the cgs unit of distance is the centimetre.  For instance [[electric field strength]] is in units of volts per centimetre, [[magnetic field strength]] is in [[oersted]]s and [[resistivity]] is in ohm-cm.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz E. Knoepfel, ''Magnetic Fields: A Comprehensive Theoretical Treatise for Practical Use'', p. 543, Wiley, 2000 {{ISBN|3527617426}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[physicists]] and [[electrical engineers]] in North America still use these hybrid units.&lt;ref&gt;Knoepfel, p. xx{{failed verification|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other variants===
There were at various points in time about half a dozen systems of electromagnetic units in use, most based on the CGS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this table, ''c'' = 29,979,245,800 is the numeric value of the [[speed of light]] in vacuum when expressed in units of centimetres per second. The symbol "↔" is used instead of "=" as a reminder that the SI and CGS units are ''corresponding'' but not ''equal'' because they have incompatible dimensions. For example, according to the next-to-last row of the table, if a capacitor has a capacitance of 1&amp;nbsp;F in SI, then it has a capacitance of (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cm in ESU; ''but'' it is usually incorrect to replace "1&amp;nbsp;F" with "(10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cm" within an equation or formula. (This warning is a special aspect of electromagnetism units in CGS. By contrast, for example, it is ''always'' correct to replace "1&amp;nbsp;m" with "100&amp;nbsp;cm" within an equation or formula.)

One can think of the SI value of the [[Coulomb constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}=\frac{\mu_0 (c/100)^2}{4\pi}=10^{-7}{\rm N}/{\rm A}^2\cdot 10^{-4}\cdot c^2 = 10^{-11}{\rm N}\cdot c^2/{\rm A}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;
This explains why SI to ESU conversions involving factors of ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lead to significant simplifications of the ESU units, such as 1&amp;nbsp;statF = 1&amp;nbsp;cm and 1&amp;nbsp;statΩ = 1&amp;nbsp;s/cm: this is the consequence of the fact that in ESU system ''k''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. For example, a centimetre of capacitance is the capacitance of a sphere of radius 1&amp;nbsp;cm in vacuum. The capacitance ''C'' between two concentric spheres of radii ''R'' and ''r'' in ESU CGS system is:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.
By taking the limit as ''R'' goes to infinity we see ''C'' equals ''r''.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
While the absence of explicit prefactors in some CGS subsystems simplifies some theoretical calculations, it has the disadvantage that sometimes the units in CGS are hard to define through experiment. Also, lack of unique unit names leads to a great confusion: thus “15 emu” may mean either 15 [[abvolt]]s, or 15 emu units of [[electric dipole moment]], or 15 emu units of [[magnetic susceptibility]], sometimes (but not always) per [[gram]], or per [[mole (unit)|mole]]. On the other hand, SI starts with a unit of current, the [[ampere]], that is easier to determine through experiment, but which requires extra multiplicative factors in the electromagnetic equations. With its system of uniquely named units, the SI also removes any confusion in usage: 1.0 ampere is a fixed value of a specified quantity, and so are 1.0 [[henry (unit)|henry]], 1.0 [[ohm]], and 1.0 volt.

A key virtue of the [[Gaussian units|Gaussian CGS system]] is that electric and magnetic fields have the same units, 4''πε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced by 1, and the only dimensional constant appearing in the [[Maxwell equations]] is ''c'', the speed of light. The [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside–Lorentz system]] has these desirable properties as well (with ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equaling 1), but it is a “rationalized” system (as is SI) in which the charges and fields are defined in such a way that there are many fewer factors of 4''π'' appearing in the formulas, and it is in Heaviside–Lorentz units that the Maxwell equations take their simplest form.

In SI, and other rationalized systems (for example, [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside–Lorentz]]), the unit of current was chosen such that electromagnetic equations concerning charged spheres contain 4π, those concerning coils of current and straight wires contain 2π and those dealing with charged surfaces lack π entirely, which was the most convenient choice for applications in [[electrical engineering]]. However, modern [[calculator|hand calculator]]s and [[personal computer]]s have eliminated this "advantage". In some fields where formulas concerning spheres are common (for example, in  astrophysics), it has been argued{{by whom|date=July 2014}} that the nonrationalized CGS system can be somewhat more convenient notationally.

Specialized unit systems are used to simplify formulas even further than ''either'' SI ''or'' CGS, by eliminating constants through some system of [[natural units]]. For example, in [[particle physics]] a system is in use where every quantity is expressed by only one unit of energy, the [[electronvolt]], with lengths, times, and so on all converted into electronvolts by inserting factors of [[speed of light|speed of light ''c'']] and the [[Planck constant|Planck constant ''ħ'']]. This unit system is very convenient for calculations in [[particle physics]], but it would be considered impractical in other contexts.

{{Christianity and gender|positions}}

'''Christian egalitarianism''' (derived from the [[French language|French]] word '''égal''', meaning ''equal'' or ''level''), also known as '''biblical equality''', is a Christian form of [[egalitarianism]]. It holds that all human persons are created equally in God's sight—equal in fundamental worth and moral status. This view does not just apply to gender, but to religion, skin colour and any other differences between individuals. It does not imply that all have equal skills, abilities, interests, or physiological or genetic traits. Christian egalitarianism holds that all people are equal before [[God in Christianity|God]] and in [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]]; have equal responsibility to use their gifts and obey their calling to the glory of God; and are called to roles and ministries without regard to class, gender, or race.&lt;ref&gt;Padgett, Alan G. "What Is Biblical Equality?" ''Priscilla Papers'', Summer 2002: 16:3 Padgett is professor of Systematic Theology at Luther Seminary, St. Paul, MN.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equality==
According to Christian egalitarianism, [[gender equality]] is biblically sound in Christian church leadership (including [[pastor]]s) and in Christian marriage. Its theological foundations are interpretations of the teachings and example of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] and other [[New Testament]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Parakeet: Rethinking How You Read the Bible  Scot McKnight - 2008 "The former is often called "complementarian" and the latter "egalitarian," though simple labels mask both the seriousness of the views as well as nuances within and between such views. The term "complementarian" fudges the reality; ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

It refers to a biblically-based belief that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that [[women]] and [[men]] are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.&lt;ref&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. "The Bible and Gender Equality." [http://www.cbeinternational.org Christians for Biblical Equality Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linda Belleville"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Belleville|authorlink1=Women in Ministry: an egalitarian perspective|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=James R.|title=Two views on women in ministry|date=2009|isbn=0-310-86451-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pXcMvBsrMLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=biblical+views+of+women#v=onepage&amp;q=biblical%20views%20of%20women&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egalitarian beliefs are generally subscribed to by [[Quaker]]s, [[The United Methodist Church|United Methodist Churches]], The Presbyterian Church (USA), The Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians (ECO), [[American Baptist Churches USA|Northern Baptists]], [[Church of the Nazarene]], [[Wesleyan Church]], [[Evangelical Covenant Church|The Evangelical Covenant Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.covchurch.org/wc/2011/07/what-do-you-think/|title="What do you think?" - Worship Connect|date=2011-07-15|work=Worship Connect|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Pentecostal churches such as the [[Assemblies of God]] and [[United Church of God]].

The opposing view is [[complementarianism]], a view which holds that differing, often non-overlapping roles between men and women, manifested in marriage, church leadership, and elsewhere, are biblically required. Complementarianism is the belief that men were created for the headship role and women were created for the support role.

== Biblical foundations ==

All three Synoptic Gospels record Jesus as saying:
{{Quotation|You know that the rulers of the Gentiles ''lord it over'' them, and their high officials ''exercise authority'' over them. But it shall not be so among you".{{bibleref2c|Matthew|20:25–26||Mt 20:25–26a}} {{bibleref2c|Mk|10:42}} {{bibleref2c|Lk|22:25}}}} According to Clive Marsh and Steve Moyise, while "lord it over" implies abusive leadership, Jesus' words "exercise authority" have no connotation of abuse of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. ''Jesus and the Gospels.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. {{ISBN|0-567-04073-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apostle Paul]] wrote:

{{quotation|There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.|{{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}}}

Christian egalitarians' interpretation of scriptures and spiritual convictions bring them to the conclusion that the manner and teaching of Jesus ''abolished'' [[discrimination]] against racial minorities, slaves, and women in both the church and marriage. They believe that the Bible teaches the fundamental equality of believers of all racial and ethnic groups and all economic classes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiritrestoration.org/Church/ministry-profile-christians-for-biblical-equality.htm Christians for Biblical Equality&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=October 2015}}{{Self-published inline|date=October 2015}} They consider overarching principles of the [[Bible]] to be that [[Gender equality|men and women are equally created]] in God's image, equally responsible for sin, equally redeemed by Christ, and equally gifted by God's Spirit for service and held responsible for using their God-given gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. (2011) ''Let My People Go: A Call to End the Oppression of Women in the Church.'' Charleston, SC: Createspace. {{ISBN|978-1-4664-0111-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the six times [[Aquila and Priscilla|Aquila and his wife Priscilla]] are mentioned by name in the New Testament, they are listed together as a couple. Their order of appearance alternates in a perfect odd-even equality, with each mentioned first three times. Aquila appears first in the first, third and fifth mentions, and Priscilla (Prisca) first in the second, fourth and sixth mentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|18:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:18|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:26|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|16:3|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|16:19|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:19|KJV}} Authorized Version&lt;/ref&gt; Some revisions of the Bible put Priscilla rather than Aquila first, in Acts 18:26, following the Vulgate and a few Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Acts%2018:26 Acts 18:26 multi-version]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest that Priscilla was the head of the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Achtenmeier |first=P.J. |title=HarperCollins Bible Dictionary |publisher=HarperCollins |edition=revised |year=1996 |page=882 |isbn=0-06-060037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Christian egalitarianism holds that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status. A significant source of this trend of thought is the Christian notion that humankind were created in the living [[image of God]] ''(Imago Dei)''.

Jesus Christ did not conform to a mentality unfavorable to women, but reacted against inequalities based on sexual differences.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrative of efforts to institutionalize this notion are these excerpts from the organizational ''Statement of Faith'' of [[Christians for Biblical Equality]], a major Christian Egalitarian organization:

==History==
The first organization whose purpose was advocating Christian egalitarianism was "Men, Women and God", established in the United Kingdom in 1984. The American organization [[Christians for Biblical Equality]] was established by [[evangelicals]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBE's History|url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/content/cbes-history|website=CBE International|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Egalitarian anthropologies ==
Titled in accordance with [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]]'s work in Christian theology, Egalitarian anthropologies explore varying views of gender equality in Christianity. These include [[Eschatology|eschatological]] feminism, [[liberal feminism]], and romantic feminism. According to Ruether, the commonality among these anthropologies is the belief that gender equality was the original intention of God and that it was somehow skewed by humanity. Ruether goes on to point out that the belief in the ideal of gender equality "leaves room for considerable variation in relating this equality to woman's present subjugated state in history under patriarchy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexism and God-Talk|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1986|isbn=0-8070-1205-X|location=Boston, MA|pages=99–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding statement, Ruether qualifies the need for further exploration into the following anthropologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Eschatological feminism ===
Ruether connects eschatological feminism to [[mysticism]] and [[asceticism]] by way of its roots in [[transcendentalism]]. Her assertion is that the original human, Adam, was androgynous and that "[[Fall of man|the fall]]" was the initial creation of gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruether|first=Rose Radford|date=2014|title=Sexism and Misogyny in the Christian Tradition: Liberating Alternatives|url=|journal=Buddhist-Christian Studies|volume=34|pages=83–94|via=|doi=10.1353/bcs.2014.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reaffirms this point in a later article, "Sexism and Misogyny in the Christian Tradition: Liberating Alternatives", referencing Galatians 3:28,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3:28&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Galatians 3:28 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that through baptism androgyny is restored.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sexuality, the main division between genders, is said to be the root of female subordination. Relationships that are typically rooted in sexuality (marriage and motherhood) place women in roles that are subordinate in accordance with society's patriarchal norms. The path to equality is believed to be found when women transcend these roles- traditionally through celibacy (as seen in the life of Paul&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Corinthians 7 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Transcending worldly norms, which the Bible instructs Christians to do,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12:2&amp;version=ESV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Romans 12:2 - English Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; brings men and women to the state of androgyny that eliminates gender subordination; thus, Christianity is intended to manifest gender equality. Ruether says that transcendence is the core of eschatological feminism; women reach equality with men by separating from the world, rather than changing it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Liberal feminism ===
Liberal feminism rejects the notion that creation established the patriarchy; Ruether asserts that gender equality originally existed, but was distorted by historical injustices against women. This branch of egalitarianism dictates that gender equality must be restored rather than introduced. This restoration will be accomplished by economic, political, social, and systemic reformation. Ruether includes the church in her discussion of social reform, displaying its participation in gender subordination. Ruether continues saying, "The Church as a bearer of redeemed humanity ought especially to represent this equality of men and women in its institutional life. But it does so as a paradigm of what all social institutions should become, not as a representative of an eschatological humanity outside of and beyond history."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Here she distinguishes liberal from eschatological feminism stating that liberal feminism calls for liberation within society, rather than removal from it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Romantic feminism ===
Ruether states that in romantic feminism the distinction between genders is found primarily in "spiritual" traits. Ruether references a sixteenth century humanist, Cornelius Agrippa, saying that women have an "affinity with divine Wisdom that gives them  moral and spiritual superiority."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Montanist Oracles and Testimonia|last=Heine|first=Ronald E.|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Macon, GA|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are perceived to be innately altruistic, sensitive, and pure- traits that are considered morally superior compared to "male traits." Ruether continues saying that men and women are both inherently capable of goodness, but because of the patriarchy placing men into positions of power, more negative character traits are manifested (pride, aggression, dominance, etc.). Since women are not allowed into positions of power, Ruether supposes that they retain humanity's natural goodness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Romantic feminism contains varying ideologies in itself which are as follows.

==== Conservative romanticism ====
According to Ruether, conservative romanticism suggests that women remain in the home in order to maintain their goodness. Ruether says, "If a woman leaves the home to take up a traditional male occupation, she will straightaway lose this good femininity and become a she-male, a monstrous virago, or will become debased to carnal femaleness, fallen woman." In one survey conducted in 1999 a researcher concluded based on participants' responses, "Even though husbands were not always the sole providers, for the majority of men they remained symbolically so, such that women's employment was nearly  always described as secondary, even expendable, in light of wives' responsibility to rear and nurture children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Sally K.|last2=Smith|first2=Christian|date=1999|title=Symbolic Traditionalism and Pragmatic Egalitarianism: Contemporary Evangelicals, Families, and Gender|jstor=190389|journal=Gender and Society|volume=13|issue=2|pages=211–233|doi=10.2307/190389}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative romanticism opposes gender equality in the work force in order to better preserve traditional roles in the home. Women's innate goodness makes her the ideal candidate to raise children and to support the husband. In turn, this spousal support allows the husband to perform better in the workforce; this trickle effect of women sending good husbands and sons into the world is how conservative romantics suppose women make an impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Reformist romanticism ====
Reformist romanticism aligns with conservative romanticism except in the reformist belief that the inherent goodness of women cannot be lost by equality in society. Ruether says that this ideology prescribes women to morally reform men and male-centric institutions, but to do so they require education, voting rights, and political power. Reformist romanticism believes that the innate goodness of women is needed in leadership positions to improve the nature of the world. It is also believed that the nature of women is incompatible with war and that under female leadership, the world would be at peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Radical romanticism ====
Radical feminism rejects the entirety of male culture and debates whether males can be redeemed at all. Ruether says that radical feminists desire a utopian society completely independent from males in which women's inherent goodness is unimpeded by male inferiority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Catholic views on egalitarianism==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has formally opposed ''[[radical egalitarianism]]'' and has stated that the differences between men and women are not merely phenomenal, but are in fact ontological in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn073104.htm National Catholic Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 ''Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World'', Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] warned against a related tendency to see gender as culturally constructed, which has generated "a new model of polymorphous sexuality", which reflects an "attempt to be free from one’s biological conditioning".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vis.pcn.net/doc/040731x_en.htm VIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15901">In [[mathematics]], especially [[vector calculus]] and [[differential topology]], a '''closed form''' is a [[differential form]] ''α'' whose [[exterior derivative]] is zero ({{nowrap|1=''dα'' = 0}}), and an '''exact form''' is a differential form, ''α'', that is the exterior derivative of another differential form ''β''.  Thus, an ''exact'' form is in the ''[[image (mathematics)|image]]'' of ''d'', and a ''closed'' form is in the ''[[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]'' of ''d''.

For an exact form ''α'', {{nowrap|1=''α'' = ''dβ''}} for some differential form ''β'' of degree one less than that of ''α''. The form ''β'' is called a "potential form" or "primitive" for ''α''. Since the exterior derivative of a closed form is zero, ''β'' is not unique, but can be modified by the addition of any closed form of degree one less than that of ''α''.

Because {{nowrap|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}, any exact form is necessarily closed. The question of whether ''every'' closed form is exact depends on the [[topology]] of the domain of interest.  On a [[Contractible space|contractible]] domain, every closed form is exact by the [[#Poincaré lemma|Poincaré lemma]]. More general questions of this kind on an arbitrary [[differentiable manifold]] are the subject of [[de Rham cohomology]], which allows one to obtain purely [[algebraic topology|topological]] information using differential methods.

== Examples ==
{{details|Winding number}}
[[File:Irrotationalfield.svg|thumb|Vector field corresponding to ''dθ''.]]
A simple example of a form which is closed but not exact is the 1-form &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is an abuse of notation. The argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not a well-defined function, and &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not the differential of any zero-form. The discussion that follows elaborates on this.&lt;/ref&gt; given by the derivative of [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] on the [[punctured plane]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^2\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not actually a function (see the next paragraph) &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not an exact form. Still, &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; has vanishing derivative and is therefore closed.

Note that the argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is only defined up to an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; since a single point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be assigned different arguments &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r+2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, etc. We can assign arguments in a locally consistent manner around &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, but not in a globally consistent manner. This is because if we trace a loop from &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; counterclockwise around the origin and back to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, the argument increases by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Generally, the argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; changes by
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{S^1} d\theta&lt;/math&gt;
over a counter-clockwise oriented loop &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;.

Even though the argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not technically a function, the different ''local'' definitions of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; differ from one another by constants. Since the derivative at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; only uses local data, and since functions that differ by a constant have the same derivative, the argument has a globally well-defined derivative "&lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt;".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The article [[covering space|covering spaces]] has more information on the mathematics of functions that are only locally well-defined.&lt;/ref&gt;

The upshot is that &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a one-form on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^2\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; that is not actually the derivative of any well-defined function &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not ''exact''. Explicitly, &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given as:
:&lt;math&gt;d\theta = \frac{-y\,dx + x\,dy}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;,
which by inspection has derivative zero. Because &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; has vanishing derivative, we say that it is ''closed''.

This form generates the de Rham cohomology group &lt;math&gt;H^1_{dR}(\mathbf{R}^2\setminus\{0\}) \cong \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt; meaning that any closed form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of an exact form &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; and a multiple of &lt;math&gt;d\theta:&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\omega = df + k\ d\theta,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{k = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_{S^1} \omega}&lt;/math&gt; accounts for a non-trivial contour integral around the origin, which is the only obstruction to a closed form on the punctured plane (locally the derivative of a [[function (mathematics)|potential function]]) being the derivative of a globally defined function.

==Examples in low dimensions==

Differential forms in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; were well known in the [[mathematical physics]] of the nineteenth century. In the plane, 0-forms are just functions, and 2-forms are functions times the basic area element {{nowrap|''dx'' ∧ ''dy''}}, so that it is the 1-forms

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = f(x,y) \, dx + g(x,y) \, dy&lt;/math&gt;

that are of real interest. The formula for the [[exterior derivative]] ''d'' here is

:&lt;math&gt; d \alpha = (g_x-f_y) \, dx\wedge dy&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripts denote [[partial derivative]]s. Therefore the condition for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to be ''closed'' is

:&lt;math&gt; f_y=g_x.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case if {{nowrap|''h''(''x'', ''y'')}} is a function then

:&lt;math&gt; dh = h_x \, dx + h_y \, dy.&lt;/math&gt;

The implication from 'exact' to 'closed' is then a consequence of the [[symmetry of second derivatives]], with respect to ''x'' and ''y''.

The [[gradient theorem]] asserts that a 1-form is exact if and only if the line integral of the form depends only on the endpoints of the curve, or equivalently,
if the integral around any smooth closed curve is zero.

===Vector field analogies===
On a [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], ''k''-forms correspond to ''k''-vector fields (by [[musical isomorphism | duality via the metric]]), so there is a notion of a vector field corresponding to a closed or exact form.

In 3 dimensions, an exact vector field (thought of as a 1-form) is called a [[conservative vector field]], meaning that it is the derivative ([[gradient]]) of a 0-form (smooth scalar field), called the [[scalar potential]]. A closed vector field (thought of as a 1-form) is one whose derivative ([[curl (mathematics)|curl]]) vanishes, and is called an [[irrotational vector field]].

Thinking of a vector field as a 2-form instead, a closed vector field is one whose derivative ([[divergence]]) vanishes, and is called an [[incompressible flow]] (sometimes [[solenoidal vector field]]).

The concepts of conservative and incompressible vector fields generalize to ''n'' dimensions, because gradient and divergence generalize to ''n'' dimensions; curl is defined only in three dimensions, thus the concept of irrotational vector field does not generalize in this way.

==Poincaré lemma&lt;!--'Poincaré lemma' redirects here--&gt;==
The '''Poincaré lemma'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; states that if ''B'' is an open ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, any smooth closed ''p''-form ''ω'' defined on ''B'' is exact, for any integer ''p'' with {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1983|pages=155-156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translating if necessary, it can be assumed that the ball ''B'' has centre 0. Let ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; be the flow on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; defined by {{nowrap|1=''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; '''x''' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''s''&lt;/sup&gt; '''x'''}}. For {{nowrap|''s'' ≥ 0}} it carries ''B'' into itself and induces an action on functions and differential forms. 
The derivative of the flow is the vector field ''X'' defined on functions ''f'' by {{nowrap|1=''Xf'' = ''d''(''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''f'')/''ds''|&lt;sub&gt;''s'' = 0&lt;/sub&gt;}}: it is the ''radial vector field'' {{nowrap|1=−''r'' {{sfrac|∂|∂''r''}} = −∑ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|∂|∂''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. The derivative of the flow on forms defines the [[Lie derivative]] with respect to ''X'' given by {{nowrap|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ''d''(''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''ω'') /''ds''|&lt;sub&gt;''s''=0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In particular 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{d\over ds} \alpha_s \omega =\alpha_s L_X \omega,}&lt;/math&gt;

Now define

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{h\omega =-\int_0^\infty \alpha_t\omega \, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] we have that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{hL_X\omega=-\int_0^\infty \alpha_t L_X \omega \, dt=-\int_0^\infty {d\over dt} (\alpha_t \omega) \, dt= -[\alpha _t \omega]_0^\infty= \omega.}&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\iota_X}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[interior multiplication]] or contraction by the vector field ''X'', Cartan's formula writes:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{L_X = d\iota_X + \iota_X d.}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that ''d'' commutes with ''h'' (as ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; does with ''d'') we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ hL_X\omega = h (d\iota_X + \iota_X d) \omega = d (h\iota_X \omega) + h \iota_X d \omega =\omega} &lt;/math&gt;.

It now follows that if ''ω'' is closed, i. e. {{nowrap|1=''dω'' = 0}}, then {{nowrap|1=''d''(''h'' ''ι''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''ω'') = ''ω''}}, so that ''ω'' is exact and the Poincaré lemma is proved.

(In the language of [[homological algebra]], {{nowrap|''h'' ∘ ''ι''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a "contracting homotopy".)  

The same method applies to any open set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; that is star-shaped about 0, i.e. any open set containing 0 and invariant under ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{1 &lt; t &lt; \infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example''': In two dimensions the Poincaré lemma can be proved directly for closed 1-forms and 2-forms as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Napier|Ramachandran|2011|pages=443-444}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy''}} is a closed 1-form on {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'') × (''c'', ''d'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} then {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''q'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(x,y)=\int_a^x p(t,y)\, dt,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''}}.  Then {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''f'' − ''g''}} must satisfy {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q'' − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The right hand side here is independent of ''x'' since its partial derivative with respect to ''x'' is 0. So 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{h(x,y)=\int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds - g(a,y)=\int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds,}&lt;/math&gt;

and hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(x,y)=\int_a^x p(t,y)\, dt + \int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds.}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''r'' ''dx'' ∧ ''dy''}} then {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''d''(''a'' ''dx'' + ''b'' ''dy'')}} with {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''}}. Thus a solution is given by {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 0}} and 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{b(x,y)=\int_a^x r(t,y) \, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

==Formulation as cohomology==

When the difference of two closed forms is an exact form, they are said to be '''cohomologous''' to each other.  That is, if ''ζ'' and ''η'' are closed forms, and one can find some ''β'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta - \eta = d\beta&lt;/math&gt;

then one says that ''ζ'' and ''η'' are cohomologous to each other. Exact forms are sometimes said to be '''cohomologous to zero'''. The set of all forms cohomologous to a given form (and thus to each other) is called a [[de Rham cohomology]] class; the general study of such classes is known as [[cohomology]]. It makes no real sense to ask whether a 0-form (smooth function) is exact, since ''d'' increases degree by 1; but the clues from topology suggest that only the zero function should be called "exact". The cohomology classes are identified with [[locally constant]] functions.

Using contracting homotopies similar to the one used in the proof of the Poincaré lemma, it can be shown that de Rham cohomology is homotopy-invariant. In general, non-contractible differentiable manifolds have non-trivial de Rham cohomology. For instance, on the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, parametrized by ''t'' in {{nowrap|[0, 1]}}, the closed 1-form ''dt'' is not exact.

==Application in electrodynamics==

In electrodynamics, the case of the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\vec B(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt; produced by a stationary electrical current is important. There one deals with the [[vector potential]] &lt;math&gt;\vec A(\mathbf r )&lt;/math&gt; of this field. This case corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 2}}, and the defining region is the full &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3\,.&lt;/math&gt;  The   current-density  vector is &lt;math&gt;\vec j\,.&lt;/math&gt; It corresponds to the current two-form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf I :=j_1(x_1,x_2, x_3) \, {\rm d}x_2\wedge {\rm d}x_3+j_2(x_1,x_2, x_3) \, {\rm d}x_3\wedge {\rm d}x_1+j_3(x_1,x_2, x_3) \, {\rm d}x_1\wedge {\rm d}x_2.&lt;/math&gt;

For the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt;  one has analogous results: it corresponds to the induction two-form &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B:=B_1{\rm d}x_2\wedge {\rm d}x_3 +\cdots ,&lt;/math&gt; and can be derived from the vector potential &lt;math&gt;\vec A&lt;/math&gt;, or the corresponding one-form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \vec B ={\rm curl\,\,}\vec A =\left\{ \frac{\partial A_3}{\partial x_2}-\frac{\partial A_2}{\partial x_3} , \frac{\partial A_1}{\partial x_3}-\frac{\partial A_3}{\partial x_1} ,\frac{\partial A_2}{\partial x_1}-\frac{\partial A_1}{\partial x_2}\right\},\text{ or }\Phi_B={\rm d}\mathbf A.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Thereby the vector potential &lt;math&gt;\vec A&lt;/math&gt;  corresponds to the potential one-form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A:=A_1 \, {\rm d}x_1+A_2 \, {\rm d}x_2+A_3 \, {\rm d}x_3.&lt;/math&gt;

The closedness of the magnetic-induction two-form corresponds to the property of the magnetic field that it is source-free: &amp;nbsp;  &lt;math&gt; {\rm div\,\,}\vec B \equiv 0,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. that there are no magnetic [[Magnetic monopole|monopole]]s.

In a special gauge, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}\vec A{~\stackrel{!}{=}~}0&lt;/math&gt;, this implies for&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3

:&lt;math&gt;A_i(\vec r)
=\int \frac{\mu_0 j_i(\vec r^{\,'})\,\, dx_1'dx_2'dx_3'}{4\pi |\vec r -\vec r^{\,'}|}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(Here &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, the magnetic vacuum permeability.)

This equation is remarkable, because it corresponds completely to a well-known formula for the ''electrical'' field &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt;, namely for the ''electrostatic Coulomb potential'' &lt;math&gt;\,\phi (x_1,x_2, x_3)&lt;/math&gt; of a ''charge density'' &lt;math&gt;\rho (x_1,x_2,x_3)&lt;/math&gt;. At this place one can already guess that

*&lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B ,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec j ,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec A&lt;/math&gt;

can be ''unified'' to quantities with six rsp. four nontrivial components, which is the basis of the  [[relativistic invariance]] of the [[Maxwell equations]].

If the condition of stationarity is left, on the ''l.h.s.'' of the above-mentioned  equation one must add, in the equations for &lt;math&gt;A_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;  to the three space coordinates, as a fourth variable also the time ''t'', whereas on the ''r.h.s.'',  in &lt;math&gt;j_i' \,,&lt;/math&gt; the so-called "retarded time", &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;t':=t-\frac{|\vec r -\vec r^{\,'}|}{c}\,,&lt;/math&gt; must be used, i.e. it is added to the argument of the current-density. Finally, as before, one integrates over the three primed space coordinates. (As usual
''c'' is the vacuum velocity of light.)

'''Communication rights''' involve [[freedom of opinion]] and [[Freedom of expression|expression]], [[democracy|democratic]] [[Media (communication)|media]] [[governance]], [[media ownership]] and media control, participation in one's own culture, [[linguistic rights]], [[right to education|rights to education]], [[right to privacy|privacy]],  [[Right to assemble|assemble]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].  They are also related [[social exclusion|inclusion and exclusion]],  quality and [[accessibility]] to  means of communication.&lt;ref name=WACCA&gt;[http://centreforcommunicationrights.org/index.php/introduction.html What are communication rights?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109023820/http://centreforcommunicationrights.org/index.php/introduction.html |date=2014-11-09 }} How do they relate to [[human rights]]? How do they differ from  [[freedom of expression]] ? Centre for Communication Rights. [[World Association for Christian Communication|WACC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A "right to communicate" and "communication rights" are closely related, but not identical. The former is more associated with the [[New World Information and Communication Order]] debate, and points to the need for a formal legal acknowledgment of such a right, as an overall framework for more effective implementation. The latter emphasizes the fact that an array of international rights underpinning communication already exists, but many are often ignored and require active mobilization and assertion.&lt;ref name=WACCA /&gt;

==History==
The concept of the right to communicate began in 1969 with [[Jean D’Arcy]], a pioneer in French and European television in the 1950s and by 1969 Director of the United Nations Radio and Visual Services Division, where he was involved in international policy discussions arising out of the recent innovations in satellite global communications.  He recognized that the communication rights relating to freedom of expression embodied in the U. N. [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) adopted in 1948 would need to be re-examined in the context of global, interactive communication between individuals and communities. He called for the need for the recognition of a human right to communicate that would encompass earlier established rights.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy, Jean - [http://righttocommunicate.com/?q=node/117  The Right to Communicate] (edited by L. S. Harms).&lt;/ref&gt;  He thus was the first to link communication and ''universal'' human rights. His call was taken up by academics, policy experts, and public servants who evolved into the [[Right to Communicate Group]], the many non-governmental and civil society organisations that made up the Platform for Co-operation on Communication and Democratisation, and the Communication Rights in the Information Society (CRIS) Campaign.

The first broad-based debate on media and communication globally, limited mainly to governments, ran for a decade from the mid-1970s. Governments of the South, by then a majority in the UN, began voicing demands in [[UNESCO]] concerning media concentration, the flow of news, and ‘[[cultural imperialism]]’. The MacBride Report (1981) studied the problem, articulating a general ‘right to communicate’. The debate was compromised, however, by Cold War rhetoric, and fell apart after the US and the UK pulled out of UNESCO.

The ''MacBride Report'' became unavailable until the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC) sponsored its republication in 1988. WACC held the secretariat of the CRIS Campaign 2000–05.

Interest in the right to communicate languished during the 1980s as there was no mass movement to promote it for the simple reason few people had direct experience with interactive communication over global electronic networks.  This situation changed dramatically in the 1990s with a cluster of innovations that included the Internet, the World Wide Web, search engines, availability of personal computers, and social networking.  As more people participated in interactive communication and the many challenges it raised in regard to such communication rights as free of speech, privacy, and freedom of information, they began to develop a growing consciousness of the importance of such rights to their ability to communicate.

A result of this growing communicative consciousness is a renewed research interest in and political advocacy for a right to communicate (see references).  From the 1990s onwards, NGOs and activists{{Who|date=December 2012}} became increasingly active in a variety of communication issues, from community media, to language rights, to copyright, to Internet provision and free and open source software. These coalesced in a number of umbrella groups tackling inter-related issues from which the pluralistic notion of communication rights began to take shape, this time from the ground up.

==Four pillars==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each Pillar [of Communication Rights] relates to a different domain of social existence, experience and practice, in which communication is a core activity and performs key functions. The {{sic|rational}} for the four [pillars is,] that each involves a ''relatively autonomous sphere of social action'', yet ''depends on the others'' for achieving its ultimate goal - they are necessary interlocking blocks in the struggle to achieve communication rights. Action can be coherently pursued under, each, often in collaboration with other social actors concerned with the area more generally; while bridges can and must be built to the other areas if the goal is to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Ó Siochrú | 2005 | p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Communicating in the public sphere===
"The role of communication and media in exercising democratic political participation in society."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"&gt;{{Harvnb | Ó Siochrú | 2005 | p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication knowledge===
"The terms and means by which knowledge generated by society is communicated, or blocked, for use by different groups."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

===Civil rights in communication===
"The exercise of civil rights relating to the processes of communication in society."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

===Cultural rights in communication===
"The communication of diverse cultures, cultural forms and identities at the individual and social levels."&lt;ref name="Ó Siochrú 2005 41"/&gt;

==Right to communicate vs. communication rights==
A ‘right to communicate’ and ‘communication rights’ are closely related, but not identical, in their history and usage. In the Cold War tensions of the 1970s and 1980s, the former became associated with the [[New World Information and Communication Order]] (NWICO) debate, thus, efforts within UNESCO to formulate such a right were abandoned.  The latter emphasizes the fact that an array of international rights underpinning communication already exists, but many are too often ignored and require active mobilisation and assertion.  While some, especially within the [[mass media]] sector, still see the right to communicate as a "code word" for state [[censorship]],the technological innovations in interactive electronic, global communication of recent decades are seen by others as challenging the traditional mass media structures and formulations of communication rights values arising from them, thereby renewing the need to re-consider the need for a right to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;These issues are explored more fully in Raboy's and Shtern's  ''Media Divides: Communication rights and the right to communicate in Canada'' (2010) and Dakroury, Eid, &amp; Kamalipour (Eds.), ''The right to communicate: Historical hopes, global debates, and future premises.'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In early philosophies of [[psychology]] and [[metaphysics]], '''conatus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=conatus&amp;nbsp;— Definitions from Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conatus|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "effort; endeavor; impulse, inclination, tendency; undertaking; striving") is an innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself.&lt;ref name="Traup"&gt;{{Harvnb|Traupman|1966|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "thing" may be [[mind]], [[matter]], or a combination of both. Over the millennia, many different definitions and treatments have been formulated. Seventeenth-century philosophers [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]] made important contributions.&lt;ref Name="LeB"&gt;{{Harvnb|LeBuffe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--These last three constitute the "great early modern classic[s] of ''conatus''" {{Harv|Tuusvuori|2000|p=147}}.--&gt; The ''conatus'' may refer to the instinctive "will to live" of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[inertia]].&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the concept is associated with [[God]]'s will in a [[pantheist]] view of [[Nature]].&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept may be broken up into separate definitions for the mind and body and split when discussing [[centrifugal force]] and inertia.&lt;ref name="Koll"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kollerstrom|1999|pp=331–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the term ''conatus'' is that of a series of subtle tweaks in meaning and clarifications of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia. Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept, each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt; The earliest authors to discuss ''conatus'' wrote primarily in Latin, basing their usage on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concepts. These thinkers therefore used "''conatus''" not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense. In archaic texts, the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one, and they are also hard to differentiate in translation. In [[English (language)|English]] translations, the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by ''conatus'' in brackets.&lt;ref name="Leib89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1989|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''conatus'' is rarely used in the technical sense, since modern physics uses concepts such as [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]] that have superseded it. It has, however, been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]].

==Classical origins==
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
The Latin ''[[wikt:conatus|cōnātus]]'' comes from the verb ''[[wikt:conor|cōnor]]'', which is usually translated into English as, "to endeavor"; but the concept of the ''conatus'' was first developed by the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] (333–264 BCE) and [[Peripatetics]] (c. 335 BCE) before the [[Common Era]]. These groups used the word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὁρμή|ὁρμή]]}} (''hormê'', translated in Latin by ''[[Theory of impetus|impetus]]'') to describe the movement of the soul towards an object, and from which a physical act results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], in SVF, III, 377; [[Cicero]], ''[[De Officiis]]'', I, 132; [[Seneca the Younger]], ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'', 113, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Classical thinkers, [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106–43 BCE) and [[Diogenes Laertius]] (c. 235 BCE), expanded this principle to include an aversion to destruction, but continued to limit its application to the motivations of non-human animals. Diogenes Laertius, for example, specifically denied the application of the term to plants. Before the [[Renaissance]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274 CE), [[Duns Scotus]] (c. 1266–1308 CE) and [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321 CE) expressed similar sentiments using the Latin words ''vult'', ''velle'' or ''appetit'' as synonyms of ''conatus''; indeed, all four terms may be used to translate the original Greek {{lang|grc|ὁρμή}}. Later&lt;!--Did Wolfson give exact date? I wrote down 1700, originally, but that is impossible.--&gt;, [[Telesius]] and [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] extended the ancient Greek notions and applied them to all objects, animate and inanimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Wolfson|1934|pp=196,199,202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First [[Aristotle]], then Cicero and Laertius each alluded to a connection between the ''conatus'' and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it "good", but rather they think it "good" because they want to do it. In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval views==
{{Further|Theory of impetus}}
{{See also|Physics in medieval Islam|Scholasticism|Medieval philosophy}}
There is a traditional connection between ''conatus'' and motion itself. Aquinas and [[Judah Leon Abravanel|Abravanel]] (1265–1321) both related the concept directly to that which [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430 CE) saw to be the "natural movements upward and downward or with their being balanced in an intermediate position" described in his ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'', (c. 520 CE). They called this force that causes objects to rise or fall, "''amor naturalis''", or "natural love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|pp=197,200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century, [[John Philoponus]] (c. 490–c. 570 CE) criticized Aristotle's view of motion, noting the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium of [[aether (classical element)|aether]] keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where there is no such medium and hence a body's motion should be impossible. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of some surrounding medium but by some property, or ''conatus'' implanted in the object when it was set in motion. This was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|1988|pp=227,228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was strongly opposed by [[Averroës]] and many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers who supported Aristotle.&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leaman|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aristotelian view was also challenged in the Islamic world. For example, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) seems to have supported Philoponus' views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sabra|1994|pp=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he developed a concept similar to [[inertia]].&lt;ref name=salam&gt;{{Harvnb|Salam|1987|pp=179–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of inertia was developed more clearly in the work of his contemporary [[Avicenna]], who conceived a permanent force whose effect is dissipated only as a result of external agents such as [[air resistance]], making him "the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|p=477}}:
{{quote|"It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna's concept of ''mayl'' is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion and is reminiscent of [[Newton's first law of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|p=477}}: {{quote|"Indeed, self-motion of the type conceived by Ibn Sina is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion of the projectile type, and it is rather reminiscent of the principle of inertia, i.e., Newton's first law of motion."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna also developed an idea similar to [[momentum]], when he attempted to provide a quantitative relation between the [[weight]] and [[velocity]] of a moving body.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia|author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] &amp; Mehdi Amin Razavi|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-7007-0314-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Buridan]] (1300–1358) also rejected the notion that this motion-generating property, which he named ''impetus'', dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of [[momentum]]. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grant|1964|pp=265–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Descartes==
&lt;!--linked from 'René Descartes'--&gt;
{{See also|René Descartes}}
[[Image:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]
In the first half of the seventeenth century, René Descartes (1596–1650) began to develop a more modern, [[materialism|materialistic]] concept of the ''conatus'', describing it as "an active power or tendency of bodies to move, expressing the power of God".&lt;ref name="Piet"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pietarinen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] sense similar to voluntary "endeavoring" or "struggling" to achieve certain ends, and medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers developed a notion of ''conatus'' as a mysterious intrinsic property of things, Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=150,154}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, for Descartes, in contrast to Buridan, movement and stasis are two states of the same thing, not different things. Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes' notion of ''conatus'', one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaukroger|1980|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes rejects the [[teleology|teleological]], or purposive, view of the material world that was dominant in the West from the time of Aristotle.&lt;!--Steve Nadler refutes the use of "despite" here--&gt; The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The ''conatus'' is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no ''new'' motion or rest can be created or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gueroult|1980|pp=120–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes specifies two varieties of the ''conatus'': ''conatus a centro'' and ''conatus recedendi''. ''Conatus a centro'', or "tendency towards the center", is used by Descartes as a theory of [[gravity]]; ''conatus recendendi'', or "tendency away from the center", represents the [[centrifugal force]]s.&lt;ref name="Koll" /&gt; These tendencies are not to be thought of in terms of animate dispositions and intentions, nor as inherent properties or "forces" of things, but rather as a unifying, external characteristic of the physical universe itself which God has bestowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=180,184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes, in developing his First Law of Nature, also invokes the idea of a ''conatus se movendi'', or "''conatus'' of self-preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is a generalization of the principle of [[inertia]], which was developed and experimentally demonstrated earlier by [[Galileo]]. The principle was formalized by [[Isaac Newton]] and made into the first of his three [[Laws of Motion]] fifty years after the death of Descartes. Descartes' version states: "Each thing, insofar as in it lies, always perseveres in the same state, and when once moved, always continues to move."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackwell|1966|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hobbes==
&lt;!--linked from 'Thomas Hobbes'--&gt;
{{See also|Thomas Hobbes}}
[[Image:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]

===''Conatus'' and the psyche===
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), too, worked off of the previous notions of the ''conatus'' principle. However, he criticized the previous definitions for failing to explain the origin of motion. Working toward this end became the primary focus of Hobbes' work in this area. Indeed, Hobbes "reduces all the cognitive functions of the mind to variations of its ''conative'' functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Hobbes describes [[emotion]] as the beginning of motion and the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] as the sum of all emotions. This "will" forms the ''conatus'' of a body&lt;ref name="Piet" /&gt; and its physical manifestation is the perceived "will to survive".&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; In order that living beings may thrive, Hobbes says, "they seek peace and fight anything that threatens this peace".&lt;ref name="Piet" /&gt; Hobbes also equates this ''conatus'' with "imagination", and states that a change in the ''conatus'', or will, is the result of "deliberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schmitter|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Conatus'' and physics===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I define [''conatus''] to be motion made in less space and time than can be given; that is, less than can be determined or assigned by exposition or number; that is, motion made through the length of a point, and in an instant or point of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobbes|1998|loc=III, xiv, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As in his psychological theory, Hobbes's physical ''conatus'' is an infinitesimal unit of motion. It is the ''beginning'' of motion: an inclination in a specified direction. The concept of ''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]'', as used by Hobbes, is defined in terms of this physical ''conatus''. It is "a measure of the ''conatus'' exercised by a moving body over the course of time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friction|Resistance]] is caused by a contrary ''conatus''; [[force]] is this motion plus "the magnitude of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes also uses the word ''conatus'' to refer to the "restorative forces" which may cause [[Spring (device)|springs]], for example, to contract or expand. Hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state. Today, science attributes this phenomenon to material [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].&lt;ref name="Osler"&gt;{{Harvnb|Osler|2001|pp=157–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Spinoza==
{{See also|Baruch Spinoza}}
Conatus is a central theme in the philosophy of Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677). According to Spinoza, "each thing, as far as it lies in itself, strives to persevere in its being" (''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', part 3, prop. 6). Spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this. First, particular things are, as he puts it, modes of God, which means that each one expresses the power of God in a particular way (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 6, dem.). Moreover, it could never be part of the definition of God that his modes contradict one another (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 5); each thing, therefore, "is opposed to everything which can take its existence away" (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 6, dem.). This resistance to destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist, and ''conatus'' is the word he most often uses to describe this force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedictus de Spinoza]]]]

Striving to persevere is not merely something that a thing does in addition to other activities it might happen to undertake. Rather, striving is "nothing but the actual essence of the thing" (''Ethics'', part 3, prop. 7). Spinoza also uses the term ''conatus'' to refer to rudimentary concepts of [[inertia]], as Descartes had earlier.&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; Since a thing cannot be destroyed without the action of external forces, motion and rest, too, exist indefinitely until disturbed.&lt;ref name="All"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral manifestation===
The concept of the ''conatus'', as used in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s [[psychology]], is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates principles that [[the Stoics]], [[Cicero]], [[Laertius]], and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morgan|2006|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; One significant change he makes to Hobbes' theory is his belief that the ''conatus ad motum'', (''conatus'' to motion), is ''not'' mental, but material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza, with his [[determinism]], believes that man and nature must be unified under a consistent set of laws; [[God]] and [[nature]] are one, and there is no [[free will]]. Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present, Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind, [[intentionality]], ethics, and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jarrett|1991|pp=470–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal is to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] framework, and his notion of ''conatus'' is central to this project. For example, an action is "free", for Spinoza, only if it arises from the essence and ''conatus'' of an entity. There can be no absolute, unconditioned freedom of the will, since all events in the natural world, including human actions and choices, are [[determinism|determined]] in accord with the natural laws of the universe, which are inescapable. However, an action can still be free in the sense that it is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lachterman|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings are thus an integral part of nature.&lt;ref name="All" /&gt; Spinoza explains seemingly irregular human behaviour as really "natural" and rational and motivated by this principle of the ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutton|2006|loc= chp. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he replaces the notion of free will with the ''conatus'', a principle that can be applied to all of nature and not just man.&lt;ref name="All" /&gt;

====Emotions and affects====
Spinoza's view of the relationship between the ''conatus'' and the human [[affect (psychology)|affects]] is not clear. [[Firmin DeBrabander]], assistant professor of philosophy at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], and [[Antonio Damasio]], professor of [[neuroscience]] at the [[University of Southern California]], both argue that the human affects arise from the ''conatus'' and the perpetual drive toward perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeBrabander|2007|pp=20–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Spinoza states in his ''Ethics'' that happiness, specifically, "consists in the human capacity to preserve itself". This "endeavor" is also characterized by Spinoza as the "foundation of [[virtue]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a person is saddened by anything that opposes his ''conatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bidney]] (1908–1987), professor at [[Yale University]], disagrees. Bidney closely associates "desire", a primary affect, with the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza. This view is backed by the Scholium of IIIP9 of the ''Ethics'' which states, "Between appetite and desire there is no difference, except that desire is generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of the appetite. So desire can be defined as appetite together with consciousness of the appetite."&lt;ref name="LeB" /&gt; According to Bidney, this desire is controlled by the other affects, pleasure and pain, and thus the ''conatus'' strives towards that which causes joy and avoids that which produces pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|source= &lt;ref name="Art98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Arthur|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) was a student of [[Erhard Weigel]] (1625–1699) and learned of the ''conatus'' principle from him and from Hobbes, though Weigel used the word ''tendentia'' (Latin: tendency).&lt;ref name="Art98" /&gt; Specifically, Leibniz uses the word ''conatus'' in his ''Exposition and Defence of the New System'' (1695) to describe a notion similar that of Hobbes, but he differentiates between the ''conatus'' of the body and soul, the first of which may only travel in a straight line by its own power, and the latter of which may "remember" more complicated motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1988|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Leibniz, the problem of motion comes to a resolution of the [[paradox of Zeno]].
Since motion is continuous, space must be infinitely divisible. In order for anything to begin moving at all, there must be some mind-like, voluntaristic property or force inherent in the basic constituents of the universe that propels them. This ''conatus'' is a sort of instantaneous or "virtual" motion that all things possess, even when they are static. Motion, meanwhile, is just the summation of all the ''conatuses'' that a thing has, along with the interactions of things. The ''conatus'' is to motion as a point is to space.&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gillespie|1971|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this view is that an object that collides with another would not be able to bounce back, if the only force in play were the ''conatus''. Hence, Leibniz was forced to postulate the existence of an [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions. Leibniz' concept of a mind-like memory-less property of ''conatus'', coupled with his rejection of [[atom]]s, eventually led to his theory of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]].&lt;ref name="Carl"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlin|2004|pp=365–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz also uses his concept of a ''conatus'' in developing the principles of the [[integral calculus]], adapting the meaning of the term, in this case, to signify a mathematical analog of Newton's accelerative "[[force]]". By summing an infinity of such ''conatuses'' (i.e., what is now called [[integral|integration]]), Leibniz could measure the effect of a continuous force.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; He defines ''[[Theory of impetus|impetus]]'' as the result of a continuous summation of the ''conatus'' of a body, just as the ''[[vis viva]]'' (or "living force") is the sum of the inactive ''[[vis mortua]]''.&lt;ref name="Duch"&gt;{{Harvnb|Duchesneau|1998|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the work of Kepler and probably Descartes, Leibniz develops a model of planetary motion based on the ''conatus'' principle, the idea of aether and a fluid [[vortex]]. This theory is expounded in the work ''Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis'' (1689).&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; According to Leibniz, Kepler's analysis of elliptical orbits into a circular and a radial component can be explained by a "harmonic vortex" for the circular motion combined with a centrifugal force and gravity, both of which are examples of ''conatus'', to account for the radial motion.&lt;ref name="Carl" /&gt; Leibniz later defines the term ''monadic conatus'', as the "state of change" through which his monads perpetually advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arthur|1994|loc=sec. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other uses of the term ''conatus'', apart from the primary ones mentioned above, have been formulated by various philosophers over the centuries. There are also some important related terms and concepts which have, more or less, similar meanings and usages. [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) defined ''conatus'' as the essence of human [[society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goulding|2005|p=22040}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also, in a more traditional, [[hylozoism|hylozoistic]] sense, as the generating power of movement which pervades all of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vico|1710|pp=180–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century after the beginnings of modern science, Vico, inspired by [[Neoplatonism]], explicitly rejected the principle of inertia and the laws of motion of the new physics. For him, nature was composed neither of atoms, as in the dominant view, nor of extension, as in Descartes, but of ''metaphysical points'' animated by a ''conatus'' principle provoked by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landucci|2004|pp=1174,1175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) developed a philosophy that contains a principle notably similar to that of Hobbes's ''conatus''. This principle, ''Wille zum Leben'', or "Will to Live", described the specific phenomenon of an organism's self-preservation instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rabenort|1911|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer qualified this, however, by suggesting that the Will to Live is not limited in duration. Rather, "the will wills absolutely and for all time", across generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=568}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), an early disciple of Schopenhauer, developed a separate principle which comes out of a rejection of the primacy of Schopenhauer's Will to Live and other notions of self-preservation. He called his version the [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Will to Power]], or ''Wille zur Macht''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Durant|Durant|1963|loc=chp. IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Nietzsche criticized Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle, arguing that if true, it would allegedly favour a stagnant Universe. He thought "the opposite is true"; every organism strives not to just to persevere, but to "become more" than it is and to exert its creative strength. Spinoza's conatus, however, was much more alike to such an understanding than to simple self-preservation, as it was akin to empowerment. DIFFICULT TO SOURCE: SEE TALK PAGE--&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939), greatly depended on Spinoza's formulation of the ''conatus'' principle as a system of self-preservation, though he never cited him directly in any of his published works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), developed the principle of the ''[[élan vital]]'', or "vital impulse", which was thought to aid in the [[evolution]] of [[organism]]s. This concept, which implies a fundamental driving force behind all life, is reminiscent of the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schrift|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Max Scheler]], the concept of ''Drang'' is the centerpiece of [[philosophical anthropology]] and [[metaphysics]].  Though his concept has been important throughout his entire philosophical career, it was only developed later in his life when his focus shifted from phenomenology to metaphysics.  Like Bergson's ''élan vital,'' ''Drang'' (drive or impulsion) is the impetus of all life; however, unlike in Bergson's vitalistic metaphysics, the significance of Drang is that it provides the motivation and driving force even of Spirit (''Geist'').  Spirit, which includes all theoretical intentionality, is powerless without the movement of ''Drang'', the material principle, as well as ''Eros'', the psychological principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheler|2008|pp=231–41, 323–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] (1911–1988), described a ''cultural conatus'' built directly upon Spinoza's seminal definition in IIIP3&lt;!--reread this book--&gt; of his ''Ethics''. The principle behind this derivative concept states that any given culture, "tends to persevere in its being, whether by dominating other cultures or by struggling against their domination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Polt|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern significance==
&lt;!--conation--&gt;

===Physical===
After the advent of Newtonian physics, the concept of a ''conatus'' of all physical bodies was largely superseded by the principle of [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]]. As Bidney states, "It is true that logically desire or the ''conatus'' is merely a principle of inertia&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the fact remains, however, that this is not Spinoza's usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''conatus'' was used by many philosophers to describe other concepts which have slowly been made obsolete. ''Conatus recendendi'', for instance, became the centrifugal force, and [[gravity]] is used where ''conatus a centro'' had been previously.&lt;ref name="Koll" /&gt; Today, the topics with which ''conatus'' dealt are matters of [[science]] and are thus subject to inquiry by the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological===
The archaic concept of ''conatus'' is today being reconciled with modern biology by scientists such as [[Antonio Damasio]].&lt;!--psychology and philosophy. --&gt; The ''conatus'' of today, however, is explained in terms of chemistry and neurology where, before, it was a matter of metaphysics and [[theurgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be "constructed so as to maintain the coherence of a living [[organism]]'s structures and functions against numerous life-threatening odds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--NEED SOURCE This stability required to maintain life can also refer to the notion of [[homeostasis]] developed by [[Claude Bernard]] which later inspired the field of [[cybernetics]].--&gt;&lt;!--ALSO NEED SOURCE This ''conatus'' is similar to modern notions of the [[libido]] in the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] sense, and the animal directive of [[self-preservation]].--&gt;

====Systems theory====
The Spinozistic conception of a ''conatus'' was a historical precursor to modern theories of [[autopoiesis]] in biological systems.&lt;ref name=ziemke6&gt;{{Harvnb|Ziemke|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[systems theory]] and the [[sciences]] in general, the concept of a ''conatus'' may be related to the phenomenon of [[emergence]], whereby [[complex systems]] may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle;&lt;ref name=sandy144145&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandywell|1996|pp=144–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.&lt;ref name=mathews110&gt;{{Harvnb|Mathews|1991|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1753">'''The Consciousness Industry''' is a term coined by author and theorist [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]], which identifies the mechanisms through which the human mind is reproduced as a social product. Foremost among these mechanisms are the institutions of [[mass media]] and [[education]]. According to Enzensberger, the mind industry does not produce anything specific; rather, its main business is to perpetuate the existing order of man's domination over man.

[[Hans Haacke]] elaborates on the consciousness industry as it applies to the arts in a wider system of production, distribution, and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Haacke, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Haacke specifically implicates museums as manufacturers of aesthetic perception that fail to acknowledge their intellectual, political, and [[moral authority]]: "rather than sponsoring intelligent, critical awareness, museums thus tend to foster appeasement."&lt;ref&gt;Haacke, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Cybernetic art''' is [[contemporary art]] that builds upon the legacy of [[Cybernetics]], where feedback involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.

==History==
[[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s ''CYSP I'' (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words "CYbernetic" and "SPatiodynamic").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CYSP I, the first cybernetic sculpture of art's history|url=http://www.olats.org/schoffer/cyspe.htm|publisher=Leonardo/OLATS - Observatoire Leonardo des arts et des technosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Roy Ascott]] elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in  "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including "[http://www.artexetra.com//CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Energy to Information: Representation in Science, Technology, Art, and Literature|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|pages=255–277|editor=Bruce Clarke and Linda Dalrymple Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of [[Roy Ascott]]"(2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A. Shanken}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to [[telematic art]] (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to [[net.art]].)

Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of [[Robert Breer]] and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In "Beyond Modern Sculpture" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading art theorists and historians in this field include [[Christiane Paul]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Margot Lovejoy]], [[Edmond Couchot]], [[Fred Forest]] and [[Edward A. Shanken]].

An '''epiphany''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] ἐπιφάνεια, ''epiphaneia'', "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by [[psychologist]]s&lt;ref name="Jarvis1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2008"/&gt; and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of [[innovation]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeemingMadden2009"/&gt;

Epiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include [[Archimedes]]'s discovery of a method to determine the density of an object ("[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!") and [[Isaac Newton]]'s realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;

==History==
The word epiphany originally referred to insight through the [[divine]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platt, V. J. (2011) ''Facing the Gods. Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion''. Cambridge University Press.'' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is [[supernatural]], as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;

The word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist [[James Joyce]]. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it."&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, ''Epiphany in the Modern Novel.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. P. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment ''[[Stephen Hero]],'' although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]]).
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]]. From "L'atmosphère", book of 1888]]
In traditional and pre-modern cultures, [[initiation]] rites and [[western esotericism|mystery religion]]s have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The [[Greek drama]]tists and [[Greek poetry|poets]] would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of ''[[catharsis]]'' or ''[[kenosis]]'', respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of [[William Burroughs]]' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, "a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork." Both the [[Dadaist]] [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Pop Art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]] would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of [[fine art]] (for example a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal as a fountain]]), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of "what art is" or is not.

==Process==
Epiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kounios|first1=John|last2=Beeman|first2=Mark|title=The Aha! Moment: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=210–216|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01638.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.521.6014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt; The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt;

==Myth==
A common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt; Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that "the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems".&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ("I have found it!").&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt; The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly [[Albert Einstein]] was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in [[Bern]] and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, "a storm broke loose in my mind," which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called "the happiest thought of my life" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of [[holistic]] understanding in a prepared mind was said to give [[Charles Darwin]] his "hunch" (about [[natural selection]]), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story,&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt; and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Another myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-11"/&gt;

==In religion==
{{Further information|Epiphany (holiday)|theophany|hierophany}}
In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the [[Visit of the Magi]] as the [[revelation]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the infant Christ, and commemorate the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or [[Theophany]]) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by [[John the Baptist]] and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6.&lt;ref name="The Season of Epiphany"/&gt; Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either [[Ash Wednesday]], or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.

In more general terms, the phrase "religious epiphany" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to [[Arjuna]]'s realization that [[Krishna]] (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the "[[Bhagavad Gita]]") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be [[bodhodaya]], from Sanskrit [[bodha]] 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the [[bodhi]] tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining [[Nirvana]]. The Zen term ''[[kensho]]'' also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a ''[[koan]]''.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}
'''Etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; alternatively '''aetiology''' or '''ætiology''') is the study of [[Causality|causation]], or origination. The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiología'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitía'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logía]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|etiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is commonly used in [[medicine]], (where it is a branch of medicine studying causes of disease) and in [[philosophy]], but also in [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[geography]], [[spatial analysis]], [[theology]], and [[biology]], in reference to the causes or origins of various [[phenomena]].

In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, [[myth]]s often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or [[origin myth]], is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, [[Virgil]]'s [[Aenead]] is a [[national myth]] written to explain and glorify the origins of the [[Roman Empire]]. In [[theology]], many religions have [[creation myths]] explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.

==Medicine==
{{Main|Cause (medicine)}}
In medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more  factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, [[scurvy]] was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]] suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet.  Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat [[sauerkraut]], a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he [[inferred]] that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of [[vitamin C]] in a sailor's diet.

== Mythology ==
{{Main|Origin myth}}
An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a [[mythology|myth]] intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name [[Delphi]] and its associated deity, ''[[Apollo|Apollon Delphinios]]'', are explained in the [[Homeric Hymn]] which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a [[dolphin]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphis}}''),  propelled [[Crete|Cretans]] over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphus}}'' ("womb"), many etiological myths are similarly based on [[folk etymology]] (the term "[[Amazons|Amazon]]", for example). In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (published circa 17 BC), [[Virgil]] claims the descent of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Julian clan]] from the hero [[Aeneas]] through his son [[Ascanius]], also called Iulus. The story of [[Prometheus]]' sacrifice [[trick at Mecone]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' relates how Prometheus tricked [[Zeus]] into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.

==Biography==

Evan Roth received a degree in architecture from [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and a MFA from the Communication, Design and Technology school at [[Parsons The New School for Design]], where he graduated as class valedictorian.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} During his time at Parsons, he developed several projects, including Graffiti Taxonomy, Typographic Illustration, Explicit Content Only and Graffiti Analysis, his thesis project. Roth was named one of the ten most interesting recent graduates of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"Head of the Class", ''RES'', 9(2):52,56&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating Roth worked at the [[Eyebeam Atelier|Eyebeam]] OpenLab, an open source creative technology lab for the public domain as a Research and Development Fellow from 2005–2006 and a Senior Fellow from 2006-2007. Roth's work with graffiti, open source technology and public space led to him forming the [[Graffiti Research Lab]] ("GRL") with [[James Powderly]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-11-19 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  GRL projects include [[LED Throwies]] and [[L.A.S.E.R. Tag]].  In 2007, Roth co-founded the [[Free Art and Technology Lab]] (F.A.T. Lab), an Internet-based art-and-technology collective dedicated to the intersection of open-source hacking and popular culture. He has worked under the pseudonym ''fi5e''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciarc.edu/lectures.php?id=1357&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth and Ben Engebreth were awarded a 2007 Rhizome Commission for White Glove Tracking, which was presented at the Contemporary New Museum in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteglovetracking.com whiteglovetracking.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizome.org/commissions/2007/ Rhizome|2007 Commissions]&lt;/ref&gt;  Roth was again awarded a Rhizome Commission in 2008 for his project "T.S.A. Communications." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizome.org/commissions/2009/ Rhizome|2009 Commissions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of Roth's work are in the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=33190&lt;/ref&gt; Roth currently{{when|date=April 2014}} lives in Paris with his wife.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28769">'''Free migration''' or '''open immigration''' is the position that people should be able to migrate to whatever country they choose.

== Argument for free migration ==
{{Expand section||date=September 2016}}
Although the two are not the same issue, free migration is similar in spirit to the concept of [[free trade]], and both are advocated by [[free market]] economists on the grounds that [[economics]] is not a [[zero-sum game]] and that free markets are, in their opinion, the best way to create a fairer and balanced economic system, thereby increasing the overall economic benefits to all concerned parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemens|first=Michael|date=2011|title=Economics and Immigration: Trillion Dollar Bills on the Sidewalk?|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume= 25|issue= 3|pages=83–106|doi=10.1257/jep.25.3.83|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/3512992.stm#Khadria The movement of people and goods is linked], Binod Khadria, BBC News, April 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding noteworthy differences among these political ideologies, many [[Libertarianism|libertarians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Libertarianism - What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Brennan|first=Jason|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=42, 50, 119, 125|quote=Libertarians also support free immigration. [...] They believe everyone has the right to take employment in any other country, regardless of citizenship. They hold that, except in special circumstances, governments may not forbid citizens from leaving a country, nor may governments forbid foreigners from entering. (Page 42)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social liberalism|liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] advocate open immigration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertarian.co.uk/freelife/fl019.pdf Immigration Control: What about the workers?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707041531/http://www.libertarian.co.uk/freelife/fl019.pdf |date=2007-07-07 }}, Paul Marks, Free Life No. 19, Page 12, November, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; as do [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2008-spring/immigration-individual-rights/|title = Immigration and Individual Rights|date = Spring 2008|accessdate = May 14, 2015|website = [[The Objective Standard]]|publisher = |last = Biddle|first = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[free market]] economists believe that competition is the essence of a healthy economic system, and that any short-term negative impact on individual economic factors that is caused by free migration is more than justified by the prospects of long-term growth for the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/defense-free-migration/ In Defense of Free Migration], Richard M. Ebeling, The Future of Freedom Foundation, June 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights perspective ===
From a [[Human rights|human-rights]] perspective, free migration may be seen to complement Article 13 of the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]]:
# Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State.
# Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=PecoudMigration Antoine Pécoud and Paul de Guchteneire (Eds): ''MIGRATION WITHOUT BORDERS, Essays on the Free Movement of People ''(Berghahn Books, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against free migration ==
Arguments against free immigration are usually economical, cultural or security-related. Some arguments are [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] or what some critics claim to be "[[xenophobia|xenophobic]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/3512992.stm#Krikorian Borders are the line between 'us' and 'them'], Mark Krikorian, BBC News, April 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or ones similar to arguments against [[free trade]], favouring [[protectionism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Free migration of war/political refugees ==
War-related chaos can lead to the breakdown of borders and allow for ''de facto'' free immigration. The natural attempts to flee strife, or escape a conquering enemy, can quickly lead to millions of [[refugees]]. Even where border controls are in place they can be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people. Once settled into [[refugee camp]]s, these reluctant [[immigrants]] may take decades to be either repatriated back or naturalized into their new country. This has been the situation with the [[Palestinian refugees#Jordan|Palestinians in Jordan]].

During the [[Cold War]], a migration paradox arose in which some of the [[communist state]]s forbade emigration, while the "[[Free World]]" would freely accept the [[defector]]s. This policy persists for [[Cuba]]ns&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immigration-usa.com/cuban_refugee.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], who are both allowed particular forms of free immigration to the [[United States]] based on their automatic refugee status.

== Spiritual perspectives on migration ==
Through numerous situations and encounters, immigration can be a test of mental fortitude rather than physical ability. In [[Buddhism]], a [[bodhisattva]] is considered to be a guide to awakening and to the Pure Lands. "The Buddha declares that we are all bodhisattvas destined to attain full Awakening. It seems that each of us, then, is engaged in 'spiritual immigration'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strangers in This World|last=Thompson|first=John|publisher=Augsburg Fortress Publishers|year=2015|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=31–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha asserts that everyone is a bodhisattva, or a 'spiritual immigrant', who must attain various virtues which ultimately leads to ''[[prajnaparamita]]'', or 'transcendent wisdom'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The existence of Buddhas and [[Mahasattva]]s{{mdash}}'great beings' who have achieved a high level on the path to awakening{{mdash}}have created various branches of belief like [[Mahayana Buddhism]], which is a form of 'spiritual immigration'. "Buddhism is a type of immigration from the world of suffering to nirvana....We are all immigrants who, paradoxically, are seeking to and the land in which we already dwell".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In terms of 'spiritual immigration', the path of the bodhisattva is a change of mental capacity rather than cosmic location.

According to Buddhist teaching, the purpose of a 'spiritual immigration' is to help guide the individual onto their future path.  The Pure Land is the state of untainted mind: reaching this land of purity requires persistent effort and practice. Along the journey, individuals learn to envision their future as a land of opportunity. The intention of the pure land is to assure that the individual achieves their personal goals in life{{mdash}}the betterment of oneself in order to reach nirvana. Alongside these goals, practitioners also learn about the relationship of 'self' and 'others', resulting in the renewal of all beings. The concept of the pure lands enforces the idea of 'spiritual immigration' as a form of mental encouragement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Migration is a spiritual journey that establishes a point of communication between the human and divine. Religious figures migrate from one place to another as immigrants: "In Christianity, God migrated to this world in the form of human Jesus; the Hindu God [[Krishna]] descended to earth to become a charioteer, a human being ([[Bhagavad Gita]] 1:20-47); and the Buddha 'becomes Awakened' when he became a wanderer and a stranger".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strangers in This World: Multi-religious Reflections on Immigration|last=Hussam S. , and Jorgenson, Allen G. , and Hwang, Alexander Y..|first=|publisher=Augsburg Fortress Publishers|year=2015|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=111–128|chapter=The Islamic Doctrine of Hijra (Migration)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents believe that religious figures have travelled from an unpurified state to a purified state: Buddha traveled from his privileged life to a life of poverty to gain divinity and knowledge; therefore divine figures like [[Gautama Buddha|Gautam Buddha]] viewed migration as purification. The Qur’an states that "they could migrate from their oppressed positions to another land of God".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

The doctrine of ''[[Hejira|Hijrah]]'' suggest that freedom of movement is a human right as well as a duty to God. [[Globalization]] affects religious perspectives on migration which seek to prevent the "destruction to the sanctity of human life and dignity".  Religious figures like Buddha and Jesus practised "a theology of migration".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} According to adherents, immigrants should have the same rights as legal residents because world religions believe everyone is divine. It is also mentioned in the [[Quran|Qur’an]] that "strangers are entitled to the equal distribution of wealth".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;!-- please give Sura and Ayat --&gt; Despite the acquisition of wealth in verse 8:41, the Qur’an states that "know that one-fifth of your battle gains belongs to the God and the messenger, to close relatives and orphans or to the needy and travellers (strangers).”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to Collier and Strain, the Roman Catholic Church has been helping migrants for decades.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious and Ethical Perspectives on Global Migration|last=Elizabeth W. Collier, and Charles R. Strain|first=|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2014|isbn=|location=Lexington|pages=|chapter=7: Migration in The Light of Scripture and Catholic Social Teaching}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian faith receives a sense of justice for migrants from Abrahamic faith traditions. Catholics follow these guidelines to help immigrants: "for all persons on the move". The reasons to help those on the move were established in 1952 when leaders of the Roman Catholic Church published written material that reinforced the teachings of the church. One of the quotes from the Bible used to justify hospitality is "when an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as a citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God" (Leviticus 19:33).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

Strangers or those on the move should be treated equally, no less than anyone else. The modern nation state should open its borders because people may be migrating due to unfavorable circumstances. The Catholic Church believes everyone has a right to migrate to support their families; this idea of free migration allows "the human person [to precede] the state".”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In some circumstances, the Church provides assistance to migrants and refugees. Some Catholic organizations offer educational activities on the legal process of immigration to the United States. Other types of aid include spiritual companionship, ESL classes for those who want to learn to speak better English, basic hygiene, and food. The Roman Catholic Church believes that helping those in need enables the growth of the human spirit.

Before the [[Columbian exchange]], there was an open border policy in the Americas that gave Native Americans access to travel freely and have open trade with other cultures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There was widespread trade among many [[First Nations]] that created free movement and travel for many foreigners. At the time, there was little border control which allowed migrants to travel to various areas to settle. Immigration policy shifted towards control and nationalism after 1492. In the 20th century, immigration policy solidified borders in America, but many Native Americans advocated free movement and hospitality towards strangers. Native Americans historically have welcomed strangers with hospitality, sometimes making them relatives through an informal adoption system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Migration in America can be understood through the religious and cultural perspectives of Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Native American Hospitality and Generosity". Strangers in This World: Multireligious Reflections on Immigration.|last=Woodley, Randy|first=|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most Native American groups have shown hospitality towards strangers, and guests are given gifts from the host, which are known as 'give-aways'. Hospitality to visitors and other members of one's community is a value of many Native Americans groups, and they consider their belongings and other possessions as blessings. The concept of borders and walls (both artificial and real) were not practised in [[pre-Columbian]] times when Native Americans inhabited present day Canada, Central Amaerica, Mexico, and the U.S. Instead, hospitality and gift giving were the traditions that were honored and shared among visitors and other people.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Law and ethics ==
{{sources|section|date=April 2018}}
Many nation states have agreed and disagreed on the topic of open borders and free migration, with some countries allowing people to travel freely from country to country and state to state without the risk of deportation or punishment. The consensus within the open borders debate is to “establish a view of migration that reflects the liberal commitment to the equal moral worth of all people which applies to a truly global view of migration.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=MORAL CONSENSUS IN THE OPEN BORDERS DEBATE|last=Askren|first=Wayne|publisher=University of Utah Graduate School. Proquest.|year=2012|isbn=|location=Sal Lake City|pages=37–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various ideas have been applied to a global view of migration, such as the ideas of other journalists such as Johnathan Wolff and Avnir De-Shalit to migration. Wolff and De-Shalit’s state that the use of law and ethics is a positive factor in the debate over free migration.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The debate of free migration does not apply to a specific country but extends beyond, and continues on to a broader spectrum for introducing a freedom of movement amongst all people, for all countries. However, this concept is especially significant to the places that experience the most migration-including both host and receiving countries or states. Free migration is not limited to a certain time period, but has been more relevant and controversial in recent years, especially in the United States. In the U.S., it has become a more controversial topic since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].

Free migration is a concept to consider when comparing basic [[human rights]] and migration. "Constraining movement in most cases is therefore, unjustified and immoral".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The topic of free migration is not a matter to be only exclusively debated amongst national governments of varying nations, but a worldwide discussion for all people of all nations on the debate of open borders and free migration. In that case, nations and people from all over the world can learn from each other where everyone is involved in the attempt to come to a just conclusion and solution to the problems surrounding both immigration and free migration alike. Free Migration has been slowly restricted throughout recent history due to the inevitable progression of society, causing more independent societies to create tighter laws, policies, and regulations concerning immigration. With nations closing themselves off and shutting their borders from non-residents, it is difficult for free migration to become secure, as well as having members of society prioritize an institutional issue such as this.

Immigration officers and agents must maintain a code of conduct based on policy to provide equal treatment to any and all immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bader|first=Veit|date=2012|title=Moral, Ethical, and Realist Dilemmas of Transnational Governance of Migration|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=56 | issue = 9 |pages=1165–1182|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764212443819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers must put their political views behind them and revert to policy law; leaving behind their personal moral conflicts and ethics to abide by law and policy. Political philosophers focus on free movement as a human right and aid for those in poverty or serious global inequality. Although there is not a necessary definition for something considered to be morally, ethically, or legally accepted in a society, everyone has an individual connection to what may be considered good for society and what may be considered bad for society. The United States government has placed many strict laws on immigration that it proposes will produce a better immigration system. Other countries, through United Nations consensus, allow a minimum two year system for refugee relocation, with other countries such as Canada and Switzerland operating within a four year system.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Economic considerations ==
According to John Kennan’s (2012) data simulations (collected in multiple countries to simulate the effects of open borders), there would be large economic gains between Mexico and the United States of America through the implementation of open borders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennan|first=John|date=2013|title=Open borders|url=|journal=Review of Economic Dynamics 16|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison|volume=16|pages=1–13|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal economic reasoning advocates for open borders to prevent economic inequality between countries where country A is more efficient than country B due to restrictions on immigration creating production efficiency gaps between the two countries. Labor share data estimates that there would be more economic gains through free migration between countries. These gains are expressed through the economic and labor growth in the country along with economic gain for foreign and resident workers in that country. Economic simulations show that migration lowers the [[Real wages|real wage]] for both countries receiving and sending immigrants; however, the effect of this decrease is based on the goods and services consumed by an individual. According to Kennan “these gains are associated with a relatively small reduction in the real wage in developed countries, and even this effect disappears as the capital–labor ratio adjusts over time.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, the number of workers in both receiving and sending countries would double by the current population of workers.

== Alleged discrimination ==
According to Mirko Bagaric and John Morss (2005), nations discriminate against immigrants through certain immigration policies like the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Naturalization Act]] (INA), the body of law governing current immigration policy, which provides for an annual worldwide limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants, with certain exceptions for close family members.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirko Bagaric and Dr John Morss|first=|date=2005|title=State Sovereignty and Migration Control: The Ultimate Act of Discrimination|url=|journal=J. Migration &amp; Refugee Issues|volume=25|pages=25–50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nations such as: North/South America, Europe and Australia use their power to regulate migration control by selecting individuals and placing them where they may not be able to succeed. “Nation states have the right to determine which people are permitted to enter within their geographical borders.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This causes people to choose places they did not want to go, making them displaced persons. Over the past decade, there have been 12-18 million displaced persons. Countries usually put restrictions on migrants because they could be a security risk. “The most persuasive argument in favour of strict immigration controls is expressed by the view that ‘we made it and own it and don’t want it ruined by others.’”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Some nations discriminate against immigrants wanting to come in because many citizens have a preconceived notion that the ones coming in are criminals who want to abuse government funding. “Unless we radically loosen migration controls we must accept that we are endorsing a racist policy.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Multiple nations spend billions of dollars every year on border security. Many nations do not realize how much immigrants can benefit their nation. They perform tasks that most individuals may not want to do, such as low paying jobs that involve hard labor. Ultimately, immigrants can benefit every nation, if they were given the chance to prove themselves and really show who they are. Free migration means migrants can choose whatever country they wish to go to. If strict migration laws and border security shut people out, then they do not have a chance for a new life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">'''''Historiography and Historiophoty''''' is the name of an essay by historian and literary critic [[Hayden White]] first published in 1988 in ''[[The American Historical Review]]''. In the essay Hayden coins the term '''Historiophoty''' to describe the "representation of history and our thought about it in visual images and filmic discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Hayden|title=Historiography and Historiophoty|journal=The American Historical Review|date=Dec 1988|volume=93|issue=5|page=1193|jstor=1873534|doi=10.2307/1873534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayden says historiophoty "..is in contrast to [[Historiography]] which is the representation of history in verbal images and written discourse,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Hayden|title=Historiography and Historiophoty|journal=The American Historical Review|date=Dec 1988|volume=93|issue=5|page=1193|jstor=1873534|doi=10.2307/1873534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayden originally coined the term as a rhetorical device in response to an essay by [[Robert A. Rosenstone]] in the same issue of ''AHR'' entitled "History in images/History in words: Reflections on the possibility of really putting history onto film". Hayden, for the sake of exploring Rosenstone's premise (that history can be portrayed on film), created the term historiophoty as a description of the study of history through film. White was not necessarily claiming that historiophoty exists, or that it ought to; his essay was a [[thought experiment]] on what historiophoty would be like if in fact such a thing did exist.

Whatever Hayden's intention, since the publication of his 1988 essay the word historiophoty has entered into public and professional discourse. For example Brian Le Beau wrote "Historiography Meets Historiophoty: The Perils and Promise of Rendering the Past on Film" in ''American Studies'' Volume 38, no. 1 (Spring 1997) [http://www.ku.edu/~amerstud/1997.spring.html]. A book has been published titled ''History of Western Historiography, History of England, Historiophoty'' by Chou, Liang-kai.

'''''Hume and the Problem of Causation''''' is a book written by [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[Alexander Rosenberg]], published in 1981 by [[Oxford University Press]]. 

Beauchamp and Rosenberg developed a single interpretation of [[David Hume]]’s view on the nature of [[Causality|causation]] that rests on all of his works, and defended it against historical and contemporary objections. They argued in particular that Hume was not a skeptic about [[inductive reasoning|induction]] but sought to undermine [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] justifications of induction advanced by [[rationalist]] philosophers.

The book is now out of print but available on line at a web site given below.

'''Intelligence-based design''' is the purposeful manipulation of the built-environment to effectively engage humans in an essential manner through complex organized information. Intelligence-Based Theory evidences the conterminous relationship between mind and matter, i.e. the direct neurological evaluations of surface, structure, pattern, texture and form. Intelligence-Based Theory maintains that our sense of well-being is established through neuro-engagement with the physical world at the deepest level common to all people i.e. "Innate Intelligence."

These precursory readings of the physical environment represent an evolved set of information processing skills that the human mind has developed over millennia through direct lived experience. This physiological engagement with the world operates in a more immediate sense than the summary events of applied meaning or intellectual speculation. It is through this direct neurological engagement that humans connect more fully with the world. Many of mankind's early religious associations with physical structures were informed by an intuitive understanding that structure and materials speak to our deeper self, i.e. the human spirit, the soul.  Intelligence Based Theory reveals this effectual dimension of the built-environment and its relationship to human cognitive development, mental acuity, perceptual awareness, spirituality, and sense of well-being. It is within this realm that the mind's eye connects, or fails to connect, with the world outside. The degree of neuro-connectivity which occurs at these intervals serves to render the built-environment either intelligible or un-intelligible. The study and theory of this occurrence is known as "Intelligence-Based Design."

==Antecedents==
Several distinct strands of design thinking, in parallel development, lead towards Intelligence-Based Design. [[Christopher Alexander]] contributed early on to the scientific approach to design, by proposing a theory of design in his book [[Notes on the synthesis of form]]. Those were the years when [[Artificial Intelligence]] was being developed by [[Herbert A. Simon]], and Alexander was part of that movement. His later work [[A Pattern Language]], although written for architects and urbanists, was picked up by the software community and used as a combinatorial and organizational rubric for software complexity, especially [[Design patterns (computer science)]]. Alexander's most recent work [[The Nature of Order]] continues by building up a framework for design that relies upon natural and biological structures. Entirely separate from this, [[E. O. Wilson]] introduced the [[Biophilia hypothesis]] to describe the affinity of humans to other living structures, and to conjecture our innate need for such a connection. This topic was later investigated by Stephen R. Kellert and others, and applied to the design of the artificial environment. The third and independent component of the theory is the recent developments in mobile robotics by [[Rodney Brooks]], where a breakthrough occurred by largely dispensing with internal memory. The practical concept of "Intelligence without representation" otherwise known as the [[Subsumption architecture]] and [[Behavior-based robotics]] introduced by Brooks suggests a parallel with the way human beings interact with, and design their own environment. These notions are brought together in Intelligence-Based Design, which is a topic currently under investigation for design applications in both architecture and urbanism.

'''Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau''' (10 February 1810 – 12 January 1892) was a French [[natural history|biologist]].

== Life ==
He was born at [[Berthézène]], in the [[communes of France|commune]] of [[Valleraugue]] ([[Gard]]), the son of a [[Protestant]] farmer. He studied medicine at [[Strasbourg]] and then Science, where he took the double degree of M.D. and D.Sc., one of his theses being a ''Théorie d'un coup de canon'' (November 1829); next year he published a book, ''Sur les arolithes'', and in 1832 a treatise on ''L'Extraversion de la vessie''. Moving to [[Toulouse]], he practised medicine for a short time, and contributed various memoirs to the local ''Journal de Médecine'' and to the ''Annales des sciences naturelles'' (1834—36). But being unable to continue his research in the provinces, he resigned the chair of [[zoology]] to which he had been appointed, and in 1839 settled in Paris, where he found in [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] a patron and a friend.

Elected professor of natural history at the [[Lycée Henri-IV|Lycée Napoléon]] in 1850, he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1852, and in 1855 was appointed to the chair of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnography]] at the [[Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle]]. Other distinctions followed rapidly, and continued to the end of his otherwise uneventful career, the more important being honorary member of the [[Royal Society of London]] (June 1879), member of the Institute and of the Academie de médecine, and commander of the [[Legion of Honor]] (1881). He died in Paris.

He was an accurate observer and unwearied collector of zoological materials, gifted with remarkable descriptive power, and possessed of a clear, vigorous style, but somewhat deficient in deep philosophic insight. Hence his serious studies on the anatomical characters of the lower and higher organisms, man included, will retain their value, while many of his theories and generalizations, especially in the department of [[ethnology]], are already forgotten.

==Evolution==

Quatrefages was critical of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theories but was not anti-evolution. From 1859 he corresponded with Darwin regularly and although they disagreed with each other they stayed on friendly terms.&lt;ref name="Burkhardt"&gt;Burkhardt, Frederick. (2010). ''Introduction''. In ''The Correspondence of Charles Darwin: Volume 18; Volume 1870''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 21-22. {{ISBN|978-0-521-76889-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quatrefages authored ''Charles Darwin et ses précurseurs francais'' (1870), which contained criticism of [[Darwinism]]. On receiving the book, Darwin in a letter to Quatrefages commented that "many of your strictures are severe enough, but all are given with perfect courtesy &amp; fairness. I can truly say I would rather be criticised by you in this manner than praised by many others."&lt;ref name="Burkhardt"/&gt;

In 1870, Quatrefages and [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] nominated Darwin for election as a corresponding member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in the section of Anatomy and Zoology. This was met with strong opposition from [[Émile Blanchard]], [[Charles-Philippe Robin]] and others. Darwin lost the election by a narrow margin.&lt;ref name="Burkhardt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1988). ''The Comparative Reception of Darwinism''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 147-148. {{ISBN|0-226-29977-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''L'Espèce humaine'' (translated ''The Human Species'', 1879) he disputed the role of [[natural selection]] in evolution. Quatrefages proposed that natural "elimination" would have been a more exact term as natural selection does not create new species.&lt;ref&gt;Quatrefages de Bréau, Armand de. (1879). [https://archive.org/stream/humanspecies01quat#page/94/mode/2up ''The Human Species'']. New York: D. Appleton and Company. pp. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Quatrefages was a strict [[Monogenism|monogenist]] and was an opponent of [[polygenism]].&lt;ref&gt;Delisle, Richard. (2006). ''Debating Humankind's Place in Nature, 1860-2000: The Nature of Paleoanthropology''. pp. 59-60. {{ISBN|978-0131773905}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, David N. (2008). ''Adam's Ancestors: Race, Religion, and the Politics of Human Origins''. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 122-123. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8813-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
{{Wikisource|Author:Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau}}

The work of de Quatrefages ranged over the whole field of [[zoology]] from the [[annelid]]s and other low organisms to the [[Simian|anthropoids]] and man. Of his numerous essays in scientific periodicals, the more important were:
*''Considérations sur les caractères zoologiques des rongeurs'' (1840)
*''De l'organisation des animaux sans vertèbres des Côtes de la Manche'' (Ann. Sc. Nat., 1844)
*''Recherches sur le système nerveux, l'embryognie, les organes des sens, et la circulation des annélides'' (Ibid., 1844–50)
*''Sur les affinités et les analogies des [[Earthworm|lombrics]] et des [[Leech|sangsues]]'' (Ibid.)
*''Sur l'histoire naturelle des tarets'' (Ibid., 1848–49)

Then there is the vast series issued under the general title of ''Etudes sur les types inférieurs de l'embranchement des annelés'', and the results of several scientific expeditions to the Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlands, Italy and [[Sicily]], forming a series of articles in the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'', or embodied in the ''Souvenirs d'un naturaliste'' (2 vols., 1854).

These were followed in quick succession by the:
*''Physiologie comparée, métamorphoses de l'homme et des animaux'' (1862)
*''Les Polynésiens et leurs migrations'' (1866)
*''Histoire naturelle des Annelés marins et d'eau douce'' (2 vols., 1866)

*''La Race prussienne'' (1871)
*''Crania Ethnica'', jointly with Dr Hamy (2 vols., with 100 plates, 1875–82), a classical work based on French and foreign anthropological data, analogous to the ''Crania'' of [[John Thurnam]] and [[Joseph Barnard Davis]], and to [[Samuel George Morton]]'s ''Crania Americana'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca''.

'''Kingsley Hall''' is a community centre, at [[Bromley-by-Bow]] in the [[East End of London]]. It dates back to the work of [[Doris Lester]] and [[Muriel Lester]], who had a nursery school in nearby Bruce Road. Their brother, Kingsley Lester, died aged 26 in 1914, leaving money for work in the local area for "educational, social and recreational" purposes, with which the Lesters bought and converted a disused chapel. The current Hall was built on Powis Road, with a stone-laying ceremony taking place on July 14, 1927. An additional Church and community centre has also been built on Parslows Ave. Dagenham. This also holds the Kingsley Hall name and is undergoing redevelopment.

During the [[General Strike]] of 1926, Kingsley Hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] stayed in Kingsley Hall in 1931 and the building now houses the [[Gandhi Foundation]]. The room where he stayed has been preserved. In 1935, hunger marchers on the [[Jarrow March]] stayed at the Hall.

In 1965 [[R. D. Laing]] and his associates asked the Lesters for permission to use the Hall as an alternative community for treating people affected by mental health crisis. Kingsley Hall became home to one of the most radical experiments in psychology of the time. The aim of the experiment by the [[Philadelphia Association]] was to create a model for non-restraining, non-drug therapies for those people seriously affected by [[schizophrenia]].
The idea of starting this type of community was an initiative suggested by [[Mary Barnes]] a former nurse and first resident as patient.

The hall was designated a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]] in September 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|206183 |accessdate= 9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Hall ==
===Origins===
In 1912, Doris and Muriel Lester started a Nursery School at numbers 58 and 60 Bruce Road. Children were fed, clothed and cared for at a charge of one [[shilling]] (five pence a day). When mothers could not afford fees, children were sponsored by a network of wealthier supporters. The service was soon expanded to include activities for older groups with the aim to provide for the development of the whole person – the mind, body and spirit – in an environment which brought people together regardless of class, race and religion.

Kingsley Lester died in 1914, leaving what money he had for work in Bow towards "educational, social and recreational" purposes. Doris and [[Muriel Lester]] bought an old chapel on the corner of Eagling Road in 1915, which was then re-decorated and fitted out by local volunteers. It was a "people's house", where friends and neighbours, workmen, factory girls and children of Bow came together for "worship, study, fun and friendship". The premises became known as Kingsley Hall, and operated a Nursery, as well as social events, concerts and adult school. Football, Sunday services and summer holiday schemes were also begun.

During [[World War I]], in the face of criticism, Doris and Muriel remained pacifists. Kingsley Hall ran a soup kitchen and stayed open at night for [[Air Raid Warden]]s. At the end of the war, Doris and Muriel joined a march to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] demanding that milk be sent to [[Germany]], where people were starving. A German child was adopted by the members of Kingsley Hall who paid for her to stay with a local family for two years.

After the War, Kingsley Hall maintained strong links with the [[Suffragettes]] in east London. Activists campaigned for votes for women in the face of threats. Muriel Lester spoke on street corners and on Sunday mornings in [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]]. After her talks local people contributed towards maintaining services at Kingsley Hall. Muriel became an [[Alderman]] on the [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar]] and fought for basic provisions such as milk for children under five.

The Lester's father, Henry Lester, was a shipbuilder. He bought a cottage in [[Loughton]], (then a countryside district of [[Essex]]), to be used as a holiday place by families from Bow. Named after his deceased wife, ''Rachel Cottage'' also served to provide holidays for nursery children.

Enough money was saved to build the Children's House on Bruce Road which was opened by [[H.G. Wells]] in 1923. The foundation stones represent: Vision, Nature, Rhythm and Music; Beauty, Health, Education, Motherhood, Internationalism and Fellowship. The ''Children's House'' continues to be run as a Nursery School.

==Powis Road==
During the [[UK General Strike of 1926|1926 General Strike]], the hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Larger accommodations were needed as the popularity of Kingsley Hall grew, and a new Kingsley Hall was built on Powis Road, with funds from people in the neighbourhood and donations from wealthy patrons. The architect was [[Charles Cowles Voysey]].

A Stone-laying ceremony took place on July 14, 1927. The following people laid stones representing different aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingsleyhall.freeuk.com/kingsleyhall.htm The History of Kingsley Hall] URL unavailable 31 July 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsley Hall (on Powis Road) was opened on September 15, 1928. The building included residential units or cells, and also had a clubroom and dining room, kitchen, office and a space of worship. 

===Gandhi===
The new building would receive its most famous visitor just a few years after it opened. In 1931 [[Mahatma Gandhi]] accepted an invitation to stay there while on his visit to England. 
[[File:Gandhi planting a tree.jpg|thumb|Gandhi planting a tree outside Kingsley Hall on December 3, 1931. The tree was destroyed in World War II by a flash and was replanted by Lady Attenborough in 1984.]] In 1931, Lylie Valentine was a participant in activities at the hall before she became a worker at the nursery. In her pamphlet: ''Two Sisters and the Cockney Kids'', she recounts the excitement surrounding Gandhi’s stay in the East End:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The same year (1931), Muriel told us that Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference. He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if he could live with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall....when he arrived, I think all the people in East London waited outside to see him.''
''...besides doing his work with the Government, he spent a lot of time with us. He visited the Nursery School and all the children called him Uncle Gandhi. At six o'clock each morning, after his prayers, he took his walk along the canal, talking to workmen on the way.... There was something about him that always lives with the people.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gandhi lived at Kingsley Hall for 12 weeks. Stories that he was accompanied by a goat however, were pure press invention. Among Gandhi's visitors were [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], the [[Pearly King|Pearly King and Queen]] of east London, many politicians including [[David Lloyd George]] and the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]]. Muriel Lester later accompanied Mahatma Gandhi on his tour of earthquake-shaken regions in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.

===Jarrow March===
In 1935 [[Ellen Wilkinson]] led the [[Jarrow March]] to London, and some of the men were put up at Kingsley Hall. It was the poor helping the poor. They collected their pennies and opened the jumble store for them. Muriel Lester visited the Far East, USA, China, Japan and India to report to the League of Nations on drug investigations in the regions. Muriel Lester retired from full-time work in 1958 and in 1963 she became a ''Freeman of the Borough of Poplar'' on her eightieth birthday. Muriel Lester died in 1967.

===R.D. Laing and Kingsley Hall===

Following World War II, with the welfare state having undertaken much of the work advocated by the Lester sisters, Kingsley Hall continued on a quieter note as a youth hostel and community activity centre.

In 1965 [[R. D. Laing]] and his colleagues asked the Lesters for use of the Hall as a community for themselves and people in a state of psychosis. As a result Kingsley Hall became home to the [[Philadelphia Association]] and one of the most radical experiments in psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphia-association.co.uk/Kingsley-Hall.html The Philadelphia Association: Kingsley Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509060104/http://www.philadelphia-association.co.uk/Kingsley-Hall.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the notion that psychosis, a state of reality akin to living in a waking dream, is not an illness simply to be eliminated through the electric shocks favoured in the Western tradition of the time but, as in other cultures, a state of trance which could even be valued as mystical or Shamanistic, it sought to allow schizophrenic people the space to explore their madness and internal chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laingsociety.org/colloquia/inperson/fhuxley.htm The Liberating Shaman of Kingsley Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; Residents (in the grip of psychosis) were often treated with kindness and respect with sincere efforts to alleviate their suffering.

One notable resident of this experiment was [[Mary Barnes]]. Along with resident psychiatrist [[Joseph Berke]], Mary later went on to write ''Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness'', describing her stay at Kingsley Hall and use of her mental condition as a vehicle for painting and creative expression. Her account became famous in the 1970s when it was used as the basis for the play ''Mary Barnes'' by [[David_Edgar_(playwright)|David Edgar]]. Another notable resident was the renowned Norwegian author [[Axel Jensen]].

The activities of residents in the "no-holds barred" experiment made the local community largely hostile to the project, and there were regular reports of harassment. After five years (from 1965 to 1970) the project was wound up and Kingsley Hall was boarded up. During the seventies it was severely damaged.

==Recent history==

[[Image:Kingsley Hall London E3.jpg|right|thumb|Kingsley Hall]]

In the 1980s Kingsley Hall was one of the sets used in the film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]''. During the filming [[Richard Attenborough]] united with the Kingsley Hall Action Group to raise enough funds to carry out an extensive refurbishing. Many of the local community contributed their skills and commitment to bring Kingsley Hall back into a usable community centre.

Kingsley Hall was reopened 2 March  1985 with events in the week preceding, and has since gone on to be used for activities ranging from youth groups, holiday outings or arts and photography workshops, for advice surgeries, wedding functions and educational projects. It also houses the office of the Gandhi Foundation, which pursues interests of peace internationally, in the tradition of its namesake.

In 1995, The Hall suffered two major burglaries when vandals broke in and burnt down the offices. The committed staff and volunteers were devastated by this destruction, but continued to run youth groups, advice sessions, clubs and meetings. The management interprets its remit as serving the local community and the cause of international peace and to do so in exciting and innovatory ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8966">The '''Levering Act''' was a law enacted by the U.S. state of [[California]] in 1950. It required state employees to subscribe to a [[loyalty oath]] that specifically disavowed radical beliefs. It was aimed in particular at employees of the [[University of California]]. Several teachers lost their positions when they refused to sign loyalty oaths.

Beginning with the onset of the [[Cold War]] in the years following World War II, government officials at all levels of government in the United States feared [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] infiltration that might influence public opinion and frustrate the efforts of the United States to counter Soviet influence. Several laws passed and programs established during the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] administration enhanced the federal government's authority to investigate those suspected of disloyalty and, in particular, to prevent their employment by the federal government. Individual states enacted similar anti-subversion statutes.

In the late 1940s, California state employees were already required to take a general oath indicating support for the Constitutions of California and the U.S., though the requirement did not extend to employees of the quasi-independent University of California. That would require legislation to enhance the state's authority over employees of the state university. Senator [[Jack B. Tenney]], chairman of the legislature's [[Committee on Un-American Activities]], submitted several loyalty oath bills along with a dozen other anti-subversive proposals.&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; In response, [[Robert Gordon Sproul|Robert Sproul]], president of the University of California, decided on his own initiative to forestall legislative action by requiring university employees to take such an oath. It read:&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web | last =Greenberg| first =Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Loyalty Oath at the University of California: A Report on Events, 1949-1958 | work =Free Speech Movement Archive  | publisher =| date =| url =http://www.fsm-a.org/stacks/AP_files/APLoyaltyOath.html | accessdate = March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fight/&gt;
{{quote|I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of my office according to the best of my ability; that I do not believe in, and I am not a member of, nor do I support any party or organization that believes in, advocates, or teaches the overthrow of the United States Government, by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional means, that I am not a member of the Communist Party or under any oath or a party to any agreement or under any commitment that is in conflict with my obligations under this oath.}}
The California Constitution specified that no oath other than the basic statement of loyalty to the state and federal constitutions could be required of state employees. The Levering Act, named for [[Harold K. Levering]], the Republican legislator who drafted it and managed its passage in the course of 1949-50, was designed to remedy that by classifying public employees as civil defense workers and using that as a rationale for requiring the new oath. The Levering Act required all employees of the state of California to take the new anti-radical loyalty oath.&lt;ref name=Cal&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =1950s: The Teachers Union that Came in From the Cold War | work =  | publisher = California Federation of Teachers | date =| url =http://www.cft.org/index.php/component/content/article/42-uncategorized/426-1950s-the-teachers-union-that-came-in-from-the-cold-war.html | accessdate = March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; 

The California State Federation of Teachers said in 1950:&lt;ref name=Cal/&gt;
{{quote|The Levering Oath is in contradiction to the Federal Constitution since it imposes on public workers a political test for employment, deprives them of equal protection under the law as guaranteed in the 14th Amendment, and exposes them through its ambiguity to self-incrimination and perjury.}}

Republican Governor [[Earl Warren]] initially opposed the legislation.&lt;ref name=fight&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Sedgwick W.|title=Fight on California Oath Continues|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1950/6/20/fight-on-california-oath-continues-pon/|accessdate=March 31, 2013|newspaper=Harvard Crimson|date=June 20, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University's Regents fired 31 tenured professors who refused to sign the oath on grounds of academic freedom. Warren decided to support the oath during his 1950 campaign for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Cruickshank | first =Robert | title =Loyalty Oaths are SO 1950s | publisher =Calitics | date =February 29, 2008 | url =http://www.calitics.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=5219 | accessdate =March 30, 2013 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130417082742/http://www.calitics.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=5219 | archivedate =April 17, 2013 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 1952, the California Supreme Court reinstated university teachers who had been fired by the university before the Act's passage for refusing to sign the oath required by the University Regents. The court found that the Regents had exceeded their authority in imposing the oath as a condition of employment. The 18 teachers whose dismissals were at issue needed to take the oath required by the Levering Act in order to be reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calif. Courts Junk Teacher Loyalty Oath|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1952/10/18/calif-courts-junk-teacher-loyalty-oath/|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=Harvard Crimson|date=October 18, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was brought by [[Stanley Alexander Weigel|Stanley Weigel]], a Republican, later member of the national committee of the [[ACLU]] and Kennedy appointment to the federal bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang|title=Judge Stanley Weigel, 93, Dies; Acted to Improve Prisons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/04/us/judge-stanley-weigel-93-dies-acted-to-improve-prisons.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1953, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear an appeal by one of the dismissed teachers, Professor Leonard T. Pockman of San Francisco State College. The order the court issue said that the case involved no substantial federal question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Loyalty Ruling Barred|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/05/26/84604807.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 26, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967, the California Supreme Court ruled in a 6-1 decision that the Levering Act was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=California Loyalty Oath Rules Unconstitutional|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/12/22/88498863.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 22, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suits on the part of individuals went on for years. Albert E. Monroe won some of the benefits he lost upon his 1950 dismissal in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Professor Ordered Rehired in 1950 Loyalty Oath Case|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/01/02/90707514.pdf|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 2, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such oaths have occasionally been a point of controversy. In 2008, a [[Quaker]] teacher was fired by California State University East Bay because she edited her loyalty oath by writing "non-violently" in front of "support and defend [the U.S. and state Constitutions] against all enemies, foreign and domestic." The office of the California Attorney General said that "as a general matter, oaths may be modified to conform with individual values", suggesting that the teacher's modification was acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Asimov| first =Nanette| title =Quaker teacher fired for changing loyalty oath | work =SFGate| publisher = San Francisco Chronicle| date =February 29, 2008| url =http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Quaker-teacher-fired-for-changing-loyalty-oath-3226110.php| format =| doi =| accessdate = March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of peace activists''' includes people who have proactively advocated [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], philosophical, and non-military resolution of major territorial or ideological disputes through [[nonviolent]] means and methods. Peace [[activist]]s usually work with others in the overall [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] and [[peace movement]]s to focus the world's attention on what they perceive to be the irrationality of violent conflicts, decisions, and actions. They thus initiate and facilitate wide public dialogues intended to nonviolently alter long-standing societal agreements directly relating to, and held in place by, the various violent, habitual, and historically fearful thought-processes residing at the core of these conflicts, with the intention of peacefully ending the conflicts themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18023">The '''margin of appreciation''' (or ''margin of state discretion'') is a doctrine with a wide scope in [[international human rights law]]. It was developed by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], to judge whether a state party to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] should be sanctioned for [[Derogation|derogations]]. The doctrine allows the Court to reconcile practical differences in implementing the articles of the Convention. Such differences create a limited right, for Contracting Parties, "to derogate from the obligations laid down in the Convention".&lt;ref&gt;''Application No. 176/56'' (Greece v United Kingdom, "Cyprus"), 2 Yearbook of the European Convention 1958-1959, 174-199 at 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine also reinforces the role of the European Convention, as a supervisory framework for human rights. In applying this discretion, European Court judges must take into account differences between domestic laws of the Contracting States as they relate to substance and procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57584 The Sunday Times ''v United Kingdom'', no. 6538/74, § 61, ECHR 1979 A30.]&lt;/ref&gt; The margin of appreciation doctrine contains concepts that are analogous to the principle of [[Subsidiarity#General principle of European Union law|subsidiarity]], which occurs in the unrelated field of [[European Union law]]. The purpose of the margin of appreciation is to balance individual rights with national interests, as well as resolve any potential conflicts. It has been suggested that the European Court should generally refer back to the State's decision, as they are an international court instead of a bill of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023]|title=Roffee, J. A. (2014). No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and origins==
The phrase ''margin of appreciation'' is a literal translation of the French "marge d'appréciation". The latter phrase refers to a notion of administrative law that was developed by the [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'Etat]], but equivalent concepts have also emerged in every other civil jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|reason=Claim requires support and examples|date=June 2017}} At the level of the European Convention on Human Rights, a margin of appreciation refers to some "latitude of deference or error which the Strasbourg organs will allow to national legislative, executive, administrative and judicial bodies".&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Yourow, ''The Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the Dynamics of European Human Rights Jurisprudence'' (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1996) at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an intermediary norm in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. It allows for some compromise between the aspirations of the Convention and the circumstances faced by a Contracting Party. This doctrine of ''administrative'' discretion first gained national levels of prominence, most notably under the German ''[[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]]'' (or Supreme Administrative Court), before it was translated into a doctrine of ''supervisory'' discretion for a regional context.

The concept of a margin of appreciation at the European level emerged through questions surrounding martial law. It was introduced to European Convention jurisprudence in 1956. This occurred through an opinion of the [[European Commission of Human Rights]]{{mdash}}in a ''Cyprus'' case{{mdash}}to permit the United Kingdom, under [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 15 - derogations|Article 15]], to derogate from its obligations in a time of public emergency.&lt;ref&gt;P. van Dijk, et al. (ed.s) ''Theory and Practice of the European Convention on Human Rights (Fourth Edition)'' (Intersentia, Antwerpen, 2006) at 1055-1056.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the hearing for ''[[Lawless v Ireland]]'' (that is, the first formally decided case of the Court) included an oral argument from the Commission President [[Humphrey Waldock|Sir Humphrey Waldock]] that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57518 ''Lawless v Ireland'', no. 332/57, ECHR 1961 A3] (N.B. verbatim record of the hearing on 8 April). Cited in J. Christoffersen, ''Fair Balance: Proportionality, Subsidiarity and Primarity in the European Convention on Human Rights'' (Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009) at 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | "...a Government's discharge of...responsibilities [in maintaining law and order] is essentially a delicate problem of appreciating complex factors and of balancing conflicting considerations of the public interest; and that, once the...Court is satisfied that the Government's appreciation is at least on the margin of powers..., then the interest which the public itself has in effective Government and in the maintenance of order justifies and requires a decision in favour of the legality of the Government's appreciation."}}

Later, the "[[Belgian Linguistic Case (No. 2)]]" of 1968 introduced a margin of appreciation to circumstances that fell outside emergency situations that were identified by Article 15 of the European Convention. This case proved to be critical in establishing a wide scope for the emerging doctrine of discretion. It identified two key elements for establishing a margin of appreciation: a focused consensus standard among 'Convention signatory states', as well as a proportionality principle in the jurisprudence of the European Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Yourow (1996), above n 6, at 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter element consisted of two weighting factors, which are necessary to establish the extent of a particular margin. These factors are the 'nature of the right' in question, as well as 'the aim pursued by the contested measure'.&lt;ref&gt;P. Alston and R. Goodman, ''International Human Rights: Text and Materials (the Successor to International Human Rights in Context)'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013) at 946.&lt;/ref&gt; With an expansive doctrine in view, the European Court also sought to constrain itself by stating that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57525 ''Case Relating to Certain Aspects of the Laws on the Use of Languages in Education in Belgium'' ("Belgian Linguistic Case") (No. 2), no. 1474/62, 1677/62, 1691/62, 1769/63, 1994/63, 2126/64, §10, ECHR 1968 A6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | '...the Court cannot disregard those legal and factual features which characterize the life of the society in the State which...has to answer for the measure in dispute. In so doing, it cannot assume the role of the competent national authorities, for it would thereby lose sight of the subsidiary nature of the international machinery of collective enforcement established for the Convention.'}}

The margin of appreciation doctrine received considerable development in 1976, with the Court decision of ''[[Handyside v United Kingdom]]''. This concerned the publication of a Danish textbook for primary school children, in which sexual behaviour was discussed using explicit terms. It was successfully published in several signatory states, but was met with controversy in the United Kingdom. Handyside, an English publisher, was convicted for violating domestic laws on obscene publications. The case that was brought before the European Court challenged whether the United Kingdom could infringe freedom of expression, under [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 10 - expression|Article 10]], on the ground of protecting moral norms. The fact that the "Little Red Schoolbook" had been received in other European countries formed a basis for this challenge. However, the Court permitted the imposed limitation on freedom of expression and found no violation of the Convention. It held that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57499 ''Handyside v United Kingdom'', no. 5493/72, §48, ECHR 1976 A24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | '...it is not possible to find in the domestic law of the Contracting States a uniform conception of morals. The view taken by their respective laws...varies from time to time and from place to place...By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements as well as on the "necessity" of a "restriction" or "penalty" intended to meet them.'}}

With this judgment, the European Court reinforced its distinction between the supervisory jurisdiction of the Convention framework and domestic forms of discretion. However, it also affirmed that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57499 ''Ibid.'', §49.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | 'The Court...is empowered to give a final ruling on whether a "restriction" or "penalty" is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The domestic margin of appreciation thus goes hand in hand with a European supervision.'}}

In the case of Z v. Finland,{{cn|date=November 2018}} while accepting that individual interests could sometimes be outweighed by the public interest in the investigation and prosecution of crime, the Court emphasized the fundamental importance of protecting the confidentiality of medical data, for the sake of personal privacy and to preserve confidence in the medical profession and health services. It found that that measures including the disclosure of the applicant's medical records without her consent in the course of criminal proceedings against her husband amounted to a violation of Article 8.

==Scope and application==

The European Court decision in ''Handyside v United Kingdom'' framed the margin of appreciation doctrine in terms of a systemic tension in the European Convention framework. It is therefore easy to distort the concept, in a negative sense, 'to circumvent the express requirements of the Convention'.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Feingold, "The Doctrine of Margin of Appreciation and the European Convention on Human Rights" (1977-1978) 53 Notre Dame Law 90 at 105.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the official position of the Court is that a margin of appreciation must be derived from 'a just balance between the protection of the general interest of the community and the respect due to fundamental human rights while attaching particular importance to the latter.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57525 "Belgian Linguistic Case" (No. 2), above n 6, §5.]&lt;/ref&gt; This precedent illustrates some continuity between the original function of a margin of appreciation{{mdash}}as a justified derogation ''simpliciter''{{mdash}}and its present purpose of delimiting rights and freedoms for individuals in relation to state parties. Yet a clear distinction has also been made between this latter ''substantive'' purpose, which evolved over time, as well as the ''structural'' aim of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;G. Letsas, "Two Concepts of the Margin of Appreciation", ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'', 26 (2006) 4, 705-732.&lt;/ref&gt; The structural purpose for a margin of appreciation was to construct 'a geographically and cultural plural notion of implementation'.&lt;ref&gt;F. Mégret, 'Nature of Obligations'; in D. Moeckli et al., ''International Human Rights Law (Second Edition)'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014) at 104.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, the doctrine has continued to subsist in an unstructured set of elements. This is possible, because the foundation concept of a margin is essentially abstract in nature and less connected to the core purposes of the Convention{{mdash}}especially when it is compared with other interpretive principles, such as legality or the effective protection of rights.&lt;ref&gt;S. Greer, ''The European Convention on Human Rights: Achievements, Problems and Prospects'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2006) at 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

As justification for any derogation from the European Convention ultimately rests on the concept of ''democratic necessity'' in a society, margins of appreciation are situation-oriented and the case law regarding this subject frequently lacks consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Arai, "The System of Restrictions"; in P. van Dijk, et al., above n 4, at 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The expanded margin of appreciation doctrine has been used to interpret European Convention guarantees regarding due process (that is, Articles [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights|5]] and [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|6]]) and personal freedoms (that is, [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 8 - privacy|Articles 8-11]]). This infused the doctrine with a sense of ubiquity and has led to its invocation in major legal developments, including challenges surrounding [[discrimination]] as they relate to human rights.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Dudgeon v United Kingdom]]'', [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57473 no. 7525/76, ECHR 1981 A45]; [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-58922 ''ADT v United Kingdom'', no. 35765/97, ECHR 2000-IX]; and, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-60596 ''Goodwin v United Kingdom'', no. 28957/95, ECHR 2002-VI].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the doctrine has also been invoked in such varied questions as the enjoyment of possessions,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-105575 ''Stummer v Austria'', no. 37452/02, ECHR 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; the use of religious symbols &lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-104040 ''Lautsi v Italy'', no. 30814/06, ECHR 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the implementation of environmental policies and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-109072 ''Hardy &amp; Maile v United Kingdom'', no. 31965/07, ECHR 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; The margin of appreciation in each of these categories of cases has differed according to the kind of right in question; for example, where private individuals are more directly involved, less discretion is typically permitted to the discretion of state parties.&lt;ref&gt;R.K.M. Smith, ''Textbook on International Human Rights{{mdash}}Sixth Edition'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014) at 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, this criterion comes under just one of the three criteria{{mdash}}that is, the nature of the right, the aims pursued, as well as the presence or absence of a European consensus{{mdash}}that are used to determine the scope of any given margin. As the European Court decided in ''Dickson v United Kingdom'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-83788 ''Dickson v United Kingdom'', no. 44362/04, §78, ECHR 2007-V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation | 'Where, however, there is no consensus within the Member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to how best to protect it, the margin will be wider. This is particularly so where the case raises complex issues and choices of social strategy...There will also usually be a wide margin accorded if the State is required to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or Convention rights.'}}

The margin of appreciation doctrine has gained sufficient prominence, under an emerging principle of subsidiarity, to merit impending incorporation into the Preamble of the European Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/213.htm Protocol No. 15 amending the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (yet to be signed by all High Contracting Parties).]&lt;/ref&gt; This formal acknowledgment indicates awareness, on the part of the [[Council of Europe]], that the evolution of the Convention must include jurisprudence that justifies the application of this doctrine in so many different issues. The margin of appreciation doctrine may also expand further throughout international law. This is because its underlying concept of a derogation being "necessary in a democratic society"{{mdash}}as it is provided for in the European Convention&lt;ref&gt;See Articles [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|8(2)]], [[Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights|9(2)]], [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|10(2)]] and [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights|11(2)]]. The treatment of these provisions has relevance, in an international context, to instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights{{mdash}}B.B. Lockwood, Jr., et al., "Working Paper for the Committee of Experts on Limitation Provisions", ''Human Rights Quarterly'' (1985) 7 Hum Rts Q 35 at 50&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}also resonates with other international human rights regimes.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Human Rights Committee view in [http://www.bayefsky.com/docs.php/area/jurisprudence/node/4/filename/101_finland14_61 Hertzberg et al. v Finland] to grant 'a certain margin of discretion' to 'responsible national authorities', under the [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPCCPR1.aspx Optional Protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)] (para. 2.5).&lt;/ref&gt; Although many regimes remain formally ambivalent (or even negative) towards margins of appreciation, the growing influence of Convention law on international norms is, in turn, making the doctrine more attractive to the global community.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Shany, "Toward a General Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in International Law?", ''The European Journal of International Law'' (2006) 16 EJIL 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in an online music scene who rearrange spliced parts of musical pieces form '''mashup culture'''. The audio-files are normally in [[MP3]] format and spliced with audio-editing software online. The new, edited song is called mashup.&lt;ref name=Shiga&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shiga |first=J. |last2= |first2= |date=2007 |title=Copy-and-Persist: The Logic of Mash-Up Culture. |url=https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/courses/2011/488/1-Readings/Shiga%20Logic%20of%20Mash-up%20culture.pdf |journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication |publisher= |volume= 24|issue= 2|pages= 93–114|doi=10.1080/07393180701262685 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression mashup culture is also strongly connected to [[Mashup (music)|mashup in music]]. Even though it is originally not a political community, the producer of mash-up music are related to the issue of [[copyright]]. Mashup Culture is even regarded as "a response to larger technological, institutional, and social contexts".&lt;ref name=Serazio&gt;{{cite journal |last=Serazio|first=Michael  |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=The Apolitical Irony of Generation Mash-Up: A Cultural Case Study in Popular Music |url=http://mediaediting.wikispaces.asu.edu/file/view/28552270.pdf |journal=Popular Music and Society |publisher= |volume= 31|issue= 1|pages= |doi=10.1080/03007760701214815 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of mashup culture in general can be dated back to the beginnings of [[dada]] and [[conceptual art]]. Artists such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] were the first to introduce already existing objects, which they rearranged and combined in [[collage]]s, to the world of higher art.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/22/from-artistic-to-technological-mash-up/ |title=Temixing Culture And Why The Art Of The Mash-Up Matters |last1=Murray |first1=Ben. |last2= |first2= |date= 22 March 2015|website=Tech Crunch |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These artists believed that even though certain [[cultural artifact|artifacts]] were ascribed a certain meaning, this meaning could be altered through rearranging them and putting them into a new context. However, it was still quite a long way to the beginning of mashup culture in music. From the early 2000s on, music was more and more distributed through the internet. With the introduction of MP3 audio files, it became much easier to access and download music. Not only could music be accessed easier, it could also be transformed and mixed in ways that were not possible before. Especially for younger people, this new gained freedom when it came to the accessibility of [[audio file format|audio files]] lead to the development of a new form of cult around the transformation of musical pieces.&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt; This "reworking MP3 recordings pulled from the Internet" was turning into more than just a fashion just as "the Internet is more than just a means of distribution, it becomes a ''raison d’eˆtre'' for a culture based on audio data’’ states Alistair Riddell in 2001.&lt;ref name=Riddell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riddell|first=Michael  |last2=Alistair  |first2= |date=2001|title=Data Culture Generation. After Content, Process as Aesthetic |url=http://www.rem.ufpr.br/_REM/REMv6/Riddell/Riddell.htm |journal=Leonardo |publisher= |volume= 34|issue= 4|pages=337–343 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, the first versions of mashup music were published, sometimes not under the term ''mashup'' but under the name of "[[bootleg recording|creative bootleg]]" or "[[bastard pop]]".&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt;&lt;ref name=Serazio /&gt; Even though the creation of a new song by combining at least two samples of different songs was also used in other music styles such as [[Hip Hop]] before,&lt;ref name=Serazio /&gt; it was only with the rise of the MP3 audio file along with easy-to-use computer mash-up programs that mash-up was transformed into an own culture as such. Especially [[peer-to-peer]] sharing was contributing to this phenomenon: People who create mashup music can easily distribute it and share it with other people through online programs.&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt;

== Forms of mashup culture ==

Mashup culture is motivated by a number of different factors.

=== Statement of art ===
Mashup culture is sometimes regarded as a cultural movement against common, existing music that is published by the music industry. In 2002, a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article described the mashup of songs as a strategy of Londoner [[disc jockey|DJs]] to transform music they considered bad into something they could appreciate and were willing to listen to.&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt; Even though mashup culture has its origin in online communities, it entered a more art-related realm. It is art used as a statement against the content music industry provides.&lt;ref name=Serazio /&gt;

=== Political statement ===
It can even be considered as a political statement against copyright laws and restrictions imposed by the [[government]] as well. "Reframing of the original narrative" is regarded as a way to create a new and unique product which leads to a "fresh perspective" of the original.&lt;ref name=Murray /&gt;
Murray states "there’s the question of the kind of Internet we want moving forward – one increasingly controlled by corporate [[gatekeepers]] who get to sanction what creative expression looks like, or one in which the freedom of this expression is valued above share price". Copyright issues have always been limiting the possibilities of mashup culture. Those implications by law have led to the problem of [[copyright infringement|online piracy]].&lt;ref name=Shiga /&gt; Mashups are often created with illegally acquired content. This closeness to illegality has become part of this culture. "In some cases, the illegality of piracy contributes to the appeal of unauthorized copies online" states Shiga in her article [https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/courses/2011/488/1-Readings/Shiga%20Logic%20of%20Mash-up%20culture.pdf Copy-and-Persist: The Logic of Mash-Up Culture]. Even though copyright laws were intentionally supposed to stop illegal downloads, they contributed to the appeal of mashup and to the culture existing around it.

=== Do-it-yourself culture ===
Another important aspect of the success of mashup culture nowadays lies in the [[do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] or DIY trend. Consumers are turning into producers as well, especially due to the simplification of online tools that help creating personalized content.

{{cquote|The audience is taking on a DIY spirit, each masher becoming a mini-Burroughs, cutting the music and pasting it on a blank sheet of MP3|author=Serazio&lt;ref name=Serazio /&gt;}}

== Mashup in current literature ==

=== DJ Spooky ===

Paul D. Miller, also known as [[DJ Spooky]], published a book about how mashup culture transforms our society. In ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'', he investigates "the nature of that transformation" stating that "rapid advances in technology [that] have transformed art and communication".&lt;ref name=Weidenbaum&gt;Weidenbaum 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He describes [[sample (music)|sampling]] as an essential part of our society. The book was published by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Press and highly recognized by scholars such as [[Lawrence Lessig]].&lt;ref name=Weidenbaum /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22140">{{distinguish|Universalism|Universalization}}

The general concept or principle of moral universalizability is that moral principles, maxims, norms, facts, predicates, rules, etc., are universally true; that is, the basis of their being true in any particular case can in some sense be applied to all cases (to all other persons, actions, etc.) Some philosophers, like Immanuel Kant, Richard Hare, and Alan Gewirth, have argued that moral universalizability is the foundation of all moral facts. Others have argued that moral universalizability is a necessary, but not a sufficient, test of morality. A few philosophers have also argued that morality is not constrained by universalizability at all.

== Two Moral Universalization Conditions ==

The general concept can be distinguished into two main versions, which can be called ''universal applicability'' and ''universal practice''.&lt;ref&gt;Forschler, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Any particular universalizability test requires that some criterion be satisfied within this universalizability condition. A universalization condition combined with a specific satisfaction criterion constitutes a universalizability test. The two versions can be modelled in formal logic as:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
  | Universal Applicability (UA):
  | □(x)'''C'''Mx
|-
  | Universal Practice (UP):
  | □'''C'''(x)Mx
|}

where '''C''' is a modal operating meaning "criterion C is satisfied by..." and Mx means "an agent/action follows principle (or maxim) M". For a strong universalizability test, satisfying this formula makes M permissible; for a weak universalizability test (or universalizability principle), satisfying this formula is necessary for M to be permissible, but may not be sufficient. Both are universalization conditions in virtue of having a universal quantifier, (x), but the role of each is different.

In a UA test, M is only permissible if the criterion C is satisfied for each possible individual, in any possible situation or world if she follows (or were to follow) the principle M. In particular, C must be satisfied anytime an individual does M even if other agents do not do M. That is, the requirement that M must satisfy C is universally applicable to each possible person's behavior, considered individually.

For a UP test, however, whether C is satisfied when not all persons are doing M is irrelevant; it is only required that C be satisfied whenever it is the case that everyone does M: that is, when M is universally practiced.

== Satisfaction Criteria within the Universalization Conditions ==

In addition to using different universalization conditions, universalizability tests use a variety of different satisfaction criteria. For example, [[Consequentialism|consequentialists]] typically use criteria like "produces at least as much good as any alternative would" or "has at least as much expected value as any alternative." These tend to be aggregative, allowing the addition of value across different agents. Deontologists tend to use non-aggregative criteria like "is not impossible" (Kant's contradiction in conception test), "would make the satisfaction of your ends impossible" (Kant's contradiction in will test), "would disrespect humanity in yourself or another" (Kant's formula of humanity), or "would be reasonable to reject" (Scanlon's contractualist test).

== Universal Applicability ==

In this condition, a moral predicate (like obligatory, permissible, forbidden, etc.) always applies to a given behavior in virtue of some reason, and whenever the same reason is present, the same predicate applies.

=== Moral Supervenience ===

According to the principle of [[moral supervenience]], moral properties of actions (obligatory, permissible, forbidden, etc.) supervene on--that is, depend upon or are functions of--non-moral properties. The principle itself does not specify which moral properties these are, so it does not constitute a universalizability test. However it is often considered a necessary feature of any moral truth, and hence is often thought to rule out certain general theories of morality (see [[meta-ethics]]), even if it cannot forbid many particular actions.

=== In Act Consequentialism ===

In a series of books, R.M. Hare (who introduced the term into philosophical literature&lt;ref&gt;Hare 1981, pp.80-81&lt;/ref&gt;) made moral supervenience the basis of his derivation of a version of [[utilitarianism]], but this was actually a universal applicability condition combined with the criterion that the universalized behavior would not produce a greater balance of satisfied over frustrated preferences of all affected agents (including animal agents as well as persons) than any alternative behavior would.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Consequentialism|act consequentialists]] also use versions of this argument, often expressing this in terms of the golden rule or the universality of reasons, where this is described as a universal applicability condition.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 1903, pp.97-98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, 1928, pp.110, 140, 334-339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1981, pp.229-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1993, pp.11-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummiskey, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.S. Mill]] was also an act consequentialist, using the universal applicability condition and rejecting the universal practice condition as part of any fundamental moral principle, although he thought that the results of everyone's acting the same way was a useful guide for determining when an individual act was likely to produce good consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, 1972, p.1881&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Colloquial Moral Thought ===

The universal applicability condition is also embodied in the colloquial question, "How would you like it if somebody else did that to you?" Here, the presumption is that the behavior in question causes some harm or offense to other people, even though it may benefit or please the person performing it. When the person reflects upon how someone else's performance of the same behavior might harm herself, she finds she cannot approve of this, which suggests that if she is consistent she should also disapprove of herself doing it, judging it morally wrong. The question is imprecise in that it does not specify exactly what effects of the behavior would be grounds for considering it impermissible, and therefore, like the principle of moral supervenience, does not specify a complete universalizability test. Likewise, the phrase "What's good (or: is sauce) for the goose is good (sauce) for the gander," suggesting that minor, irrelevant differences do not affect the permissibility of some behavior, so if it is permissible for one person (the "goose") then it is also permissible for any very similar person (a "gander")-with the implication that if someone rejects the second judgment, they must either explain why the different between the two cases is morally relevant, or retract their judgment of the first case.

=== In Alan Gewirth ===

Alan Gewirth uses a universal applicability condition in his "principle of generic consistency,"&lt;ref&gt;Gewirth, 1978, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;, who added to it the criterion that the effects of anyone's actions may not deny to any other person the necessary conditions of their successful agency, most notably including "freedom and well-being."&lt;ref&gt;Gewirth, 1978, pp.63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Kantian Ethics ===

The 18th-century [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s second formulation of a [[categorical imperative]] or fundamental moral principle, the formula of humanity as an end in itself, uses a UA condition. It requires all persons to always respect humanity in oneself or another as an end in itself. ''Always'' presumably means: in any possible situation, and hence implicitly invokes a UA condition: even if some instance of a behavior is not disrespectful, if some possible instance of it would be disrespectful, then we must follow a principle of avoiding it in the latter type of case.

== Universal Practice ==

In this condition, a behavior if permissible if and only if its universal practice by all persons necessarily satisfies some criterion. An imagined world in which everyone in it conform to the same kind of behavior is often called an "ideal world," and so moral or political theories appealing to it are sometimes called "ideal theories" as opposed to "non-ideal theories." This should not be taken to mean that the former theories are themselves more ideal or better than the latter by definition; the ideality in question refers to the worlds the theories describe, are based on, or intended to apply to, not necessarily to how well they describe moral facts and obligations in the actual world, which is much disputed.

=== General Problems of Universal Practice Tests ===

For many behaviors, universalizability tests using the same satisfaction criteria but different universalization conditions will reach the same conclusion. For instance, if every person's M-ing causes the same amount of harm and good as anyone else's, no matter what anyone else does, then the total effect of everyone's M-ing will be the effect of one person's M-ing multiplied by the number of persons; if the criterion is that the effect cause no more harm than good, then the same behaviors will satisfy or fail this criterion under either universalization condition we use. However some behaviors cause different amounts of harm depending upon how many other people are performing them. For these behaviors, universal practice tests generally give counter-intuitive, and often quite harmful recommendations, for cases in which not everyone else is doing the same thing we are doing. This occurs in two general kinds of cases: responding to evil-doers, and solving coordination problems. Together they are typically called "partial compliance" problems, because they deal with the question of what would be a morally-correct response to a situation where other persons are not doing the same thing you are doing (or considering doing).

The first is illustrated by a disposition to complete pacifism. In any world where everyone is pacifistic, little harm is done, so it passes most universal practice tests. But in a realistic world containing many non-pacifists, an individual's commitment to complete pacifism is likely to not only make him a victim of evil-doers, but unable to defend innocent third parties from the latter, resulting in much greater harm than a more complex conditional disposition, like "be pacifist only if all others are pacifistic, but defend yourself and others from aggression if necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, 1965, pp.38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, 1970-71, p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is exemplified by the need to choose which side of the road to drive on. A rule of always driving on the left passes most universal practice tests. It follows that such tests permit such behavior--even if not everyone else has chosen this option. Of course, the rule of always driving on the right, as well as the more intuitively plausible rule of driving on whatever side conforms to local custom or law, also passes such tests. So while such tests permit such intuitively plausible rules, they also permit some which will lead to catastrophe in a world where not everyone has picked the same permissible rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbard, 1965, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 1985, pp.253-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, 1988, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, like the rule of absolute pacifism, such a rule will typically pass a universal practice test, but fails a universal applicability test, because while everyone's following the rule is not harmful, its practice by some persons ''while some other people are not doing so'' does produce significant harm. Any behavior condemned by a universal practice test will also be condemned by a universal approval test using the same satisfaction criteria, so the latter is always at least as strong as the former.

A variety of proposals have been made to try to rescue universal practice tests from these implications, but none have been universally considered successful.

=== In Colloquial Moral Thought ===

The UP condition is expressed by the colloquial question "What if everybody did that?" Like the colloquial "somebody" question above, it leaves unstated precisely what result of everyone's performance of the behavior would make this result unacceptable and hence make the behavior wrong. 

=== In Kantian Ethics ===

Immanuel Kant's first formulation of the categorical imperative, the "Formula of Universal Law," as well as his third "Kingdom of Ends" formulation, also use a universal practice condition.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1785&lt;/ref&gt; The first formula states that the only morally acceptable [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxims]] of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to practiced as a universal law, or in a variant "Law of Nature" formulation, one whose practice by all persons we could will to have been a law of nature (and hence necessarily governing the behavior of all persons throughout all time and space).&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1785, 4:421&lt;/ref&gt; Kant appealed to two criteria which must be satisfied under such a condition: first, the universalization must be conceivable, and second that this universalization will not necessarily frustrate the ends of any agent practicing the maxim (and hence such an agent can both will his own practice of the maxim, and its practice by all other agents).&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1784, 4:424&lt;/ref&gt; The first is violated by maxims, e.g., of always lying or making false promises, for if (''per impossibile'') everyone did the same thing, no one would even consider any form of words given by another to count as a statement or promise, so it would be impossible to even try to make such statements with the intent to deceive.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1785, 4:422&lt;/ref&gt; The second is violated by maxims, e.g, of never helping another person in need, for while we could imagine a world in which no one gave such help to anyone else, no agent could possibly want others to treat him that way, for there are bound to be occasions which the lack of such help will inevitably result in the frustration of the first person's ends-which, by hypothesis, he wills to satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, 1785, 4:423&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant called the first kind of violation a contradiction in conception, the second a contradiction in will. Like Gewirth's idea of frustrating the necessary conditions of agency, they involve a [[performative contradiction]], because the practice of the maxim by others would undermine one's own attempt to practice it, and willing the former (even when this does not cause others to practice it) is tantamount to willing the frustration of one's own agency. However Kant's Formula of Universal Law only identifies these contradictions in cases where the maxim is universally practiced; for Gewirth they can also occur in cases where some (but not all) persons' performing the behavior would deprive you of the necessary condition of agency.

Defenders of Kant's ethics have often appealed to his second version of the categorical imperative, the formula of humanity, in order to successfully deal with problems involving evil-doers and coordination problems. As noted above, this formula can successfully do so because it involves a universal applicability condition, and hence is sensitive to the harm done by various maxims in non-ideal conditions even if their universal practice is harmless.

=== In Rule Consequentialism ===

Another moral theory using a universal practice test is [[rule consequentialism]], or more precisely that version of it sometimes called ''ideal rule consequentialism'', where a moral rule is permissible if and only if its practice by all persons would produce at least as much of a balance of good over bad results than the universal practice of any other rule would. This theory was first expounded by Jurist John Austin &lt;ref&gt;Austin, 1885, book I, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;, and defended at greater length by R.F. Harrod in 1936, on the grounds that some behaviors cause ''more'' harm when everyone (or almost everyone) else is doing the same thing than in the more common case where not everyone else is doing so; since the harm can get so very bad in such cases, he argued that we should use its effects in this universal practice case to condemn the same behavior even when almost no one else is doing it, and even when it actually causes little or no harm in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;Harrod, 1936, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated this with Kant's example of telling a lie, arguing that the practice of lying by many individual people may actually only be modestly harmful, and in some cases may produce more good than the truth, as long as enough truth-tellers are still around to provide a moral example and give us some confidence that we will usually be told the truth (and be believed when we speak); but if everyone lies, then communication becomes impossible, a devastating effect which Harrod thought justified our condemnation of lying even in the normal case where it may cause little or no harm.

This view has been much criticized, however, on the grounds that it involves "rule-worship" which forbids us from performing such behaviors precisely when they are harmless or even beneficial, just because they would be less beneficial in circumstances which we know we are not in, and that an adequate response (justified by a UA test) is to follow the slightly more but not unmanageable complex rule of usually telling the truth, but lying just when doing so will definitely produce more good than telling the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, 1973, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Considerations of the aforementioned need to handle evil-doers has also motivated some defenders of ideal rule consequentialism to suggest modified versions which permit only rules which produce at least as great a balance of good over bad results when 90% (or some other fraction) of any given population practice it, which requires us to follow rules which contain provisions for how to respond to the 10% (criminals, etc.) who may be violating the rules in question.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Such proposals have in turn been criticized as a 90% practice level is just as arbitrary as a 100% practice level for the test condition, which can be avoided by appealing to a "variable-rate" test condition where the rule must be optimal regardless of the fraction of the population following it.&lt;ref&gt;Ridge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobia, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals in effect abandon the universal practice condition for the universal applicability condition.

=== In Other Moral Theories ===

Other versions of a universal practice test are found in M.G. Singer's "generalization argument,"&lt;ref&gt;Singer, M.G., 1961, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;, J. Habermas's "principle U,"&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, 1990, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; and T.M. Scanlon's "contractualism."&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, 1998, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; These have each in turn been occasionally criticized for their inability to handle non-ideal cases

{{Rights |Distinctions}}
'''Natural and legal rights''' are two types of [[rights]]. Natural rights are those that are not dependent on the laws or customs of any particular culture or government, and so are universal and [[alienation (property law)|inalienable]] (they cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws). Legal rights are those bestowed onto a person by a given [[legal system]] (they can be modified, repealed, and restrained by human laws).

The concept of [[natural law]] is related to the concept of natural rights. Natural law first appeared in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Rommen, Heinrich A., ''The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social Philosophy'' trans. Thomas R. Hanley, O.S.B., Ph.D. (B. Herder Book Co., 1947 [reprinted 1959] ), p.. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to by [[Roman philosopher]] [[Cicero]]. It was subsequently alluded to in the [[Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|2:14–15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then developed in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Catholic philosopher]]s such as [[Albert the Great]] and his pupil [[Thomas Aquinas]]. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the concept of natural laws was used to challenge the [[divine right of kings]], and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a [[social contract]], [[positive law]], and [[government]] – and thus legal rights – in the form of [[classical republicanism]]. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.

The idea of [[human rights]] is also closely related to that of natural rights: some acknowledge no difference between the two, regarding them as synonymous, while others choose to keep the terms separate to eliminate association with some features traditionally associated with natural rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Peter. ''Rights''. Palgrave Macmillan, 1994, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural rights, in particular, are considered beyond the authority of any government or [[Intergovernmental organizations|international body]] to dismiss. The 1948 [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is an important [[legal instrument]] enshrining one conception of natural rights into international [[soft law]]. Natural rights were traditionally viewed as exclusively [[negative rights]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, the imperative "not to harm others" is said to be justified by natural law, but the same is not true when it comes to providing protection against harm&lt;/ref&gt; whereas human rights also comprise positive rights.&lt;ref&gt;See James Nickel, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-human/ Human Rights], 2010. The claim that "..all human rights are negative rights.." is rejected, therefore human rights also comprise positive rights.&lt;/ref&gt; Even on a natural rights conception of human rights, the two terms may not be synonymous.

The proposition that [[Animal rights|animals have natural rights]] is one that gained the interest of philosophers and legal scholars in the 20th century and into the 21st.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007642/animal-rights "Animal Rights"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007; Dershowitz, Alan. ''Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights'', 2004, pp. 198–99; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-257091/animal-rights "Animal Rights: The Modern Animal Rights Movement"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea that certain rights are natural or inalienable also has a history dating back at least to the [[Stoics]] of [[late Antiquity]] and [[Thomism|Catholic law]] of the early [[Middle Ages]], and descending through the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] to today.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The existence of natural rights has been asserted by different individuals on different premises, such as ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' philosophical reasoning or religious principles. For example, [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed to derive natural rights through reason alone. The United States Declaration of Independence, meanwhile, is based upon the "[[self-evident]]" truth that "all men are … endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights".&lt;ref name="us-doi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html |title=America's Founding Documents &amp;#124; National Archives |website=Archives.gov |date=2016-10-12 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, different philosophers and statesmen have designed different lists of what they believe to be natural rights; almost all include the right to [[life]] and [[liberty]] as the two highest priorities. [[H. L. A. Hart]] argued that if there are any rights at all, there must be the right to liberty, for all the others would depend upon this. [[T. H. Green]] argued that “if there are such things as rights at all, then, there must be a right to life and liberty, or, to put it more properly to free life.”&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation'', T. H. Green, 1883, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] emphasized "life, liberty and property" as primary. However, despite Locke's influential defense of the [[right of revolution]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] substituted "pursuit of happiness" in place of "property" in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

===Ancient===
[[Stephen Kinzer]], a veteran journalist for ''The New York Times'' and the author of the book ''All The Shah's Men'', writes in the latter that:

{{quote|The Zoroastrian religion taught Iranians that citizens have an inalienable right to enlightened leadership and that the duty of subjects is not simply to obey wise kings but also to rise up against those who are wicked. Leaders are seen as representative of God on earth, but they deserve allegiance only as long as they have ''farr'', a kind of divine blessing that they must earn by moral behavior.}}

The [[Stoics]] held that no one was a slave by nature; slavery was an external condition juxtaposed to the internal freedom of the soul (''sui juris''). [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote:

{{quote|It is a mistake to imagine that slavery pervades a man's whole being; the better part of him is exempt from it: the body indeed is subjected and in the power of a master, but the mind is independent, and indeed is so free and wild, that it cannot be restrained even by this prison of the body, wherein it is confined.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De beneficiis'', III, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of fundamental importance to the development of the idea of natural rights was the emergence of the idea of natural human equality. As the historian A.J. Carlyle notes: "There is no change in political theory so startling in its completeness as the change from the theory of Aristotle to the later philosophical view represented by [[Cicero]] and Seneca.... We think that this cannot be better exemplified than with regard to the theory of the equality of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carlyle |first=A.J. |title=A History of Medieval Political Theory in the West |year=1903 |location=Edinburgh |volume=1 |pages=8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles H. McIlwain likewise observes that "the idea of the equality of men is the profoundest contribution of the Stoics to political thought" and that "its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McIlwain |first=Charles H. |title=The Growth of Political Thought in the West: From the Greeks to the End of the Middle Ages |year=1932 |location=New York |pages=114–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero argues in [[De Legibus]] that "we are born for Justice, and that right is based, not upon opinions, but upon Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'' (Keyes translation), book 1, section 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
One of the first Western thinkers to develop the contemporary idea of natural rights was French theologian [[Jean Gerson]], whose 1402 treatise ''De Vita Spirituali Animae'' is considered one of the first attempts to develop what would come to be called modern natural rights theory.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tuck, ''Philosophy and Government 1572–1651'' (1993), pp. 25-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries later, the Stoic doctrine that the "inner part cannot be delivered into bondage"&lt;ref&gt;Davis, David Brion. ''The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture.'' Cornell University Press, 1966, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; re-emerged in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] doctrine of liberty of conscience. [[Martin Luther]] wrote:

{{quote|Furthermore, every man is responsible for his own faith, and he must see it for himself that he believes rightly. As little as another can go to hell or heaven for me, so little can he believe or disbelieve for me; and as little as he can open or shut heaven or hell for me, so little can he drive me to faith or unbelief. Since, then, belief or unbelief is a matter of every one's conscience, and since this is no lessening of the secular power, the latter should be content and attend to its own affairs and permit men to believe one thing or another, as they are able and willing, and constrain no one by force.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Concerning Secular Authority'', 1523.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

17th-century [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] [[John Locke]] discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being "life, liberty, and estate (property)", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the [[social contract]]. Preservation of the natural rights to life, liberty, and property was claimed as justification for the rebellion of the American colonies. As [[George Mason]] stated in his draft for the ''[[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]'', "all men are born equally free," and hold "certain inherent natural rights, of which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity."&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Maier,''American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence.'' New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], 1993, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 17th-century Englishman, [[John Lilburne]] (known as ''Freeborn John''), who came into conflict with both the monarchy of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and the [[military dictatorship]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] governed republic, argued for level human basic rights he called "''[[freeborn]] rights''" which he defined as being rights that every human being is born with, as opposed to rights bestowed by government or by human law.

The distinction between alienable and unalienable rights was introduced by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. In his ''Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue'' (1725), Hutcheson foreshadowed the Declaration of Independence, stating: “For wherever any Invasion is made upon unalienable Rights, there must arise either a perfect, or external Right to Resistance. . . . Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments.” Hutcheson, however, placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights, declaring that “there can be no Right, or Limitation of Right, inconsistent with, or opposite to the greatest publick Good."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Hutcheson, ''An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue in Two Treatises'' (Indianapolis, 2004), pp. 192, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his ''A System of Moral Philosophy'' (1755), based on the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] principle of the liberty of conscience. One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment (e.g., about religious questions) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is "unalienable." Hutcheson wrote: "Thus no man can really change his sentiments, judgments, and inward affections, at the pleasure of another; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart. The right of private judgment is therefore unalienable."&lt;ref&gt;Hutcheson, Francis. ''A System of Moral Philosophy''. London, 1755, pp. 261–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Age of Enlightenment|German Enlightenment]], [[Hegel]] gave a highly developed treatment of this inalienability argument. Like Hutcheson, Hegel based the theory of inalienable rights on the ''de facto'' inalienability of those aspects of personhood that distinguish persons from things. A thing, like a piece of property, can in fact be transferred from one person to another. According to Hegel, the same would not apply to those aspects that make one a person:

{{quote|The right to what is in essence inalienable is imprescriptible, since the act whereby I take possession of my personality, of my substantive essence, and make myself a responsible being, capable of possessing rights and with a moral and religious life, takes away from these characteristics of mine just that externality which alone made them capable of passing into the possession of someone else. When I have thus annulled their externality, I cannot lose them through lapse of time or from any other reason drawn from my prior consent or willingness to alienate them.&lt;ref&gt;Georg W. F. Hegel, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Right'', T.M. Knox, trans., New York: Oxford University Press, 1967 (1821), section 66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In discussion of [[social contract]] theory, "inalienable rights" were said to be those rights that could not be surrendered by citizens to the sovereign. Such rights were thought to be ''natural rights'', independent of positive law. Some social contract theorists reasoned, however, that in the [[state of nature|natural state]] only the strongest could benefit from their rights. Thus, people form an implicit [[social contract]], ceding their natural rights to the authority to protect the people from abuse, and living henceforth under the legal rights of that authority.

Many historical apologies for slavery and illiberal government were based on explicit or implicit voluntary contracts to alienate any "natural rights" to freedom and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;Philmore, J. 1982. The Libertarian Case for Slavery: A Note on Nozick. ''Philosophical Forum''. XIV (Fall 1982): 43–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''de facto'' inalienability arguments of Hutcheson and his predecessors provided the basis for the [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]] to argue not simply against involuntary slavery but against any explicit or implied contractual forms of slavery. Any contract that tried to legally alienate such a right would be inherently invalid. Similarly, the argument was used by the democratic movement to argue against any explicit or implied social contracts of subjection (''pactum subjectionis'') by which a people would supposedly alienate their right of self-government to a sovereign as, for example, in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]]. According to [[Ernst Cassirer]],

{{quote|There is, at least, one right that cannot be ceded or abandoned: the right to personality...They charged the great logician [Hobbes] with a contradiction in terms. If a man could give up his personality he would cease being a moral being. … There is no ''pactum subjectionis'', no act of submission by which man can give up the state of free agent and enslave himself. For by such an act of renunciation he would give up that very character which constitutes his nature and essence: he would lose his humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, Ernst. ''The Myth of the State''. Yale University Press, 1963, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These themes converged in the debate about American Independence. While Jefferson was writing the Declaration of Independence, [[Richard Price]] in England sided with the Americans' claim "that Great Britain is attempting to rob them of that liberty to which every member of society and all civil communities have a natural and unalienable title."&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;Price, Richard. ''Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty''. 1776, Part I. Reprinted in: Peach, Bernard, (Ed.) ''Richard Price and the Ethical Foundations of the American Revolution''. [[Duke University]] Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Price again based the argument on the ''de facto'' inalienability of "that principle of spontaneity or self-determination which constitutes us agents or which gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly ours, and not effects of the operation of any foreign cause."&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;{{rp|67–68}} Any social contract or compact allegedly alienating these rights would be non-binding and void, wrote Price:

{{quote|Neither can any state acquire such an authority over other states in virtue of any compacts or cessions. This is a case in which compacts are not binding. Civil liberty is, in this respect, on the same footing with religious liberty. As no people can lawfully surrender their religious liberty by giving up their right of judging for themselves in religion, or by allowing any human beings to prescribe to them what faith they shall embrace, or what mode of worship they shall practise, so neither can any civil societies lawfully surrender their civil liberty by giving up to any extraneous jurisdiction their power of legislating for themselves and disposing their property.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;{{rp|78–79}}}}

Price raised a furor of opposition so in 1777 he wrote another tract that clarified his position and again restated the ''de facto'' basis for the argument that the "liberty of men as agents is that power of self-determination which all agents, as such, possess."&lt;ref&gt;Price, Richard. ''Additional Observations on the Nature and Value of Civil Liberty.'' Reprinted in: Peach, Bernard, (Ed.) ''Richard Price and the Ethical Foundations of the American Revolution''. Duke University Press, 1979, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism'', [[Staughton Lynd]] pulled together these themes and related them to the slavery debate:

{{quote|Then it turned out to make considerable difference whether one said slavery was wrong because every man has a natural right to the possession of his own body, or because every man has a natural right freely to determine his own destiny. The first kind of right was alienable: thus Locke neatly derived slavery from capture in war, whereby a man forfeited his labor to the conqueror who might lawfully have killed him; and thus Dred Scott was judged permanently to have given up his freedom. But the second kind of right, what Price called "that power of self-determination which all agents, as such, possess," was inalienable as long man remained man. Like the mind's quest for religious truth from which it was derived, self-determination was not a claim to ownership which might be both acquired and surrendered, but an inextricable aspect of the activity of being human.&lt;ref&gt;Lynd, Staughton. ''Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism''. Vintage Books, 1969, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, in America, [[Thomas Jefferson]] "took his division of rights into alienable and unalienable from Hutcheson, who made the distinction popular and important",&lt;ref&gt;Garry Wills, 1979. ''Inventing America.'' New York: [[Random House|Vintage Books]], p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]], famously condensed this to:

{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...}}

In the 19th century, the movement to abolish slavery seized this passage as a statement of constitutional principle, although the U.S. constitution recognized and protected slavery. As a lawyer, future [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] argued before the Supreme Court in the case of [[John Van Zandt]], who had been charged with violating the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], that:

{{quote|The law of the Creator, which invests every human being with an inalienable title to freedom, cannot be repealed by any interior law which asserts that man is property.}}

The concept of inalienable rights was criticized by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Edmund Burke]] as groundless. Bentham and Burke, writing in 18th century Britain, claimed that rights arise from the actions of government, or evolve from tradition, and that neither of these can provide anything ''inalienable''. (See Bentham's [http://www.ditext.com/bentham/bentham.html "Critique of the Doctrine of Inalienable, Natural Rights"], and Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''). Presaging the shift in thinking in the 19th century, Bentham famously dismissed the idea of natural rights as "nonsense on stilts". By way of contrast to the views of British nationals Burke and Bentham, the leading American revolutionary scholar [[James Wilson]] condemned Burke's view as "tyranny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=James |editor=Robert Green McCloskey |title=The Works of James Wilson |publisher=Harvard University Press |date= |location=Cambridge, Mass. |volume=2 |pages=586–89 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signers of the Declaration of Independence deemed it a "self-evident truth" that all men "are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights".
In ''[[The Social Contract]]'', [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] claims that the existence of inalienable rights is unnecessary for the existence of a [[constitution]] or a set of laws and rights. This idea of a [[social contract]]{{spaced ndash}}that rights and responsibilities are derived from a consensual contract between the government and the people{{spaced ndash}}is the most widely recognized alternative.

One criticism of natural rights theory is that one cannot draw norms from facts.&lt;ref name="Finnis"&gt;{{cite book |title=Natural Law &amp; Natural Rights |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Finnis, John |year=2011 |location=Oxford |pages=23–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This objection is variously expressed as the [[is-ought problem]], the [[naturalistic fallacy]], or the [[appeal to nature]]. [[G.E. Moore]], for example, said that [[ethical naturalism]] falls prey to the naturalistic fallacy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Some defenders of natural rights theory, however, counter that the term "natural" in "natural rights" is contrasted with "artificial" rather than referring to [[nature]]. [[John Finnis]], for example, contends that [[natural law]] and natural rights are derived from self-evident principles, not from speculative principles or from facts.&lt;ref name="Finnis" /&gt;

There is also debate as to whether all rights are either natural or legal. Fourth president of the United States [[James Madison]], while representing Virginia in the House of Representatives, believed that there are rights, such as [[trial by jury]], that are [[social rights]], arising neither from [[natural law]] nor from [[positive law]] (which are the basis of natural and legal rights respectively) but from the [[social contract]] from which a government derives its authority.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction of the Bill of Rights in Congress, 1789 Jun 8, Jul 21, Aug 13, 18–19; Annals 1:424-50, 661–65, 707–17, 757–59, 766.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomas Hobbes====
{{Main article|Thomas Hobbes}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) included a discussion of natural rights in his moral and [[political philosophy]]. Hobbes' conception of natural rights extended from his conception of man in a "state of nature". Thus he argued that the essential natural (human) right was "to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own Life; and consequently, of doing any thing, which in his own judgement, and Reason, he shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto." ([[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']]. 1, XIV)

Hobbes sharply distinguished this natural "liberty", from natural "laws", described generally as "a precept, or general rule, found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving his life; and to omit, that, by which he thinketh it may best be preserved." ([[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']]. 1, XIV)

In his natural state, according to Hobbes, man's life consisted entirely of liberties and not at all of laws – "It followeth, that in such a condition, every man has the right to every thing; even to one another's body. And therefore, as long as this natural Right of every man to every thing endureth, there can be no security to any man... of living out the time, which Nature ordinarily allow men to live." ([[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']]. 1, XIV)

This would lead inevitably to a situation known as the "[[bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]]", in which human beings kill, steal and enslave others in order to stay alive, and due to their natural lust for "Gain", "Safety" and "Reputation". Hobbes reasoned that this world of chaos created by unlimited rights was highly undesirable, since it would cause human life to be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short". As such, if humans wish to live peacefully they must give up most of their natural rights and create moral obligations in order to establish political and [[civil society]]. This is one of the earliest formulations of the theory of government known as the [[social contract]].

Hobbes objected to the attempt to derive rights from "[[natural law]]," arguing that law ("lex") and right ("jus") though often confused, signify opposites, with law referring to obligations, while rights refer to the absence of obligations. Since by our (human) nature, we seek to maximize our well being, rights are prior to law, natural or institutional, and people will not follow the laws of nature without first being subjected to a sovereign power, without which all ideas of [[Ethics|right and wrong]] are meaningless – "Therefore before the names of Just and Unjust can have place, there must be some coercive Power, to compel men equally to the performance of their Covenants..., to make good that Propriety, which by mutual contract men acquire, in recompense of the universal Right they abandon: and such power there is none before the erection of the Commonwealth." ([[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan]]''. 1, XV)

This marked an important departure from medieval natural law theories which gave precedence to obligations over rights.

====John Locke====
{{Main article|John Locke}}
[[File:John Locke by Herman Verelst.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|[[John Locke]], ''"[[Life]], [[Liberty]], [[Estate (law)|Estate]]'' ([[property]])"]]
John Locke (1632 – 1704) was another prominent Western philosopher who conceptualized rights as natural and inalienable. Like Hobbes, Locke believed in a natural right to [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[property]]. It was once conventional wisdom that Locke greatly influenced the [[American Revolutionary War]] with his writings of natural rights, but this claim has been the subject of protracted dispute in recent decades. For example, the historian Ray Forrest Harvey declared that Jefferson and Locke were at "two opposite poles" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson’s use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase "pursuit of happiness" instead of "property."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Harvey |first=Ray Forrest |title=Jean Jacques Burlamaqui: A Liberal Tradition in American Constitutionalism |year=1937 |location=Chapel Hill, N.C. |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the eminent&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IR3HlZ9IQuEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Law+as+culture+and+culture+as+law:+essays+in+honor+of+John+Phillip+Reid&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X260ecQgxo&amp;sig=A-CqdA9td0uZGU-ZXR8ZvlacxpI&amp;hl=ko&amp;ei=fiT3S8fUHY3vcMiH1OYL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Law As Culture and Culture As Law: Essays in Honor of John Phillip Reid]  Books.google.co.kr. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; legal historian John Phillip Reid has deplored contemporary scholars’ "misplaced emphasis on John Locke," arguing that American revolutionary leaders saw Locke as a ''commentator'' on established constitutional principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Reid |first=John Phillip |title=Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority To Tax |year=1987 |location=Madison, Wis. |pages=135–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Reid |first=John Phillip |title=Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Rights |year=1986 |location=Madison, Wis. |pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Pangle]] has defended Locke's influence on the Founding, claiming that historians who argue to the contrary either misrepresent the classical republican alternative to which they say the revolutionary leaders adhered, do not understand Locke, or point to someone else who was decisively influenced by Locke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pangle |first=Thomas L. |authorlink=Thomas Pangle |title=The Spirit of Modern Republicanism: The Moral Vision of the American Founders and the Philosophy of John Locke |year=1988 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position has also been sustained by Michael Zuckert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zuckert |first=Michael P. |title=The Natural Rights Republic: Studies in the Foundation of the American Political Tradition |year=1996 |location=South Bend, Ind. |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zuckert |first=Michael P. |title=Natural Rights and the New Republicanism |year=1998 |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zuckert |first=Michael P. |title=Launching Liberalism: On Lockean Political Philosophy |year=2002 |location=Lawrence |publisher=University Press of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Locke there are three natural rights:
* Life: everyone is entitled to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kunze |first1=Fred |title=A Biography of John Locke |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/biographies/john-locke/ |website=American History from revolution to reconstruction and beyond |publisher=GMW – University of Groningen |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Liberty: everyone is entitled to do anything they want to so long as it doesn't conflict with the first right.
* Estate: everyone is entitled to own all they create or gain through gift or trade so long as it doesn't conflict with the first two rights.

In developing his concept of natural rights, Locke was influenced by reports of society among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], whom he regarded as "natural peoples" who lived in a state of liberty and "near perfect freedom", but not license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ratical.org/many_worlds/6Nations/EoL/chp4.html |title=Chp 4: Ennobling `Savages', Native America in European natural-rights philosophy, "Exemplar Of Liberty" |website=Ratical.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also informed his conception of [[social contract]].

The social contract is an agreement between members of a country to live within a shared system of laws. Specific forms of government are the result of the decisions made by these persons acting in their collective capacity. Government is instituted to make laws that protect these three natural rights. If a government does not properly protect these rights, it can be overthrown.

{{Main article|Thomas Paine}}
[[File:Thomas Paine rev1.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|[[Thomas Paine]]]]

Thomas Paine (1731–1809) further elaborated on natural rights in his influential work ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791), emphasizing that rights cannot be granted by any charter because this would legally imply they can also be revoked and under such circumstances they would be reduced to privileges:

{{quote|It is a perversion of terms to say that a charter gives rights. It operates by a contrary effect – that of taking rights away. Rights are inherently in all the inhabitants; but charters, by annulling those rights, in the majority, leave the right, by exclusion, in the hands of a few. … They...consequently are instruments of injustice.

The fact therefore must be that the individuals themselves, each in his own personal and sovereign right, entered into a compact with each other to produce a government: and this is the only mode in which governments have a right to arise, and the only principle on which they have a right to exist.}}

=== American individualist anarchists ===
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]While at first [[American individualist anarchists]] adhered to natural rights positions, later in this era led by [[Benjamin Tucker]], some abandoned natural rights positions and converted to [[Max Stirner]]'s [[Egoist anarchism]]. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said there were only two rights: "the right of might" and "the right of contract".{{Citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=}} He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, "In times past... it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off.... Man's only right to land is his might over it."&lt;ref name="Ref_ac"&gt;Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wendy McElroy:
{{quote|In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.&lt;ref name="Ref_ad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;layout=html#chapter_100896 |title=Literature of Liberty, Autumn 1981, vol. 4, No. 3 – Online Library of Liberty |website=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several periodicals were "undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism, including ''I'' published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of ''Liberty''); ''The Ego'' and ''The Egoist'', both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''[[Der Eigene]]'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]], and ''The Eagle'' and ''The Serpent'', issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Ref_ad" /&gt; Among those American anarchists who adhered to egoism include [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[James L. Walker]], [[Victor Yarros]] and E.H. Fulton.&lt;ref name="Ref_ad" /&gt;

===Contemporary===
Many documents now echo the phrase used in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The preamble to the 1948 United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] asserts that rights are inalienable: "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world." Article 1, §&amp;nbsp;1 of the [[California Constitution]] recognizes inalienable rights, and articulated ''some'' (not all) of those rights as "defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and [[privacy]]." However, there is still much dispute over which "rights" are truly natural rights and which are not, and the concept of natural or inalienable rights is still controversial to some.

[[Erich Fromm]] argued that some powers over human beings could be wielded only by God, and that if there were no God, no human beings could wield these powers.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm (1973), ''The Revolution of Hope: Toward a Humanized Technology'', New York: Bantam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary political philosophies continuing the [[classical liberal]] tradition of natural rights include [[libertarianism]], [[anarcho-capitalism]] and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], and include amongst their canon the works of authors such as [[Robert Nozick]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Ayn Rand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html Individual Rights – Ayn Rand Lexicon]. Aynrandlexicon.com. Retrieved 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Murray Rothbard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ethics.asp |title=The Ethics of Liberty &amp;#124; Mises Institute |website=Mises.org |date=2005-07-20 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A libertarian view of inalienable rights is laid out in Morris and Linda Tannehill's ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', which claims that a man has a right to ownership over his life and therefore also his property, because he has invested time (i.e. part of his life) in it and thereby made it an extension of his life. However, if he initiates force against and to the detriment of another man, he alienates himself from the right to that part of his life which is required to pay his debt: "Rights are ''not'' inalienable, but only the possessor of a right can alienate himself from that right – no one else can take a man's rights from him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Market for Liberty |chapter=Man and Society |page=11 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various definitions of inalienability include non-relinquishability, non-salability, and non-transferability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A Libertarian Theory of Inalienability |author=Block, Walter |publisher=Journal of Libertarian Studies |volume=17 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2003 |pages=39–85 |url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/17_2/17_2_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been recognized by libertarians as being central to the question of [[voluntary slavery]], which [[Murray Rothbard]] dismissed as illegitimate and even self-contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/2459#ixzz0nx4DiTmB |title=A Crusoe Social Philosophy &amp;#124; Mises Institute |website=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephan Kinsella]] argues that "viewing rights as alienable is perfectly consistent with – indeed, implied by – the libertarian [[non-aggression principle]]. Under this principle, only the initiation of force is prohibited; [[defensive force|defensive]], [[restitutive]], or [[retaliatory force]] is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_4.pdf |title=Inalienability and Punishment: A Reply to George Smith &amp;#124; Mises Institute |website=Mises.org |date=2014-07-30 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various philosophers have created different lists of rights they consider to be natural. Proponents of natural rights, in particular Hesselberg and [[Rothbard]], have responded that reason can be applied to separate truly [[axiom]]atic rights from supposed rights, stating that any principle that requires itself to be disproved is an axiom. Critics have pointed to the lack of agreement between the proponents as evidence for the claim that the idea of natural rights is merely a political tool.

Hugh Gibbons has proposed a descriptive argument based on human biology. His contention is that Human Beings were other-regarding as a matter of necessity, in order to avoid the costs of conflict. Over time they developed expectations that individuals would act in certain ways which were then prescribed by society (duties of care etc.) and that eventually crystallized into actionable rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/pilj/vol13no2/documents/13-2GibbonsArticle.pdf |title=De Sciuridae Et Homo Sapiens: The Origin Of Rights And Duties |format=PDF |website=Bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">'''No Value Added''' ('''NVA''') is a management term loosely related to the [[Lean Manufacturing]] movement as codified in the 1980s by a landmark [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] study&lt;ref&gt;The Machine That Changed the World&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Automaker|automobile industry]], which explained lean production for the first time.

No Value Added programs can be formal or whimsical. Generally, they involved seeking input and opinion from every level of the organization about rules, processes or process elements which are said to be “no value added.”

In one form, the proponent of an activity accused of being NVA must defend it, or suspend it.

In a milder form, the proponent (or [[process owner]]) of an activity accused of being NVA is simply informed that it is seen in that light. Oddly, this milder form is often effective because in a large organization, the original reason for an activity can be long forgotten, similar to ''[[caboose]]s'' which came into use in the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uprr.com/aboutup/history/caboose/caboo01.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually had no useful purpose and became NVA.

Some claim that this NVA is a jibe at ''Net Value Added'' [[accounting methods]], which were held in low esteem by some Lean advocates, and high esteem by others.

The ''z''-axis is vertical, and the foci are at&amp;nbsp;±2.  The red oblate spheroid (flattened sphere) corresponds to ''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, whereas the blue half-hyperboloid corresponds to ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45°.  The azimuth ''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−60° measures the [[dihedral angle]] between the green ''x''-''z'' half-plane and the yellow half-plane that includes the point&amp;nbsp;'''P'''.  The [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of '''P''' are roughly (1.09,&amp;nbsp;−1.89,&amp;nbsp;1.66).]]

'''Oblate spheroidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] about the non-focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis that separates the foci. Thus, the two foci are transformed into a ring of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the ''x''-''y'' plane.  (Rotation about the other axis produces [[prolate spheroidal coordinates]].)  Oblate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of [[ellipsoidal coordinates]] in which the two largest [[semi-axis|semi-axes]] are equal in length.

Oblate spheroidal coordinates are often useful in solving [[partial differential equation]]s when the boundary conditions are defined on an [[oblate spheroid]] or a [[hyperboloid|hyperboloid of revolution]].  For example, they played an important role in the calculation of the [[Perrin friction factors]], which contributed to the awarding of the 1926 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] to [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]].  These friction factors determine the [[rotational diffusion]] of molecules, which affects the feasibility of many techniques such as [[protein NMR]] and from which the hydrodynamic volume and shape of molecules can be inferred.  Oblate spheroidal coordinates are also useful in problems of electromagnetism (e.g., dielectric constant of charged oblate molecules), acoustics (e.g., scattering of sound through a circular hole), fluid dynamics  (e.g., the flow of water through a firehose nozzle) and the diffusion of materials and heat (e.g., cooling of a red-hot coin in a water bath)

==Definition (µ,ν,φ)==
[[File:OblateSpheroidCoord.png|thumb|350 px|right|Figure 2: Plot of the oblate spheroidal coordinates &amp;mu; and &amp;nu; in the ''x''-''z'' plane, where φ is zero and ''a'' equals one. The curves of constant ''&amp;mu;'' form red ellipses, whereas those of constant ''&amp;nu;'' form cyan half-hyperbolae in this plane. The ''z''-axis runs vertically and separates the foci; the coordinates ''z'' and ν always have the same sign. The surfaces of constant &amp;mu; and &amp;nu; in three dimensions are obtained by rotation about the ''z''-axis, and are the red and blue surfaces, respectively, in Figure 1.]]
The most common definition of oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu \ \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu \ \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \ \sinh \mu \ \sin \nu 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and the angle &lt;math&gt;\nu\in\left[-\pi/2,\pi/2\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  The azimuthal angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can fall anywhere on a full circle, between &lt;math&gt;\pm\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  These coordinates are favored over the alternatives below because they are not degenerate; the set of coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; describes a unique point in Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;. The reverse is also true, except on the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis and the disk in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; plane inside the focal ring.

===Coordinate surfaces===

The surfaces of constant μ form [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroids]], by the trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \cosh^{2} \mu} + 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \sinh^{2} \mu} = \cos^{2} \nu + \sin^{2} \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

since they are [[ellipse]]s rotated about the ''z''-axis, which separates their foci.   An ellipse in the ''x''-''z'' plane (Figure 2) has a [[semi-major axis|major semiaxis]] of length ''a'' cosh μ along the ''x''-axis, whereas its [[semi-minor axis|minor semiaxis]] has length ''a'' sinh μ along the ''z''-axis.  The foci of all the ellipses in the ''x''-''z'' plane are located on the ''x''-axis at ±''a''.

Similarly, the surfaces of constant ν form one-sheet half [[hyperboloid]]s of revolution by the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \cos^{2} \nu} - 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \sin^{2} \nu} = \cosh^{2} \mu - \sinh^{2} \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

For positive ν, the half-hyperboloid is above the ''x''-''y'' plane (i.e., has positive ''z'') whereas for negative ν, the half-hyperboloid is below the ''x''-''y'' plane (i.e., has negative ''z'').  Geometrically, the angle ν corresponds to the angle of the [[asymptote]]s of the hyperbola.  The foci of all the hyperbolae are likewise located on the ''x''-axis at ±''a''.

===Inverse transformation===

The (μ, ν, φ) coordinates may be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') as follows.  The azimuthal angle φ is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan \phi = \frac{y}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The cylindrical radius ρ of the point P is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and its distances to the foci in the plane defined by φ is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{1}^{2} = (\rho + a)^{2} + z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{2}^{2} = (\rho - a)^{2} + z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The remaining coordinates μ and ν can be calculated from the equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\cosh \mu = \frac{d_{1} + d_{2}}{2a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos \nu = \frac{d_{1} - d_{2}}{2a}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the sign of μ is always non-negative, and the sign of ν is the same as that of ''z''.

Another method to compute the inverse transform is

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \operatorname{Re} \operatorname{arcosh} \frac{\rho + z i}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu = \operatorname{Im} \operatorname{arcosh} \frac{\rho + z i}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = \arctan \frac{y}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the coordinates μ and ν are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = h_{\nu} = a\sqrt{\sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\phi} = a \cosh\mu \ \cos\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{3} \cosh\mu \ \cos\nu \ 
\left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right) d\mu d\nu d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right)} 
\left[
\frac{1}{\cosh \mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} 
\left( \cosh \mu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} \right) + 
\frac{1}{\cos \nu} \frac{\partial}{\partial \nu}
\left( \cos \nu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu} \right)
\right] +
\frac{1}{a^{2} \cosh^{2}\mu \cos^{2}\nu}
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \phi^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates (μ, ν, φ) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

===Basis Vectors===

The orthonormal basis vectors for the &lt;math&gt;\mu,\nu,\phi&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\mu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu}}
\left( \sinh \mu \cos \nu \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} + \sinh \mu \cos \nu \sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}} + \cosh \mu \sin \nu \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\nu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu}}
\left(
-\cosh \mu \sin \nu \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} - \cosh \mu \sin \nu \sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}} + \sinh \mu \cos \nu \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\phi} = -\sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} + \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat{i}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{j}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}&lt;/math&gt; are the Cartesian unit vectors. Here, &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is the outward normal vector to the oblate spheroidal surface of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is the same azimuthal unit vector from spherical coordinates, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; lies in the tangent plane to the oblate spheroid surface and completes the right-handed basis set.

==Definition (ζ, ξ, φ)==

Another set of oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\zeta,\xi,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used where &lt;math&gt;\zeta = \sinh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi = \sin \nu&lt;/math&gt; (Smythe 1968).  The curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; are oblate spheroids and the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; are the hyperboloids of revolution. The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is restricted by &lt;math&gt;0 \le \zeta &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is restricted by &lt;math&gt;-1 \le \xi &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The relationship to [[Cartesian coordinates]] is

:&lt;math&gt;x = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1-\xi^2)}\,\cos \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1-\xi^2)}\,\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z  = a \zeta \xi&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for &lt;math&gt;(\zeta, \xi, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\zeta} = a\sqrt{\frac{\zeta^2 + \xi^2}{1+\zeta^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\xi} = a\sqrt{\frac{\zeta^2 + \xi^2}{1 - \xi^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\phi} = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1 - \xi^2)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing the scale factors, various functions of the coordinates can be calculated by the general method outlined in the [[orthogonal coordinates]] article. The infinitesimal volume element is:

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{3} (\zeta^2+\xi^2)\,d\zeta\,d\xi\,d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla V = 
\frac{1}{h_{\zeta}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \zeta} \,\hat{\zeta}+
\frac{1}  {h_{\xi}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}   \,\hat{\xi}+
\frac{1} {h_{\phi}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi}  \,\hat{\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

The divergence is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{a(\zeta^2+\xi^2)}
\left\{
\frac{\partial}{\partial \zeta} \left(\sqrt{1+\zeta^2}\sqrt{\zeta^2+\xi^2}F_\zeta\right)        +
\frac{\partial}  {\partial \xi} \left(\sqrt{1-\xi^2}\sqrt{\zeta^2+\xi^2}F_\xi\right)
\right\}
+\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\zeta^2}\sqrt{1-\xi^2}} \frac{\partial F_\phi}{\partial \phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} V = 
\frac{1}{a^2 \left( \zeta^2 + \xi^2 \right)}
\left\{
\frac{\partial}{\partial \zeta} \left[ 
\left(1+\zeta^2\right) \frac{\partial V}{\partial \zeta}
\right] + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi} \left[ 
\left( 1 - \xi^2 \right) \frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}
\right]
\right\}
+ \frac{1}{a^2 \left( 1+\zeta^2 \right) \left( 1 - \xi^{2} \right)}
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Oblate spheroidal harmonics ===

: ''See also [[Oblate spheroidal wave function]].''

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]] and [[spherical harmonics]], Laplace's equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''oblate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant oblate spheroidal coordinate.

Following the technique of [[separation of variables]], a solution to Laplace's equation is written:

:&lt;math&gt;V=Z(\zeta)\,\Xi(\xi)\,\Phi(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

This yields three separate differential equations in each of the variables:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\zeta}\left[(1+\zeta^2)\frac{dZ  }{d\zeta}\right]+\frac{m^2Z  }{1+\zeta^2}-n(n+1)Z  =0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\xi  }\left[(1-\xi^2  )\frac{d\Xi}{d\xi  }\right]-\frac{m^2\Xi}{1-\xi^2  }+n(n+1)\Xi=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2}=-m^2\Phi&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is a constant which is an integer because the &amp;phi; variable is periodic with period 2&amp;pi;. ''n'' will then be an integer. The solution to these equations are:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{mn}   =A_1P_n^m(i\zeta)+A_2Q_n^m(i\zeta)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Xi_{mn} =A_3P_n^m(\xi)+A_4Q_n^m(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_m   =A_5e^{im\phi}+A_6e^{-im\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are constants and &lt;math&gt;P_n^m(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_n^m(z)&lt;/math&gt; are [[associated Legendre polynomial]]s of the first and second kind respectively. The product of the three solutions is called an ''oblate spheroidal harmonic'' and the general solution to Laplace's equation is written:

:&lt;math&gt;V=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^\infty\,Z_{mn}(\zeta)\,\Xi_{mn}(\xi)\,\Phi_m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

The constants will combine to yield only four independent constants for each harmonic.

==Definition (σ, τ, φ)==

[[File:Oblate spheroidal coordinates full hyperboloid.png|thumb|right|350px|Figure 3: Coordinate isosurfaces for a point P (shown as a black sphere) in the alternative oblate spheroidal coordinates (σ, τ, φ). As before, the oblate spheroid corresponding to σ is shown in red, and φ measures the azimuthal angle between the green and yellow half-planes. However, the surface of constant τ is a full one-sheet hyperboloid, shown in blue. This produces a two-fold degeneracy, shown by the two black spheres located at (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'').]]

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of oblate spheroidal coordinates (σ, τ, φ) are sometimes used, where σ = [[Cosh (mathematical function)|cosh]] μ and τ = [[cosine|cos]] ν.&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the coordinate σ must be greater than or equal to one, whereas τ must lie between ±1, inclusive.  The surfaces of constant σ are oblate spheroids, as were those of constant μ, whereas the curves of constant τ are full hyperboloids of revolution, including the half-hyperboloids corresponding to ±ν.  Thus, these coordinates are degenerate; ''two'' points in Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'') map to ''one'' set of coordinates (σ, τ, φ).  This two-fold degeneracy in the sign of ''z'' is evident from the equations transforming from oblate spheroidal coordinates to the [[Cartesian coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a\sigma\tau \cos \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a\sigma\tau \sin \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2}  = a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left(1 - \tau^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the focal ring.  For any point, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the focal ring equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the "far" distance to the focal ring is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the "near" distance is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Coordinate surfaces===

Similar to its counterpart μ, the surfaces of constant σ form [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroids]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \sigma^{2}} + 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \left(\sigma^{2} -1\right)} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the surfaces of constant τ form full one-sheet [[hyperboloid]]s of revolution

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \tau^{2}} - 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the alternative oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{\sigma^2 - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\tau = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor is &lt;math&gt;h_{\phi} = a \sigma \tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 \sigma \tau \frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{\sqrt{\left( \sigma^2 - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^2 \right)}} \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^2 \left( \sigma^2 - \tau^2 \right)}
\left\{
\frac{\sqrt{\sigma^2 -1}}{\sigma}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} \left[ 
\left( \sigma\sqrt{\sigma^2 - 1} \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right] + 
\frac{\sqrt{1 - \tau^2}}{\tau}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \left[ 
\left( \tau\sqrt{1 - \tau^2} \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right]
\right\}
+ \frac{1}{a^2 \sigma^2 \tau^2 }
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \phi^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae  found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]], Laplaces equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''oblate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant oblate spheroidal coordinate (See Smythe, 1968).

[[Image:Operant conditioning diagram.png|thumb|400px|Diagram of operant conditioning]]
'''Operant conditioning''' (also called '''instrumental conditioning''') is a learning process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment.  It is also a procedure that is used to bring about such learning.

Although operant and [[classical conditioning]] both involve behaviors controlled by environmental stimuli, they differ in nature. In operant conditioning, stimuli present when a behavior is rewarded or punished come to control that behavior.  For example, a child may learn to open a box to get the candy inside, or learn to avoid touching a hot stove; in operant terms, the box and the stove are "discriminative stimuli". Operant behavior is said to be "voluntary": for example, the child may face a choice between opening the box and petting a puppy.

In contrast, [[classical conditioning]] involves involuntary behavior based on the pairing of stimuli with biologically significant events. For example, sight of candy may cause a child to salivate, or the sound of a door slam may signal an angry parent, causing a child to tremble. Salivation and trembling are not operants; they are not reinforced by their consequences, and they are not voluntarily "chosen".

The study of animal learning in the 20th century was dominated by the analysis of these two sorts of learning,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. M. "Animal Learning and Behavior Theory" Ch. 5 in Hearst, E. "The First Century of Experimental Psychology"  Hillsdale N. J.,  Earlbaum, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; and they are still at the core of behavior analysis.

==Historical note==

===Thorndike's law of effect===
{{Main|Law of effect}}
Operant conditioning, sometimes called ''instrumental learning'', was first extensively studied by [[Edward L. Thorndike]] (1874–1949), who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorndike|first1=E.L.|year=1901|title=Animal intelligence: An experimental study of the associative processes in animals|url=|journal=Psychological Review Monograph Supplement|volume=2|issue=|pages=1–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole, but when first constrained, the cats took a long time to get out. With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently, so the cats escaped more and more quickly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thorndike generalized this finding in his [[law of effect]], which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences ''strengthen'' behavior and some consequences ''weaken'' behavior. By plotting escape time against trial number Thorndike produced the first known animal [[learning curve]]s through this procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans appear to learn many simple behaviors through the sort of process studied by Thorndike, now called operant conditioning. That is, responses are retained when they lead to a successful outcome and discarded when they do not, or when they produce aversive effects. This usually happens without being planned by any "teacher", but operant conditioning has been used by parents in teaching their children for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="parenting"&gt;Miltenberger, R. G., &amp; Crosland, K. A. (2014). Parenting. The wiley blackwell handbook of operant and classical conditioning. (pp. 509–531) Wiley-Blackwell. {{DOI|10.1002/9781118468135.ch20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===B. F. Skinner===
{{Main|B. F. Skinner}} 
[[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) is referred to as the father of operant conditioning, and his work is frequently cited in connection with this topic. His 1938 book "The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis",&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis", 1938 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; initiated his lifelong study of operant conditioning and its application to human and animal behavior. Following the ideas of [[Ernst Mach]], Skinner rejected Thorndike's reference to unobservable mental states such as satisfaction, building his analysis on observable behavior and its equally observable consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=B. F.|year=1950|title=Are theories of learning necessary?|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=57|issue=|pages=193–216|doi=10.1037/h0054367|pmid=15440996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner believed that classical conditioning was too simplistic to be used to describe something as complex as human behavior. Operant conditioning, in his opinion, better described human behavior as it examined causes and effects of intentional behavior.

To implement his empirical approach, Skinner invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], or "''Skinner Box''", in which subjects such as pigeons and rats were isolated and could be exposed to carefully controlled stimuli. Unlike Thorndike's puzzle box, this arrangement allowed the subject to make one or two simple, repeatable responses, and the rate of such responses became Skinner's primary behavioral measure.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "B. F. Skinner: The role of reinforcement and Punishment", subsection in: Psychology; Second Edition. New York: Worth, Incorporated, 2011, 278–288.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another invention, the cumulative recorder, produced a graphical record from which these response rates could be estimated. These records were the primary data that Skinner and his colleagues used to explore the effects on response rate of various reinforcement schedules.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ferster, C. B. &amp; Skinner, B. F.  "Schedules of Reinforcement", 1957 New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; A reinforcement schedule may be defined as "any procedure that delivers reinforcement to an organism according to some well-defined rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staddon|first=J. E. R|author2=D. T Cerutti|date=February 2003|title=Operant Conditioning|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=115–144|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145124|pmc=1473025|accessdate=23 March 2013|pmid=12415075}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of schedules became, in turn, the basic findings from which Skinner developed his account of operant conditioning. He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Mecca Chiesa (2004) Radical Behaviorism: The philosophy and the science&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Skinner's writings are devoted to the application of operant conditioning to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Science and Human Behavior", 1953. New York: MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1948 he published ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional account of a peaceful, happy, productive community organized around his conditioning principles.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). Walden Two. Indianapolis: Hackett&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] published ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. "Verbal Behavior", 1957. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; which extended the principles of operant conditioning to language, a form of human behavior that had previously been analyzed quite differently by linguists and others. Skinner defined new functional relationships such as "mands" and "tacts" to capture some essentials of language, but he introduced no new principles, treating verbal behavior like any other behavior controlled by its consequences, which included the reactions of the speaker's audience.

==Concepts and procedures==

===Origins of operant behavior: operant variability===
Operant behavior is said to be "emitted"; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why it happens in the first place.  The answer to this question is like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a "new" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A|year=2002|title=Operant variability: Evidence, functions, and theory|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=9|issue=4|pages=672–705|doi=10.3758/bf03196324|pmid=12613672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifying operant behavior: reinforcement and punishment===
{{Main|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}
Reinforcement and punishment are the core tools through which operant behavior is modified. These terms are defined by their effect on behavior. Either may be positive or negative. 
* '''Positive reinforcement''' and '''negative reinforcement''' increase the probability of a behavior that they follow, while '''positive punishment''' and '''negative punishment''' reduce the probability of behaviour that they follow. 
Another procedure is called "extinction".
* '''Extinction''' occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. 
There are a total of five consequences. 
# '''[[Positive reinforcement]]''' occurs when a behavior (response) is [[reward system|rewarding]] or the behavior is followed by another stimulus that is rewarding, increasing the frequency of that behavior.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2015|title=Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data|journal=Physiological Reviews|volume=95|issue=3|pages=853–951|doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014|pmc=4491543|pmid=26109341|quote=Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.|vauthors=Schultz W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a rat in a [[Skinner box]] gets food when it presses a lever, its rate of pressing will go up.  This procedure is usually called simply ''reinforcement''.
# '''[[Negative reinforcement]]''' (a.k.a. escape) occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of an [[aversive]] stimulus, thereby increasing the original behavior's frequency. In the Skinner Box experiment, the aversive stimulus might be a loud noise continuously inside the box; negative reinforcement would happen when the rat presses a lever to turn off the noise.
# '''[[Positive punishment]]''' (also referred to as "punishment by contingent stimulation") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by an aversive stimulus. Example: pain from a [[spanking]], which would often result in a decrease in that behavior. ''Positive punishment'' is a confusing term, so the procedure is usually referred to as "punishment".
# '''[[Negative punishment]]''' (penalty) (also called "punishment by contingent withdrawal") occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by the removal of a stimulus. Example: taking away a child's toy following an undesired behavior by him/her, which would result in a decrease in the undesirable behavior.
# '''[[extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]''' occurs when a behavior (response) that had previously been reinforced is no longer effective. Example: a rat is first given food many times for pressing a lever, until the experimenter no longer gives out food as a reward. The rat would typically press the lever less often and then stop. The lever pressing would then be said to be "extinguished."

It is important to note that actors (e.g. a rat) are not spoken of as being reinforced, punished, or extinguished; it is the ''actions'' that are reinforced, punished, or extinguished. Reinforcement, punishment, and extinction are not terms whose use is restricted to the laboratory. Naturally-occurring consequences can also reinforce, punish, or extinguish behavior and are not always planned or delivered on purpose.

====Schedules of reinforcement====
Schedules of reinforcement are rules that control the delivery of reinforcement. The rules specify either the time that reinforcement is to be made available, or the number of responses to be made, or both. Many rules are possible, but the following are the most basic and commonly used&lt;ref&gt;Schacter et al.2011 Psychology 2nd ed. pg.280–284 Reference for entire section Principles version 130317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

* Fixed interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a fixed time has elapsed after the previous reinforcement. This schedule yields a "break-run" pattern of response; that is, after training on this schedule, the organism typically pauses after reinforcement, and then begins to respond rapidly as the time for the next reinforcement approaches.
* Variable interval schedule: Reinforcement occurs following the first response after a variable time has elapsed from the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a relatively steady rate of response that varies with the average time between reinforcements.
* Fixed ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. An organism trained on this schedule typically pauses for a while after a reinforcement and then responds at a high rate. If the response requirement is low there may be no pause; if the response requirement is high the organism may quit responding altogether.
* Variable ratio schedule: Reinforcement occurs after a variable number of responses have been emitted since the previous reinforcement. This schedule typically yields a very high, persistent rate of response.
* Continuous reinforcement: Reinforcement occurs after each response. Organisms typically respond as rapidly as they can, given the time taken to obtain and consume reinforcement, until they are satiated.

====Factors that alter the effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment====
The effectiveness of reinforcement and punishment can be changed. 
# '''Satiation/Deprivation''': The effectiveness of a positive or "appetitive" stimulus will be reduced if the individual has received enough of that stimulus to satisfy his/her appetite. The opposite effect will occur if the individual becomes deprived of that stimulus: the effectiveness of a consequence will then increase. A subject with a full stomach wouldn't feel as motivated as a hungry one.&lt;ref name = Miltenberger84&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Immediacy''': An immediate consequence is more effective than a delayed one. If one gives a dog a treat for sitting within five seconds, the dog will learn faster than if the treat is in thirty.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Contingency''': To be most effective, reinforcement should occur consistently after responses and not at other times. Learning may be slower if reinforcement is intermittent, that is, following only some instances of the same response. Responses reinforced intermittently are usually slower to extinguish than are responses that have always been reinforced.&lt;ref name = Miltenberger84/&gt;
# '''Size''': The size, or amount, of a stimulus often affects its potency as a reinforcer. Humans and animals engage in cost-benefit analysis. A smaller amount of food may not, to a rat, seem a worthwhile reward for an effortful lever press. A pile of quarters from a slot machine may keep a gambler pulling the lever longer than a single quarter. Most of these factors serve biological functions.  For example, the process of satiation helps the organism maintain a stable internal environment ([[homeostasis]]). When an organism has been deprived of sugar, for example, the taste of sugar is an effective reinforcer. When the organism's [[blood sugar]] reaches or exceeds an optimum level the taste of sugar becomes less effective or even aversive.

====Shaping====
{{main|Shaping (psychology)}}
Shaping is a conditioning method much used in animal training and in teaching nonverbal humans. It depends on operant variability and reinforcement, as described above. The trainer starts by identifying the desired final (or "target") behavior. Next, the trainer chooses a behavior that the animal or person already emits with some probability. The form of this behavior is then gradually changed across successive trials by reinforcing behaviors that approximate the target behavior more and more closely. When the target behavior is finally emitted, it may be strengthened and maintained by the use of a schedule of reinforcement.

====Noncontingent reinforcement====
Noncontingent reinforcement is the delivery of reinforcing stimuli regardless of the organism's behavior. Noncontingent reinforcement may be used in an attempt to reduce an undesired target behavior by reinforcing multiple alternative responses while extinguishing the target response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=M.|last2=Sigafoos|first2=J.|last3=Bushell|first3=H.|year=1998|title=Use of noncontingent reinforcement in the treatment of challenging behavior|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=22|issue=|pages=529–547|doi=10.1177/01454455980224005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent "reinforcement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poling|first1=A.|last2=Normand|first2=M.|year=1999|title=Noncontingent reinforcement: an inappropriate description of time-based schedules that reduce behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=32|issue=|pages=237–238|doi=10.1901/jaba.1999.32-237|pmc=1284187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimulus control of operant behavior===
{{main|Stimulus control}}
Though initially operant behavior is emitted without an identified reference to a particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come under the control of stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called "discriminative stimuli." A so-called "[[three-term contingency]]" is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Example: a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to the kitchen when it hears the rattle of his/her food bag; a child reaches for candy when s/he sees it on a table.

====Discrimination, generalization &amp; context====
Most behavior is under stimulus control. Several aspects of this may be distinguished: 
*'''Discrimination''' typically occurs when a response is reinforced only in the presence of a specific stimulus. For example, a pigeon might be fed for pecking at a red light and not at a green light; in consequence, it pecks at red and stops pecking at green.  Many complex combinations of stimuli and other conditions have been studied; for example an organism might be reinforced on an interval schedule in the presence of one stimulus and on a ratio schedule in the presence of another. 
*'''Generalization''' is the tendency to respond to stimuli that are similar to a previously trained discriminative stimulus. For example, having been trained to peck at "red" a pigeon might also peck at "pink", though usually less strongly.
*'''Context''' refers to stimuli that are continuously present in a situation, like the walls, tables, chairs, etc. in a room, or the interior of an operant conditioning chamber. Context stimuli may come to control behavior as do discriminative stimuli, though usually more weakly.  Behaviors learned in one context may be absent, or altered, in another.  This may cause difficulties for behavioral therapy, because behaviors learned in the therapeutic setting may fail to occur elsewhere.

===Behavioral sequences: conditioned reinforcement and chaining===
Most behavior cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one. The scope of operant analysis is expanded through the idea of behavioral chains, which are sequences of responses bound together by the three-term contingencies defined above.  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a "conditioned reinforcer". For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may be used to reinforce "turning around" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence "noise – turn-around – light – press lever – food". Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.

===Escape and avoidance===
In escape learning, a behavior terminates an (aversive) stimulus. For example, shielding one's eyes from sunlight terminates the (aversive) stimulation of bright light in one's eyes.  (This is an example of negative reinforcement, defined above.) Behavior that is maintained by preventing a stimulus is called "avoidance,"  as, for example, putting on sun glasses before going outdoors.  Avoidance behavior raises the so-called "avoidance paradox", for, it may be asked, how can the non-occurrence of a stimulus serve as a reinforcer? This question is addressed by several theories of avoidance (see below).

Two kinds of experimental settings are commonly used: discriminated and free-operant avoidance learning.

====Discriminated avoidance learning====
A discriminated avoidance experiment involves a series of trials in which a neutral stimulus such as a light is followed by an aversive stimulus such as a shock. After the neutral stimulus appears an operant response such as a lever press prevents or terminate the aversive stimulus. In early trials, the subject does not make the response until the aversive stimulus has come on, so these early trials are called "escape" trials. As learning progresses, the subject begins to respond during the neutral stimulus and thus prevents the aversive stimulus from occurring. Such trials are called "avoidance trials." This experiment is said to involve classical conditioning because a neutral CS is paired with the aversive US; this idea underlies the two-factor theory of avoidance learning described below.

====Free-operant avoidance learning====
In free-operant avoidance a subject periodically receives an aversive stimulus (often an electric shock) unless an operant response is made; the response delays the onset of the shock. In this situation, unlike discriminated avoidance, no prior stimulus signals the shock. Two crucial time intervals determine the rate of avoidance learning. This first is the S-S (shock-shock) interval. This is time between successive shocks in the absence of a response. The second interval is the R-S (response-shock) interval. This specifies the time by which an operant response delays the onset of the next shock. Note that each time the subject performs the operant response, the R-S interval without shock begins anew.

====Two-process theory of avoidance====

This theory was originally proposed in order to explain discriminated avoidance learning, in which an organism learns to avoid an aversive stimulus by escaping from a signal for that stimulus. Two processes are involved: classical conditioning of the signal followed by operant conditioning of the escape response:

a) ''Classical conditioning of fear.'' Initially the organism experiences the pairing of a CS (conditioned stimulus) with an aversive US (unconditioned stimulus). The theory assumes that this pairing creates an association between the CS and the US through classical conditioning and, because of the aversive nature of the US, the CS comes to elicit a conditioned emotional reaction (CER) – "fear." b) ''Reinforcement of the operant response by fear-reduction.'' As a result of the first process, the CS now signals fear; this unpleasant emotional reaction serves to motivate operant responses, and responses that terminate the CS are reinforced by fear termination. Note that the theory does not say that the organism "avoids" the US in the sense of anticipating it, but rather that the organism "escapes" an aversive internal state that is caused by the CS.
Several experimental findings seem to run counter to two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes very slowly even when the initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response might be expected to extinguish (see [[Classical conditioning]]). Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"&gt;Pierce &amp; Cheney (2004) Behavior Analysis and Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operant or "one-factor" theory====
Some theorists suggest that avoidance behavior may simply be a special case of operant behavior maintained by its consequences. In this view the idea of "consequences" is expanded to include sensitivity to a pattern of events. Thus, in avoidance, the consequence of a response is a reduction in the rate of aversive stimulation. Indeed, experimental evidence suggests that a "missed shock" is detected as a stimulus, and can act as a reinforcer. Cognitive theories of avoidance take this idea a step farther. For example, a rat comes to "expect" shock if it fails to press a lever and to "expect no shock" if it presses it, and avoidance behavior is strengthened if these expectancies are confirmed.&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"/&gt;

===Operant hoarding===
Operant hoarding refers to the observation that rats reinforced in a certain way may allow food pellets to accumulate in a food tray instead of retrieving those pellets. In this procedure, retrieval of the pellets always instituted a one-minute period of [[extinction]] during which no additional food pellets were available but those that had been accumulated earlier could be consumed. This finding appears to contradict the usual finding that rats behave impulsively in situations in which there is a choice between a smaller food object right away and a larger food object after some delay. See [[schedules of reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=M.R.|year=1990|title=Operant hoarding: A new paradigm for the study of self-control|url=|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=53|issue=|pages=247–262|doi=10.1901/jeab.1990.53-247|pmc=1323010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurobiological correlates==
{{Further|Reward system}}
The first scientific studies identifying [[neuron]]s that responded in ways that suggested they encode for conditioned stimuli came from work by Mahlon deLong&lt;ref&gt;[http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/citation/34/3/414 "Activity of pallidal neurons during movement"], M.R. DeLong, ''J. Neurophysiol.'', 34:414–27, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RTR&amp;MRD"&gt;Richardson RT, DeLong MR (1991): Electrophysiological studies of the function of the nucleus basalis in primates. In Napier TC, Kalivas P, Hamin I (eds), ''The Basal Forebrain: Anatomy to Function'' (''Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology'', vol. 295. New York, Plenum, pp. 232–252&lt;/ref&gt; and by R.T. Richardson.&lt;ref name=RTR&amp;MRD/&gt; They showed that [[nucleus basalis]] neurons, which release [[Acetylcholine#Neuromodulatory Effects|acetylcholine]] broadly throughout the [[cerebral cortex]], are activated shortly after a conditioned stimulus, or after a primary reward if no conditioned stimulus exists. These neurons are equally active for positive and negative reinforcers, and have been shown to be related to [[neuroplasticity]] in many [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;PNAS 93:11219-24 1996, Science 279:1714–8 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also exists that [[Dopamine#Functions in the brain|dopamine]] is activated at similar times. There is considerable evidence that dopamine participates in both reinforcement and aversive learning.&lt;ref&gt;Neuron 63:244–253, 2009, Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, 3: Article 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Dopamine pathways project much more densely onto [[frontal cortex]] regions. [[Cholinergic]] projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the [[primary visual cortex]]. A study of patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in positive reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Frank, Lauren C. Seeberger, and Randall C. O'Reilly (2004) "By Carrot or by Stick: Cognitive Reinforcement Learning in Parkinsonism," ''Science'' 4, November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with aversive consequences than with positive reinforcement. Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, positive reinforcement proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.

A neurochemical process involving dopamine has been suggested to underlie reinforcement.  When an organism experiences a reinforcing stimulus, [[dopamine]] pathways in the brain are activated. This network of pathways "releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many [[dendrites]], thus broadcasting a global reinforcement signal to [[postsynaptic neuron]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Wolfram|year=1998|title=Predictive Reward Signal of Dopamine Neurons|url=|journal=The Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows recently activated synapses to increase their sensitivity to efferent (conducting outward) signals, thus increasing the probability of occurrence for the recent responses that preceded the reinforcement. These responses are, statistically, the most likely to have been the behavior responsible for successfully achieving reinforcement. But when the application of reinforcement is either less immediate or less contingent (less consistent), the ability of dopamine to act upon the appropriate synapses is reduced.

==Questions about the law of effect==
A number of observations seem to show that operant behavior can be established without reinforcement in the sense defined above. Most cited is the phenomenon of [[Shaping (psychology)#Autoshaping|autoshaping]]  (sometimes called "sign tracking"), in which a stimulus is repeatedly followed by reinforcement, and in consequence the animal begins to respond to the stimulus. For example, a response key is lighted and then food is presented. When this is repeated a few times a pigeon subject begins to peck the key even though food comes whether the bird pecks or not. Similarly, rats begin to handle small objects, such as a lever, when food is presented nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timberlake|first1=W|year=1983|title=Rats' responses to a moving object related to food or water: A behavior-systems analysis|url=|journal=Animal Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=11|issue=3|pages=309–320|doi=10.3758/bf03199781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuringer|first1=A.J.|year=1969|title=Animals respond for food in the presence of free food|url=|journal=Science|volume=166|issue=|pages=399–401|doi=10.1126/science.166.3903.399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strikingly, pigeons and rats persist in this behavior even when pecking the key or pressing the lever leads to less food (omission training).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=D.R.|last2=Williams|first2=H.|year=1969|title=Auto-maintenance in the pigeon: sustained pecking despite contingent non-reinforcement|url=|journal=J.

These observations and others appear to contradict the [[law of effect]], and they have prompted some researchers to propose new conceptualizations of operant reinforcement  (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=R.A.|last2=Gardner|first2=B.T.|year=1988|title=Feedforward vs feedbackward: An ethological alternative to the law of effect|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=11|issue=|pages=429–447|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00058258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, R.

In this view, many behaviors can be influenced by both classical contingencies (stimulus-response) and operant contingencies (response-reinforcement), and the experimenter's task is to work out how these interact.&lt;ref&gt;Locurto, C. M., Terrace, H. S., &amp; Gibbon, J. (1981) Autoshaping and conditioning theory. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of someone having a positive experience with a drug is easy to see how drug dependence and the law of effect works. The tolerance for a drug goes down as one continues to use it after having a positive experience with a certain amount the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Neil, Carlson; et al. (2007). Psychology The Science Of Behaviour. New Jersey, USA: Pearson Education Canada, Inc.,. p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; It will take more and more to get that same feeling. This is when the controlled substance in an experiment would have to be modified and the experiment would really begin. The law of work for psychologist B. F. Skinner almost half a century later on the principles of operant conditioning, "a learning process by which the effect, or consequence, of a response influences the future rate of production of that response.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Peter. Psychology, Worth, NY. 6th ed. pp 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Reinforcement and punishment are ubiquitous in human social interactions, and a great many applications of operant principles have been suggested and implemented. Following are a few examples.

===Applied behavior analysis===

{{main|Applied behavior analysis}}
[[Applied behavior analysis]] is the discipline initiated by [[B. F. Skinner]] that applies the principles of conditioning to the modification of socially significant human behavior. It uses the basic concepts of conditioning theory, including conditioned stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;), discriminative stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;), response (R), and reinforcing stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;rein&lt;/sup&gt; or S&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; for reinforcers, sometimes S&lt;sup&gt;ave&lt;/sup&gt; for aversive stimuli).&lt;ref name="Pierce 2004"/&gt; A conditioned stimulus controls behaviors developed through respondent (classical) conditioning, such as emotional reactions. The other three terms combine to form Skinner's "three-term contingency": a discriminative stimulus sets the occasion for responses that lead to reinforcement. Researchers have found the following protocol to be effective when they use the tools of operant conditioning to modify human behavior:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
# '''State goal'''  Clarify exactly what changes are to be brought about. For example, "reduce weight by 30 pounds."
# '''Monitor behavior'''  Keep track of behavior so that one can see whether the desired effects are occurring. For example, keep a chart of daily weights.
# '''Reinforce desired behavior'''  For example, congratulate the individual on weight losses.  With humans, a record of behavior may serve as a reinforcement. For example, when a participant sees a pattern of weight loss, this may reinforce continuance in a behavioral weight-loss program. However, individuals may perceive reinforcement which is intended to be positive as negative and vice versa. For example, a record of weight loss may act as negative  reinforcement if it reminds the individual how heavy they actually are. The [[token economy]], [[token economy|is]] an exchange system in which tokens are given as rewards for desired behaviors.  Tokens may later be exchanged for a desired prize or rewards such as power, prestige, goods or services.
# '''Reduce [[incentive]]s to perform undesirable behavior'''  For example, remove candy and fatty snacks from kitchen shelves.

Practitioners of applied behavior analysis (ABA) bring these procedures, and many variations and developments of them, to bear on a variety of socially significant behaviors and issues. In many cases, practitioners use operant techniques to develop constructive, socially acceptable behaviors to replace aberrant behaviors.  The techniques of ABA have been effectively applied in to such things as [[Lovaas model|early intensive behavioral interventions]] for children with an [[autism spectrum disorders|autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD)&lt;ref name="As-in-ABA"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dillenburger, K.|author2=Keenan, M.|year=2009|title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths|journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil|volume=34|issue=2|pages=193–95|doi=10.1080/13668250902845244|pmid=19404840}}&lt;/ref&gt; research on the principles influencing [[criminology|criminal behavior]], HIV prevention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DeVries, J.E.|author2=Burnette, M.M.|author3=Redmon, W.K.|year=1991|title=AIDS prevention: Improving nurses' compliance with glove wearing through performance feedback|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=24|issue=4|pages=705–11|doi=10.1901/jaba.1991.24-705|pmc=1279627|pmid=1797773}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservation of natural resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brothers, K.J.|author2=Krantz, P.J.|author3=McClannahan, L.E.|year=1994|title=Office paper recycling: A function of container proximity|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=27|issue=1|pages=153–60|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-153|pmc=1297784|pmid=16795821}}&lt;/ref&gt; education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dardig, Jill C.|author2=Heward, William L.|author3=Heron, Timothy E.|author4=Nancy A.

===Addiction and dependence===

Positive and negative reinforcement play central roles in the development and maintenance of [[addiction]] and [[drug dependence]]. An addictive drug is [[reward system|intrinsically rewarding]]; that is, it functions as [[#Primary reinforcers|a primary positive reinforcer]] of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it [[incentive salience]] (i.e., it is "wanted" or "desired"),&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Reinforcement principles for addiction medicine; from recreational drug use to psychiatric disorder|journal=Prog. Brain Res.|volume=223|issue=|pages=63–76|doi=10.1016/bs.pbr.2015.07.005|pmid=26806771|quote=Abused substances (ranging from alcohol to psychostimulants) are initially ingested at regular occasions according to their positive reinforcing properties. Importantly, repeated exposure to rewarding substances sets off a chain of secondary reinforcing events, whereby cues and contexts associated with drug use may themselves become reinforcing and thereby contribute to the continued use and possible abuse of the substance(s) of choice.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug [addiction], cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing&amp;nbsp;... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an “escape” response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).|vauthors=Edwards S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2012|title=From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation|journal=Eur.

The CS even takes on some incentive properties similar to its UCS. An attractive CS often elicits behavioral motivated approach, and sometimes an individual may even attempt to ‘consume’ the CS somewhat as its UCS (e.g., eat, drink, smoke, have sex with, take as drug). ‘Wanting’ of a CS can turn also turn the formerly neutral stimulus into an instrumental conditioned reinforcer, so that an individual will work to obtain the cue (however, there exist alternative psychological mechanisms for conditioned reinforcement too).|vauthors=Berridge KC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2015|title=Pleasure systems in the brain|journal=Neuron|volume=86|issue=3|pages=646–664|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018|pmc=4425246|pmid=25950633|quote=An important goal in future for addiction neuroscience is to understand how intense motivation becomes narrowly focused on a particular target. Addiction has been suggested to be partly due to excessive incentive salience produced by sensitized or hyper-reactive dopamine systems that produce intense ‘wanting’ (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). But why one target becomes more ‘wanted’ than all others has not been fully explained. In addicts or agonist-stimulated patients, the repetition of dopamine-stimulation of incentive salience becomes attributed to particular individualized pursuits, such as taking the addictive drug or the particular compulsions. In Pavlovian reward situations, some cues for reward become more ‘wanted’ more than others as powerful motivational magnets, in ways that differ across individuals (Robinson et al., 2014b; Saunders and Robinson, 2013).&amp;nbsp;... However, hedonic effects might well change over time. As a drug was taken repeatedly, mesolimbic dopaminergic sensitization could consequently occur in susceptible individuals to amplify ‘wanting’ (Leyton and Vezina, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2011; Wolf and Ferrario, 2010), even if opioid hedonic mechanisms underwent down-regulation due to continual drug stimulation, producing ‘liking’ tolerance. Incentive-sensitization would produce addiction, by selectively magnifying cue-triggered ‘wanting’ to take the drug again, and so powerfully cause motivation even if the drug became less pleasant (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).|vauthors=Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving.  In addition, stimuli associated with drug use&amp;nbsp;– e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use&amp;nbsp;– become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug.&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become [[#Secondary reinforcers|conditioned positive reinforcers]] of continued use.&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]] as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing [[relapse]] upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

In drug dependent individuals, negative reinforcement occurs when a drug is [[self-administration|self-administered]] in order to alleviate or "escape" the symptoms of [[physical dependence]] (e.g., [[tremor]]s and sweating) and/or [[psychological dependence]] (e.g., [[anhedonia]], restlessness, irritability, and anxiety) that arise during the state of [[drug withdrawal]].&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt;

===Animal training===
{{main|Animal training}}
Animal trainers and pet owners were applying the principles and practices of operant conditioning long before these ideas were named and studied, and animal training still provides one of the clearest and most convincing examples of operant control. Of the concepts and procedures described in this article, a few of the most salient are the following: 
(a) availability of primary reinforcement (e.g. a bag of dog yummies); 
(b) the use of secondary reinforcement, (e.g. sounding a clicker immediately after a desired response, then giving yummy); 
(c) contingency, assuring that reinforcement (e.g. the clicker) follows the desired behavior and not something else; 
(d) shaping,  as in gradually getting a dog to jump higher and higher; 
(e) intermittent reinforcement, as in gradually reducing the frequency of reinforcement to induce persistent behavior without satiation; 
(f) chaining, where a complex behavior is gradually constructed from smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;McGreevy, P &amp; Boakes, R."Carrots and Sticks: Principles of Animal Training".(Sydney: "Sydney University Press"., 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Example of animal training from Seaworld related on Operant conditioning

Animal training has effects on positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement. Schedules of reinforcements may play a big role on the animal training case.

=== Child behaviour – parent management training ===
{{Main|Parent management training}}
Providing positive reinforcement for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of parent management training. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child).&lt;ref name="Kazdin2010"&gt;Kazdin AE (2010). Problem-solving skills training and parent management training for oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. ''Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (2nd ed.),'' 211–226. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called "successive approximations").&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="PMTO"&gt;Forgatch MS, Patterson GR (2010). Parent management training — Oregon model: An intervention for antisocial behavior in children and adolescents. ''Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (2nd ed.),'' 159–78. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
{{main|Behavioral economics}}
{{further|Consumer demand tests (animals)}}
Both psychologists and economists have become interested in applying operant concepts and findings to the behavior of humans in the marketplace. An example 
is the analysis of consumer demand, as indexed by the amount of a commodity that is purchased. In economics, the degree to which price influences consumption is called "the price elasticity of demand." Certain commodities are more elastic than others; for example, a change in price of certain foods may have a large effect on the amount bought, while gasoline and other essentials may be less affected by price changes. In terms of operant analysis, such effects may be interpreted in terms of motivations of consumers and the relative value of the commodities as reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;Domjan, M. (2009). The Principles of Learning and Behavior. Wadsworth Publishing Company. 6th Edition. pages 244–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambling – variable ratio scheduling===
As stated earlier in this article, a variable ratio schedule yields reinforcement after the emission of an unpredictable number of responses.  This schedule typically generates rapid, persistent responding. Slot machines pay off on a variable ratio schedule, and they produce just this sort of persistent lever-pulling behavior in gamblers. The variable ratio payoff from slot machines and other forms of gambling has often been cited as a factor underlying gambling addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleda|first1=Miguel Ángel Pérez|last2=Nieto|first2=José Héctor Lozano|date=2012|title=Impulsivity, Intelligence, and Discriminating Reinforcement Contingencies in a Fixed-Ratio 3 Schedule|url=https://search-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/docview/1439791203?accountid=12378|journal=The Spanish Journal of Psychology|volume=3|issue=15|pages=922–929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nudge theory ===
{{Main|Nudge theory}}
Nudge theory (or nudge) is a concept in [[behavioural science]], [[political theory]] and [[economics]] which argues that indirect suggestions to try to achieve non-forced [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] can [[Social influence|influence]] the motives, incentives and [[decision making]] of groups and individuals, at least as effectively – if not more effectively – than direct instruction, legislation, or enforcement.

===Praise===
{{Main|Praise}}
The concept of praise as a means of behavioral reinforcement is rooted in B.F. Skinner's model of operant conditioning. Through this lens, praise has been viewed as a means of positive reinforcement, wherein an observed behavior is made more likely to occur by contingently praising said behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazdin|first1=Alan|title=History of behavior modification: Experimental foundations of contemporary research|date=1978|publisher=University Park Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of praise in promoting positive behaviors, notably in the study of teacher and parent use of praise on child in promoting improved behavior and academic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strain|first1=Phillip S.|last2=Lambert|first2=Deborah L.|last3=Kerr|first3=Mary Margaret|last4=Stagg|first4=Vaughan|last5=Lenkner|first5=Donna A.|date=1983|title=Naturalistic assessment of children's compliance to teachers' requests and consequences for compliance|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=16|issue=2|pages=243–249|doi=10.1901/jaba.1983.16-243|pmc=1307879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"/&gt; but also in the study of work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Charles R.|last2=Anderson|first2=D. Chris|last3=Abel|first3=Dawn M.|last4=Sergio|first4=Joseph P.|date=1988|title=Task clarification, performance feedback, and social praise: Procedures for improving the customer service of bank tellers|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=21|issue=1|pages=65–71|doi=10.1901/jaba.1988.21-65|pmc=1286094|pmid=16795713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise has also been demonstrated to reinforce positive behaviors in non-praised adjacent individuals (such as a classmate of the praise recipient) through vicarious reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Kazdin, 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kazdin|first1=Alan E.|date=1973|title=The effect of vicarious reinforcement on attentive behavior in the classroom|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=6|issue=1|pages=71–78|doi=10.1901/jaba.1973.6-71|pmc=1310808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise may be more or less effective in changing behavior depending on its form, content and delivery. In order for praise to effect positive behavior change, it must be contingent on the positive behavior (i.e., only administered after the targeted behavior is enacted), must specify the particulars of the behavior that is to be reinforced, and must be delivered sincerely and credibly.&lt;ref name="Brophy, 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brophy|first1=Jere|title=On praising effectively|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=1981|volume=81|issue=5|jstor=1001606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the effect of praise as a positive reinforcement strategy, numerous behavioral and cognitive behavioral interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols.&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonsen|first1=Brandi|last2=Fairbanks|first2=Sarah|last3=Briesch|first3=Amy|last4=Myers|first4=Diane|last5=Sugai|first5=George|date=2008|title=Evidence-based Practices in Classroom Management: Considerations for Research to Practice|journal=Education and Treatment of Children|volume=31|issue=1|pages=351–380|doi=10.1353/etc.0.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisz &amp; Kazdin, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisz|first1=John R.|last2=Kazdin|first2=Alan E.|title=Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents|date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management&lt;ref name="Simonsen et al 2008" /&gt; and parenting training interventions,&lt;ref name="Garland et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garland|first1=Ann F.|last2=Hawley|first2=Kristin M.|last3=Brookman-Frazee|first3=Lauren|last4=Hurlburt|first4=Michael S.|date=May 2008|title=Identifying Common Elements of Evidence-Based Psychosocial Treatments for Children's Disruptive Behavior Problems|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=47|issue=5|pages=505–514|doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816765c2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and behavioral rewards.

Several studies have been done on the effect cognitive-behavioral therapy and operant-behavioral therapy have on different medical conditions. When patients developed cognitive and behavioral techniques that changed their behaviors, attitudes, and emotions; their pain severity decreased. The results of these studies showed an influence of cognitions on pain perception and impact presented explained the general efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT) and Operant-Behavioral therapy (OBT).

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes praise, [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: may involve removing one from a negative situation
* [[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement.3B schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist – for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], yelling, the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using [[verbal abuse]], explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===Traumatic bonding===
{{Main|Traumatic bonding}}
Traumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Traumatic Bonding: The development of emotional attachments in battered women and other relationships of intermittent abuse|last = Dutton|first = |date = 1981|journal = Victimology: An International Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Painter|issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson2008"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5vA42Opyx9cC&amp;pg=PA84 Counselling Survivors of Domestic Abuse]''. Jessica Kingsley Publishers; 15 June 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-84642-811-1}}. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other source indicated that 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/traumatic-bonding&lt;/ref&gt;
'The necessary conditions for traumatic bonding are that one person must dominate the other and that the level of abuse chronically spikes and then subsides. The relationship is characterized by periods of permissive, compassionate, and even affectionate behavior from the dominant person, punctuated by intermittent episodes of intense abuse. To maintain the upper hand, the victimizer manipulates the behavior of the victim and limits the victim's options so as to perpetuate the power imbalance. Any threat to the balance of dominance and submission may be met with an escalating cycle of punishment ranging from seething intimidation to intensely violent outbursts. The victimizer also isolates the victim from other sources of support, which reduces the likelihood of detection and intervention, impairs the victim's ability to receive countervailing self-referent feedback, and strengthens the sense of unilateral dependency...The traumatic effects of these abusive relationships may include the impairment of the victim's capacity for accurate self-appraisal, leading to a sense of personal inadequacy and a subordinate sense of dependence upon the dominating person. Victims also may encounter a variety of unpleasant social and legal consequences of their emotional and behavioral affiliation with someone who perpetrated aggressive acts, even if they themselves were the recipients of the aggression. '.

===Military Psychology===
{{Main|Military Psychology}}

Human beings have an innate resistance to killing and are reluctant to act in a direct, aggressive way towards members of their own species, even to save life.  This resistance to killing has caused infantry to be remarkably inefficient throughout the history of military warfare.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Killing: the Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society|last=Grossman|first=Dave|publisher=Little Brown|year=1995|isbn=978-0316040938|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon was not understood until [[S.L.A. Marshall]] (Brigadier General and military historian) undertook interview studies of WWII infantry immediately following combat engagement. Marshall's well-known and controversial book, Men Against Fire, revealed that only 15% of soldiers fired their rifles with the purpose of killing in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Against Fire: the Problem of Battle Command in Future War|last=Marshall|first=S.L.A.|publisher=Infantry Journal|year=1947|isbn=978-0-8061-3280-8|location=Washington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following acceptance of Marshall's research by the US Army in 1946, the Human Resources Research Office of the US Army began implementing new training protocols which resemble operant conditioning methods.  Subsequent applications of such methods increased the percentage of soldiers able to kill to around 50% in Korea and over 90% in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Revolutions in training included replacing traditional pop-up firing ranges with three-dimensional, man-shaped, pop-up targets which collapsed when hit.  This provided immediate feedback and acted as positive reinforcement for a soldier's behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.killology.com/behavioral-psychology|title=Behavioral Psychology|last=Murray, K.A., Grossman, D., &amp; Kentridge, R.W.|first=|date=21 October 2018|website=https://www.killology.com/behavioral-psychology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other improvements to military training methods have included the timed firing course; more realistic training; high repetitions; praise from superiors; marksmanship rewards; and group recognition. Negative reinforcement includes peer accountability or the requirement to retake courses.  Modern military training conditions [[Midbrain|mid-brain]] response to combat pressure by closely simulating actual combat, using mainly Pavlovian [[Classical conditioning|Classical Conditioning]] and [[B. F. Skinner|Skinnerian]] operant Conditioning (both forms of [[Behaviorism]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern marksmanship training is such an excellent example of behaviorism that it has been used for years in the introductory psychology course taught to all cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point as a classic example of operant conditioning. In the 1980s, during a visit to West Point, B.F. Skinner identified modern military marksmanship training as a near-perfect application of operant conditioning.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lt. Col. Dave Grossman states about operant conditioning and US Military training that:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely possible that no one intentionally sat down to use operant conditioning or behavior modification techniques to train soldiers in this area…But from the standpoint of a psychologist who is also a historian and a career soldier, it has become increasingly obvious to me that this is exactly what has been achieved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his book, On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society, Grossman overviews the main factors influencing individual acts of aggression as:

* [[Stanley Milgram|'''Stanley Milgram's''']] (US Social Psychologist) '''Killing Factors:''' include '''t'''he demands of authority, group absolution, and distance from the victim (including emotional or psychological distancing).
* Ben '''Shalit''' (Israeli military psychologist) '''Factors:''' Shalit's ''Psychology of Conflict and Combat'' considers tactical circumstances such as available strategies, threat to the killer, and payoff for killer in terms of personal gain and enemy loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Conflict and Combat|last=Shalit|first=Ben|publisher=Praeger|year=1998|isbn=978-0275927530|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Predisposition of the killer:''' includes natural predisposition, training, conditioning and recent experiences of the soldier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Psychological distancing includes physical distance, dehumanizing the enemy (including through [[propaganda]]), and the impersonal use of technology such as night vision, drones, and airstrikes.  Modern conditioning techniques have had parallel effects on law enforcement firing rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Video games===
{{Main|Compulsion loop}}
The majority{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} of [[video games]] are designed around a [[compulsion loop]], adding a type of positive reinforcement through a variable rate schedule to keep the player playing. This can lead to the pathology of [[video game addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hopson: [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131494/behavioral_game_design.php Behavioral Game Design], [[Gamasutra]], 27 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Loot box}}
As part of a trend in the [[video game monetization|monetization of video games]] during the 2010s, some games offered [[loot box]]es as rewards or as items purchasable by real world funds. Boxes contains a random selection of in-game items. The practice has been tied to the same methods that slot machines and other gambling devices dole out rewards, as it follows a variable rate schedule. While the general perception that loot boxes are a form of gambling, the practice is only classified as such in a few countries. However, methods to use those items as [[virtual currency]] for [[online gambling]] or trading for real world money has created a [[skin gambling]] market that is under legal evaluation.&lt;ref name="eg pegi"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-11-are-loot-boxes-gambling | title = Are loot boxes gambling? | first = Vic | last = Hood | date = 12 October 2017 | accessdate = 12 October 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace culture of fear ===
{{Main|Culture of fear|Organizational culture|Toxic workplace|Workplace bullying}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]]: leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name="ashforth"&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations'', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent [[negative reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name="braiker"/&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies are tolerated, a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the many reasons proposed for the dramatic costs associated with healthcare is the practice of defensive medicine.  Prabhu reviews the article by Cole and discusses how the responses of two groups of neurosurgeons are classic operant behavior.  One group practice in a state with restrictions on medical lawsuits and the other group with no restrictions.  The group of neurosurgeons were queried anonymously on their practice patterns.  The physicians changed their practice in response to a negative feedback (fear from lawsuit) in the group that practiced in a state with no restrictions on medical lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Operant Conditioning and the Practice of Defensive Medicine.

'''PETases''' are an [[esterase]] class of [[enzyme]]s that [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the [[hydrolysis]] of  poly (ethylene terephthalate) [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] plastic to [[monomer]]ic [[2-Hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid|mono-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate]] (MHET). The idealized chemical reaction is (where n is the number of [[monomer]]s in the [[polymer]] chain):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:(ethylene terephthalate)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → (ethylene terephthalate)&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; + MHET

Trace amount of the PET breaks down to [[Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate|bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate]] (BHET). PETases can also break down PEF-plastic ([[Polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate|polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate]]), which is a bioderived PET replacement. PETases can't catalyze the hydrolysis of [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[polyester]]s like [[polybutylene succinate]] or [[polylactic acid]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Austin HP, Allen MD, Donohoe BS, Rorrer NA, Kearns FL, Silveira RL, Pollard BC, Dominick G, Duman R, El Omari K, Mykhaylyk V, Wagner A, Michener WE, Amore A, Skaf MS, Crowley MF, Thorne AW, Johnson CW, Woodcock HL, McGeehan JE, Beckham GT | title = Characterization and engineering of a plastic-degrading aromatic polyesterase | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 19 | pages = E4350-E4357 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29666242 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1718804115 | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical Reaction - PETase Hydrolysis ==

PETase hydrolyses PET (polyethylene terephthalate) into soluble building blocks due to reaction with water which is a bioconversion of plastics. &lt;ref&gt;Chan, Allison (2016). "The Future of Bacteria Cleaning Our Plastic Waste". https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7xb0c7hr/qt7xb0c7hr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; PET is a polymer composed of ester bond-linked terephthalate (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). A high molecular weight and other properties make PET a great utilizing plastic. By the hydrolysis reaction PET hydrolyzing enzymes decompose PET into building blocks which is helpful for the environment. During the hydrolyzing PET, the enzyme produces mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), TPA ,and bis-2(hydroxyethyl) TPA (BHET). &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The novel bacteria called ''Ideonella sakaieensis'' is isolating and it utilize PET as an energy and carbon source. The ''deonella sakaieensis'' sticks to the surface of PET  and keep a cutinase enzyme that allow PET to degrade. That reaction allows to degrade PET, and make it less harmful for the environment. 

==MHET breakdown in ''I. sakaiensis''==
MHET is broken down in ''I. sakaiensis'' by the action of [[MHETase]] enzyme to [[terephthalic acid]] and [[ethylene glycol]]. These are environmentally harmless as they are broken down further to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida S, Hiraga K, Takehana T, Taniguchi I, Yamaji H, Maeda Y, Toyohara K, Miyamoto K, Kimura Y, Oda K | title = A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate) | journal = Science | volume = 351 | issue = 6278 | pages = 1196–9 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26965627 | doi = 10.1126/science.aad6359 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6278/1196.long | lay-url = https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/press_releases/2016/cb96u90000005501-att/160330_2.pdf | lay-date = 2016-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''I. sakaiensis'' bacterium  adhere to the PET surface and release a unique enzyme, similar to cutinase, with the ability to degrade PET.

==Mutations==

In 2018 scientists from the University of Portsmouth with the collaboration of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the United States Department of Energy developed a mutant of this PETase that degrades PET faster than the one in its natural state. In this study it was also shown that PETases can degrade [[polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate]] (PEF).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Classifications of PETase-like enzymes.jpg|thumb|Figure A. Classification of PETase-like enzymes.  Figure B. A comparison of residues between two type II sub-classes and type I class of PETase-like enzymes. &lt;ref&gt;Figure 2. Chan, Allison (2016). "The Future of Bacteria Cleaning Our Plastic Waste." https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7xb0c7hr/qt7xb0c7hr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are approximately 69 PETase-like enzymes comprising a variety of diverse organisms, and there are two classifications of these enzymes including type I and type II. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is suggested that 57 enzymes fall into the type I category whereas the rest fall into the type II group, including the PETase enzyme found in the ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]].'' Within all 69 PETase-like enzymes, there exists the same three residues within the active site, suggesting that the catalytic mechanism is the same in all forms of PETase-like enzymes.

In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 |work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

==Definitional difficulties==
Predeterminism is difficult to discuss because its simple definition can logically lead to a variety of similar, complex (and, perhaps, better defined) concepts in [[metaphysics]], [[theology]], and the philosophy of [[free will]]. The term ''predeterminism'' suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). Due to this, predeterminism and the similar term [[predetermination]] are easily and often confused or associated with ideas ranging, for instance, from the [[Physicalism|physicalist]] (and often scientific) notion of ''[[causal determinism]]'' to even the theological (and often religious) notion of ''[[predestination]]''.

A [[secular]] example to try to illustrate predeterminism is that a fetus's future physical, emotional, and other personal characteristics as a matured human being may be considered "predetermined" by heredity, [[i.e.]] derived from a chain of events going back long before her eventual birth. However, one of the difficulties with defining predeterminism using this example is that the word ''predetermine'' necessarily implies a conscious being "doing" the determining ahead of time. With regards to predetermined heredity, a conscious being (perhaps a genetic scientist) is presumed to be the one speculating on what the fetus's personal characteristics will turn out to be, for example, based on looking at the genomes of the fetus and its ancestors. If there were not this conscious entity, the scientist, then one could say merely that the fetus's characteristics are ''determined'' by heredity, rather than ''pre''determined. Predeterminism necessarily implies, at the very least, a passive but all-knowing observer, if not an active planner, designer, or manipulator (of the fetus's personal characteristics). This basic scientific idea of hereditary determination, though, already fulfills the definition of [[causal determinism]], a metaphysical concept.

While determinism usually refers to a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events ''before'' they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. This creates a definitional conflict because predeterminism, by this understanding, logically leads to a belief in the existence of a conscious being who must determine ''all'' actions and events in advance and who, possessing such seeming [[omnipotence]], almost certainly operates outside of the laws of nature. This conscious entity is probably, then, a being who is omnipotent as well as presumably [[supernatural]] and [[omniscient]]. The definitional confusion here is that there is already a name for this very concept: [[predestination]]. Predestination asserts that a supremely powerful being has, in advance, fixed all events and outcomes in the universe; it is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinist]]s in [[Christian]] theology.

Likewise, the doctrine of [[fatalism]] already explicitly attributes all events and outcomes to the will of a (vaguer) higher power such as fate or destiny. Furthermore, in philosophic debates about the compatibility of [[free will]] and [[determinism]], some argue that ''predeterminism'' back to the origin of the universe is simply what philosophers mean by the more common term "determinism." Others have suggested that the term "[[self-determination]]" be used to describe actions as merely "determined" by an agent's reasons, motives, and desires.

When various interpretation of the word ''predeterminism'' can be defined even better by other terms, such as the aforementioned determinism, predestination, or fatalism, then the definition of predeterminism itself appears awkward, unclear, and perhaps even worthless in terms of practical or philosophic discussion.

==R. E. Hobart==

R. E. Hobart is the pseudonym of [[Dickinson S. Miller]], a student of [[William James]] who was later one of James' closest personal friends and for some years a colleague in the Harvard philosophy department. Hobart (Miller) criticized the core idea of James' ''The Will to Believe'', namely that it was acceptable to hold religious faith in the absence of evidence for or against that faith. James referred to Miller as "my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy."

Nearly 25 years after James' death, R. E. Hobart published a short article in ''Mind'' in 1934 that is considered one of the definitive statements of [[determinism]] and [[compatibilism]]. It was entitled ''Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It''.&lt;ref name="Hobart"&gt;R. E. Hobart "Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It," ''Mind'', Vol XLIII, No. 169, January, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobart's compatibilism was similar to earlier landmark positions by [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume]], as refined in the 19th-century compatibilist views of [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], and [[F. H. Bradley]]. But unlike them Hobart explicitly did not endorse ''strict'' logical or physical determinism, and he explicitly did endorse the existence of [http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/possibilities.html alternative possibilities], which can depend on absolute [[Randomness|chance]].

He was writing just a few years after the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[Indeterminacy principle|indeterminacy]], and also makes passing mention of the ancient "swerve" of the atoms espoused by [[Epicurus]]:

'I am not maintaining that determinism is true...it is not here affirmed that there are no small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of absolute chance.'&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

'"We say," I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose". Two courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose either.'&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Hobart supports the existence of alternative possibilities for action and the capability to do otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/possibilities.html Alternative Possibilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

And he clearly prefers "determination" to "determinism." Hobart's article is frequently misquoted as "Free Will as Involving Determinism."&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ncN3TuDQ7cC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Free+Will+As+Involving+Determinism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Q3OHYTn66&amp;sig=Rj7QYcAoy8x7oLrfDO9ZtACXhgk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vqu6S7jgEcWqlAfc1-3XBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Free%20Will%20As%20Involving%20Determinism%22&amp;f=false Fischer and Ravizza, Perspectives on moral responsibility], and even in the [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article-bibliography/V014 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731000518/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article-bibliography/V014 |date=2009-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippa Foot==

[[Philippa Foot]] is one who misquoted Hobart's title, but who had the same misgivings about determinism.

In 1957 she wrote an article in The Philosophical Review entitled "Free Will As Involving Determinism."

Nevertheless, she criticized arguments that free will requires indeterminism, and in particular the idea that one could not be held responsible for "chance" actions chosen for no particular reason.

Her article begins with the observation that determinism has become widely accepted as compatible with free will.

"The idea that free will can be reconciled with the strictest determinism is now very widely accepted. To say that a man acted freely is, it is often suggested, to say that he was not constrained, or that he could have done otherwise if he had chosen, or something else of that kind; and since these things could be true even if his action was determined it seems that there could be room for free will even within a universe completely subject to causal laws."&lt;ref name="Foot"&gt;Philippa Foot "Free Will As Involving Determinism," ''The Philosophical Review'', vol LXVI, (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|439}}

Foot doubted that the ordinary language meaning of saying our actions are "determined" by motives has the same meaning as strict physical determinism, which assumes a causal law that determines every event in the future of the universe.

She notes that our normal use of "determined" does not imply universal determinism.

"For instance, an action said to be determined by the desires of the man who does it is not necessarily an action for which there is supposed to be a sufficient condition. In saying that it is determined by his desires we may mean merely that he is doing something that he wants to do, or that he is doing it for the sake of something else that he wants. There is nothing in this to suggest determinism in [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s sense."&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;{{rp|441}}

Foot cited Bertrand Russell's view of causal determinism:

"The law of universal causation . . . may be enunciated as follows:...given the state of the whole universe,...every previous and subsequent event can theoretically be determined."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8252">Between 2009 and 2014, there were large numbers of refugees who were kidnapped and held in [[Sinai]]. Refugees from various countries were transported to Sinai and held hostage by members of [[Bedouin tribe]]s. Typically, the hostages were forced to give up phone numbers of relatives and were tortured with the relatives on the phone, in order to obtain ransoms in the range of $20,000–$40,000. If the families couldn't pay, the hostages were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/beyondslavery/lucia-heisterkamp/tortured-for-ransom-extortion-on-migrant-routes|title=Tortured for ransom: extortion on migrant routes|date=2016-10-05|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sz/&gt;&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Many of the hostages, refugees from [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]] or [[Eritrea]], paid traffickers for transport to the [[Israel]]i border, hoping to cross into that country. They were instead taken hostage by those they had paid.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Others were taken by force from refugee camps in Sudan, as reported by the United Nations Refugee Agency in January 2013.&lt;ref name=un/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] published a report about numerous kidnappings in 2011-2013 in the [[Ash Showak|Shagarab refugee camps]] in eastern Sudan, carried out by members of the [[Rashaida]] tribe, with victims being sold off to gangs in Sinai, where they would be brutally mistreated to extract ransoms.&lt;ref name=ai/&gt; In 2012 Israel constructed a fence at its border to Sinai to keep out African migrants, causing the Rashaida to lose income from transporting refugees to the border; they then started to concentrate on kidnappings instead.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

The phenomenon was first documented by Israeli organization [http://hotline.org.il/ Hotline for Refugees and Migrants] in 2010 in a report entitled ''[http://hotline.org.il/en/publication/deadofthewilderness/ In the Dead of the Wilderness].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hotline for Refugees and Migrants  {{!}} "The Dead of the Wilderness": Testimonies from Sinai Desert, 2010|url = http://hotline.org.il/en/publication/deadofthewilderness/|website = hotline.org.il|access-date = 2016-02-24|last = Felix007.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was based on  testimonies they collected from 60 asylum seekers, mostly Eritreans, who had been tortured for ransom in the Sinai desert. Staff and volunteers of the organisation mostly met the survivors in Israeli immigration detention centers where they were visiting recently arrived asylum seekers. Many people arrived with serious injuries, and some women arrived pregnant as a result of  rape. Seriously injured people were immediately taken to hospital upon arrival in Israel.

German journalist [[Michael Obert]] visited the region in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obert.de/text/sinai&lt;/ref&gt; met a victim and a torturer and talked to an activist of the New Generation Foundation for Human Rights in [[Al-Arish]]. The organization has documented hundreds of cases of mutilated corpses of Africans found in the desert. Obert reported that some Islamist militants were using force to try to stop the kidnapper gangs. He described a lawless and impoverished region where children were looking forward to grow up to become kidnappers.&lt;ref name=sz/&gt;

A 2011 CNN documentary reported on Eritrean refugees who had paid Bedouin traffickers for transport to Israel but were instead held in bondage before their organs were harvested.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt; In 2013 the Al-Arish activist presented photos of corpses from which organs had been professionally removed and claimed to have seen mobile operation units.&lt;ref name="sz" /&gt;

In February 2011, [[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel]] reported that some 190 Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees were being held hostage in Sinai, and that numerous refugee women reported having been raped on their trip to Israel.&lt;ref name="phr" /&gt; In 2013, the same organization estimated that about 1,000 refugees were being held in Sinai hostage camps, and that in total about 7,000 refugees had been abused in these camps, resulting in more than 4,000 deaths.&lt;ref name="sz" /&gt;

In a 2013 report, [[This American Life]] reported on the experiences of journalist Meron Estefanos, who has helped publicize the kidnappings, and helped get some hostages freed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979 limits the number of Egyptian forces that can be deployed in Sinai.&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], security forces largely abandoned the peninsula, but they returned in 2014 to fight unrelated terrorist networks, and the practice of kidnapping refugees moved to Libya and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/502/this-call-may-be-recorded-to-save-your-life|title=This Call May Be Recorded...

A '''relaxation technique''' (also known as '''relaxation training''') is any method, process, procedure, or activity that helps a person to relax; to attain a state of increased [[calmness]]; or otherwise reduce levels of [[pain]], [[anxiety]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]] or [[anger]].  Relaxation techniques are often employed as one element of a wider [[stress management]] program and can decrease muscle tension, lower the blood pressure and slow heart and breath rates, among other health benefits.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9A0DE5D81E3AF930A25756C0A960948260# |title= Relaxation: Surprising benefits detected |first= Daniel |last= Goleman |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= May 13, 1986 |accessdate= May 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People respond to stress in different ways, namely, by becoming overwhelmed, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] or both.&lt;ref name="helpguide"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://helpguide.org/mental/stress_relief_meditation_yoga_relaxation.htm |title= Relaxation Techniques for Stress Relief |first1= Lawrence |last1= Robinson |first2= Robert |last2= Segal |first3= Jeanne |last3= Segal |first4= Melinda |last4= Smith |website= helpguide.org |date= August 2011 |accessdate= December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]], [[QiGong]], [[Taiji]], and [[Pranayama]] that includes deep breathing tend to calm people who are overwhelmed by stress, while rhythmic exercise improves the mental and physical health of those who are depressed. People who encounter both symptoms simultaneously, feeling depressed in some ways and overexcited in others, may do best by walking or performing yoga techniques that are focused on strength.&lt;ref name=helpguide /&gt;

==Background==

Research has indicated that removing stress helps to increase a person's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/exercise-and-stress/SR00036 |title= Exercise and stress: Get moving to combat stress |author= [[Mayo Clinic]] Staff |date= July 21, 2012 |website= mayoclinic.com |publisher= Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research released in the 1980s indicated stronger ties between stress and health and showed benefits from a wider range of relaxation techniques than had been previously known.  This research received national media attention, including a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article in 1986.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

==Uses==
People use relaxation techniques for the following reasons, among others:

* [[Anger management]]
* [[Anxiety attack]]s
* [[Cardiac]] health
* [[Hypnotherapy in childbirth|Childbirth]]
* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
* General [[quality of life|well-being]]

* [[High blood pressure]]
* Preparation for [[hypnosis]]
* [[Immune system]] support
* [[Insomnia]]
* [[Pain management]]
* [[Relaxation (psychology)]]
* [[Stress management]]

==Techniques==

Various techniques are used by individuals to improve their state of relaxation.  Some of the methods are performed alone; some require the help of another person (often a trained professional); some involve movement, some focus on stillness; while other methods involve different elements.

Certain relaxation techniques known as "formal and passive relaxation exercises" are generally performed while sitting or lying quietly, with minimal movement and involve "a degree of withdrawal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Jonathan C. |chapter= Ch. 3: The Psychology of Relaxation |title= Principles and Practice of Stress Management |edition= 3rd |editor1-last= Lehrer |editor1-first= Paul M. |editor2-first= Robert L. |editor2-last= Woolfolk |editor3-first= Wesley E. |editor3-last= Sime |year= 2007|isbn= 9781606238288 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=T-hUvwUNjvUC&amp;pg=PA38 38] |ref= {{SfnRef|Leher, Woolfolk &amp; Sime (eds.)|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
*[[Autogenic training]]
*[[Biofeedback]]
*[[Deep breathing]]
*[[Meditation]]
*Mindbody relaxation
*[[Pranayama]]
*[[Progressive muscle relaxation]]
*[[Qigong]]
*[[Self-hypnosis]]
*[[Transcendental Meditation technique]] 
*[[Mental image|Visualization]]
*[[Yoga Nidra]]
*[[Zen Yoga]]

Movement-based relaxation methods incorporate [[Physical exercise|exercise]] such as [[walking]], [[gardening]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], [[Qigong]], and more.  Some forms of [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] are helpful in promoting a state of increased relaxation. Examples include [[massage]], [[acupuncture]], the [[Feldenkrais Method]], [[myotherapy]], [[reflexology]] and [[Self-control|self-regulation]].

Some relaxation methods can also be used during other activities, for example,  [[autosuggestion]] and [[prayer]]. At least one study has suggested that listening to certain types of music, particularly [[new-age music]] and [[classical music]], can increase feelings associated with relaxation, such as peacefulness and a sense of ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Jonathan C. |chapter= Ch. 3: The Psychology of Relaxation |title= Principles and Practice of Stress Management |edition= 3rd |editor1-last= Lehrer |editor1-first= Paul M. |editor2-first= Robert L. |editor2-last= Woolfolk |editor3-first= Wesley E. |editor3-last= Sime |year= 2007|isbn= 9781606238288 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=T-hUvwUNjvUC&amp;pg=PA46 46–7] |ref= {{SfnRef|Leher, Woolfolk &amp; Sime (eds.)|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A technique growing in popularity is [[isolation tank|flotation therapy]], which is the use of a float tank in which a solution of [[Magnesium sulfate|Epsom salt]] is kept at skin temperature to provide effortless floating.  Research in USA and Sweden has demonstrated a powerful and profound relaxation after twenty minutes.  In some cases, floating may reduce pain and stress and has been shown to release [[endorphins]].

Even actions as simple as a walk in the park have been shown to aid feelings of relaxation, regardless of the initial reason for the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Irvine |first1= KN |last2= Warber |first2= SL |last3= Devine-Wright |first3= P |last4= Gaston |first4= K |title= Understanding urban green space as a health resource: A qualitative comparison of visit motivation and derived effects among park users in Sheffield, UK |journal= International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |pages= 417–42 |year= 2013 |doi= 10.3390/ijerph10010417 |url= http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/10/1/417 |pmid= 23340602 |pmc= 3564151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ride-sharing is defined as multiple persons, not related to one another, using the same transportation, typically a car, to reach their respective destinations. People can share rides on a short notice, which increases the efficiency of travel. Most often, the riders are not related to one another, and the shared vehicle will eventually reach each rider's destination, as they are in close enough proximity that traveling together is efficient. Ride-share platforms offer a platform where drivers and riders can connect, agree on a pre-determined price calculated by the application, wait time, and location of driver, essentially a way to contact their driver and gain travel information without having to release personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hahn|first=Robert|date=January 2017|title=The Ridesharing Revolution: Economic Survey and Synthesis|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ridesharing-oup-1117-v6-brookings1.pdf|journal=More Equal By Design: Economic design responses to inequality|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ride-sharing is different than [[Carpool|carpooling]] because the main objective of carpooling is that the driver most likely related to those who are receiving the ride and are purposely recruited for the benefit of the shared parties. Additionally, ride-sharing is mainly hailed through mobile applications, something that sets it apart from normal carpooling, which is primarily set up based on people who already know one another.

Ride-sharing is primarily accessed through a mobile application, and because of this, there are several dangers that could lead to an infringement of the user's privacy and their personal information. Mostly, ride-sharing privacy is relevant to a user's location because of the app's ability to pinpoint in live time a user's position. Ride sharing applications primarily use [[Location-based service|location-based services (LBS)]] in order to be able to trace the user's location. With location sharing services, there is a need to address privacy protection while still maintaining high accuracy in location pinpointing. Unlike how in online transactions there is a third party or some sort of secure form of transaction, location sharing services cannot follow this same standard. Someone’s privacy could also be in danger because of the ride-share applications' current tracking of the user's location or tracing an IP address so the user does not even have to voluntarily input information about their location, yet they are still being tracked.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pingley|first=Aniket|last2=Yu|first2=Wei|last3=Zhang|first3=Nan|last4=Fu|first4=Xinwen|last5=Zhao|first5=Wei|date=2012-07|title=A context-aware scheme for privacy-preserving location-based services|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2012.03.022|journal=Computer Networks|volume=56|issue=11|pages=2551–2568|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.03.022|issn=1389-1286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if the user data of locations they interact with falls into the wrong hands, a potential abuse of the data whether that be creating an online profile based on cumulative data of the individual or companies able to share personal information around multiple sources could arise.

There have been several proposed solutions to the applications in order to try and alter the side-effects of LBS. The amount of protection has to be catered differently than another application because of the real time location aspect. Factors are always changing in real time, so these services cannot accurately update if it is limited to what data it is able to access, but they are good starts being able to try and eliminate these issues in the future.

== History ==
Ride-sharing as a concept has been around since World War II.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Nelson D.|last2=Shaheen|first2=Susan A.|date=2012-01|title=Ridesharing in North America: Past, Present, and Future|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt3qm8k0c5/qt3qm8k0c5.pdf|journal=Transport Reviews|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=93–112|doi=10.1080/01441647.2011.621557|issn=0144-1647|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until around 1990s when programs were starting to digitalize, although the concept had long been established since. Some of the first telephone-based ride-matching programs were Bellevue Smart Traveler from The [[University of Washington]], Los Angeles Smart Traveler from Los Angeles's Commuter Transportation Services, and Rideshare Express from Sacramento Rideshare.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; However, in these telephone-based programs the operational costs started exceeding their revenues and an alternative, internet and email driven ride-matches, was proposed. This program was tested on a closed campus, and it was only available to University of Washington related people, which proved highly successful. Two other programs, ATHENA and MINERVA were both computerized but faced unsuccessful endings.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;*additional citation* When the internet was created in the 1990s, online ride-matching was created. Websites originally had lists or forums that people could get information for carpooling options from, but the internet provided the ability to develop platforms, which were more dynamic and interactive. Yet, this concept did not kick-start because the mechanics were not any different than traditional carpooling, only the ability to find them had been made easier. Since carpooling and ride-sharing were not a very popular option, the smaller population who did participate already had set agendas so timing wise it was not helpful to those who needed transportation outside of a regular workday commute. Larger scale companies started becoming interested in partnering with ride-matching companies in order to spread the ride-sharing platform which are gaining more traction as availability of mobile technology and thus accessibility not from a stationary point is becoming more prominent.

== User input/privacy with software data ==
=== Software ===
==== User Input Features ====
Ride-sharing applications have several user input features:

* Users can input their pick-up destination.
* Users can input their drop-off destination.
* Users can save a home or work address.
* Users can save unique places if they are visited frequently.
* Users can also pinpoint their exact location on a map.
* Users can save their credit card information for easy access.
* Users can invite their friends which the app pulls from their phone contact information.
* Users can create their own profile.
* Users can see the profiles of their potential drivers as well as any reviews that come with it.

Ride-sharing companies also have several tracking features that are unclear in terms of what user information is being collected:

* The application automatically connects and tracks the user's current location and surrounding areas, so when the app opens, an accurate map is immediately opened as the home page and the location of the user are immediately tracked.
* Recent addresses that have been set as either pick-up or drop-off locations are in kept in the search history.
* Letting the app connect to personal data that is stored in the phone, such as access to contacts, can let the app access more than just phone numbers (addresses, personal information) which have been stored under the contact in the phone.

Uber has an option where user privacy can potentially be forgotten and they are aware of what data they are collecting from the user and are being transparent *citation*:

* Ability to share or un-share live location as well as having location settings always on.
* Ability to receive notifications about your account and trip.
* Ability to remove stored contacts which adds on another way that can link two people together if someone is tracking someone's information.
* Ability to share trip details with 911 in case of emergency.
* Ability to sync personal calendar with the app.

=== Hardware ===
==== Camera inside the car ====
Very recently has the presence of physical cameras been implemented in ride-share vehicles. Prior to this, the only time cameras were related to cars were traffic cameras and police cars. However, there has been a rise in the amount of continuous-recording cameras that are not just surveilling the road and keeping track of what happens outside the car. The implementation of cameras inside cars to record interactions between drivers and riders is something new. However, people are concerned about their privacy because this recording goes on during their trip duration, and they do not verbally consent to their recording. However, they consent to being in a person's car, hence they must abide to the driver's rules. There are federal rules about audio recordings, federal laws only requires "one party consent". *citation*

==== Government policies about recording ====
According to the [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]], there are policies regarding recording audio conversations, including clarifications about the "one-party consent" rule that comes with it. Regarding audio conversations, it is illegal to record a conversation for which one is not partaking in. However, they are allowed to record if they are a member of the conversation themselves, without having to receive consent from the other party or having to let them know there is recording happening.

== Concerns ==
=== The potential abuse of location-tracking ===
There are several areas where data could potentially be abused by the application knowing the rider's location. Since trip data is collected, if the ride-sharing company has partnerships with corporations, their partners can use the data to predict future locations and be able to pinpoint an individual's interests and market towards them. *citation* Corporations can collect information on what types of stores and what brands are most often visited by a user and can build an online profile, which is traceable. This can also relate to advertising companies, which can target personal interests and alter their online interactions to start showing ads that are catered and specific towards where the user has visited. *citation*

There are some cases where bad implications could arise. If the user were to partake in something related to their political standpoints, companies can store this for later information and potentially use it against the user if they come into contact with the company in a professional setting. This can apply to medicinal, religious, or legal affiliations as well, that a user's location and places visited cannot be justified when being looked at from an outside perspective.

Relating more to the online profile created of the user, if a person solely relies on ride-sharing services to get around, one can track how long the user has been away from their home and how far away they are from their home. This becomes an opportunity for people to stalk or rob the user because they know when is the ideal time people aren't home. *citation* Looking on a broader scale, based on the demographics of the area a user interacts with, if they frequently visit the same stores within a certain area, information can be assumed, such as estimated income. *citation*

Users have the option to save a home or work address for easy access. Most often, users put their actual address, but in some cases, users have been known to put an address a couple streets away, just for their safety in case data gets leaked. However, while this is a very basic level of deflection, putting a home address a couple streets away still gives a general location of where the user is stationed.

=== Location aware applications ===
Individuals have concerns over how, what, when, and where their location information is being stored as well as to what extent others have access to it. Not only pertaining to ride-sharing applications, but any applications that have sharing enabled of sorts, there are several types of applications that are location aware. Location based searching (LBS) occurs when a user's tracking returns items and buildings around the user's current location in order to be tracked. A map is drawn with the orientation of the surrounding buildings to determine a location.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Damiani|first=Maria L.|date=Oct 2014|title=Location privacy models in mobile applications: conceptual view and research directions|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562335430/219F4ADE8AD642F3PQ/18?accountid=14496|journal=GeoInformatica|volume=18|pages=819-842|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geo-location services are having the user tracked with an environmental footprint. It's an estimate of a user's location. Mobile sensing is the process of pinpointing the user's physical device, which has sensors and information that can be collected. Location sharing is a voluntary state where the user is in live-time and their location is constantly being updated and tracked.

=== Making use of user information ===
Looking more at the applications and how a user accesses the ride-sharing service, once a user inputs data into the app, it will be accessible on the web forever. Even if they delete information or delete their account, the information has been created on an online platform and now exists whether the user consents to it or not. These applications ask for user information such as phone number, email, and profile picture, all features which can be used to trace back to the user's identity. Once this information is in the application's database, it can accessed by the application as well as indirectly by any partners of the app.

Most apps have the payment charged and completed before a user can be connected to their ride. Users have the option to store credit card information for easy access instead of having to repeatedly input payment information. While there is an added level of security, such as passcode or touch ID before every transaction, this does not ensure the safety of this information in the app. It only ensures that the current transaction is made under the consent of the user.

=== Reverse image search ===
Users are allowed to input a profile picture into their applications. Doing so has the intention of helping drivers spot their intended riders. However, this can cause an issue because if somehow a rider's image is saved and uploaded to the web, connections can be made to personal accounts. For example, with Facebook's face recognition advanced algorithm, it is easier to identify people's identities from outside pictures.

== Targets ==
There are three main categories where location-based services should be protecting:

# Identity protection - Location-based services can put together an identity of a user, even with anonymous identification, through the frequency in locations.
# Location protection - Very straightforward, the user's true location should be protected. There is no absolute way for a person to completely hide their whereabouts.
# Behavior protection - The goal of this protection is to survey the mobile patterns from the user's behavior, what locations they attend that people can interpret their behavior and make judgments about their character.

== Solutions ==
=== Noise distribution ===
Researchers have come up with a conclusion which  introduces a solution for these issues which is a system that helps with both data privacy and user anonymity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The solution is a program that creates a noise distribution so a user’s certain location is offset. It is basically putting the location of the user through some encryption and reporting that location that only the system knows how to read, so it is not manipulating the actual location, but just how that data is input into the system. This solution has already been implemented into two major operating systems, [[MacOS|Mac OS]] and [[Linux]]. This solution helps with those who are suspicious of using these ride-sharing application softwares because of the fear of their privacy being invaded or potentially data being stolen, but this software has proven that it can handle securing data as well as keeping the user anonymous. It is more like an extra layer of security that creates another blanket to hide the user.

==== K-anonymity ====
K-anonymity serves as an Anonymizing Server, which is a trusted third party server which is in charge of providing anonymous cover for users. K-anonymity is used to preserve the location privacy by creating a location cloak without knowing the actual location of the user.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biswas|first=Pratima|last2=Sairam|first2=Ashok Singh|date=2018-07|title=Modeling privacy approaches for location based services|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/S1389128618301890/1-s2.0-S1389128618301890-main.pdf?_tid=b8168b74-0369-4335-a7fd-1332dea53f6a&amp;acdnat=1541790052_acfdd6566bb115cc20a85cdcf0a1cea8|journal=Computer Networks|volume=140|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2018.04.016|issn=1389-1286|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software attempts to find a number of users close to the actual users because then exact locations could not be correlated back to the original user in question and these several locations which cannot be identified to the users in close proximity would protect the original user. There is no way to distinguish between all the users.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

=== Fuzzy interference systems ===
Another solution is to try and use fuzzy interference systems when relating to mobile geo-services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hashemi|first=Mahdi|last2=Malek|first2=Mohammad Reza|date=2012-07|title=Protecting location privacy in mobile geoservices using fuzzy inference systems|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0198971511001189|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|volume=36|issue=4|pages=311–320|doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2011.12.002|issn=0198-9715}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution would use different details to identify the user that would not be prone to organizations abusing the obtained information. Currently, location based services can reveal several sensitive pieces of information, like closest religious institutions, which can reveal the identity of the user, which organizations utilize for purely commercial purposes. The paper proposes a solution, anonymization, which protects user’s data in case of accidental breaches. There is an explanation of the fuzzy inference system and how it works *explain how it works* and then the potential implication method in taxi drivers to see if this is an effective way of protecting people’s information because there isn’t a concrete design with anonymization that has proven to do well. There are different levels of precision that the location system can narrow down on a user. These systems turn quantitative data into qualitative data which would obscure a user’s identity and location. After a trial implementation with taxi drivers, several complications came up, mostly human misinterpretation, but in the future, investing more time into this solution and combining it with already existing solutions could provide a more effective solution. To those who are afraid of their locations being tracked and that being used to trace back to the user, this solution makes user data fuzzy so if they are being tracking, it is not completely precise. There are data tables that show experimental distances of how close a tracking software was to those who had implemented the fuzzy solution. This solution takes on a different approach because it doesn’t entirely solve the problem of how to entirely protect the user's privacy, but it is working towards it since the solution has not had enough time to mature, as it is just in introductory stages. It sheds light on the fact that the location tracking software is still not private even when solutions have been taken to try and overcome this solution but leaves an open ending because it ends that with more research and resources put into it (and specifically told what areas could be developed better) it could expand further and be developed better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Rui|last2=Yang|first2=Yupu|date=2013-06-19|title=Smooth support vector learning for fuzzy rule-based classification systems|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=551debe9-8331-46e6-985d-5b15447bf24d%40sessionmgr104|journal=Intelligent Data Analysis|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=679–695|doi=10.3233/ida-130600|issn=1571-4128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location transformation ===
One proposed solution is a model that would estimate how difficult it would be for outside sources to get their hands on someone’s private information. There are several mechanisms proposed that would be helpful in hiding data including location obfuscation, perturbation, confusion and suppression, and cryptographic techniques. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Location obfuscation ====
Obfuscating a user's location means to cloud the user's location. A user's location coordinates are still being preserved, however the accuracy is just being degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zurbarán|first=Mayra|last2=Wightman|first2=Pedro|last3=Brovelli|first3=Maria|last4=Oxoli|first4=Daniele|last5=Iliffe|first5=Mark|last6=Jimeno|first6=Miguel|last7=Salazar|first7=Augusto|date=2018-08-17|title=NRand-K: Minimizing the impact of location obfuscation in spatial analysis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12462|journal=Transactions in GIS|language=en|volume=22|issue=5|pages=1257–1274|doi=10.1111/tgis.12462|issn=1361-1682}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this cannot be a complete solution because this would just neglect the entire reason of location-based services. So being selective in what an application is obfuscating, would help with protection.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

There is a program, called NRand algorithm, which is the algorithm that determines the amount of obstruction that is put on the user location data. There are a couple issues that arise with this algorithm, including determining how much noise should be implemented and if the changing of the data is enough to alter it to an unrecognizable form from its original state. &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=Jingyu|last2=Tong|first2=Wei|last3=Xu|first3=Fengyuan|last4=Zhong|first4=Sheng|date=2017|title=A Geo-Indistinguishable Location Perturbation Mechanism for Location-Based Services Supporting Frequent Queries|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8125751/?reload=true|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security|language=en-US|pages=1–1|doi=10.1109/tifs.2017.2779402|issn=1556-6013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Location perturbation ====
On a map, a location locks onto something in close proximity but not the exact user location because of added noise. With this added layer, if there is another location in a close enough range, a transition will be added to multiple locations and mask all points of interest. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==== Confusion and suppression ====
A dummy location is set as the true location. This is done so by pinpointing a user's specific location and transforming it into several other locations, yet keeping the true location. Suppression is a subset of these different applications where for a short period of time, when a user enters an area, the user information is temporarily suspended and the identity of the user is lost, so when they exit back out of the protected area, they have a new identity.  &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Cryptographic techniques ====
Original data is unable to be tracked because information goes through some sort of cryptographic interpreter, could be transformed into several different data points. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

{{Culture of Scotland}}
'''Scottish''' or '''Scots units of measurement''' are the '''weights and measures''' peculiar to [[Scotland]] which were nominally replaced by [[English units]] in 1685 but continued to be used in unofficial contexts until at least the late 18th century. The system was based on the [[ell]] ([[#Length|length]]), [[stone (Imperial mass)|stone]] ([[#Mass|mass]]), and [[:wikt:boll#Noun|boll]] and [[firlot]] ([[#Volume|volume]]). This official system coexisted with local variants, especially for the measurement of [[#Area|land area]].

The system is said to have been introduced by [[David I of Scotland]] (1124–53), although there are no surviving records until the 15th century when the system was already in normal use. Standard measures and weights were kept in each [[burgh]], and these were periodically compared against one another at "assizes of measures", often during the early years of the reign of a new monarch. Nevertheless, there was considerable local variation in many of the units, and the units of dry measure steadily increased in size from 1400 to 1700.&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{citation | last= Simpson |first=A.

The Scots units of length were technically replaced by the English system by an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1685,&lt;ref name="1685-4-83"&gt;"[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1685/4/83 Act for a standard of miles]" (16 June 1685). ''APS'' '''viii''': 494, c.59. ''RPS'' 1685/4/83.&lt;/ref&gt; and the other units by the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1706.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1706/10/257 Union with England Act 1707 (c.&amp;nbsp;7)], art.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; However many continued to be used locally during the 18th and 19th centuries. The introduction of the [[Imperial units|Imperial system]] by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]] saw the end of any formal use in trade and commerce, although some informal use as customary units continued into the 20th century. "Scotch measure" or "[[Clan Cunningham|Cunningham]] measure" was brought to parts of [[Ulster]] in Ireland by [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots settlers]], and used into the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=John Harwood|title=Plantation acres: an historical study of the Irish land surveyor and his maps|accessdate=15 May 2015|date=1985|publisher=Ulster Historical Foundation|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall1842"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Anna Maria|authorlink=Anna Maria Hall|title=Ireland: Its Scenery, Character, &amp;c|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbwTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=15 May 2015|year=1842|publisher=How and Parsons|pages=198, fn.|quote=We notice the Scotch acre, chiefly because it is the measure employed in some of the northern Irish counties.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Length==
;[[Ell#Ell (Scots)|ell]] : The ell ({{lang-la|ulna}}) was the basic unit of length, equal to 37&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1427/3/2 Act of 11 March 1427], ''RPS'' 1427/3/2.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Barony ell" of 42&amp;nbsp;inches was used as the basis for land measurement in the Four Towns area near [[Lochmaben]], Dumfriesshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The statistical account of Scotland | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fYXRAAAAMAAJ | author = Sinclair, John | location = Edinburgh | publisher = W. Creech | year = 1793 | page = 240}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Inch#Scottish inch|Scottish inch]] : As in England.&lt;ref name="Connor" /&gt; A fraudulent smaller inch of {{frac|42}} of an ell is also recorded.&lt;ref name="1663-6-81"&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1663/6/81 Act anent the foot measure] (29 September 1663), ''RPS'' 1663/6/81.&lt;/ref&gt;
;foot (fit) : 12 inches.&lt;ref name="1685-4-83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1663-6-81" /&gt;
;yard (yaird) : 36 inches.&lt;ref name="1685-4-83" /&gt; Rarely used except with English units, although it appears in an Act of Parliament from 1432: "The king's officer, as is foresaid, shall have a horn, and each one a red wand of three-quarters of a yard at least."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1432/3/12 Act of 10 March 1432], ''RPS'' 1432/3/12.&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[fall (unit)|fall]] (faw) : 6 ells, or 222 inches. Identical to the Scots [[rod (unit)|rod]] and ''raip'' ("rope").&lt;ref&gt;"fall, faw", ''[[Dictionary of the Scottish Language]] – [[Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue]]'' [http://www.dsl.ac.uk/ online edition].&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Mile#Scots mile|Scots mile]] : 320 falls ({{frac|1973|1|3}} yards), but varied from place to place. Obsolete by the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;"mile", ''[[Dictionary of the Scottish Language]] – [[Scottish National Dictionary]]'' [http://www.dsl.ac.uk/ online edition].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area==
A number of conflicting systems were used for area, sometimes bearing the same names in different regions, but working on different conversion rates. Because some of the systems were based on what land would produce, rather than the physical area, they are listed in their own section. Please see individual articles for more specific information. Because fertility varied widely, in many areas, production was considered a more practical measure.

===Area by size===
''For information on the squared units, please see the appropriate articles in the length section''
*'''square inch'''
*'''square ell'''
*'''square fall''' (''faw'')
*'''[[Rood (Scots)|rood]]''' (''ruid'')
*'''[[Acre (Scots)|acre]]'''

===Area by production===
[[File:Oxgangs towards Comiston.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Oxgangs]], Edinburgh named after the Scottish unit.]]

Eastern Scotland:

* [[oxgang]] (''damh-imir'') = the area an ox could plough in a year (around 20 acres)
* [[ploughgate]] (''plougate'') = 8 oxgangs
* [[Davoch|dauch]] (''dabhach''/''davoch'') = 4 ploughgates

=== Area by taxation/rent ===
In western Scotland, including [[Galloway]]:
* [[Markland (Scots)|markland]] (''merkland'', ''marg-fhearann'') = 8 ouncelands (varied) 
* [[ounceland]] (''unceland'', ''tir-unga'') = 20 pennylands
* [[pennyland]] (''peighinn'') = basic unit; sub-divided into [[halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]]-land and [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]-land &lt;!-- Based on quote/reference presented in Pennyland article. --&gt;
* (Other terms in use; [[quarterland]] (''ceathramh''): variable value; [[groatland]] (''còta bàn'')

==Volume==

===Dry volume===
Dry volume measures were slightly different for various types of grain, but often bore the same name.

*'''[[chalder]]''' (''chauder'')
*'''boll''' (''bowe'' / ''bole'') equal to 4 [[firlot]]s
*'''[[firlot]]'''
*'''[[peck]]''' 
*'''[[lippie]]''' or '''[[forpet]]'''

Weight equivalents of one  '''boll''' are given in a trade dictionary of 1863 as follows:
Flour 140 pounds;
Peas or beans 280 pounds;
Oats 264 pounds;
Barley 320 pounds;
Oatmeal 140 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simmonds|first1=P L|title=A dictionary of trade products, commercial, manufacturing, and technical terms: with a definition of the moneys, weights, and measures of all countries, reduced to the British standard|date=1863|publisher=Routledge, Warne &amp; Routledge|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/cihm_47512#page/n55/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluid volume===
Nipperkin was also used, but perhaps not part of this more formal set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nipperkin|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-nip1.htm|website=World Wide Words: Investigating the English language across the globe|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donn|first1=Benjamin|title=A new introduction to the mathematicks: being essays on vulgar and decimal Arithmetick (1858)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6o2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA146-IA1|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight==
Weight was measured according to "troy measure" ([[Lanark]]) and "tron measure" ([[Edinburgh]]), which were standardised in 1661. In the Troy system these often bore the same name as imperial measures.

* '''drop''' (''drap'')
* '''ounce ''' (''unce'')
* '''pound''' (''pund'')
* '''stone''' (''stane'')

Various local measures all existed, often using local weighing stones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10736">'''Self-evaluation maintenance''' ('''SEM''') theory refers to discrepancies between two people in a relationship. Two people in a relationship each aim to keep themselves feeling good psychologically throughout a comparison process to the other person.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tesser |first=A. |year=1988 |chapter=Toward a self-evaluation maintenance model of social behavior |editor-first=L. |editor-last=Berkowitz |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |volume=21 |pages=181–227 |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-015221-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-evaluation is defined as the way a person views him/herself. It is the continuous process of determining personal growth and progress, which can be raised or lowered by the behavior of a close other (a person that is psychologically close).  People are more threatened by friends than strangers. [[Abraham Tesser]] created the self-evaluation maintenance theory in 1988. The self-evaluation maintenance model assumes two things: that a person will try to maintain or increase their own self-evaluation, and self-evaluation is influenced by relationships with others.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt;

== Description ==

A person's self-evaluation (which is similar to [[self-esteem]]) may be raised when a close other performs well.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; For example, a sibling scores the winning goal in an important game. Self-evaluation will increase because that person is sharing his/her success. The closer the psychological relationship and the greater the success, the more a person will share in the success.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; This is considered the ''reflection'' process. When closeness and performance are high, self-evaluation is raised in the reflection process. If someone who is psychologically close performs well on a task that is irrelevant to a person's [[self-definition]], that person is able to benefit by sharing in the success of the achievement.

At the same time, the success of a close other can decrease someone's self-evaluation in the comparison process. This is because the success of a close other invites ''comparison'' on one's own capabilities, thereby directly affecting one's own self-evaluation.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; This is also strengthened with the closeness of the psychological relationship with the successful other. Using the same example: a sibling scores the winning goal in an important game; the person is now comparing him/herself to the sibling's success and through comparison, his/her self-evaluation is lowered. When closeness (sibling) and performance (scored the winning goal) are high, self-evaluation is decreased in the comparison process.

In both the reflection and comparison processes, closeness and performance level are significant. If the closeness of another decreases, then a person is less likely to share the success and/or compare him/herself, which lessens the likelihood of decreasing self-evaluation. A person is more likely to compare him/herself to someone close to him/her, like a sibling or a best friend, than a stranger. There are different factors in which a person can assume closeness: family, friends, people with similar characteristics, etc. If an individual is not close to a particular person, then it makes sense that he/she will not share in their success or be threatened by their success. At the same time, if the person's performance is low, there is no reason to share the success and increase self-evaluation; there is also no reason to compare him/herself to the other person, decreasing self-evaluation. Because their performance is low, there is no reason it should raise or lower his/her self-evaluation. According to Tesser's (1988) theory, if a sibling did not do well in his/her game, then there is no reason the individual's self-evaluation will be affected.

Closeness and performance can either raise self-evaluation through reflection or lower self-evaluation through comparison. Relevance determines whether reflection or comparison will occur. There are many different dimensions that can be important to an individual's self-definition. A self-defining factor is any factor that is important to who a person is. For example, an ability or success in music may be important to one's self-definition, but at the same time, being good in math may not be as important. Relevance assumes that a particular factor that is important to an individual is also important to another person. Relevance can be as simple as a shared dimension which he/she considers important to who he/she is. If relevance is high, then one will engage in comparison, but if relevance is low, one will engage in reflection.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; For example, if athletics is important to a person and that person considers athletics to be an important dimension of his/her self-definition, then when a sibling does well in athletics, the comparison process will take place and his/her self-evaluation will decrease. On the other hand, if athletics is not a dimension he/she uses for self-definition, the reflection process will take place and he/she will celebrate the sibling's success with the sibling; his/her self-evaluation will increase along with the sibling's because he/she is not threatened or challenged by the sibling's athletic capability.

Tesser (1988) suggests that people may do things to reduce the decrease in self-evaluation from comparison. One can spend less time with that particular individual, thereby reducing closeness or one can change their important self-definition and take up a new hobby or focus on a different self-defining activity, which reduces relevance. The third way of avoiding a decrease in self-evaluation through the comparison process is to affect another's performance (e.g. by hiding a sibling's favorite shoes, or believe that his/her performance was based on luck) or one can improve their own skills by practicing more. This theory poses the question: under what conditions will someone get in the way of another's performance? The answer is that it depends on closeness of the individuals and the relevance of the activity. When the relevance is high, the comparison process is more important than the reflection process. When the relevance is high and the activity is high in self-defining importance, the other person poses a larger threat than when the relevance is low.

== Research example ==

Tesser &amp; Smith (1980) experimented with this theory. Men were recruited and asked to bring a friend with them. They were then put into groups of four, Man A and Man A's friend along with Man B and Man B's friend. Half the subjects were told that this activity was measuring important verbal skills and leadership. This was the high relevance group. The other two subjects were told that the task had nothing to do with verbal skills, leadership or anything important. This was considered the low relevance group. The activity was based on the game Password, where persons have to guess a word based on clues. Each man was given an opportunity to guess the word while the other three gave clues from a list. The other three can give clues that are easy or difficult based on their own judgment and basically whether or not they would like to help the other person guess the word. The clues given to the person were necessary to guess the word. The first pair of partners performed poorly (as instructed in the experimental design). The experiment was looking at the behavior of the second group of men. The next pairing was designed to partner a stranger with a friend. Researchers were trying to see when a friend was helped more than a stranger and when a stranger was helped more than a friend. The research was supported. In 10 out of 13 sessions, when relevance was high (told that this activity measures important verbal and leadership skills) the stranger was helped more than a friend. Also, in 10 out of 13 sessions, when relevance was low (subjects were told that this activity determined nothing of importance) the friend was helped more than the stranger.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; The prediction of the self-evaluation maintenance theory was strongly supported.

Zuckerman &amp; Jost (2001) compares the self-evaluation maintenance theory to the work of Feld (1991). As the self-evaluatory maintenance theory would lead one to judge a stranger higher than their friends (based on popularity) in order to prevent a drop in self-evaluation, Feld's (1991) research demonstrated that people must have fewer friends than their friends do in order to remain popular. This is based on a mathematical equation that explains why popular people are involved in more social circles than unpopular people. These are not the only two research examples. For more examples see the references.

This graph illustrates the basic principles of Tesser's (1988) self-evaluatory maintenance model of behavior. Relevance determines whether reflection or comparison will occur. When relevance is low (the factor does not affect self-definition) as the other's performance increases, so does self-evaluation, allowing that person to share in the celebration of the other person (reflection). When relevance is high (the factor is important to self-definition also) as the other's performance increases, self-evaluation decreases because that person is being compared to the other person (comparison). If relevance is high, then one will engage in comparison, but if relevance is low, one will engage in reflection.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt;

The idea of '''self-parenting''' is that a person's "[[mind]]" is created in the form of a [[conversation]] between two voices generated by the two parts of the [[cerebral hemisphere]]. One is the "inner [[parent]]" represented by the [[left brain]] with the other voice being the "inner [[child]]" represented by the [[right brain]]. The manner and quality by which these "inner conversations" take place between the two voices is most accurately described as self-parenting. The inner parent is parenting the inner child within the inner conversations.

Another way of seeing self-parenting through a different perspective is first off knowing that usually some individuals are not strong when it comes to dealing with problems with their inner self; they usually need a mentor with positive feedback, there to guide them with certain strategies and most of all to overcome obstacles. Most of the time when they are in need to dealing with the forces of reality, they may place too much pressure on certain people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://selfparenting.com/booksmodulesconsultations-middle-page/support-groups/ |title=Self-Parenting Support Groups &amp;#124; Welcome to the Official SELF-PARENTING Program Website |publisher=Selfparenting.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual quality of a person's self-parenting style is said to closely resemble the specific style of parenting he or she received growing up as child.

A '''self-replicating machine''' is a type of [[autonomous robot]] that is capable of reproducing itself autonomously using raw materials found in the environment, thus exhibiting [[self-replication]] in a way analogous to that found in [[nature]]. The concept of self-replicating machines has been advanced and examined by [[Homer Jacobsen]], [[Edward F. Moore]], [[Freeman Dyson]], [[John von Neumann]] and in more recent times by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his book on [[nanotechnology]], ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (coining the term '''clanking replicator ''' for such machines) and by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] in their review ''Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines''&lt;ref name="Freitas 2004"&gt;{{cite book| last=Freitas| first=Robert A.|author2=Ralph C. Merkle | title=Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines| year=2004| publisher=Landes Bioscience| location=Georgetown, Texas| isbn=1-57059-690-5| url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator design space. The future development of such technology is an integral part of several plans involving the mining of [[moon]]s and [[asteroid]] belts for ore and other materials, the creation of lunar factories, and even the construction of [[solar power satellite]]s in space. The possibly misnamed [[von Neumann probe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.11.htm#p3 |title=3.11 Freitas Interstellar Probe Replicator (1979-1980) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one theoretical example of such a machine. Von Neumann also worked on what he called the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]], a self-replicating machine that would operate in a [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] environment.

A self-replicating machine is an artificial [[self-replication|self-replicating]] system that relies on conventional large-scale technology and automation. Certain idiosyncratic terms are occasionally found in the literature. For example, the term clanking replicator was once used by Drexler&lt;ref name=EoC&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_4.html#section01of03| title=Engines of Abundance (Chapter 4) Clanking Replicators| work=Engines of Creation| first=K. Eric| last=Drexler| year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish macroscale replicating systems from the microscopic [[nanorobot]]s or "[[assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]]" that [[nanotechnology]] may make possible, but the term is informal and is rarely used by others in popular or technical discussions. Replicators have also been called "von Neumann machines" after John von Neumann, who first rigorously studied the idea. However, the term "von Neumann machine" is less specific and also refers to a completely unrelated [[Von Neumann architecture|computer architecture]] that von Neumann proposed and so its use is discouraged where accuracy is important.&lt;ref name="Freitas 2004"/&gt; Von Neumann himself used the term [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] to describe such self-replicating machines.

Historians of [[machine tool]]s, even before the [[numerical control]] era, sometimes figuratively said that machine tools were a unique class of machines because they have the ability to "reproduce themselves"&lt;ref name="Colvin1947pp6-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Colvin|1947|pp=6–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by copying all of their parts. Implicit in these discussions is that a human would direct the cutting processes (later planning and programming the machines), and would then be assembling the parts. The same is true for [[RepRap Project|RepRaps]], which are another class of machines sometimes mentioned in reference to such non-autonomous "self-replication". In contrast, machines that are ''truly autonomously'' self-replicating (like [[Molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]]) are the main subject discussed here.

==History==

The general concept of artificial machines capable of producing copies of themselves dates back at least several hundred years. An early reference is an anecdote regarding the philosopher [[René Descartes]], who suggested to Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] that the human body could be regarded as a machine; she responded by pointing to a clock and ordering "see to it that it reproduces offspring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American| title=Build Your Own Replicator| volume=285|date=August 2001| pages=38–39| first=Moshe| last= Sipper|author2=James A. Reggia }} Several other variations on this anecdotal response also exist.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other variations on this anecdotal response also exist. [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] proposed in his 1872 novel ''[[Erewhon]]'' that machines were already capable of reproducing themselves but it was man who made them do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/1.htm#p5 |title=1 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and added that ''"machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel Butler |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ButErew.html |title=Erewhon, Chapter 24, The book Of the Machines |publisher=Nzetc.org |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[George Eliot|George Eliot's]] 1879 book ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]'', a series of essays that she wrote in the character of a fictional scholar named Theophrastus, the essay "Shadows of the Coming Race" speculated about self-replicating machines, with Theophrastus asking "how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to carry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply, self-repair, and reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Eliot |url=http://www.online-literature.com/george_eliot/theophrastus-such/17/ |title=Impressions of Theophrastus Such, Chapter 17, Shadows of the Coming Race |publisher=online-literature.com |accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 [[William Paley]] formulated the first known [[teleological argument]] depicting machines producing other machines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/1.htm#p11 |title=1 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the [[watchmaker argument|question of who originally made a watch]] was rendered moot if it were demonstrated that the watch was able to manufacture a copy of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=William| last= Paley| title= Natural Theology: or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature| chapter=Chapter i, Section 1| publisher= E.

In the course of the 1950s, suggestions of several increasingly simple mechanical systems capable of self-reproduction were made—notably by [[Lionel Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1179|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===von Neumann's kinematic model===

A detailed conceptual proposal for a physical non-biological self-replicating system was first put forward by mathematician [[John von Neumann]] in lectures delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he proposed a [[kinematic]] self-reproducing automaton model as a [[thought experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=von Neumann| first=John| year=1966| title=The Theory of Self-reproducing Automata| editor= A. Burks| publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press| location= Urbana, IL| isbn=0-598-37798-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/2.1.htm |title=2.1 Von Neumann's Contributions |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann's concept of a physical self-replicating machine was dealt with only abstractly, with the hypothetical machine using a "sea" or stockroom of spare parts as its source of raw materials. The machine had a program stored on a memory tape that directed it to retrieve parts from this "sea" using a manipulator, assemble them into a duplicate of itself, and then copy the contents of its memory tape into the empty duplicate's. The machine was envisioned as consisting of as few as eight different types of components; four logic elements that send and receive stimuli and four mechanical elements used to provide a structural skeleton and mobility. While qualitatively sound, von Neumann was evidently dissatisfied with this model of a self-replicating machine due to the difficulty of analyzing it with mathematical rigor. He went on to instead develop an even more abstract model self-replicator based on [[cellular automata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/2.1.3.htm |title=2.1.3 The Cellular Automaton (CA) Model of Machine Replication |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original kinematic concept remained obscure until it was popularized in a 1955 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kemeny| first=John G.| title=Man Viewed as a Machine| journal=Scientific American| volume=192|date=April 1955| issue=4| pages=58–67| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0455-58| bibcode=1955SciAm.192d..58K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moore's artificial living plants===

In 1956 mathematician [[Edward F. Moore]] proposed the first known suggestion for a practical real-world self-replicating machine, also published in ''Scientific American''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Scientific American| first=Edward F.| last=Moore|date=October 1956| volume=195| title=Artificial Living Plants| issue=4| pages=118–126| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1056-118| bibcode=1956SciAm.195d.118M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.1.htm |title=3.1 Moore Artificial Living Plants (1956) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's "artificial living plants" were proposed as machines able to use air, water and soil as sources of raw materials and to draw its energy from sunlight via a [[solar cell|solar battery]] or a [[steam engine]]. He chose the seashore as an initial habitat for such machines, giving them easy access to the chemicals in seawater, and suggested that later generations of the machine could be designed to float freely on the ocean's surface as self-replicating factory barges or to be placed in barren desert terrain that was otherwise useless for industrial purposes. The self-replicators would be "harvested" for their component parts, to be used by humanity in other non-replicating machines.

===Dyson's replicating systems===

The next major development of the concept of self-replicating machines was a series of thought experiments proposed by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1970 Vanuxem Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "The twenty-first century," Vanuxem Lecture delivered at Princeton University, 26 February 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.6.htm |title=3.6 Dyson Terraforming Replicators (1970, 1979) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed three large-scale applications of machine replicators. First was to send a self-replicating system to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], which in addition to producing copies of itself would also be programmed to manufacture and launch [[solar sail]]-propelled cargo spacecraft. These spacecraft would carry blocks of Enceladean ice to [[Mars]], where they would be used to [[Terraforming of Mars|terraform the planet]]. His second proposal was a solar-powered factory system designed for a terrestrial desert environment, and his third was an "industrial development kit" based on this replicator that could be sold to developing countries to provide them with as much industrial capacity as desired. When Dyson revised and reprinted his lecture in 1979 he added proposals for a modified version of Moore's seagoing artificial living plants that was designed to distill and store fresh water for human use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Chapter 18: Thought Experiments| work=Disturbing the Universe| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| year=1979| publisher=Harper and Row| location=New York| pages=194–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[Astrochicken]]."

===''Advanced Automation for Space Missions''===
[[File:Advanced Automation for Space Missions figure 5-19.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's conception of a "self-growing" robotic lunar factory]]

In 1980, inspired by a 1979 "New Directions Workshop" held at Wood's Hole, [[NASA]] conducted a joint summer study with [[ASEE]] entitled [[s:Advanced Automation for Space Missions|Advanced Automation for Space Missions]] to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop [[Moon|lunar]] resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site. The study was conducted at [[Santa Clara University]] and ran from June 23 to August 29, with the final report published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Advanced_Automation_for_Space_Missions |editor=[[Robert Freitas]], William P. Gilbreath| title=Advanced Automation for Space Missions| year=1982| id=NASA Conference Publication CP-2255 (N83-15348)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed system would have been capable of [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] productive capacity and the design could be modified to build self-replicating probes to explore the galaxy.

The reference design included small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails inside the factory, mobile "paving machines" that used large parabolic mirrors to focus sunlight on lunar [[regolith]] to melt and sinter it into a hard surface suitable for building on, and robotic front-end loaders for [[strip mining]]. Raw lunar regolith would be refined by a variety of techniques, primarily [[hydrofluoric acid]] [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]]. Large transports with a variety of manipulator arms and tools were proposed as the constructors that would put together new factories from parts and assemblies produced by its parent.

Power would be provided by a "canopy" of solar cells supported on pillars. The other machinery would be placed under the canopy.

A "[[casting]] [[robot]]" would use sculpting tools and templates to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|molds]]. Plaster was selected because the molds are easy to make, can make precise parts with good surface finishes, and the plaster can be easily recycled afterward using an oven to bake the water back out. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals. A carbon dioxide [[laser cutting]] and welding system was also included.

A more speculative, more complex microchip fabricator was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were "vitamins."

A 2004 study supported by NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts took this idea further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/883Toth-Fejel.html|title=Modeling Kinematic Cellular Automata: An Approach to Self-Replication|last=Toth-Fejel|first=Tihamer|date=|year=2004|website=|publisher=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts are beginning to consider self-replicating machines for [[asteroid mining]].

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing the ores, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in lunar [[regolith]]. The element that most limited the growth rate was [[chlorine]], needed to process regolith for [[aluminium]]. Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith.

===Lackner-Wendt Auxon replicators===

In 1995, inspired by Dyson's 1970 suggestion of seeding uninhabited deserts on Earth with self-replicating machines for industrial development, [[Klaus Lackner]] and Christopher Wendt developed a more detailed outline for such a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lackner| first=Klaus S.|author2=Christopher H. Wendt | title=Exponential growth of large self-replicating machine systems| journal=Mathl. Comput.

Their proposal didn't include a complete analysis of the system's material requirements, but described a novel method for extracting the ten most common chemical elements found in raw desert topsoil (Na, Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Al, C, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) using a high-temperature carbothermic process. This proposal was popularized in [[Discover Magazine]], featuring solar-powered desalination equipment used to irrigate the desert in which the system was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Discover|date=October 1995| first=Thomas| last=Bass| title=Robot, build thyself| pages=64–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; They named their machines "Auxons", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''auxein'' which means "to grow."

==Recent work==

===Self-replicating rapid prototypers===
[[File:Reprap Darwin.jpg|thumb|right|RepRap 1.0 "Darwin" prototype]]

Early experimentation with [[rapid prototyping]] in 1997-2000 was not expressly oriented toward reproducing rapid prototyping systems themselves, but rather extended simulated "[[evolutionary robotics]]" techniques into the physical world. Later developments in rapid prototyping have given the process the ability to produce a wide variety of electronic and mechanical components, making this a rapidly developing frontier in self-replicating system research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.20.htm |title=Freitas 2004, pp. 64-67 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Chris Phoenix informally outlined a design for a hydraulically powered replicator a few cubic feet in volume that used ultraviolet light to cure soft plastic feedstock and a fluidic logic control system, but didn't address most of the details of assembly procedures, error rates, or machining tolerances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| author=Christopher J. Phoenix| newsgroup=sci.nanotech| title=Partial design for macro-scale machining self-replicator| date=March 21, 1998| url=http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;selm=6f0nui%248ih%241%40news.nanospace.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.20.htm#p8 |title=3.20 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First replication.jpg|300px|right|thumb|All of the plastic parts for the machine on the right were produced by the almost identical machine on the left. (Adrian Bowyer (left) and Vik Olliver(right) are members of the RepRap project.)]]

In 2005, [[Adrian Bowyer]] of the [[University of Bath]] started the [[RepRap Project]] to develop a [[rapid prototyping]] machine which would be able to manufacture some or most of its own components, making such machines cheap enough for people to buy and use in their homes. The project is releasing its designs and control programs under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ensab/replicator/| title=WebHome| accessdate=2007-02-18| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112200308/http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ensab/replicator/| archivedate=2007-01-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RepRap approach uses [[fused deposition modeling]] to manufacture plastic components, possibly incorporating conductive pathways for circuitry. Other components, such as steel rods, nuts and bolts, motors and separate electronic components, would be supplied externally. In 2006 the project produced a basic functional prototype and in May 2008 the machine succeeded in producing all of the plastic parts required to make a 'child' machine.

Some researchers have proposed a [[microfactory]] of specialized machines that support recursion—nearly all of the parts of all of the machines in the factory can be manufactured by the factory.&lt;ref&gt;

===NIAC studies on self-replicating systems===

In the spirit of the 1980 "Advanced Automation for Space Missions" study, the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] began several studies of self-replicating system design in 2002 and 2003. Four phase I grants were awarded:

===Bootstrapping Self-Replicating Factories in Space===

In 2012, NASA researchers Metzger, Muscatello, Mueller, and Mantovani argued for a bootstrapping approach to start self-replicating factories in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=Philip | last2=Muscatello | first2=Anthony | last3=Mueller | first3=Robert | last4=Mantovani | first4=James | title=Affordable, Rapid Bootstrapping of the Space Industry and Solar System Civilization | journal=Journal of Aerospace Engineering | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=18–29 | publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers | date= January 2013 | language=English | url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000236 | doi=10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000236 | access-date=2016-09-24| arxiv=1612.03238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed this concept on the basis of [[In situ resource utilization|In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU)]] technologies that NASA has been developing to "live off the land" on the Moon or Mars. Their modeling showed that in just 20 to 40 years this industry could become self-sufficient then grow to large size, enabling greater exploration in space as well as providing benefits back to Earth. In 2014, [[Thomas Kalil]] of the White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] published on the White House blog an interview with Metzger on bootstrapping solar system civilization through self-replicating space industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/14/bootstrapping-solar-system-civilization |title=Bootstrapping a Solar System Civilization |publisher=The White House |date=2014-10-14 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalil requested the public submit ideas for how "the Administration, the private sector, philanthropists, the research community, and storytellers can further these goals." Kalil connected this concept to what former NASA Chief technologist [[Mason Peck]] has dubbed "Massless Exploration", the ability to make everything in space so that you do not need to launch it from Earth. Peck has said, "...all the mass we need to explore the solar system is already in space. It's just in the wrong shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-01-05/exciting-new-ideas-space-technology-are-getting-short-changed-congress |title=Exciting new ideas in space technology are getting short-changed by Congress |publisher=PRI.org |date=2015-01-15 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Metzger argued that fully self-replicating industry can be started over several decades by astronauts at a lunar outpost for a total cost (outpost plus starting the industry) of about a third of the space budgets of the [[International Space Station]] partner nations, and that this industry would solve Earth's energy and environmental problems in addition to providing massless exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=Philip | title=Space Development and Space Science Together, an Historic Opportunity | journal=Space Policy | volume=37 | issue=2 | pages=77–91 | publisher=Elsevier Ltd. | date= August 2016 | language=English | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964616300625 | doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2016.08.004 | access-date=2016-12-09 | arxiv=1609.00737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornell University's self-assembler===

In 2005, a team of researchers at [[Cornell University]], including [[Hod Lipson]], implemented a self-assembling machine. The machine is composed of a tower of four articulated [[cube]]s, known as ''molecubes'', which can revolve about a [[triagonal]]. This enables the tower to function as a [[robotic arm]], collecting nearby molecubes and assembling them into a copy of itself. The arm is directed by a [[computer program]], which is contained within each molecube, analogous to how each animal [[cell (biology)|cell]] contains an entire copy of its [[DNA]]. However, the machine cannot manufacture individual molecubes, nor do they occur naturally, so its status as a self-replicator is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news4055.html |title=Researchers build a robot that can reproduce |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York University artificial DNA tile motifs ===

In 2011, a team of scientists at [[New York University]] created a structure called 'BTX' (bent triple helix) based around three double helix molecules, each made from a short strand of DNA.  Treating each group of three double-helices as a code letter, they can (in principle) build up self-replicating structures that encode large quantities of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111012132651.htm |title=Self-Replication Process Holds Promise for Production of New Materials| publisher=Science Daily |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368/full/nature10500.html |title=Self-replication of information-bearing nanoscale patterns|journal=Nature|accessdate=2011-10-13|volume=478|doi=10.1038/nature10500|pages=225–228|bibcode=2011Natur.478..225W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-replication of magnetic polymers ===

In 2001 Jarle Breivik at [[University of Oslo]] created a system of magnetic building blocks, which in response to temperature fluctuations, spontaneously form self-replicating polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/3/4/273 |title=Self-Organization of Template-Replicating Polymers and the Spontaneous Rise of Genetic Information| publisher=Entroy |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-replication of neural circuits ===

In 1968 [[Zellig Harris]] wrote that "the metalanguage is in the language,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Mathematical Structures of Language|page=17|last=Harris|first=Zellig|year=1968|publisher=John Wiley and Son|location= New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that self-replication is part of language. In 1977 [[Niklaus Wirth]] formalized this proposition by publishing a self-replicating [[deterministic context-free grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wirth|first1=Niklaus|title= What can we do about the unnecessary diversity of notation for syntactic definitions?|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=20|pages=822–823|doi=10.1145/359863.359883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to it probabilities, [[Bertrand du Castel]] published in 2015 a self-replicating [[stochastic grammar]] and presented a mapping of that grammar to [[neural networks]], thereby presenting a [[Conceptual model|model]] for a self-replicating neural circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=du Castel|first1=Bertrand|title=Pattern Activation/Recognition Theory of Mind|journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience|volume=9|issue=90|publisher=EPFL|location=Lausanne|date = 15 July 2015|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00090/full|doi=10.3389/fncom.2015.00090|ref=neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial construction==
Partial construction is the concept that the constructor creates a partially constructed (rather than fully formed) offspring, which is then left to complete its own construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Automata 2008| title=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biological Theory| title=Computational Ontogeny| volume=3| issue=1| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|doi=10.1162/biot.2008.3.1.3|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The von Neumann model of self-replication envisages that the mother automaton should construct all portions of daughter automatons, without exception and prior to the initiation of such daughters. Partial construction alters the construction relationship between mother and daughter automatons, such that the mother constructs but a portion of the daughter, and upon initiating this portion of the daughter, thereafter retracts from imparting further influence upon the daughter. Instead, the daughter automaton is left to complete its own development. This is to say, means exist by which automatons may develop via the mechanism of a zygote.

==Self-replicating spacecraft==
{{Main article|Self-replicating spacecraft}}

The idea of an automated spacecraft capable of constructing copies of itself was first proposed in scientific literature in 1974 by [[Michael A. Arbib]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.11.htm#p1 |title=3.11 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael A.| last=Arbib| title=The Likelihood of the Evolution of Communicating Intelligences on Other Planets| work= Interstellar Communication: Scientific Perspectives| editor=Cyril Ponnamperuma, A. G. W. Cameron| location=Boston| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company| year=1974| pages=59–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept had appeared earlier in [[science fiction]] such as the 1967 novel ''[[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]]'' by [[Fred Saberhagen]] or the 1950 novellette trilogy ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]]. The first quantitative engineering analysis of a self-replicating spacecraft was published in 1980 by [[Robert Freitas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Robert A., Jr.| last=Freitas| title=A Self-Reproducing Interstellar Probe| journal=[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]| volume=33|date=July 1980| pages=251–264| url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-01|bibcode = 1980JBIS...33..251F }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the non-replicating [[Project Daedalus]] design was modified to include all subsystems necessary for self-replication. The design's strategy was to use the probe to deliver a "seed" factory with a mass of about 443 tons to a distant site, have the seed factory replicate many copies of itself there to increase its total manufacturing capacity, and then use the resulting automated industrial complex to construct more probes with a single seed factory on board each.

== Prospects for implementation ==
As the use of industrial automation has expanded over time, some factories have begun to approach a semblance of self-sufficiency that is suggestive of self-replicating machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.7.htm |title=3.7 Self-Replicating Automated Industrial Factory (1973-present) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such factories are unlikely to achieve "full closure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.6.htm |title=5.6 Closure Theory and Closure Engineering |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the cost and flexibility of automated machinery comes close to that of human labour and the manufacture of spare parts and other components locally becomes more economical than transporting them from elsewhere. As [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] has pointed out in [[Erewhon]], replication of partially closed universal machine tool factories is already possible. Since safety is a primary goal of all legislative consideration of regulation of such development, future development efforts may be limited to systems which lack either control, matter, or energy closure. Fully capable machine replicators are most useful for developing resources in dangerous environments which are not easily reached by existing transportation systems (such as [[outer space]]).

An artificial replicator can be considered to be a form of [[artificial life]]. Depending on its design, it might be subject to [[evolution]] over an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.L.htm |title=5.1.9.L Evolvability |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with robust [[error correction]], and the possibility of external intervention, the common [[science fiction]] scenario of robotic life run amok will remain extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.11.htm |title=5.11 Replicators and Public Safety |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], '''separated sets''' are pairs of [[subset]]s of a given [[topological space]] that are related to each other in a certain way: roughly speaking, neither overlapping nor touching.
The notion of when two sets are separated or not is important both to the notion of [[connected space]]s (and their connected components) as well as to the [[separation axiom]]s for topological spaces.

Separated sets should not be confused with [[separated space]]s (defined below), which are somewhat related but different.
[[Separable space]]s are again a completely different topological concept.

== Definitions ==

There are various ways in which two subsets of a topological space ''X'' can be considered to be separated.

*''A'' and ''B'' are '''disjoint''' if their [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] is the [[empty set]]. This property has nothing to do with topology as such, but only [[naive set theory|set theory]]; it is included here because it is the weakest in the sequence of different notions. For more on disjointness in general, see: [[disjoint sets]].
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated''' in ''X'' if each is disjoint from the other's [[closure (topology)|closure]]. The closures themselves do not have to be disjoint from each other; for example, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s [0,1) and (1,2] are separated in the [[real line]] '''R''', even though the point 1 belongs to both of their closures. More generally in any [[metric space]], two [[open balls]] ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = {y:''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y)&lt;''r''} and   ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = {y:''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,y)&lt;''s''} are separated whenever ''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ ''r''+''s''. Note that any two separated sets automatically must be disjoint.
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by neighbourhoods''' if there are [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhoods]] ''U'' of ''A'' and ''V'' of ''B'' such that ''U'' and ''V'' are disjoint. (Sometimes you will see the requirement that ''U'' and ''V'' be ''[[open (topology)|open]]'' neighbourhoods, but this makes no difference in the end.) For the example of ''A'' = [0,1) and ''B'' = (1,2], you could take ''U'' = (-1,1) and ''V'' = (1,3). Note that if any two sets are separated by neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated. If ''A'' and ''B'' are open and disjoint, then they must be separated by neighbourhoods; just take ''U'' := ''A'' and ''V'' := ''B''. For this reason, separatedness is often used with closed sets (as in the [[normal separation axiom]]).
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by closed neighbourhoods''' if there is a [[closed (topology)|closed]] neighbourhood ''U'' of ''A'' and a closed neighbourhood ''V'' of ''B'' such that ''U'' and ''V'' are disjoint. Our examples, [0,1) and (1,2], are ''not'' separated by closed neighbourhoods. You could make either ''U'' or ''V'' closed by including the point 1 in it, but you cannot make them both closed while keeping them disjoint. Note that if any two sets are separated by closed neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated by neighbourhoods.
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by a function''' if there exists a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the space ''X'' to the real line '''R''' such that ''f''(''A'') = {0} and ''f''(''B'') = {1}. (Sometimes you will see the [[unit interval]] [0,1] used in place of '''R''' in this definition, but it makes no difference in the end.) In our example, [0,1) and (1,2] are not separated by a function, because there is no way to continuously define ''f'' at the point 1. Note that if any two sets are separated by a function, then they are also separated by closed neighbourhoods; the neighbourhoods can be given in terms of the [[preimage]] of ''f'' as ''U'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[-''e'',''e''] and ''V'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[1-''e'',1+''e''], as long as ''e'' is a [[positive number|positive real number]] less than [[half|1/2]].
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''precisely separated by a function''' if there exists a continuous function ''f'' from ''X'' to '''R''' such that ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(0) = ''A'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1) = ''B''. (Again, you may also see the unit interval in place of '''R''', and again it makes no difference.) Note that if any two sets are precisely separated by a function, then certainly they are separated by a function. Since {0} and {1} are closed in '''R''', only closed sets are capable of being precisely separated by a function; but just because two sets are closed and separated by a function does not mean that they are automatically precisely separated by a function (even a different function).

== Relation to separation axioms and separated spaces ==

The ''separation axioms'' are various conditions that are sometimes imposed upon topological spaces which can be described in terms of the various types of separated sets.
As an example, we will define the T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axiom, which is the condition imposed on separated spaces.
Specifically, a topological space is ''separated'' if, given any two [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] points ''x'' and ''y'', the singleton sets {''x''} and {''y''} are separated by neighbourhoods.

Separated spaces are also called ''Hausdorff spaces'' or ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spaces''.
Further discussion of separated spaces may be found in the article [[Hausdorff space]].
General discussion of the various separation axioms is in the article [[Separation axiom]].

== Relation to connected spaces ==

Given a topological space ''X'', it is sometimes useful to consider whether it is possible for a subset ''A'' to be separated from its [[complement (set theory)|complement]].
This is certainly true if ''A'' is either the empty set or the entire space ''X'', but there may be other possibilities.
A topological space ''X'' is ''connected'' if these are the only two possibilities.
Conversely, if a nonempty subset ''A'' is separated from its own complement, and if the only [[subset]] of ''A'' to share this property is the empty set, then ''A'' is an ''open-connected component'' of ''X''.
(In the degenerate case where ''X'' is itself the [[empty set]] {}, authorities differ on whether {} is connected and whether {} is an open-connected component of itself.)

For more on connected spaces, see [[Connected space]].

== Relation to topologically distinguishable points ==

Given a topological space ''X'', two points ''x'' and ''y'' are ''topologically distinguishable'' if there exists an [[open set]] that one point belongs to but the other point does not.
If ''x'' and ''y'' are topologically distinguishable, then the [[singleton set]]s {''x''} and {''y''} must be disjoint.
On the other hand, if the singletons {''x''} and {''y''} are separated, then the points ''x'' and ''y'' must be topologically distinguishable.
Thus for singletons, topological distinguishability is a condition in between disjointness and separatedness.

For more about topologically distinguishable points, see [[Topological distinguishability]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4522">In [[computer sciences]] the '''separation of [[Protection mechanism|protection]] and [[Computer security|security]]''' is a [[computer design|design]] choice. Wulf et al. identified protection as a [[Mechanism (technology)|mechanism]] and security as a [[policy]],&lt;ref name="Wulf74"&gt;Wulf 74 pp.337-345&lt;/ref&gt; therefore making the protection-security distinction a particular case of the [[separation of mechanism and policy]] principle.

== Overview ==
The adoption of this distinction in a [[computer architecture]], usually means that protection is provided as a [[fault tolerance]] mechanism by [[Electronic hardware|hardware]]/[[firmware]] and [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], whereas the [[operating system]] and [[Process (computing)|applications]] implement their security policies. In this design, security policies rely therefore on the protection mechanisms and on additional [[cryptography]] techniques.

The major hardware approach&lt;ref name="Swift05"&gt;Swift 2005 p.26&lt;/ref&gt; for security or protection is the use of [[hierarchical protection domains]]. Prominent example of this approach is [[Ring (computer security)|ring]] architecture with "[[Ring (computer security)#Supervisor mode|supervisor mode]]" and "user mode").&lt;ref&gt;Intel Corporation 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Such approach adopts a policy already at the lower levels (hardware/firmware/kernel), restricting the rest of the system to rely on it. Therefore, the choice to distinguish between protection and security in the overall architecture design implies rejection of the hierarchical approach in favour of another one, the [[capability-based addressing]].&lt;ref name="Wulf74" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houdek et al. 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of models with protection and security separation include: [[access matrix]], [[UCLA Data Secure Unix]], [[take-grant]] and [[filter (security)|filter]]. Such separation is not found in models like: [[High watermark (computer security)|high-water mark]], [[Bell–LaPadula model|Bell–LaPadula]] (original and revisited), [[Information flow (information theory)|information flow]], [[strong dependency]] and [[constraints security model|constraints]].&lt;ref&gt;Landwehr 81, pp. 254, 257; there's a table showing which models for computer security separates protection mechanism and security policy on p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simulink''', developed by [[MathWorks]], is a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain [[dynamical systems]]. Its primary interface is a [[visual modeling|graphical block diagramming tool]] and a customizable set of block [[library (computer science)|libraries]]. It offers tight integration with the rest of the [[MATLAB]] environment and can either drive MATLAB or be scripted from it. Simulink is widely used in [[automatic control]] and [[digital signal processing]] for multidomain simulation and [[Model-based design|Model-Based Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vega-group.com/assets/documents/10000421matlabsimulink.pdf | title = The Successful development process with MATLAB Simulink in the framework of ESA's ATV project | format = PDF | publisher = Vega Group PLC | accessdate = 2011-11-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717191512/http://www.vega-group.com/assets/documents/10000421matlabsimulink.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.sae.org/2010-01-1999/|title=Model Based Design Accelerates the Development of Mechanical Locomotive Controls|work=sae.org|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Add-on products ==
MathWorks and other third-party hardware and software products can be used with Simulink. For example, [[Stateflow]] extends Simulink with a design environment for developing [[state machines]] and [[Flowchart|flow charts]].

[[MathWorks]] claims that, coupled with another of their products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_3|title=Automatic Code Generation - Simulink Coder|work=mathworks.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulink can [[automatic code generation|automatically generate]] [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] for [[real-time computing|real-time]] implementation of systems. As the efficiency and flexibility of the code improves, this is becoming more widely adopted for production systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1296h/1296%20(Denney).pdf A Software Safety Certification Plug-in for Automated Code Generators: Feasibility Study and Preliminary Design]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/10/general-motors-developed-twomode-hybrid-powertrain-with-mathworks-modelbased-design-cut-24-months-of.html|title=Green Car Congress: General Motors Developed Two-Mode Hybrid Powertrain With MathWorks Model-Based Design; Cut 24 Months Off Expected Dev Time|author=BioAge Media|work=greencarcongress.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to being a tool for [[embedded system]] design work because of its flexibility and capacity for quick iteration{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Embedded Coder creates code efficient enough for use in embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techsource.com.sg/eresources/eres_storyDetails.asp?stid=10 Lotus Engineering Develops Control Systems Software to Reduce Diesel Emissions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedes.se/Registrerade%20dokument/17%20RH%20JN%20A%20comparison%20of%20code%20generators.pdf A Comparison of Three Code Generators for Models Created in Simulink] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811055925/http://www.cedes.se/Registrerade%20dokument/17%20RH%20JN%20A%20comparison%20of%20code%20generators.pdf |date=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotivedesignline.com/howto/193300307|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018215921/http://automotivedesignline.com/howto/193300307|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 2007|title=Multitarget modeling reduces ECU software costs|work=EETimes|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulink Real-Time (formerly known as xPC Target), together with x86-based real-time systems, is an environment for simulating and testing Simulink and Stateflow models in real-time on the physical system.  Another MathWorks product&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_5|title=Code Generation - Embedded Coder - Simulink|work=mathworks.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supports specific embedded targets.  When used with other generic products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/products/slhdlcoder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_6 HDL Coder]&lt;/ref&gt; Simulink and [[Stateflow]] can automatically generate [[logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Matlab.family.png|300px|left|Matlab product family]] --&gt;

Simulink Verification and Validation enables systematic verification and validation of models through modeling style checking, [[requirements traceability]] and model coverage analysis. Simulink Design Verifier uses [[formal methods]] to identify design errors like [[integer overflow]], [[division by zero]] and dead logic, and generates test case scenarios for [[model checking]] within the Simulink environment.

[[SimEvents]] is used to add a library of graphical building blocks for modeling queuing systems to the Simulink environment, and to add an event-based simulation engine to the time-based simulation engine in Simulink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Discrete-Event Simulation | last=Cassandras| first=Christos | publisher= Springer US | date=2007-11-27 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g82w56/?v=editorial| accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore in Simulink any type of simulation can be done and the model can be simulated at any point in this environment.

Different type of blocks can be accessed using the Simulink library browser. And therefore the benefit could be taken out from this environment efficiently.

'''Sustainability standards and certifications''' are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are perhaps up to 500 such standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of [[Ecolabel]]s and standards for [[Organic food]] and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Overview article on sustainability standards in the food industry]&lt;/ref&gt; A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.

The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and [[NGO]] movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203029/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/sweatshops/nike/ |Global Exchange Campaign - Nike]&lt;/ref&gt; and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “[[sweatshop]]” factories by the likes of [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the [[SA8000]] and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the [[Fairtrade]] movement, administered by [[FLO International]] and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx Fairtrade Growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094221/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.

However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and [[precompetitive]] industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} .

With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering ''real'' social, environmental and economic results. The [[ISEAL Alliance]] has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.

Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of [[State of Sustainability Initiatives|The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI)]] project, facilitated by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

== Origin of global standards ==

''Most'' sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by [[social movements]] in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as [[UTZ Certified|Utz Certified]] (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including [[Kraft Foods]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[Nestle]], assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1668888 Article on the Development of the Common Code for the Coffee Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.

Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.

== Different sustainability standards ==
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Introduction to different standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.

=== Fairtrade ===

The [[Fairtrade]] label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The initiative performs [[development work]] and promotes its political vision of an [[alternative economy]], seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The ''most distinguishing'' feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a [[social premium]] that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.

=== Rainforest Alliance ===
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}
The [[Rainforest Alliance]] was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers’ welfare by establishing and securing ''sustainable'' livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed [[floor price]], the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Utz Certified ===

[[UTZ Certified]] (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster [[Ahold Coffee Company]] in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. ''Instruments'' include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has ''stringent'' chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).

=== Organic ===
The [[Organic farming|Organic]] standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on [[IFOAM]] Basic Standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== trustea ===

The [http://www.trustea.org trustea code] is designed to evaluate the social, economic, [[agronomic]] and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).

It is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly– producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.

=== SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===

SuRe® is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth&lt;/ref&gt; GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe® standard at a [[COP21]] event on 9 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/updates/gib-launches-sure%C2%AE-standard-cop21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
Other types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as [[GlobalGAP]];
Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as [[Starbucks#Coffee and Farmer Equity .28C.A.F.E..29 practices|Starbucks' CAFE Practices]]; and national programmes such as the [[Bord Bia|Irish Food Board]]'s 'Origin Green' scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Topics/Product-differentiation/Special-report-Implications-of-sustainability-certification-schemes-for-the-ACP ''Agritrade'': Implications of sustainability certification schemes for the ACP] 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards]] (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards|url=https://unfss.org|website=UNFSS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School''' is a scientific [[school of thought]] in the field of [[semiotics]] that was formed in 1964 and led by [[Juri Lotman]]. Among the other members of this school were [[Boris Uspensky]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Mikhail Gasparov]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[Isaak I. Revzin]], and others. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the [[semiotics of culture]].

==History==
The Tartu–Moscow School of Semiotics developed an original method of multidimensional [[cultural analysis]]. The languages of culture are interpreted as secondary modelling systems in relation to verbal language. This method permits a productive understanding of the use of different languages of culture.

This school is widely known for its journal, ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' (formerly published in Russian as ''Труды по знаковым системам''), published by [[Tartu University Press]]. It is the oldest semiotics journal in the world, established in 1964.

In its first period, the 1960s and 1970s, TMSS followed a [[structuralism|structuralist]] approach and was strongly influenced by [[Russian formalism]]. Since the 1980s, its approach can be characterized as [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]], and is connected with the introduction of [[Yuri Lotman|Juri Lotman's]] concept of [[semiosphere]] and its relation to [[organicism]].

From 1990s, TMSS has been succeeded by the Tartu Semiotics School, which is based in the Department of Semiotics of the University of Tartu and led by [[Kalevi Kull]], [[Peeter Torop]], [[Mihhail Lotman]], and others.

[[Time in physics]] is unambiguously operationally defined as "what a [[clock]] reads".&lt;ref name=DefRefs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnham/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Process instruments and controls handbook |journal=New York: Mcgraw-Hill |edition=3 |first1=Douglas M. |last1=Considine |first2=Glenn D. |last2=Considine |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1985 |isbn=978-0070124363 |pages=18–61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt1UAAAAMAAJ|bibcode=1985pich.book.....C }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[#Units of time|Units of Time]]. Time is one of the seven fundamental [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] in both the [[International System of Units]] and [[International System of Quantities]]. Time is used to define other quantities&amp;nbsp;– such as [[velocity]]&amp;nbsp;– so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition.&lt;ref name="TrialogueP3"&gt;Duff, Okun, Veneziano, ''ibid.'' p. 3. "There is no well established terminology for the fundamental constants of Nature.&amp;nbsp;... The absence of accurately defined terms or the uses (i.e., actually misuses) of ill-defined terms lead to confusion and proliferation of wrong statements."
&lt;/ref&gt; An [[operational definition]] of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single continuum called [[spacetime]] bring questions about space into questions about time, questions that have their roots in the works of early students of [[natural philosophy]].

Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and [[Engineering technologist|technologists]], and was a prime motivation in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the [[electronic transition]] [[frequency]] of [[caesium]] atoms (see [[#History of time measurement devices|below]]). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value ("[[Time value of money|time is money]]") as well as personal value, due to an [[awareness]] of the limited time in each day and in [[life expectancy|human life spans]].

== Temporal measurement and history ==
Generally speaking, methods of temporal measurement, or [[chronometry]], take two distinct forms: the [[calendar]], a mathematical tool for organising intervals of time,&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mapping Time: The Calendar and its History |last=Richards |first=E. G. |date=1998 |pages=3–5 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[clock]], a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time. In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day. Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously. The number (as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch&amp;nbsp;– a central reference point.

=== History of the calendar ===
{{Main article|Calendar}}

Artifacts from the [[Paleolithic]] suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Rudgley"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age |last=Rudgley |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Rudgley |date=1999 |pages=86–105 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lunar calendar]]s were among the first to appear, either 12 or 13 [[lunar month]]s (either 354 or 384 days). Without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. [[Lunisolar calendar]]s have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years. Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based, with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five epagomenal days at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Van Stone, Mark. "The Maya Long Count Calendar: An Introduction." Archaeoastronomy 24.(2011): 8–11. Academic Search Complete. Web. 20 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms of [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC put the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]] on a [[solar calendar]]. This [[Julian calendar]] was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] introduced a correction in 1582; the [[Gregorian calendar]] was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now the most commonly used calendar around the world, by far.

During the [[French Revolution]], a new clock and calendar were invented in attempt to de-Christianize time and create a more rational system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar. The [[French Republican Calendar]]'s days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a deviation from the 12-based [[duodecimal]] system used in many other devices by many cultures. The system was later abolished in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;"French Republican Calendar | Chronology." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|History of timekeeping devices}}
{{See also|Clock}}

A large variety of [[Measuring instrument|devices]] have been invented to measure time. The study of these devices is called [[horology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://nawcc.org/index.php/main-education | title=Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An Egyptian device that dates to c. 1500 BC, similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]], measured the passage of time from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a nonlinear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Jo Ellen ''Time's Pendulum: The Quest to Capture Time&amp;nbsp;– from Sundials to Atomic Clocks'' Plenum, 1998 {{isbn|0306457873}} p. 28
&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sundial]] uses a [[gnomon]] to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the hour. The position of the shadow marks the hour in [[Time zone|local time]]. The idea to separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is due the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used to count the passage of night.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, Michael A. "Why Is a Minute Divided into 60 Seconds, an Hour into 60 Minutes, Yet There Are Only 24 Hours in a Day?" Scientific American. Springer Nature, 5 Mar. 2007. Web. 21 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most precise timekeeping device of the [[ancient world]] was the [[water clock]], or ''clepsydra'', one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]]. They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the people from [[Chaldea]] (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, ''ibid'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventors]] and [[History of science and technology in China|engineers]] invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an [[escapement]] mechanism.

[[File:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary [[quartz watch]], 2007 ]]
The [[hourglass]] uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time. They were used in navigation. [[Ferdinand Magellan]] used 18 glasses on each ship for his circumnavigation of the globe (1522).&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, Laurence. ''Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe'' (HarperCollins Publishers, 2003), {{isbn|0066211735}}{{pageneeded|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incense sticks and candles were, and are, commonly used to measure time in temples and churches across the globe. Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey, famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical [[orrery]] about 1330.&lt;ref&gt;North, J. (2004) ''God's Clockmaker: Richard of Wallingford and the Invention of Time''. Oxbow Books. {{isbn|1852854510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, E (1979) "The St Albans Clock of Richard of Wallingford". ''Antiquarian Horology'' pp. 372–384.&lt;/ref&gt;

Great advances in accurate time-keeping were made by [[Galileo Galilei]] and especially [[Christiaan Huygens]] with the invention of pendulum driven clocks along with the invention of the minute hand by Jost Burgi.&lt;ref name="Clocks 2016"&gt;"History of Clocks." About.com Inventors. About.com, n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word [[clock]] probably comes from the Middle Dutch word ''klocke'' which, in turn, derives from the medieval Latin word ''clocca'', which ultimately derives from Celtic and is cognate with French, Latin, and German words that mean [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]. The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see [[ship's bell]]). The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.

Clocks can range from watches, to more exotic varieties such as the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a [[pendulum]].

Alarm clocks first appeared in ancient Greece around 250 BC with a water clock that would set off a whistle. This idea was later mechanized by Levi Hutchins and Seth E. Thomas.&lt;ref name="Clocks 2016"/&gt;

A [[chronometer watch|chronometer]] is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards. Initially, the term was used to refer to the [[marine chronometer]], a timepiece used to determine [[longitude]] by means of [[celestial navigation]], a precision firstly achieved by [[John Harrison]]. More recently, the term has also been applied to the [[chronometer watch]], a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency [[COSC]].

The most accurate timekeeping devices are [[atomic clock]]s, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211190407/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 February 2012 |title=New atomic clock can keep time for 200 million years: Super-precise instruments vital to deep space navigation |date=16 February 2008 |work=Vancouver Sun |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.

Atomic clocks use the frequency of [[electronic transition]]s in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the most common atoms used is [[caesium]], most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n99-22.cf |title=NIST-F1 Cesium Fountain Clock |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of [[caesium]] atoms. [[International System of Units|SI]] defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs atom.

Today, the [[Global Positioning System]] in coordination with the [[Network Time Protocol]] can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe.

In medieval philosophical writings, the '''atom''' was a unit of time referred to as the smallest possible division of time. The earliest known occurrence in English is in [[Byrhtferth]]'s ''Enchiridion'' (a science text) of 1010–1012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Byrhtferth of Ramsey |year=2008 |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |accessdate=15 September 2008 |url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9438957}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was defined as 1/564 of a ''momentum'' (1½ minutes),&lt;ref&gt;"atom", [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision September 2008 (contains relevant citations from Byrhtferth's ''Enchiridion'')&lt;/ref&gt; and thus equal to 15/94 of a second. It was used in the ''[[computus]]'', the process of calculating the date of Easter.

{{As of| May 2010}}, the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 12 [[attosecond]]s (1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−17&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), about 3.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; [[Planck time]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news192909576.html |title=12 attoseconds is the world record for shortest controllable time |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805173204/http://www.physorg.com/news192909576.html |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}

=== Units of time ===
{{See also|Time (Orders of magnitude)|Unit of time#List}}

The [[second]] (s) is the [[SI]] base unit. A [[minute]] (min) is 60 seconds in length, and an [[hour]] is 60 minutes in length. A day is 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length.

== Definitions and standards ==
The Mean [[Solar Time]] system defines the second as 1/86,400 of the mean [[solar day]], which is the year-average of the solar day. The solar day is the time interval between two successive solar noons, i.e., the time interval between two successive passages of the Sun across the local meridian. The local meridian is an imaginary line that runs from celestial north pole to celestial south pole passing directly over the head of the observer. At the local meridian the Sun reaches its highest point on its daily arc across the sky.

In 1874 the British Association for the Advancement of Science introduced the CGS (centimetre/gramme/second system) combining fundamental units of length, mass and time. The second is "elastic", because tidal friction is slowing the earth's rotation rate. For use in calculating ephemerides of celestial motion, therefore, in 1952 astronomers introduced the "ephemeris second", currently defined as

{{quote|the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].}}&lt;ref&gt;''Whitaker's Almanac 2013'' (ed. Ruth Northey), London 2012, p. 1131, {{isbn|978-1408172070}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear left}}

The CGS system has been superseded by the ''Système international''. The [[SI base unit]] for time is the [[SI]] second. The [[International System of Quantities]], which incorporates the SI, also defines larger units of time equal to fixed integer multiples of one second (1 s), such as the minute, hour and day. These are not part of the SI, but may be used alongside the SI. Other units of time such as the month and the year are not equal to fixed multiples of 1 s, and instead exhibit significant variations in duration.&lt;ref name="si_units"&gt;{{cite book |title=The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040427205458/http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 April 2004 |format=PDF |date=1998 |author=Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du Métre |accessdate=9 April 2011 |df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The official SI definition of the second is as follows:&lt;ref name="si_units"/&gt;&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{cite web |title=Base unit definitions: Second |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |publisher=[[NIST]] |accessdate=9 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417135428/http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |archivedate=17 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]] 133 atom.}}
{{clear left}}

At its 1997 meeting, the CIPM affirmed that this definition refers to a caesium atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K.&lt;ref name="si_units"/&gt;

The current definition of the second, coupled with the current definition of the metre, is based on the [[special theory of relativity]], which affirms our spacetime to be a [[Minkowski space]]. The definition of the second in mean solar time, however, is unchanged.

=== World time ===
While in theory, the concept of a single worldwide universal time-scale may have been conceived of many centuries ago, in practicality the technical ability to create and maintain such a time-scale did not become possible until the mid-19th century. The timescale adopted was Greenwich Mean Time, created in 1847. A few countries have replaced it with Coordinated Universal Time, [[UTC]].

==== History of the development of UTC ====
With the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], a greater understanding and agreement on the nature of time itself became increasingly necessary and helpful. In 1847 in Britain, [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) was first created for use by the British railways, the British navy, and the British shipping industry. Using telescopes, GMT was calibrated to the [[mean solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] in the UK.

As international commerce continued to increase throughout Europe, in order to achieve a more efficiently functioning modern society, an agreed upon, and highly accurate '''''international standard''''' of time measurement became necessary. In order to find or determine such a time-standard, three steps had to be followed:
# An internationally agreed upon time-standard had to be defined.
# This new time-standard then had to be consistently and accurately measured.
# The new time-standard then had to be freely shared and distributed around the world.

The development of what is now known as [[UTC|UTC time]] came about historically as an effort which first began as a collaboration between 41 nations, officially agreed to and signed at the [[International Meridian Conference]], in Washington D.C. in 1884. At this conference, the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the "universal day", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. astronomical day ''X'' began at noon of civil day ''X''. The purpose of this was to keep one night's observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the [[Royal Navy]], but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their [[Prime Meridian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howse|first1=Derek|title=Greenwich Time and the Longitude|year=1997|publisher=Philip Wilson|location=London|isbn=978-0856674686|pages=133–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 41 nations represented at the conference, the advanced time-technologies that had already come into use in Britain were fundamental components of the agreed upon method of arriving at a universal and agreed upon international time. In 1928 Greenwich Mean Time was rebranded for scientific purposes by the [[International Astronomical Union]] as [[Universal Time]] (UT). This was to avoid confusion with the previous system where the day had begun at noon. As the general public had always begun the day at midnight the timescale continued to be presented to them as Greenwich Mean Time. By 1956, universal time had been split into various versions – UT2, which smoothed for polar motion and seasonal effects, was presented to the public as Greenwich Mean Time. Later, UT1 (which smooths only for polar motion) became the default form of UT used by astronomers and hence the form used in navigation, sunrise and sunset and moonrise and moonset tables where the name Greenwich Mean Time continues to be employed. Greenwich Mean Time is also the preferred method of describing the timescale used by legislators. Even to the present day, UT is still based on an international telescopic system. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system. Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT, where the second is defined as 1/86 400 of the mean solar day.

For the better part of the first century following the "International Meridian Conference," until 1960, the methods and definitions of time-keeping that had been laid out at the conference proved to be adequate to meet time tracking needs of science. Still, with the advent of the "electronic revolution" in the latter half of the 20th century, the technologies that had been available at the time of the Convention of the Metre proved to be in need of further refinement in order to meet the needs of the ever-increasing precision that the "electronic revolution" had begun to require.

==== The ephemeris second ====
An invariable second (the "ephemeris second") had been defined, use of which removed the errors in ephemerides resulting from the use of the variable mean solar second as the time argument. In 1960 this ephemeris second was made the basis of the "coordinated universal time" which was being derived from atomic clocks. It is a specified fraction of the mean tropical year as at 1900 and, being based on historical telescope observations, corresponds roughly to the mean solar second of the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="USNO"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The SI second ====
In 1967 a further step was taken with the introduction of the SI second, essentially the ephemeris second as measured by atomic clocks and formally defined in atomic terms.&lt;ref name=mark58&gt;
{{cite journal |author=W Markowitz, RG Hall, L Essen, JVL Parry |year=1958 |url=http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |title=Frequency of cesium in terms of ephemeris time |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=105–107 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.1.105 |bibcode=1958PhRvL...1..105M |last2=Hall |last3=Essen |last4=Parry |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019014530/http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SI second (Standard Internationale second) is based directly on the measurement of the atomic-clock observation of the frequency oscillation of caesium atoms. It is the basis of all atomic timescales, e.g. coordinated universal time, GPS time, International Atomic Time, etc. Atomic clocks do not measure nuclear decay rates, which is a common misconception, but rather measure a certain natural vibrational frequency of caesium-133.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html Cesium Atoms at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223231150/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html |date=23 February 2015 }} USNO, downloaded 28 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinated universal time is subject to one constraint which does not affect the other atomic timescales. As it has been adopted as the civil timescale by some countries (most countries have opted to retain mean solar time) it is not permitted to deviate from GMT by more than 0.9 second. This is achieved by the occasional insertion of a leap second.

==== Current application of UTC ====

Most countries use mean solar time. Australia, Canada (Quebec only), Colombia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea (Bougainville only), Paraguay, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States and Venezuela use UTC. However, UTC is widely used by the scientific community in countries where mean solar time is official. [[UTC|UTC time]] is based on the SI second, which was first defined in 1967, and is based on the use of atomic clocks. Some other less used but closely related time-standards include [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]], [[Terrestrial Time]], and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]].

Between 1967 and 1971, UTC was periodically adjusted by fractional amounts of a second in order to adjust and refine for variations in mean solar time, with which it is aligned. After 1 January 1972, UTC time has been defined as being offset from atomic time by a whole number of seconds, changing only when a [[leap second]] is added to keep radio-controlled clocks synchronized with the rotation of the Earth.

The [[Global Positioning System]] also broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC. GPS-time is based on, and regularly synchronized with or from, UTC-time.

Earth is split up into a number of [[time zone]]s. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from GMT. For example, time zones at sea are based on GMT. In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to [[daylight saving time]] transitions.

=== Time conversions ===
These conversions are accurate at the millisecond level for time systems involving earth rotation (UT1 &amp; TT). Conversions between atomic time systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are accurate at the microsecond level.

===Sidereal time===
{{main|Sidereal time}}
{{see|Earth's rotation|Diurnal motion|Hour circle}}

Unlike [[solar time]], which is relative to the [[position of the Sun|apparent position]] of the [[Sun]], [[sidereal time]] is the measurement of time relative to that of a [[fixed stars|distant star]]. In [[astronomy]], sidereal time is used to predict when a [[star]] will reach its [[culmination|highest point]] in the sky. Due to [[Earth's orbit]]al motion around the Sun, a mean solar day is about 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a mean sidereal day, or {{fract|1|366}} more than a mean sidereal day.

=== Chronology ===
{{Main article|Chronology}}

Another form of time measurement consists of studying the [[past]]. Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a [[chronology]]), and can be put into chronological groups ([[periodization]]). One of the most important systems of periodization is the [[geologic time scale]], which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the [[Earth]] and its life. Chronology, periodization, and interpretation of the past are together known as the study of history.

* [[time interval]]&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-010; ISO 80000-3:2006, item 3–7&lt;/ref&gt; as an object&amp;nbsp;– part of the time axes limited by two instants. Being an object, it has no value;
* [[Calendar date|date]]&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-012: "mark attributed to an instant by means of a specified time scale&lt;/ref&gt; as a quantity characterising an instant. As a quantity, it has a value which may be expressed in a variety of ways, for example "2014-04-26T09:42:36,75" in [[ISO 8601|ISO standard]] format, or more colloquially such as "today, 9:42&amp;nbsp;a.m.";
* [[duration (philosophy)|duration]]&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-013: "range of a time interval (113-01-10)"&lt;/ref&gt; as a quantity characterizing a time interval.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 80000-3:2006, item 3–7&lt;/ref&gt; As a quantity, it has a value, such as a number of minutes, or may be described in terms of the quantities (such as times and dates) of its beginning and end.

=== Time in Greek mythology ===
The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, [[Chronos]] and [[Kairos]]. The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally "the right or opportune moment", relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In Greek mythology, Chronos (Ancient Greek: Χρόνος) is identified as the Personification of Time. His name in Greek means "time" and is alternatively spelled Chronus (Latin spelling) or Khronos. Chronos is usually portrayed as an old, wise man with a long, gray beard, such as "Father Time". Some English words whose etymological root is khronos/chronos include ''chronology'', ''chronometer'', ''chronic'', ''anachronism'', ''synchronise'', and ''chronicle''.

Two contrasting viewpoints on time divide prominent philosophers.

The opposing view is that ''time'' does not refer to any kind of "container" that events and objects "move through", nor to any entity that "flows", but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with [[space]] and number) within which humans sequence and compare events.

In short, an empty space would be a substance with no properties; it will be a substance that even God cannot modify or destroy.... That is, space and time are internal or intrinsic features of the complete concepts of things, not extrinsic.... Leibniz's view has two major implications. First, there is no absolute location in either space or time; location is always the situation of an object or event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time are not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are, rather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways of perceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are phenomena or, strictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions that are well-founded upon the internal properties of substances).... It is sometimes convenient to think of space and time as something "out there," over and above the entities and their relations to each other, but this convenience must not be confused with reality. Space is nothing but the order of co-existent objects; time nothing but the order of successive events. This is usually called a relational theory of space and time. |accessdate=9 April 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000548/http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H7 |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}

This view is shared by Abrahamic faiths as they believe time started by creation, therefore the only thing being infinite is God and everything else, including time, is finite.

With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as [[Substance theory|substances]], but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an [[Abstract structure|abstract]] conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, [[quantity|quantify]] their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, ''time'' does not refer to any kind of entity that "flows," that objects "move through," or that is a "container" for events. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] the extent of and distances between [[object (philosophy)|objects]], and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between [[Phenomenon|events]]. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible [[Schema (Kant)#Time|schema]] of a pure concept or category.

[[Henri Bergson]] believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor a mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as ''[[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]]''. Duration, in Bergson's view, was creativity and memory as an essential component of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Bergson, Henri (1907) ''Creative Evolution''. trans. by Arthur Mitchell. Mineola: Dover, 1998.
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Heidegger]] we do not exist inside time, we ''are'' time. Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of ''having been'', which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes "being ahead of oneself" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended.&lt;ref name=Balslev&gt;

[[J.M.E. McTaggart]]'s 1908 ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'' argues that, since every event has the characteristic of being both present and not present (i.e., future or past), that time is a self-contradictory idea (see also [[Philosophy of space and time#The flow of time|The flow of time]]).

These arguments often center on what it means for something to be ''unreal''. Modern physicists generally believe that time is as ''real'' as space&amp;nbsp;– though others, such as [[Julian Barbour]] in his book ''[[The End of Time (book)|The End of Time]]'', argue that quantum equations of the universe take their true form when expressed in the timeless [[Configuration space (physics)|realm]] containing every possible ''now'' or momentary configuration of the universe, called '[[Platonia (philosophy)|platonia]]' by Barbour.&lt;ref&gt;

A modern philosophical theory called [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]] views the past and the future as human-mind interpretations of movement instead of real parts of time (or "dimensions") which coexist with the present. This theory rejects the existence of all direct interaction with the past or the future, holding only the present as tangible. This is one of the philosophical arguments against time travel. This contrasts with [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (all time: present, past and future, is real) and the [[Growing block universe|growing block theory]] (the present and the past are real, but the future is not).

== Physical definition ==
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
{{Main article|Time in physics}}

Until [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space, time was considered to be the same everywhere in the universe, with all observers measuring the same time interval for any event.&lt;ref&gt;Herman M. Schwartz, ''Introduction to Special Relativity'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968, hardcover 442 pages, see {{isbn|0882754785}} (1977 edition), pp. 10–13
&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]] is based on this Newtonian idea of time.

Einstein, in his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein, H. A. Lorentz, H. Weyl, H. Minkowski, ''The Principle of Relativity'', Dover Publications, Inc, 2000, softcover 216 pages, {{isbn|0486600815}}, See pp. 37–65 for an English translation of Einstein's original 1905 paper.
&lt;/ref&gt;
postulated the constancy and finiteness of the speed of light for all observers. He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.

The theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in [[Minkowski space]]time, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a [[light-year]] is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two [[Event (relativity)|events]] in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an ''[[Spacetime interval|invariant interval]]'', which can be either [[space-like]], [[light-like]], or [[time-like]]. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any [[frame of reference]], there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the ''invariant interval'' between the events is independent of the observer (and his or her velocity).

=== Classical mechanics ===
In non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]], Newton's concept of "relative, apparent, and common time" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the result that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.

Time has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging into spacetime in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the [[inertial frame of reference|spatial reference frame of the observer]], and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.

On the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the [[past]] is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the [[future]] is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |title=Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity |publisher=YouTube |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182611/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |title=Time Travel: Einstein's big idea (Theory of Relativity) |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182714/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hours |first=After |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19659_7-theories-time-that-would-make-doc-browns-head-explode.html |title=7 Theories on Time That Would Make Doc Brown's Head Explode |publisher=Cracked.com |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922232407/http://www.cracked.com/article_19659_7-theories-time-that-would-make-doc-browns-head-explode.html |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time dilation ===
[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and occurs later in the red frame.]]
{{Main article|Time dilation}}

[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on [[Causality (physics)|cause and effect]], measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Subatomic particle]]s exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], in the high-speed particle's [[Inertial frame of reference|frame of reference]], it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its [[mean lifetime]], and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to "slow down" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or "warped") by high-speed motion.

Einstein (''The Meaning of Relativity''): "Two [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]] taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which register the same simultaneously."

Einstein wrote in his book, ''Relativity'', that [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity is also relative]], i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.

=== Relativistic time versus Newtonian time ===
[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|Views of spacetime along the [[world line]] of a rapidly accelerating observer in a relativistic universe. The events ("dots") that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past [[light cone]] of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer.]]

The animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and the relativistic descriptions. At the heart of these differences are the [[Galilean transformation|Galilean]] and [[Lorentz transformation]]s applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively.

In the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the spacetime trajectory ("[[world line]]") of the observer. The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime.

The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.

In the Newtonian description these changes are such that ''time'' is absolute:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3642975998 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of p. 30]&lt;/ref&gt; the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the 'now' (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer).

However, in the relativistic description the ''observability of events'' is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the "[[light cone]]" of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of ''absolute time'' is no longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.

=== Arrow of time ===
{{Main article|Arrow of time}}

Time appears to have a direction&amp;nbsp;– the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an [[arrow of time]], and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modelled by a parameter in the system being analysed, where there is no "proper time": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] arrow of time, which points away from the [[Big Bang]], [[CPT symmetry]], and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only travelling forwards in time (see [[light cone]]). In [[particle physics]], the [[CP violation|violation of CP symmetry]] implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve [[CPT symmetry]] as stated above. The standard description of [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]] is also time asymmetric (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]). The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that [[entropy]] must increase over time (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|Entropy]]). This can be in either direction – Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time. So entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy universe is a statistical aberration, in the similar manner as tossing a coin often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row. However, this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZujlUD1oAAC |last=Greene |first=Brian |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos|chapter= Chapter 6: Chance and the Arrow |date=2005 |location=London|isbn=978-0141959955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantized time ===
{{See also|Chronon}}

Time quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical theories (the [[Standard Model]] of Particles and Interactions and [[General Relativity]]) time is not quantized.

[[Planck time]] (~ 5.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−44&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) is the unit of time in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]]. Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist; see for instance [[loop quantum gravity]].

== Time travel ==
{{Main article|Time travel}}
{{See also|Time travel in fiction|Wormhole|Twin paradox}}

Time travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the normal "flow" of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) "persist" in some way. Time travel has been a [[plot device]] in fiction since the 19th century. Travelling backwards in time has never been verified, presents many theoretical problems, and may be an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |title=Informational Time and Space |journal=Prespacetime Journal |first=Gunn |last=Quznetsov |date=30 March 2010 |volume=1 |issue=2 |accessdate=30 December 2016 |via=Prespacetime Journal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102085729/http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |archivedate=2 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a [[Time travel|time machine]].

A central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of [[causality]]; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a [[temporal paradox]]. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch points]], [[Multiverse|parallel realities]], or [[universe]]s.

Another solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, [[free will]] either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the [[grandfather paradox]] because it is a historical fact that your grandfather was not killed before his child (your parent) was conceived. This view doesn't simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveller would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveller moves from. More elaboration on this view can be found in the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]].

== Time perception ==
[[File:William James b1842c.jpg|thumb|upright|Philosopher and psychologist [[William James]]]]
{{Main article|Time perception}}

The [[specious present]] refers to the time duration wherein one's [[perception]]s are considered to be in the present. The experienced present is said to be ‘specious’ in that, unlike the objective present, it is an interval and not a durationless instant. The term ''specious present'' was first introduced by the psychologist [[E.R. Clay]], and later developed by [[William James]].&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andersen, Holly |author2=Rick Grush |title=A brief history of time-consciousness: historical precursors to James and Husserl |publisher=Journal of the History of Philosophy |date=2009 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=277–307 |url=http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/bhtc/Andersen&amp;Grush.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216100320/http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/bhtc/Andersen%26Grush.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 February 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=9 April 2011 |df=}}

=== Biopsychology ===
The brain's judgment of time is known to be a highly distributed system, including at least the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]] as its components. One particular component, the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus|suprachiasmatic nuclei]], is responsible for the [[circadian rhythm|circadian (or daily) rhythm]], while other cell clusters appear capable of shorter-range ([[ultradian]]) timekeeping.

Psychoactive drugs can impair the judgment of time. [[Stimulant]]s can lead both humans and rats to overestimate time intervals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote= |last=Wittmann |first=M. |author2=Leland D.S. |author3=Churan J. |author4=Paulus M.P. |date=8 October 2007 |title=Impaired time perception and motor timing in stimulant-dependent subjects |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend. |volume=90 |issue=2–3 |pages=183–192 |pmid=17434690 |pmc=1997301 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2007.03.005}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Such chemicals will either excite or inhibit the firing of [[neuron]]s in the brain, with a greater firing rate allowing the brain to register the occurrence of more events within a given interval (speed up time) and a decreased firing rate reducing the brain's capacity to distinguish events occurring within a given interval (slow down time).&lt;ref name="Carter 186–187"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Human Brain Book |first1=Rita |last1=Carter |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |date=2009 |isbn=978-0756654412 |pages=186–187 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCV6cwU3qm0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mental chronometry]] is the use of response time in perceptual-motor tasks to infer the content, duration, and temporal sequencing of cognitive operations.

=== Development of awareness and understanding of time in children ===
Children's expanding cognitive abilities allow them to understand time more clearly. Two- and three-year-olds' understanding of time is mainly limited to "now and not now." Five- and six-year-olds can grasp the ideas of past, present, and future. Seven- to ten-year-olds can use clocks and calendars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201403/time-management-kids |title=Time Management for Kids |last=Kennedy-Moore |first=Eileen |date=28 March 2014 |website= |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Time management|Time discipline}}

In sociology and [[anthropology]], [[time discipline]] is the general name given to [[society|social]] and economic rules, conventions, customs, and expectations governing the measurement of time, the [[social currency]] and awareness of time measurements, and people's expectations concerning the observance of these customs by others.

The use of time is an important issue in understanding [[human behavior]], education, and [[travel behavior]]. [[Time-use research]] is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been observed to be about 20–30 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period.

[[Time management]] is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.

A sequence of events, or series of events, is a [[sequence]] of items, facts, events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order (chronological order), often with [[causality]] relationships among the items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sequence – Order of Important Events |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |publisher=[[Austin Independent School District]] |date=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172713/http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}

Because of [[causality]], cause precedes [[result|effect]], or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause. A sequence of events can be presented in text, [[Table (information)|tables]], [[chart]]s, or timelines. The description of the items or events may include a [[timestamp]]. A sequence of events that includes the time along with place or location information to describe a sequential path may be referred to as a [[world line]].

and timetables for scheduling activities. A sequence of events may also be used to help describe [[Process (engineering)|processes]] in science, technology, and medicine. A sequence of events may be focused on past events (e.g., stories, history, chronology), on future events that must be in a predetermined order (e.g., [[plan]]s, [[schedule (project management)|schedules]], procedures, timetables), or focused on the observation of past events with the expectation that the events will occur in the future (e.g., processes, projections). The use of a sequence of events occurs in fields as diverse as machines ([[cam timer]]), documentaries (''[[Seconds From Disaster]]''), law ([[Choice of law#Sequence of events in conflict cases|choice of law]]), [[computer simulation]] ([[discrete event simulation]]), and [[electric power transmission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Utility Communications Architecture (UCA) glossary |url=http://www.nettedautomation.com/glossary_menue/glossary_uca.html |publisher=NettedAutomation |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210131225/http://nettedautomation.com/glossary_menue/glossary_uca.html |archivedate=10 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}

== Spatial conceptualization of time ==
Although time is regarded as an abstract concept, there is increasing evidence that time is [[Conceptual metaphor|conceptualized]] in the mind in terms of space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Núñez |first=Rafael |last2=Cooperrider |first2=Kensy |last3=Doan |first3=D |last4=Wassmann |first4=Jürg |date=2012-07-01 |title=Contours of time: Topographic construals of past, present, and future in the Yupno valley of Papua New Guinea |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027712000571 |journal=Cognition |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.03.007|pmid=22542697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, instead of thinking about time in a general, abstract way, humans think about time in a spatial way and mentally organize it as such. Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal events in a specific way.

This spatial representation of time is often represented in the mind as a Mental Time Line (MTL).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bottini |first=Roberto |last2=Crepaldi |first2=Davide |last3=Casasanto |first3=Daniel |last4=Crollen |first4=Virgine |last5=Collignon |first5=Olivier |date=2015-08-01 |title=Space and time in the sighted and blind |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771500075X |journal=Cognition |volume=141 |pages=67–72 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2015.04.004|pmid=25935747 |hdl=2078.1/199842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal order. These origins are shaped by many environmental factors&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;––for example, [[literacy]] appears to play a large role in the different types of MTLs, as reading/[[Writing system|writing direction]] provides an everyday temporal orientation that differs from culture to culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In western cultures, the MTL may unfold rightward (with the past on the left and the future on the right) since people read and write from left to right.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Western calendars also continue this trend by placing the past on the left with the future progressing toward the right. Conversely, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and [[Israeli Hebrew language|Israeli-Hebrew]] speakers read from right to left, and their MTLs unfold leftward (past on the right with future on the left), and evidence suggests these speakers organize time events in their minds like this as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This linguistic evidence that abstract concepts are based in spatial concepts also reveals that the way humans mentally organize time events varies across cultures––that is, a certain specific mental organization system is not universal. So, although Western cultures typically associate past events with the left and future events with the right according to a certain MTL, this kind of horizontal, egocentric MTL is not the spatial organization of all cultures. Although most developed nations use an egocentric spatial system, there is recent evidence that some cultures use an allocentric spatialization, often based on environmental features.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A recent study of the indigenous Yupno people of [[Papua New Guinea]] focused on the directional gestures used when individuals used time-related words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When speaking of the past (such as "last year" or "past times"), individuals gestured downhill, where the river of the valley flowed into the ocean. When speaking of the future, they gestured uphill, toward the source of the river. This was common regardless of which direction the person faced, revealing that the Yupno people may use an allocentric MTL, in which time flows uphill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A similar study of the Pormpuraawans, an [[Aboriginal groupings of Western Australia|aboriginal group]] in Australia, revealed a similar distinction in which when asked to organize photos of a man aging "in order," individuals consistently placed the youngest photos to the east and the oldest photos to the west, regardless of which direction they faced.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/10/19/0956797610386621.full |title=Remembrances of Times East |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1635–9 |journal=Psychological Science |pmid=20959511|access-date=2016-12-07|year=2010 |last1=Boroditsky |first1=L. |last2=Gaby |first2=A. |doi=10.1177/0956797610386621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This directly clashed with an American group which consistently organized the photos from left to right. Therefore, this group also appears to have an allocentric MTL, but based on the cardinal directions instead of geographical features.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The wide array of distinctions in the way different groups think about time leads to the broader question that different groups may also think about other abstract concepts in different ways as well, such as causality and number.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''trace diagrams''' are a graphical means of performing computations in [[linear algebra|linear]] and [[multilinear algebra]]. They can be represented as (slightly modified) [[graph theory|graphs]] in which some edges are labeled by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The simplest trace diagrams represent the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and [[determinant]] of a matrix. Several results in linear algebra, such as [[Cramer's Rule]] and the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], have simple diagrammatic proofs. They are closely related to [[Penrose's graphical notation]].

== Formal definition ==

Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] of [[vector space|dimension]] ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' (with ''n''≥2), and let Fun(''V'',''V'') denote the [[linear transformation]]s on ''V''. An ''' ''n''-trace diagram''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}=(V_1\sqcup V_2\sqcup V_n, E)&lt;/math&gt;, where the sets ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;''n'') are composed of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] ''i'', together with the following additional structures:
* a ''ciliation'' at each vertex in the graph, which is an explicit ordering of the adjacent edges at that vertex;
* a labeling ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fun(''V'',''V'') associating each degree-2 vertex to a linear transformation.
Note that ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' should be considered as distinct sets in the case&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. A '''framed trace diagram''' is a trace diagram together with a partition of the degree-1 vertices ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into two disjoint ordered collections called the ''inputs'' and the ''outputs''.

The "graph" underlying a trace diagram may have the following special features, which are not always included in the standard definition of a graph:
* [[Loop (graph theory)|Loops]] are permitted (a loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself).
* Edges that have no vertices are permitted, and are represented by small circles.
* Multiple edges between the same two vertices are permitted.

=== Drawing conventions ===

* When trace diagrams are drawn, the ciliation on an ''n''-vertex is commonly represented by a small mark between two of the incident edges (in the figure above, a small red dot); the specific ordering of edges follows by proceeding counter-clockwise from this mark.
* The ciliation and labeling at a degree-2 vertex are combined into a single directed node that allows one to differentiate the first edge (the ''incoming'' edge) from the second edge (the ''outgoing'' edge).
* Framed diagrams are drawn with ''inputs'' at the bottom of the diagram and ''outputs'' at the top of the diagram. In both cases, the ordering corresponds to reading from left to right.

=== Correspondence with multilinear functions ===

Every framed trace diagram corresponds to a [[multilinear]] function between [[tensor]] powers of the vector space ''V''. The degree-1 vertices correspond to the inputs and outputs of the function, while the degree-''n'' vertices correspond to the generalized [[Levi-Civita symbol]] (which is an [[anti-symmetric tensor]] related to the [[determinant]]). If a diagram has no output strands, its function maps tensor products to a scalar. If there are no degree-1 vertices, the diagram is said to be '''closed''' and its corresponding function may be identified with a scalar.

By definition, a trace diagram's function is computed using [[signed graph]] coloring. For each [[edge coloring]] of the graph's edges by ''n'' labels, so that no two edges adjacent to the same vertex have the same label, one assigns a ''weight'' based on the labels at the vertices and the labels adjacent to the matrix labels. These weights become the coefficients of the diagram's function.

In practice, a trace diagram's function is typically computed by ''decomposing'' the diagram into smaller pieces whose functions are known. The overall function can then be computed by re-composing the individual functions.

== Examples ==

=== 3-Vector diagrams ===
Several [[vector identities]] have easy proofs using trace diagrams. This section covers 3-trace diagrams. In the translation of diagrams to functions, it can be shown that the positions of ciliations at the degree-3 vertices has no influence on the resulting function, so they may be omitted.

It can be shown that the [[cross product]] and [[dot product]] of 3-dimensional vectors are represented by

:[[Image:Trace diagram vector product definitions.png|300px]]

In this picture, the inputs to the function are shown as vectors in yellow boxes at the bottom of the diagram. The cross product diagram has an output vector, represented by the free strand at the top of the diagram. The dot product diagram does not have an output vector; hence, its output is a scalar.

As a first example, consider the scalar triple product identity

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{w})=(\mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{u})\cdot\mathbf{v}=\det(\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}\mathbf{w}).&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this diagrammatically, note that all of the following figures are different depictions of the same 3-trace diagram (as specified by the above definition):

:[[File:Trace diagram triple product identity.png|350px]]

Combining the above diagrams for the cross product and the dot product, one can read off the three leftmost diagrams as precisely the three leftmost scalar triple products in the above identity. It can also be shown that the rightmost diagram represents det['''u''' '''v''' '''w''']. The scalar triple product identity follows because each is a different representation of the same diagram's function.

As a second example, one can show that
:[[File:Trace diagram 3 binor identity.png|100px]]
(where the equality indicates that the identity holds for the underlying multilinear functions). One can show that this kind of identity does not change by "bending" the diagram or attaching more diagrams, provided the changes are consistent across all diagrams in the identity. Thus, one can bend the top of the diagram down to the bottom, and attach vectors to each of the free edges, to obtain
:[[File:Trace diagram quadruple product identity.png|350px]]
which reads
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{u})\cdot(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{w})=(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{v})(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{w})-(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{w})(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}),&lt;/math&gt;
a well-known identity relating four 3-dimensional vectors.

=== Diagrams with matrices ===

The simplest closed diagrams with a single matrix label correspond to the coefficients of the [[characteristic polynomial]], up to a scalar factor that depends only on the dimension of the matrix. One representation of these diagrams is shown below, where &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate equality up to a scalar factor that depends only on the dimension ''n'' of the underlying vector space.

:[[File:Trace diagram invariant diagrams.png|600px]].

== Properties ==

Let ''G'' be the group of n×n matrices. If a closed trace diagram is labeled by ''k'' different matrices, it may be interpreted as a function from &lt;math&gt;G^k&lt;/math&gt; to an algebra of multilinear functions. This function is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under simultaneous [[conjugacy class|conjugation]], that is, the function corresponding to &lt;math&gt;(g_1,\ldots,g_k)&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the function corresponding to &lt;math&gt;(a g_1 a^{-1}, \ldots, a g_k a^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; for any invertible &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

== Extensions and applications ==

Trace diagrams may be specialized for particular [[Lie groups]] by altering the definition slightly. In this context, they are sometimes called [[birdtracks]], [[Penrose graphical notation|tensor diagrams]], or [[Penrose graphical notation]].

Trace diagrams have primarily been used by physicists as a tool for studying [[Lie groups]]. The most common applications use [[representation theory]] to construct [[spin network]]s from trace diagrams. In mathematics, they have been used to study [[character variety|character varieties]].

'''Political war-weariness''' is the [[public]] or political disapproval for the continuation of a prolonged conflict or [[war]]. The causes normally involve the intensity of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]]—financial, [[civilian]], and [[military]]. It also occurs when a belligerent has the ability to easily leave the conflict yet continues to stay. War-weariness normally leads to a distrust in [[government]] or military leadership and can spark protest and [[anti-war movement|anti-war movements]]. It can also be fueled when a belligerent is found guilty of [[war crime|war crimes]], which can create domestic and international backlash. Rates of enlistment and the [[morale]] of the armed-forces are often affected by war-weariness.

War-weariness is less likely to appear in [[Military dictatorship|military dictatorships]], especially those with heavy propaganda and censorship. According to [[Immanuel Kant]], democratic nations have a better chance of having unpopular news of the war reach the masses, increasing their chance and level of war-weariness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Causes War?: An Introduction to Theories of International Conflict|last=Cashman|first=Greg|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2013|isbn=0742566528|location=|pages=234-235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
