{{Year nav topic5|1700|music}}

The year '''1700 in music''' involved some significant events.  Much of the music in the 1700s America originated from places such as England, Ireland, Italy, France, and Africa.  Much of the music in this time period were ballads, folk songs, drum signals, and psalms.  Many songs were used as theater songs, recruiting songs, military marches, and even some dance music.  Around this time was when the piano started becoming more and more popular.  Violins, fiddles, and flutes were among the most played and most known instruments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colonialmusic.org/colonial-music-resources/essays/about-early-american-music.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many of the most famous composers in classical music history have come out of the 18th century time period.  These include men such as Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Bach Johann Sebastian.  Mozart is considered the "greatest musical genius of all time."  In his lifetime he has been a part of forty-one symphonies, twenty-five string quartets, and nineteen masses.  This was only a fraction of the work he has done.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history1700s.com/index.php/articles/25-society-and-culture/9-18th-century-composers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The coin is made of two [[alloy]]s: the inner part of nickel [[brass]], the outer part of copper-nickel. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.

The €2 coin is the coin subject to legal-tender&lt;ref&gt;[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins|Other commemorative coins]] of various values are minted, but not for general circulation.&lt;/ref&gt; [[€2 commemorative coins|commemorative issues]] and hence there is a large number of national sides, including three issues of identical commemorative sides by all eurozone members.

== History ==
[[File:LV_2_eiro.png|thumb|Latvian 2 euro coin]]
[[File:N22978_2_eur_aversas.jpg|thumb|Lithuanian 2 euro coin]]
The coin dates from 2002, when [[euro coins]] and [[euro banknotes|notes]] were introduced in the 12-member [[eurozone]] and its [[Eurozone#Use outside the Union|related territories]]. The common side was designed by [[Luc Luycx]], a Belgian artist who won a Europe-wide competition to design the new coins. The designs of the one- and two-euro coins were intended to show the [[European Union]] (EU) as a whole with the then-15 countries more closely joined together than on the 10 to 50-cent coins (the 1-cent to 5-cent coins showed the EU as one, though intending to show its place in the world).

The national sides, then 15 (eurozone plus [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] who could mint their own) were each designed according to national competitions, though to specifications which applied to all coins such as the requirement of including twelve stars. National designs were not allowed to change until the end of 2008, unless a monarch (whose portrait usually appears on the coins) dies or abdicates. This happened in Monaco and the Vatican City, resulting in three new designs in circulation (the Vatican had an interim design until the new Pope was selected). National designs have seen some changes due to a new rule stating that national designs should include the name of the issuing country (neither [[Finland]] and [[Belgium]] show a country name, and hence have made minor changes).

In 2004 the commemorative coins were allowed to be minted in six states (a short interim period was set aside so citizens could get used to the new currency). By 2007 nearly all states had issued a commemorative issue and the first eurozone-wide commemorative was issued to celebrate the Treaty of Rome.

As the [[Member state of the European Union|EU's membership]] has since [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanded]] in 2004 and 2007, with further expansions envisaged, the common face of all euro coins from the value of 10 euro cent and above were redesigned in 2007 to show a new map. This map showed Europe, not just the EU, as one continuous landmass; however, Cyprus was moved west as the map cut off after the [[Bosphorus]] (which was seen as excluding Turkey for political reasons). The redesign in 2007, rather than in 2004, was due to the fact that 2007 saw the first enlargement of the [[eurozone]]: the entry of Slovenia. Hence, the Slovenian design was added to the designs in circulation.

Cyprus and Malta joined in 2008, Slovakia in 2009 and Estonia in 2011, bringing four more designs. Also in 2009, the second eurozone-wide issue of a 2-euro commemorative coin was issued, celebrating ten years of the introduction of the euro. In 2012, the third eurozone-wide issue of a 2-euro commemorative coin was issued, celebrating 10 years of euro coins and notes. In 2015, the fourth eurozone-wide issue for this denomination was issued, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the [[Flag of Europe]].

== Design ==
The coins are composed of two alloys. The inner circle is composed of three layers (nickel brass, nickel, nickel brass) and the outer ring of copper-nickel giving them a two colour (silver outer and gold inner) appearance. The diameter of the coins is 25.75&amp;nbsp;mm, the thickness is 2.20&amp;nbsp;mm and the mass is 8.5&amp;nbsp;grams. The coins' edges are finely milled with lettering, though the exact design of the edge can vary between states with some choosing to write the issuing state's name or denomination around the edge (see "edges" below). The coins have been used from 2002, though some are dated 1999 which is the year the euro was created as a currency, but not put into general circulation.

=== Reverse (common) side ===
The reverse (used from 2007 onwards) was designed by Luc Luycx and displays a map of Europe, not including Iceland and cutting off, in a [[semicircle]], at the Bosporus, north through the middle of Ukraine and Belarus and through northern [[Scandinavia]]. Cyprus is located further west than it should be and Malta is shown disproportionally large so it appears on the map. The map has numerous indentations giving an appearance of geography rather than a flat design. Six fine lines cut across the map except where there is landmass and have a star at each end – reflecting the twelve stars on the [[flag of Europe]]. Across the map is the word EURO, and a large number 2 appears to the left hand side of the coin. The designer's initials, LL, appear next to Cyprus.

Luc Luycx designed the original coin, which was much the same except the design was only of the then 15 members in their entirety and showing border and no geographic features. The map was less detailed and the lines the stars were upon cut through where there would be landmass in eastern Europe if it were shown.

=== Obverse (national) sides ===
The obverse side of the coin depends on the issuing country. All have to include twelve stars (in most cases a circle around the edge), the engravers initials and the year of issue. New designs also have to include the name or initials of the issuing country. The side cannot repeat the denomination of the coin unless the issuing country uses an alphabet other than [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (currently, Greece is the only such country, hence it engraves "2 ΕΥΡΩ" upon its coins). Austria also engraves "2 EURO" on the reverse of its coins.

==== Edges ====
The edges of the 2 euro coin vary according to the issuing state;
{{Standard issue €2 edge inscriptions}}

==== Planned designs ====
{{See also|Enlargement of the eurozone}}
Austria, Germany and Greece will also at some point need to update their designs to comply with guidelines stating they must include the issuing state's name or initial, and not repeat the denomination of the coin.

In addition, there are several EU states that have not yet adopted the euro, some of them have already agreed upon their coin designs however it is not known exactly when they will adopt the currency, and therefore these are not yet minted. See [[enlargement of the Eurozone]] for expected entry dates of these countries. Latvia officially introduced the euro on 1 January 2014, its design for the 2 euro coin is similar to the 5 [[Latvian lat|lati]] coin's design from 1929 to 1932:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Lati|url=http://worldcoingallery.com/countries/display_wd.php?dir=img7&amp;image=105-9&amp;desc=Latvia%20km9%205%20Lati%20(1929-1932)&amp;query=Latvia|work=World Coin Gallery|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemorative issues ==
{{Main|€2 commemorative coins}}

Each state, allowed to issue coins, may also mint two [[commemorative coins]] each year (until 2012, it was one a year). Only €2 coins may be used in this way (for them to be legal tender) and there is a limit on the number that can be issued. The coin must show the normal design criteria, such as the twelve stars, the year and the issuing country. Not all states have issued their own commemorative coins except for in 2007, 2009 and 2012 when every then-eurozone state issued a common coin (with only different languages and country names used) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]] (1957–2007), the 10th anniversary of the euro (1999–2009) and the 10th anniversary of euro coins (2002-2012). Eurozone-wide issues do not count as a state's two-a-year issue. Germany has begun issuing one coin a year for each of [[states of Germany|its states]] (the [[€2 commemorative coins#German Bundesländer series|German Bundesländer series]] which will take it up to 2021.

=== Types of Commemorative €2 coins ===
There are several types of Commemorative €2 Coins:
# Commemorative coins that the euro countries are issued jointly by all EU Countries
# Commemorative coins issued by a single country
# Commemorative coins issued by a number of countries

==== Commemorative coins that are issued jointly by all eurozone countries ====
So far, there have been three commemorative coins that the eurozone countries have issued jointly: the first, in March 2007, to commemorate the "50th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]]", the second, in January 2009, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the euro is celebrated with a coin called the "10th anniversary of [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]]" and the third one in 2012, to commemorate 10 years of the euro coins and notes.

There are €2 commemorative coins that have been issued on the same topic by different member states, two (by Belgium and Italy) to celebrate [[Louis Braille]]'s 200th birthday, four (by Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Finland) to celebrate 60th anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and two (by Germany and France) to commemorate 50 years of the Elysee Treaty (1963-2013).

==== Commemorative coins issued by a single country ====
As a rule, euro countries may each issue only two €2 commemorative coins per year. Exceptionally, they are allowed to issue another, provided that it is a joint issuance and commemorates events of European-wide importance.

=== Proposing a topic for a €2 Commemorative Coin ===

==== Role of the European Central Bank ====
Designing and issuing the coins is the competence of the individual euro countries. The ECB's role regarding the commemorative but also all other coins is to approve the maximum volumes of coins that the individual countries may issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/html/reproduction.en.html ECB: Reproduction rules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Unlike banknotes, euro coins are still a national competence and not the ECB's. If a euro area country intends to issue a €2 commemorative coin it has to inform the European Commission. There is no reporting by euro area countries to the ECB. The Commission publishes the information in the multilingual  Official Journal of the EU (C series).

The Official Journal is the authoritative source upon which the ECB bases its website updates on euro coins. The reporting process, the translation into 22 languages and publishing lead to unavoidable delays. The coin pages on the ECB’s website cannot therefore always be updated as timely as users might wish.

If the ECB learns of a euro coin that has not yet featured in the Official Journal, only its image will be posted on the ECB’s website, with a brief statement that confirmation by the European Commission is pending."

==== Role of the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs ====
[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/cash/commemorative/index_en.htm The website of the EU – DG for Economic and Financial Affairs is not specific on the topic of proposing themes for €2 commemorative coins].

[http://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/html/reproduction.en.html The website of the European Central Bank where the Euro coins are mentioned], is not specific on the topic of proposing themes for €2 commemorative coins.  It is not mentioned how the €2 commemorative coins that are in circulation today came about.

== Similar coins ==
The coins were minted in several of the participating countries, many using blanks produced at the [[Birmingham Mint]] in Birmingham, England. A problem has arisen in differentiation of coins made using similar blanks and minting techniques.
* The [[Turkish lira#Coins|Turkish 1 New Lira coin]] (which was in circulation from 2005 until 2008) closely resembled the €2 coin in both weight and size, and both coins seem to be recognized and accepted by coin-operated machines as being a €2 coin; however, 2 euros are worth roughly 4 times than 1 Turkish lira. There are now some vending machines which have been upgraded to refuse the 1 lira coin.
* The [[Ten-baht coin|10 Thai baht coin]], first minted in 1988, which is of similar shape and size to a €2 coin but worth around one-eighth of the value has recently been appearing in the coin boxes of vending machines throughout Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coinworld.com/news/021802/news-5.asp |title=Thai bahts causing euro problems – 10-baht coins work in place of 2-euro coins in machines |first=William T. |last=Gibbs |date=11 February 2002 |work=Coin World |publisher=Amos Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302014633/http://coinworld.com/news/021802/news-5.asp |archivedate=2 March 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and being given back as change in some smaller establishments.

* The Mexican [[Mexican peso|5 peso]] coin is also similar to the 2 Euro coin. It is worth around 28 Euro Cents (1/7 of the 2 Euro coin).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/gilmorales/4560013608/in/photostream/ Comparison between 5 Mexican peso and 2 Euro coins]&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''''Adoration of the Magi''''' or '''''Uffizi Triptych''''' is a group of three tempera-on-panel paintings by [[Andrea Mantegna]], dating to around 1460. Their three subjects are the ''[[Ascension of Christ]]'' (86 by 42.5&amp;nbsp;cm), ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' the largest and central panel (76 by 76.5&amp;nbsp;cm) and the ''[[Circumcision of Christ]]'' (86 by 42.5&amp;nbsp;cm). They were gathered as a trio in the 19th century, although some art historians doubt that they were created as a [[triptych]] set in the way they are now arranged. They are now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]].

==History==
Most scholars agree the three works were commissioned in the 1460s for [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]]'s private chapel in the [[Castello di San Giorgio|Castle of St. George]] in [[Mantua]] (together with the [[Death of the Virgin (Mantegna)|''Death of the Virgin'']], now in the [[Museo del Prado]], and ''[[Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin]]'', now in [[Ferrara]]). The paintings for the chapel are mentioned in two letters from Mantegna to Ludovico dated April 1464 and in [[Vasari]] as "a painting [by Mantegna], in which are scenes with small but very beautiful figures ... in the castle at Mantua, for the chapel".

Other scholars such as Fiocco argue that there is no evidence for how the three works got from Mantua to Florence and that they were instead produced in Tuscany during one of Mantegna's two trips there in 1466 and 1467. Stylistic reasons, however, link the work to Mantegna's final period in Padua, which ended in 1459, rather than to his maturity in Mantua.

The first secure reference to the three paintings dates to 1587, when it was found cut up in Valle Muggia near [[Pistoia]] among the belongings of [[Don Antonio de' Medici]]. They were inherited before in 1632 entering the collection of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], where the ''Adoration'' was misattributed to [[Botticelli]]. The three works were exhibited together from 1827, with a gilded new neo-Renaissance intaglio frame which compensated for the differing sizes of the central work and the side panels.

Most modern critics note the differences between the three works, including their form, format, setting and quality, especially between the ''Circumcision'' and the other two works. [[Roberto Longhi]] doubted that the three works were conceived as a single unified triptych and theorised that instead they all came from different locations in the same chapel, as did ''[[Death of the Virgin (Mantegna)|Death of the Virgin]]'' and ''[[Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin]]''. According to Longhi, ''Circumcision'' replaced ''Death of the Virgin'' when it was decided to limit the scheme solely to scenes from Christ's life.

==Adoration==
[[File:Andrea Mantegna 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Adoration]]
The panel was probably located in the chapel's apse. The Magi are depicted while descending to the Child's grotto from a path carved out in the rock. The Virgin is portrayed with a crown of angels, according to a [[byzantine art|Byzantine]] model.

Another version of the painting sold for the then record price of $10.5 million in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-19/entertainment/ca-15137_1_mantegna-paintings Los Angeles Times - Getty Pays $10.5 Million For Painting&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aegyo''''' ({{korean|hangul=애교|hanja=愛嬌}}) in [[Korean language|Korean]] refers to a cute display of affection often expressed including but not limited to through a cute/baby voice, facial expressions, and gestures.&lt;ref name="Jung2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sun Jung|title=Korean Masculinities and Transcultural Consumption: Yonsama, Rain, Oldboy, K-Pop Idols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npgE-K9rawUC&amp;pg=PA165|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8028-66-5|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aegyo'' literally means behaving in a flirtatious, [[Flirting|coquette-ish]] manner and it is commonly expected for both male and female [[Korean pop idol|k-pop idol]]s&lt;ref name="UtzLau2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christian Utz|author2=Frederick Lau|title=Vocal Music and Contemporary Identities: Unlimited Voices in East Asia and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GblVHStg54oC&amp;pg=PA279|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-50224-5|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; to behave this way. However, it is not uncommon for everyday people to behave in such a way, and is widely used as an expression of affection to loved ones, families, and friends. ''Aegyo'' can also display closeness with others, which can possibly bring people together. The word is often translated as [[cuteness]] in English{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and can be compared to the Japanese concept of [[kawaii]] or to the Japanese equivalent, {{nihongo|''aikyou''|愛嬌, あいきょう}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Background==
''Aegyo'' plays a huge role in [[South Korean popular culture]], especially in idol girl groups. The higher-registered girl voice popular in girl groups in Korea has been dominant since the first successful female k-pop group [[S.E.S. (band)|S.E.S.]] emerged in 1997. This style has grown in popularity since then. A famous example of that exaggerated cuteness that is ''aegyo'' is the [[Girls' Generation]] music video for "[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]", which features much use of hands pointing at, touching and framing the face when showing the girls in turn. The first of their many song &amp; dance videos, many of Gee's dance moves are based on aegyo. ''Aegyo'' as a personal trait of Girls' Generation member [[Sunny (singer)|Sunny]] was described as "cuteness that calls for a punch," not as an actual complaint, but as a recognition of the degree to which ''aegyo'' can be taken. 

Although more common among female idol groups, male groups often perform ''aegyo'' as part of their fanservice. The ''[[maknae]]'', or youngest member of a group, is often (but not exclusively) the one encouraged to perform ''aegyo''. Another member may get a better response from fans, or be better suited due to physical or emotional characteristics. For some performers, ''aegyo'' is merely an extension of their own normal behavior, encouraged by the groups' producers. 

As performers evolve from "atul" to "young adult" images, the ''aegyo'' in their performances often evolves, becoming an almost-nostalgic homage to the performers' earlier stage image. They will "put on the character" briefly for fun and to satisfy fan expectation, in the same way they will sing their earliest hits. Some traces of ''aegyo'' will continue as persistent traits.

A pro-forma version of ''aegyo'' may become tradition for certain circumstances, such as when idols perform the "[[Gwiyomi]]" song, with actions made popular by the South Korean rapper Jung Ilhoon of [[BtoB (band)|BtoB]].

Puzar argues that ''aegyo'' in popular culture affects how young South Korean women act, especially in romantic relationships. Using cute hand gestures and expressions in photos, for example, are commonly seen behaviors in many young women in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Puzar, Aljosa. “Asian Dolls and the Western Gaze: Notes on the Female Dollification in South Korea,” ''Asian Women'' 27.2 (2011): 81-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''backup band''' or '''backing band''' is a [[Band (music)|musical ensemble]] that [[Accompaniment|accompanies]] a [[lead singer]] at a live performance or on a [[sound recording|recording]].&lt;ref name="CampbellBrody2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Campbell|author2=James Brody|title=Rock and roll: an introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=14 December 2010|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-534-64295-2|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}} A backup band can also accompany an instrumental soloist, such as a [[lead guitarist]] or solo [[fiddler]], though [[instrumental music|all-instrumental]] performances, with no singing, are not common in [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]]. This can either be an established, long-standing group that has little or no change in membership, or it may be an [[ad hoc]] group assembled for a single show or a single recording.{{or|date=September 2017}} Ad hoc or "pickup" groups are often made up of [[session musician]]s.

The '''Basel Paper Mill''' ([[German Language|German:]] ''Basler Papiermühle''), also known as the '''Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing''' ([[German Language|German:]] ''Schweizerisches Museum für Papier, Schrift und Druck'') in [[Basel]], is primarily dedicated to [[papermaking]], the art of book [[printing]] and [[writing]] in general. Through a combination of pictures and objects, visitors gain insights into the old artisanal techniques of dipping paper, printing and [[bookbinding]].

The museum is located in a carefully restored building that began its life as a [[paper mill]] 500 years ago. It is a [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance]] (1995), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caffe Cino''' was an [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theater founded in 1958 by [[Joe Cino]]. The [[West Village, Manhattan|West Village]] coffeehouse, located at 31 Cornelia Street, was initially imagined as a venue for [[poetry]], [[folk music]], and [[Art exhibition|visual art exhibitions]]. The plays produced at the Cino, however, became most prominent, and it is now considered the "birthplace of Off-Off-Broadway".&lt;ref name="birthplace"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/theater/donation-to-library-opens-new-portal-to-caffe-cino.html|title=Portal to Off Off Broadway's Early Days|author=Steven McElroy|first=|date=December 7, 2001|work=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Many paragraphs from the [[Joe Cino]] page should be brought over or reworked into articles on this page. --&gt;

==Beginnings and early productions==
[[Joe Cino]] was born into an [[Italian-American]] family, and moved from [[Buffalo, New York]] to be a [[Dance|dancer]] in [[New York City]]. After ten years, he used his $400 in savings and opened the "Caffe Cino Art Gallery".&lt;ref name="gallery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/caffe-cino-joe-cino-gay-off-off-broadway-theater|title=The Gay Coffeehouse Where Off-Off Broadway Theater Was Born|author=Natasha Frost|first=|date=February 9, 2018|work=Atlas Obscura|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Cino encouraged his friends to hang their artwork on the walls. That led to poetry readings, which led to [[Stage reading|staged readings]] and eventually to productions of plays.&lt;ref name="beginning"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thevillager.com/2015/12/02/magic-time-at-the-caffe-cino/|title='Magic Time' at the Caffe Cino|author=Dusica Sue Malesevic|first=|date=December 2, 2015|work=The Villager (Manhattan)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early days of the Cino, plays were produced on the floor. A makeshift 8x8-foot stage was later created using milk cartons and carpet remnants. Productions were initially limited to 30 minutes, and the audience could stand anywhere. The space was only 18x30-feet, and audience members often perched atop the [[cigarette machine]].&lt;ref name="gallery" /&gt; Admission was one dollar, and audience members were offered a coffee and an Italian pastry along with the show.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt;

== The fire (1965) and Joe Cino's death (1967) ==
On [[Ash Wednesday]] of 1965, a fire destroyed the interior of the Cino. The building's structure was not affected. A new lighting system had recently been installed, along with the fireproofing of the Caffe's ceiling, which prevented the fire from spreading to the rest of the [[tenement building]].&lt;ref name="fire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/09/10/caffe-cino-goes-up-in-smoke/|title=Caffe Cino Goes Up in Smoke|author=Tony Ortega|first=|date=September 10, 2009|work=The Village Voice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official cause of the fire was a [[gas leak]], but some suspected that Cino's lover [[Arson|set the fire]]. The community raised money by staging [[benefit performance]]s while the Caffe was closed for renovations.&lt;ref name="birthplace" /&gt; [[Ellen Stewart]], founder of [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]], offered Cino and his staff a space to continue Caffe Cino productions on Sunday and Monday nights at her theater.&lt;ref name="fire" /&gt;

Joe Cino died three days after an [[attempted suicide]] in 1967. Some{{who|date=November 2018}} suspected that the attempt was due to the death of Cino's lover, John Torrey, and to his drug use.&lt;ref name="gallery" /&gt;{{Not in citation given|date=November 2018}}

==Notable contributors==
The Caffe Cino was an incubator for first-time directors, playwrights, actors, and lighting or set designers. Many continued to work in stage, screen, or both after the Cino closed. Notable contributors include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">'''Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming''' ({{lang-de|Der Dichter und das Phantasieren}}), was an informal talk given in 1907 by [[Sigmund Freud]], and subsequently published in 1908, on the relationship between unconscious [[fantasy (psychology)|phantasy]] and creative art.

Freud's argument – that artists, reviving memories of childhood [[daydream]]s and play activities, succeeded in making them acceptable through their aesthetic technique&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; – was to be widely influential for interwar [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Berman, ''Translating Modernism'' (2010) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic sources==
Freud began his talk by raising the question of where writers drew their material from, suggesting that children at play, and adults day-dreaming, both provided cognate activities to those of the literary artist.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 307-8&lt;/ref&gt; Heroic and erotic daydreams or [[preconscious]] phantasies in both men and women were seen by Freud as providing substitute satisfactions for everyday deprivations;&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and the same phantasies were in turn turned into shareable (public) artistic constructs by the creative writer, where they could serve as cultural surrogates for the universal instinctual renunciations inherent in civilization.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic technique==
Freud saw the aesthetic principle as the ability to turn the private phantasy into a public artefact, using artistic pleasure to release a deeper pleasure founded on the release of forbidden (unconscious) material.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p.&amp;nbsp;308&lt;/ref&gt; The process allowed the writer him/herself to emerge from their introversion and return to the public world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; If the phantasies came too close to the unconscious repressed, however, the process would fail, leading either to creative inhibition or to a rejection of the artwork itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself epitomised his essay's argument a decade later in his ''Introductory Lectures'',&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 423-3&lt;/ref&gt; stating of the true artist that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"he understands how to work over his daydreams in such a way as to make them lose what is too personal in them and repels strangers, and to make it possible for others to share in the enjoyment of them. He understands, too, how to tone them down so that they do not easily betray their origin from proscribed sources....he has thus achieved ''through'' his phantasy what originally he had achieved only ''in'' his phantasy – honour, power and the love of women".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Cythna Letty01.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Cythna Letty]]

'''Cythna Lindenberg Letty''' (1 January 1895, [[Standerton]] &amp;ndash; 3 May 1985, [[Pretoria]]), was a [[South Africa]]n [[botanical artist]] and is regarded as a doyenne of South African botanical art by virtue of the quality and quantity of her meticulously executed paintings and pencil sketches, produced over a period of 40 years with the National Herbarium in Pretoria.

Cythna Letty is best remembered for her book "''Wild Flowers of the Transvaal''" which was published in 1962. When decimal currency was introduced in South Africa, she was asked to design the floral motifs for the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins. Besides painting she was an accomplished poet and published "''Children of the Hours''" when she was in her eighties.

Cythna was the eldest child of her mother Josina Christina Lindenberg's second marriage and was named after the heroine in [[Percy Shelley]]'s poem '[[The Revolt of Islam]]". The Lettys had five children and for many years the six children from Josina's first marriage were part of an extended, disciplined family. They were taught to play a number of musical instruments.

Cythna's father, Walter Edward Letty, had many career changes and the family were often uprooted. As a result Cythna attended a total of 13 schools, ending at the [[Pretoria Girls' High School]]. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Walter enlisted and served in France, and remained there after peace was declared. Josina supported the family by illustrating genealogical charts. Her artistic skills were passed on to a number of her children, but only Cythna had a passion for botanical subjects.

Cythna's main occupations until 1924 were teaching and nursing. For two years she worked as an artist, at the Veterinary Division at [[Onderstepoort]] near [[Pretoria]], illustrating diseased and cancerous organs, after which she transferred to the Division of Plant Industry under [[Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans|Dr I.B. Pole Evans]]. It was here that she started on 730 contributions to "''[[Flowering Plants of Africa]]''", an example of which is [http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantab/plimagesab/anemonefanletty.jpg Anemone fanninii Harv. ex Mast.]

She resigned in 1938 to marry Oscar William Alric Forssman. After producing a son, she rejoined the Division of Botany in 1945 and stayed until 1966. She was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Horticultural Society for her exhibition of flower paintings in 1970.

Her interest in ''Zantedeschia'' led her to a study of the genus and her revision appeared in ''Bothalia'' 11: 5-26 (1973). She illustrated numerous books on botany such as the Botanical Survey Memoir ''Trees and shrubs in the Kruger National Park'' (1951) by [[L. E. W. Codd]], who was at that time director of the Botanical Research Institute. Others were ''The Stapelieae'' (1937) by White &amp; Sloane, and ''Grasses and Pastures of South Africa'' (1955) by Lucy K.A. Chippindall. In 1973 she received an honorary LL.D. from the [[University of Witwatersrand]].

Her ashes were scattered in the Cythna Letty Nature Reserve near the small town of [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]] in [[Mpumalanga]]. In 1989 the National Botanical Institute published a portfolio of seven prints of flower paintings selected from two journals kept by Cythna's mother, Josina Letty, and housed in the Institute's Mary Gunn Library in Pretoria.

The Botanical Society of South Africa commemorated her by the awarding of the "Cythna Letty Medal" which is awarded for significant contributions to the promotion of South African flora through the medium of published botanical paintings or drawings.

Plants named for her include ''Crassula lettyae'' Phillips and ''Aloe lettyae'' [[Gilbert Reynolds|Reynolds]]. She is denoted by the [[List of botanists by author abbreviation|author abbreviation]] '''&lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span class="fn n"&gt;&lt;span class="nickname"&gt;Letty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;''' when [[Author citation (botany)|citing]] a [[botanical name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R.

'''Dallas ArtsPartners''' (AP) is a program run by the [[501(c)3]] [[nonprofit organization]] [[Big Thought]] and is a community collaboration between the [[Dallas Independent School District]] (DISD), the City of [[Dallas]] Office of Cultural Affairs, and more than 60 professional arts and cultural organizations.

Big Thought’s responsibilities to the program include program design and implementation, private sector fund raising, governance, and fiscal management. Dallas ArtsPartners, recognized as an exemplary program by the [[Texas School Performance Review]], was established in 1998. The initiative was born soon after the Dallas Cultural Affairs Commission Long Range Planning Committee commissioned a study to determine the availability and accessibility of educational outreach programming offered by the city’s arts and cultural institutions. 
The data collected indicated that while some public schools received multiple performances, residencies, and field trips, many received none. In response to these findings, and recognizing the potential educational benefits of these programs, the City of Dallas teamed with the Dallas Independent School District to create Dallas ArtsPartners.

The Dallas ArtsPartners was designed to:
# Provide all DISD elementary students with equal access to high quality arts programs offered by the city’s professional arts and cultural institutions.
# Train every DISD elementary classroom teacher to integrate those programs into the curriculum to benefit student academic achievement and learning in the arts and ensure that ArtsPartners is an institutional, sustainable part of Dallas’ school district and cultural community and a suitable model for replication across the nation.

Dallas ArtsPartners coordinates both school day programs that integrate programming across the [[curriculum]], and after school (21st Century Community Learning Centers) and summer (Summer in the City) programs that provide curriculum support. All AP programs directly support the state curriculum standards, [[Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills]] (TEKS) and offer links to every core curriculum subject. Fine Arts TEKS were informed by the [[National Standards for the Arts]].

The estimated 15,000 programs provided by AP’s cultural partners incorporates dozens of arts and cultural disciplines each year and include:
# in-school performances
# field trip performances
# artist residencies
# master classes
# workshops
# guided tours

AP promotes educators’ success in integrating arts and cultural resources into curricula by providing a tiered Professional Development System that employs multiple trainings and educational materials. Every DISD elementary teacher receives AP’s services. 
AP’s three-year plus longitudinal study examines the effects of AP on students, teachers, and cultural organizations. The study is longitudinal, rigorous, intensive, collaborative and literacy-focused.

Dallas ArtsPartners serves every public elementary school in the city of Dallas; a total of 156 schools, 101,000 children and 6,000 elementary educators.

'''Day Without Art''' ('''DWA''') is an annual event where art museums and other organizations organize programs to raise awareness of [[AIDS]], remember people who have died, and inspire positive action.

== History ==

Day Without Art began on December 1, 1989 as the national day of action and mourning in response to the AIDS crisis, which had rapidly and conspicuously decimated the artistic community. To make the public aware that [[AIDS]] can touch everyone, and inspire positive action, some 800 U.S. art and AIDS groups participated in the first Day Without Art, shutting down museums, sending staff to volunteer at AIDS services, or sponsoring special exhibitions of work about AIDS. Since then, Day With(out) Art has grown into a collaborative project in which an estimated 8,000 national and international museums, galleries, art centers, [[AIDS service organization]]s, libraries, high schools and colleges take part.

In the past, "Visual AIDS" initiated public actions and programs, published an annual poster and [[public domain|copyright-free]] [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]], and acted as press coordinator and [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] for projects for Day Without Art/[[World AIDS Day]]. In 1997, it was suggested Day Without Art become a '''Day ''With'' Art''', to recognize and promote increased programming of cultural events that draw attention to the continuing [[pandemic]]. Though "the name was retained as a [[metaphor]] for the chilling possibility of a future day without art or artists", we added parentheses to the program title, '''Day With(out) Art''', to highlight the proactive programming of art projects by artists living with HIV/AIDS, and art about AIDS, that were taking place around the world. It had become clear that active interventions within the annual program were far more effective than actions to negate or reduce the programs of cultural centers. In 2014, the Los Angeles art collective, My Barbarian, staged a video performance in remembrance of [[Pedro Zamora]], inspired by the queer theorist, [[José Esteban Muñoz]]'s theory of counterpublicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.visualaids.org/blog/detail/tavia-nyongo#_edn3|title = The video is a remembrance within a remembrance: to Pedro Zamora and to José Esteban Muñoz.|last = AIDS|first = Visual|website = Visual AIDS|access-date = 2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==

The inaugural Day without Art exhibition held in [[New Zealand]] opened on 1 December 1995, at the [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]].  Curated by Wayne P. Marriott, the installation was undertaken by Daniel McKnight, Vicky Byrne and Marriott.  In 1996 the Southland Museum and Art Gallery was awarded a New Zealand AIDS Foundation media award for its work in promoting a better understanding of the impact of HIV/AIDS on the wider community.  The museum continued to annually host a Day without Art exhibition until 1999.

'''Dying Fetus''' is an American [[death metal]] band originally from [[Greater Upper Marlboro, Maryland]]. Formed in 1991, the group is known for their consistently [[Hook (music)|hook]]-laden song structures, characterized by [[blast beats]], complex [[riff]]ing, slam riffs and heavy [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]s. Additionally, their reality-based lyrics characterized by political/modern themes are notable in death metal. Various line-up changes throughout the years have left John Gallagher as the sole remaining original member, as well as the band's driving force. According to Gallagher, the band name was chosen while the members were of [[adolescence|adolescent]] ages and was intended to be offensive. To date, Dying Fetus has released eight studio albums.

==History==

===Beginnings (1991–1996)===
Dying Fetus was founded in 1991 in [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland]], by John Gallagher (guitar, vocals) and Jason Netherton (bass, vocals). The band began in earnest when the pair met up with guitarist/vocalist Nick Speleos in 1992. It was decided then that Gallagher would fill in on drums until a proper drummer was found. The writing of this period resulted in the 1993 demo ''Bathe In Entrails'' In late 1993, the band found drummer Rob Belton, as well as guitarist Brian Latta, who replaced the departing Nick Speleos (which also thrust John Gallagher back into the role of guitarist and vocalist). Together the new four-piece lineup recorded the ''[[Infatuation with Malevolence]]'' demo in early 1994, later released together with the first demo in 1995 as a compilation on California Indie label [[Wild Rags]] Records. Songs included all tracks from both demos as one CD.

In 1996, the band released their first album, ''[[Purification through Violence]]'', on short-lived Illinois label Pulverizer Records. The album marked a further refinement of the band's developing sound of [[death metal]] [[riffing]], combined with heavy slams, over seven original songs, and one [[Napalm Death]] cover, "Scum". Drummer Rob Belton left and the band was joined briefly in 1995 for a year by drummer Casey Buckler, with whom they performed live, yet never recorded with. Casey was asked to leave the band as they agreed he would play drums for a tour they had that year.

===Rise to underground prominence (1996–2000)===
With no promotion and no label, Dying Fetus toured off and on, sporadically, for 4 years straight starting in summer 1996 with their first full US tour alongside [[Kataklysm]] and [[Monstrosity (band)|Monstrosity]], with the first appearance of future drummer Erik Sayenga as drummer replacing Casey Buckler. However, by 1997, Erik Sayenga had left the band, and after a short Texas tour in May 1997, drummer Kevin Talley joined full-time in the summer of 1997. At this point, the band caught the attention of German indie label Morbid Records, who signed them early in 1998 for a one-album deal. Almost immediately afterwards, the band released their second album, ''[[Killing on Adrenaline]]''.

Morbid Records supplied the band with scant promotion in the death metal underground, and the band subsequently rose to slightly higher prominence, yet the band's live performances still gained them the most attention. However, guitarist Brian Latta left the band in late 1998, ushering in new guitarist “Sparky” Voyles, and in 1999 the band embarked on their first headlining tour of the US, over three weeks dubbed the "Underground Terrorism" tour. The tour was followed shortly thereafter by the ''[[Grotesque Impalement]]'' EP, which the band released on their own Blunt Force Records label imprint.

===Relapse Records, new lineups (2000–2003)===
By 2000, Dying Fetus caught the attention of another underground metal label, the indie company [[Relapse Records]], who subsequently signed the band.

Once more returning to Steve Carr's Hit and Run Studios in Maryland (where each previous Dying Fetus album was recorded), Dying Fetus recorded in the spring of 2000 their Relapse debut (and overall third full-length album), ''[[Destroy the Opposition]]''. This album featured even stronger political themes, and songwriting that was to highly influence the "[[deathcore]]" scene in subsequent years. The album was included in ''[[Decibel Magazine|Decibel]]'''s Top 100 Albums of the decade list for the 2000s (Decibel Magazine Special Edition, December 2009), as well as to Decibel's "Hall of Fame" (#89, July 2012).

However, following the release of ''Destroy the Opposition'', original member Jason Netherton left the band for personal reasons, and thereafter guitarist Voyles and drummer Talley left the band only months after the album's release (they since went on to form the band [[Misery Index (band)|Misery Index]]). Gallagher recruited guitarist Mike Kimball, singer Vince Matthews, bassist/backup vocalist Sean Beasley, and the returning Eric Sayenga on drums.

With the new lineup, the band released their 4th album, ''[[Stop at Nothing]]'', in 2003, another album featuring Carr’s production and strong political themes. A promotional video was shot for the track “One Shot, One Kill”.

===Five members, return to form (2003–present)===
[[Image:Dying Fetus.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Bassist [[Sean Beasley]] joined the band in 2001 and has been one half of Dying Fetus' dual vocalist setup since joining.]]
Dying Fetus toured extensively for ''Stop at Nothing'', and got airplay for the music video for "One Shot, One Kill" on Headbanger's Ball. Another tool that led to exposure of the band was more mainstream metal attention of Relapse Records (with acts such as [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] gaining popularity), as well as a full North American tour with [[GWAR]] in 2005. However, the ''Stop at Nothing'' lineup dissolved slightly in the years that followed as drummer Erik Sayenga parted yet again, and singer Vince Matthews went on to form [[Criminal Element]]. However, Dying Fetus came back yet again, bassist Beasley took over on vocals, and drummer Duane Timlin (ex-Divine Empire/[[Broken Hope]]) joined the ranks in 2006.

That lineup then recorded ''[[War of Attrition (album)|War of Attrition]]'', which was released in March 2007. Themes include attacking reality TV, the war on terrorism, racial ignorance, and the flaws in the criminal justice system. Songs include “Homicidal Retribution,” “Raping the System”, and “Parasites of Catastrophe.” Dying Fetus’ second music video was made for “Homicidal Retribution.”

Yet another lineup change occurred on the Dying Fetus front in July 2007: drummer Duane Timlin was fired due to incompatibilities. The newest drummer for the band is Trey Williams, from the local Baltimore band Severed Head. Mike Kimball also left the band and they've remained a trio since.

On September 15, 2009, Dying Fetus released their seventh album, ''[[Descend into Depravity]]'' on [[Relapse Records]]. Three years later, their follow-up to this record ''[[Reign Supreme]]'', would be released on June 19, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=167288 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108000537/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=167288 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-01-08 |title=DYING FETUS: New Album Title Revealed |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band released the first single from the album, "Subjected to a Beating", on April 2, 2012.

Dying Fetus headlined a US tour being supported by [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]], Abiotic and [[Waking the Cadaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/20594/Dying-Fetus-Exhumed-Devourment-Abiotic-tour|title=Dying Fetus, Exhumed, Devourment, Abiotic tour|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Devourment]] was intended to be on the bill to play the tour, but dropped off a month beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/09/26/devourment-drop-off-dying-fetus-and-exhumed-fall-tour/|title=Devourment Drop Off Dying Fetus and Exhumed Fall Tour - MetalSucks|date=26 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers of Nihil appeared in select spots of the tour.

On November 4, 2013, after [[Avenged Sevenfold]] were announced as a headliner for [[Download Festival]] 2014, a fan of the band claimed that other bands were more deserving of a headline spot at the festival, and said "Everyone is going on about that this is good to give new blood a chance, then why not [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], Dying Fetus or [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]]? Give them a chance". Due to the smaller size of the band's fanbase, this sparked a mock internet campaign with the hashtag "#WhyNotDyingFetus?" trending worldwide. On November 6, 2013, [[Andy Copping]] announced on his Twitter feed that due to the internet campaign, Dying Fetus had been confirmed to be playing at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Maverick_AC|author=Andy Copping|number=398070530688823296|date=6 November 2013|title=The very brilliant &amp;amp; fantastic DYING FETUS @DyingFetusBand have now been confirned for @DownloadFest #DL2014 #whynotdyingfetus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band were the first to play the main stage on the Saturday.

By June 2016, Dying Fetus had been working on their eighth studio album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/dying-fetus-is-pretty-much-done-recording-a-new-album|title=DYING FETUS Is Pretty Much Done Recording A New Album|publisher=metalinjection.net|date=June 6, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expected to be released in the summer of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2017/02/22/news/dying-fetus-finish-tracking-new-album-reveal-vinyl-reissue-plans/|title=Dying Fetus Finish Tracking New Album, Reveal Vinyl Reissue Plans|publisher=theprp.com|date=February 22, 2017|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-April 2017, both the band and [[Relapse Records]] had announced via social media the release of their eighth studio album, entitled ''Wrong One to Fuck With'', which was released on June 23, 2017.

'''Elizabeth Polack''' was an [[England|English]] playwright of the 1830s, notable for having been described by chroniclers of the period as England's first [[Jew]]ish woman [[melodrama]]tist.

Few historical records survive which detail Elizabeth Polack's life.  Although neither the year nor place of her birth have been noted, documentation of her activity as a playwright active in [[London]] between 1830 and 1838 remains for posterity.  Contemporary records credit her with five plays, only two of which, ''Esther, the Royal Jewess; or The Death of [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]'' and ''St. Clair of the Isles; or The Outlaw of [[Barra]]'', have survived. ''Esther'', with a story taken from the [[Old Testament]], and considered in its time to be a type of an "Exotic East" melodrama, was successfully produced in 1835 at London's [[Mile End]] [[Pavilion Theatre (Mile End)|Pavilion Theatre]] in the [[East End of London|East End]] (the Pavilion was later a centre for [[Yiddish theatre]] in London). 1838's ''St. Clair'', based on an 1803 novel by Elizabeth Helme, met, however, with a very modest reception.

Polack may have been a relation of [[Joel Samuel Polack]], the first Jewish settler of New Zealand. Joel's biographer writes that he lived with his sister in Piccadilly when he first returned to England; that sister may have been Elizabeth.&lt;ref name="gore"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sisters of Gore: seven Gothic melodramas by British women, 1790-1843 |first=John Charles |last=Franceschina |pages=227–284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8waoQn5L0wAC&amp;pg=PA227 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997|isbn=9780815317814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confuse|Ethnos (disambiguation){{!}}Ethnos}}

'''Ethos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek stories of [[Orpheus]] exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in [[rhetoric]] is closely based on the Greek terminology used by [[Aristotle]] in his concept of the three artistic proofs or [[modes of persuasion]].

==Etymology and origin==
''Ethos'' ({{lang|grc|ἦθος}}, {{lang|grc|ἔθος}}; ''plurals:'' ''ethe'', {{lang|grc|ἤθη}}; ''ethea'', {{lang|grc|ἤθεα}}) is a Greek word originally meaning "accustomed place" (as in {{lang|grc|ἤθεα ἵππων}} "the habitats of horses", ''[[Iliad]]'' 6.511, 15.268),&lt;ref&gt;Proscurcin Jr., ''Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer.'' (2014) pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; "custom, habit", equivalent to Latin ''[[mores]]''.

''Ethos'' forms the root of ''ethikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἠθικός}}), meaning "moral, showing moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2 (1103a17)&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective in the neuter plural form ''ta ethika'' ({{lang|grc|τὰ ἠθικά}}), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word ''[[ethics]]''.

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote in 1940 that "the general ethos of the people they have to govern  determines the behaviour of politicians".&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, ''The idea of a Christian society'' (1940) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the historian [[Orlando Figes]] wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s "the ethos of the  [[Communist]] party dominated every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''A people's tragedy: the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 1891–1924'' (1996) p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This statement requires further elaboration to be intelligible: When used in the rhetorical tradition, in addition to what motivates the individual, ethos establishes credibility for the individual among the audience, which is essential in a successful attempt at persuasion.--&gt;
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s brought about "the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development".&lt;ref&gt;Afrie Krampf, "Reception of the Developmental Approach in the Jewish Economic Discourse of Mandatory Palestine, 1934–1938," ''Israel Studies,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 15#2, pp. 80–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
In [[rhetoric]], ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (''pistis'', πίστις) or [[modes of persuasion]] (other principles being ''[[logos#Aristotle.27s rhetorical logos|logos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]'') discussed by [[Aristotle]] in '[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start.  This can involve "moral competence" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include [[expertise]] and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ethos Dwells Pervasively'' In: ''The Ethos of Rhetoric.'' (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woerther, ''L'èthos aristotélicien.'' (2007) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf [[Isocrates]]).

According to [[Aristotle]], there are three categories of ethos:

* ''[[phronesis]]''&amp;nbsp;– useful skills &amp; wisdom
* ''[[Arete (excellence)|arete]]''&amp;nbsp;– virtue, goodwill
* ''[[eunoia]]''&amp;nbsp;– goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy ([[Appeal to motive]]). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

For Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to "inspire trust in his audience" (''Rhetorica'' 1380). ''Ethos'' was therefore achieved through the orator's "good sense, good moral character, and goodwill", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this "good moral character" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (''Rhetorica'' 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and ''ethos'' most succinctly in Book II of ''Nichomachean Ethics'': "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name ''ethike'' is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ''ethos'' (habit)" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: "Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety" (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man Cannot Speak for Her: Volume I; A Critical Study of Early Feminist Rhetoric|last = Campbell|first = Karlyn Kohrs|publisher = Praeger|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant "social totality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and Counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by theorizing "subaltern counterpublics", which function as alternative publics that represent "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (67).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of the Actually Existing Democracy|last = Fraser|first = Nancy|date = 1990|journal = Social Text|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, "Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak" (83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Essences: Ethos and the Postmodern Subject of Feminism|last = Schmertz|first = Johanna|date = 1999|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that "ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self", (39)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Reexamination of Personal and Public Discourse in Classical Rhetoric|last = Ronald|first = Kate|date = 1990|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links [[credibility]] and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that "these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently" (56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethos: New Essays in Rhetorical and Critical Theory|last = Susan|first = Jarratt|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Dallas|pages = 37–69|last2 = Reynolds|first2 = Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos "emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of ''ethos'', Halloran illuminates the interdependence between ''ethos'' and cultural context by arguing that "To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks" (60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Aristotle's Concept of Ethos, or if not His, Someone Else's|last = Halloran|first = Michael|date = 1982|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in ''Invention as Social Act'' situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos "appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader" (45-46).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invention as a Social Act|last = LeFevre|first = K. B.|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nedra Reynolds, "ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim "that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's "ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices" (48).

In "Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, "Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture" (43).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos: Harriet Jacobs, Billie Holiday, and Sister Souljah|last = Pittman|first = Corretta|date = 2007|journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, ''Aristotle's Poetics.'' (1998) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple.&lt;ref name=M534&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Ancient Theater and Performance Culture'' In: ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theater.'' (2007) pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.&lt;ref name=M546&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.&lt;ref name=M59&gt;Murray (1916), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, ''Aristoteles über das Wesen und die Wirkung der Tragödie (Kap. 6)'' In: ''Aristoteles. Poetik.'' (2009) pp. 87 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character.&lt;ref name=G247&gt;Garton (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint.&lt;ref name=G2478&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse.&lt;ref name=G248&gt;Garton (1957), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.&lt;ref name=G2489&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garet makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=G250&gt;Garton (1957), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.&lt;ref name=G2501&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Murray (1916), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that "[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot".&lt;ref name=M53&gt;Murray (1916), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character, or ethos, in pictorial narrative==
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can.&lt;ref name=C11&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action.&lt;ref name=C10&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that "his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, "[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the [[polis]]".&lt;ref name=C10 /&gt; Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, "ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality".&lt;ref name=C12&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fairytale Forest''' (''Sprookjesbos'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} wooded section of the [[amusement park]] [[Efteling]] in the [[Netherlands]], where a number of well-known [[fairy tale]]s and fairy tale figures are depicted by animated statues and buildings.  Most of the figures are inspired by the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and [[Charles Perrault]].
[[Image:Sprookjesbosbord.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''Fairytale Forest'']]

==History==
[[Image:Zonnestralen.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Truly enchanted forest]]

===Concept and building===
The Fairytale Forest was founded on the work of R.J.Th. van der Heijden, Peter Reijnders and Anton Pieck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holland's rival to Disneyland|url=http://www.windmillfields.com/2012/03/hollands-rival-to-disneyland.html|work=Tales from the Windmill Fields|publisher=Windmill Tales|accessdate=3 June 2012|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Heijden conceived of the idea in the 1950s to boost [[tourism]]. He asked his brother-in-law [[Peter Reijnders]], a filmmaker and amateur inventor from [[Eindhoven]], to recreate a fairy tale [[theme park]] Reijnders built. Reijnders chose artist [[Anton Pieck]], whose visual style had been inspired by [[Arthur Rackham]] and [[Edmund Dulac]], to add the artistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprookjesbos|url=http://www.efteling.com/NL/attracties/Sprookjesbos.html|work=Efteling|publisher=Efteling|accessdate=3 June 2012|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first scenes===
It took roughly two years to develop and build the first ten fairy tales:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efteling reviews|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/reviews/efteling/|work=Theme Park Insider|publisher=Robert Niles|accessdate=3 June 2012|author=Leroy Koevoets|date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Chinese Nightingale]], The Naughty Princess, [[Sleeping Beauty]], The [[Gnome]] Village, "Number One" (referring to the toilets), [[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]], The Magic Clock, [[Mother Hulda|Mother Holle]], [[Snow White]] and The Six Servants.

===Fairytale Forest===
The Fairytale Forest has 25 scenes.  Some include specific events such as Little Red Riding Hood at the door of her grandmother's house; while others are more general, such as The Gnome Village. There are three types of fairy tale scenes: indoor scenes with a commentary telling the tale (such as The Indian Water Lilies); structures too small to enter, but which can be viewed by visitors through the windows (Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother's house); and open-air attractions, such as the fountain for The Frog King or The Naughty Princess. In some cases, the tale is presented via electronic voice-over; in other cases the tale can be read from a book provided nearby (usually in Dutch, English, German and French).

===Origins of the scenes===
There are ten scenes based on [[Brothers Grimm]] fairytales:  [[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids|The Wolf and the Seven Kids]], [[Snow White]], [[Hansel and Gretel]], [[Rumpelstilskin]], [[Mother Hulda|Mother Holle]], [[The Six Servants]] ([[Long-neck]]), [[Rapunzel]], [[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog King]], [[The Wishing-Table]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]]. Three scenes are fairy tales from ''Mother Goose’s Fairy Tales'' by [[Charles Perrault]]: [[Tom Thumb]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and [[Cinderella]]. Five scenes are from [[Hans Christian Andersen]] tales: [[The Emperor's New Clothes]], [[The Red Shoes (fairy tale)|The Red Shoes]], [[The Little Mermaid]], [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Chinese Nightingale]] and [[The Little Match Girl]]. The tale of The Indian Water Lilies was written by [[Fabiola de Mora y Aragón]]. The remaining scenes either do not have a matching tale (such as The Gnome Village and Holle Bolle Gijs) or a tale was created afterwards (such as The Gardener and the Fakir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaat 6 - Indische Waterlelies, Chinese Nachtegaal, Fakir, Magische Klok|url=http://www.wonderlijkewcweb.org/index.htm?/sprookjeslps/indexmusic.htm?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.wonderlijkewcweb.org/sprookjeslps/plaat6.htm|work=Sprookjes van de Efteling|publisher=Teksten|accessdate=3 June 2012|language=Dutch|quote=The story (in Dutch) of the Gardener and the Fakir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Magic Clock).

==The Paper Gobblers==
{{double image|right|Efteling - Holle Bolle Gijs.jpg|140|opagijs.jpg|80}}
The park's cleanliness is maintained with the help of an ingenious waste disposal system designed by [[Anton Pieck]] and [[Ton van de Ven]], and originally conceived by Henk Knuivers.  There are 11 talking waste disposals.  Children take trash from the ground, and stuff it in the disposals to hear the gobbler talk.  The most popular gobbler, Hollow Bulging Gijs, makes a gobbling sound when ‘eating’ garbage and thanks the donor politely, whereas Captain Gijs fires a cannon to illustrate his enthusiasm for the guests' tidiness. However, Captain Gijs and the cannon have been removed as to make place for the fairytale Pinocchio.

==Fairy tale scenes==

===Sleeping Beauty===
{{double image|right|Kasteeltje.jpg|180|doornroosje.jpg|180|Castle of...|...Sleeping beauty}}
Designed by [[Anton Pieck]] &amp; [[Ton van de Ven]] as ''Doornroosje''.

[[Sleeping Beauty]]'s castle was built in 1952.  The rooms were decorated and [[Sleeping Beauty]], a sleeping guard, and two sleeping cooks were introduced the following year.  Instead of climbing roses, faster growing [[evergreen]] [[ivy]] was used to partially cover the castle.  The castle was completely renovated in 1981.  The poles and chicken wire with plaster were replaced by bricks.  An extra [[animatronic]] scene of the wicked witch spinning yarn was added.  Also in 1981, the sleeping guard was renewed, and again in 1997.  Visitors cannot enter the rooms of the castle, but instead look through the windows to see the various scenes. Both the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Charles Perrault]] have written versions of the tale. The story is about a young maiden; who has been cursed by an evil fairy at birth and fell into an enchanted eternal sleep, and awaken by the kiss of a prince.
 
Since 1999, a book with the tale of [[Sleeping Beauty]] can be read near the entrance in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].

===Herald Square===
{{double image|right|Herautenplein Efteling.jpg|200|Efteling Herautenplein.jpg|140|Herald square}}
Designed by Pieck &amp; [[Henny Knoet]] as ''Herautenplein''.

Herald Square is the beautiful central square of the Fairy Tale Forest, built in 1952.  The nostalgic gate, the magic clock and the fountain create a [[picturesque]] environment.  The original name was ‘Castle Square’, but the stone princes blowing their horns were confused with [[heralds]], so the name was changed to ‘Herald Square’.

===The Frog King===
Based on [[The Frog Prince]], the scene was designed by Pieck as ''de Kikkerkoning''.

===Snow White===
[[Image:Sneeuwwitje_2018.jpg|left|200px|thumb|''Sneeuwwitje'']]
Designed by Pieck, Van de Ven and Knoet as ''Sneeuwwitje''. Renovated in 1975.

[[Snow White]] first stood in a cave with a hole so you could watch it from outside, with seven stone dwarfs crying over her sleeping death.  Then later, the cave was renewed, and the stone dwarfs were replaced by moving animatronics.  Snow White remained the same, sleeping in a glass box. In 1999, the castle's stepmother appeared in a mirror, with her holographic reflection. In 2018, the cave went down for a major refurbishment, the dwarfs got new clothes, the scenes were renewed and the lighting was updated.

===The Magic Clock===
[[Image:Magische klok.JPG|right|100px|''the Six Princes'']]
Designed as ''de Magische Klok'', it depicts one of Efteling’s own fairy tales.  Every quarter of an hour, the magic clock comes to life and its characters tell us the story. The six princes are animatronics.
In 2012, the animatronics were renewed.

===Dwarf Village===
{{double image|left|Kabouterdorp.JPG|140|kabouterdeur.jpg|120|''the Dwarf Village''|Yanking the dwarf’s chain}}
Dwarf Village was originally designed by Anton Pieck with later contributions by Ton van de Ven.  In 1952, the village consisted of three large toadstools, through which children could walk, with miniature adornments, such as little chairs and dwarf laundry hanging from a wire.  Later additions included a large inhabited dwarf house in 1972, and a hollow tree with a dwarf playing a [[clavichord]] in 1974.  The village was completed by a toadstool with a writing dwarf and a house with a waterwheel belonging to a dwarf-couple in 1980.  During the 1980s, the male dwarf received spoken lines.

In 2017, the three large toadstools went down for a refurbishment.
The toadstools will be rebuilt with modern materials.

===The Six Servants===
[[Image:Langenek Efteling1.JPG|110px|thumb|right|''Langnek'', one of the six servants]]
Designed originally by Anton Pieck, with later contributions of Ton van de Ven.  The original Long-neck (one of the six servants from the Grimm tale, ''[[The Six Servants]]'', who could see everything due to his long neck and sharp eyes) was built in 1952.  In 1955, a little pond was dug around the stone on which Long-neck sits.  A bust of Bullet-eye with a wasp on his nose stood next to Long-neck.  Bullet-eye was one of the six servants.

In the late 1950s, Bullet-eye was removed and a smaller bust of a blindfolded Bullet-eye was placed upon a [[kiosk]] near Long-neck.  Long-neck received a new head in the 1970s; and in 1979, his body and neck were renewed.  In 2006, safety-fences were placed near the pond. In 2013, the rocks were remodeled and Long-neck received a new head again.

The tale is voiced by Peter Reijnders, and can be read from a book in Dutch, English, French and German.

===The Chinese Nightingale===
[[Image:Chinese Nachtegaal.jpg|right|130px|thumb]]
Designed by Pieck and Van de Ven as ''De Chinese Nachtegaal''.

The scene from [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]] shows the emperor's death, and how the [[nightingale]] restores his life by singing.
The nightingale was one of the first fairy tales when the Fairytale Forest opened in 1952.
Back then, it was just a small scene, with the nightingale on a branch.
In 1979 it got replaced by the Dragon.
In 1999, the new scene opened.
The new scene is much bigger and is located in a building inspired by classic Chinese architecture.

The tale is voiced by Angélique de Boer.

===The Talking Parrot===
The Talking Parrot was one of the ten original scenes from 1952, designed by Anton Pieck.  The tale is about a naughty princess who used to mock people's voices and movements.  She was turned into a [[parrot]] by an old fairy whom she ridiculed. When the girl regrets her sins, the fairy vetoes the spell and "they live happily ever after".  The scene is depicted by the parrot, which records sounds for a few seconds at a time and then plays back any sounds captured on the recording.  The scene was titled "The Naughty Princess" before being renamed to "The Talking Parrot".

===Mother Hulda===
[[Image:Vrouwholle.jpg|right|130px|thumb|''Mother Hulda'']]
Based on [[Mother Hulda|the Grimm tale]], the scene was designed by Pieck as ''Vrouw Holle''.
This story has been depicted, since the park opened, by a well. At the bottom of the well images are projected by Anton Pieck while a voice tells the story.

Since the winter of 2006, [[Mother Hulda]] is present in person with a new animatronic. If called upon, she opens the shutters of the cottage next door and shakes her pillow. And as in the tale, it starts to snow.

===Little Red Riding Hood===
{{double image|right|Efteling 2017 Roodkapje.jpg|80|Efteling Roodkapje.jpg|150|''Little Red Riding Hood''}}
The scene was designed by Anton Pieck.  [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and the wolf entered Efteling in 1953, made of wood, as an outdoor scene.  Little Red Riding Hood knelt in the midst of flowers while the wolf watched her from behind a tree.  In 1960, the scene was replaced by Granny’s house, with the wolf lying in bed and Red Riding Hood at the front door, ringing the bell.  The wooden Little Red Riding Hood would later return to the Fairy Tale Forest as a road-sign.  One can look through the window and listen to the story, told by [[Wieteke van Dort]].

On August 15, 1998, the figure of Little Red Riding Hood was stolen; but was found the next day at the Dominicus Church in [[Tiel]].  During its brief absence, an actress played Little Red Riding Hood in the Fairy Tale Forest.  On October 4, 2006, it was stolen again and found at a retirement home in [[Kaatsheuvel]].

In 2016, the house was rebuilt, with new building techniques.
Also in 2016, the animatronic of the crow Krakeeltje was renewed with new movements.

===The Red Shoes===
{{double image|right|Rode schoentjes efteling.jpg|120|Efteling - Rode Schoentjes.jpg|120|''The Red Shoes''}}
Designed by Anton Pieck, the Dancing Shoes entered Efteling in 1953.  The scene contains a little dance floor with two red shoes dancing, covered by a porch roof.  Visitors can listen to the story, told by Wieteke van Dort, after which the shoes dance to the music of "The [[clogging|Clog]] Dance" by [[Jan van Oort]].

The original story by Hans Christian Andersen has been adapted to be more suitable for young children. In the original story, the girl's feet are cut off to stop her dancing.  In the adaptation, the straps of her shoes are cut, after which the girl can stop dancing, but the shoes keep moving.  The shoes are moved by two rotating discs with [[magnets]], a mechanism developed by Peter Reijnders.

===Hansel and Gretel===
{{double image|right|Hans-en-Grietje.jpg|140|Efteling Hans.jpg|140|The witch's candy hut|Hansel in the cage}}
[[Hansel and Gretel]] was designed by Anton Pieck and presented to the public on June 20, 1955.  The scene consists of the witch's house with candy on the walls, [[pancakes]] as roofing tiles and a cake on top; and in the garden, a fountain of red [[lemonade]].  Gretel sits by the cage in which Hansel is held in the garden.  The witch's face can be seen through a little window in the front door.

In the late seventies, the wood figures were replaced by moving [[animatronic]]s.  An interactive element was added by Peter Reijnders: when one moves the front gate, a [[crow]] on the roof caws, smoke comes out of the chimney, a black cat with yellow eyes comes out of a hole in the wall and the witch (voiced by Peter Reijnder's daughter) says "Knibbel, knabbel, knuisje, wie knabbelt aan mijn huisje?" (Dutch translation of "Nibble, nibble, mousekin, who's nibbling at my housekin?").

In 2016, the animatronics of Hansel and Gretel were replaced by more realistic versions of them.

===The Wishing-Table===
Designed by Pieck and Knoet as ''Tafeltje-dek-je''.

===Guinevere's Bridal Gown===
[[Image:Efteling Het bruidskleed van Genoveva - gekleurde duiven.JPG|160px|right|thumb|Some coloured pigeons]]
Designed as ''Het Bruidskleed van Genoveva''. Presented in the area of Snowwhite as coloured pigeons.
Since June 2018, the pigeons are white instead of coloured.

===The Gardener and the Fakir===
[[Image:Fakir1.JPG|160px|left|thumb|''The Gardener and the Fakir'']]
Designed by Pieck and Van de Ven as ''De Vliegende Fakir''.

The story is staged in front of a building surrounded by an Indian tulip garden. The fakir appears in a window playing his flute, which makes the tulips grow. He then disappears and shows up in the tower with his magic carpet and flies to the other palace tower, using an ingenious system of discreet cables (developed by Peter Reijnders) which gives the illusion of a real levitation.  He plays his flute again to open the tulips there, and in the meanwhile the other tulips close.

The color of the beard of the fakir went from black to white in 1987.

===The Indian Water Lilies===
{{double image|right|Lilies 0001.jpg|180|Indische waterlelies.jpg|200|Square with the [[Indrajit]] Temple Guards|The witch’s chant brings out the fairies}}
[[The Indian Water Lilies]] is a walk-through attraction.  Visitors walk into the show area to experience the three-dimensional tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquanura water show in the works at Efteling in the Netherlands|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/10/news/la-trb-efteling-aquanura-water-show-01201211|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=3 June 2012|author=Brady MacDonald|date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the very first attraction that made use of advanced techniques to create an artificial, fairy tale-style environment.  The consistency and style of the music, lighting, decorations and [[animatronics]] can be found in many other rides built later, like Spookslot,  [[Fata Morgana (Efteling)|Fata Morgana]] and [[Dreamflight|Droomvlucht]].

[[Peter Reijnders]] wanted to create this ride to commemorate the 15th anniversary of Efteling, and went to the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]] at [[Laeken|Laken]] for an audience with [[Queen Fabiola of Belgium]].  The queen agreed to let the Efteling use her story, which she had published in a book of fairy tales entitled ''Los doce cuentos maravillosos'', on the condition that a contribution to charity was made.

One enters the ride by walking through a cave leading to an Indian temple square with a large fountain, Indian decorations and two [[Indrajit]] giants. Two large gates give access to a cavern leading to a [[subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] [[jungle]] lake, enclosed by tropical plants, a creek and a roaring waterfall. After the introduction tale has been told, the appearance of the singing witch summons the fairies to dance on the water lilies, guided by the music of a frog orchestra and singing geese.

The principal musical theme for The Indian Water Lilies is “Afrikaan Beat” by [[Bert Kaempfert]], but the ride starts with the [[Inca]] chant, “Taita [[Inti]]” (Virgin of the Sun God), taken from the album ''Voice of the [[Xtabay]]'' by [[Yma Sumac]].

===The Little Mermaid===
[[The Little Mermaid]] made her appearance in 1970, designed by Anton Pieck.  She holds a fish that spouts water out of its mouth.  The music is the "Allegro Briljante" by [[François-Adrien Boieldieu]].  The mermaid was renewed in 2001.

===The Wolf and the Seven Kids===
[[Image:Moeder geit.jpg|150px|left|Outside of the house, Mother Goat goes out shopping, while the wolf stalks her little goats.]]
The Seven Little Goats was the last fairy tale to be added by Anton Pieck in 1973.  One can look through the windows of the goats' house.  It consists of a living room and a playing annex bedroom.  Six of the little goats play the [[Game of the Goose]] on a special Efteling-board designed by Anton Pieck.  The youngest goat hides in the big clock.  The big bad wolf, dressed in a tuxedo, is at the front door.  In 2002, a [[squirrel]] was added on top of the roof.

===The Dragon===
{{double image|right|draak efteling.jpg|200|schatkist.jpg|200|The Dragon attacks... |...when guests touch the treasure}}
The Dragon, designed by Anton Pieck and Ton van de Ven, was supposed to open on April 6, 1979.  However, the movements of the dragon’s neck and wings were too staccato, delaying the presentation until June 20, 1979.  The dragon is about seven meters long, with a wing span of four meters, and it weighs about 1000&amp;nbsp;kg, making it the largest [[animatronic]] dragon of its time.  If one tries to steal the crown from the treasure chest in front of the dragon, the dragon starts growling and moving fiercely.  The dragon’s sounds are a mix of the sounds of an angry gorilla and a hissing snake, taken from ''Essential Death And Horror Sound Effects Vol. 1'' by [[BBC]] sound designer Steven Brown.  In 2000, the dragon was upgraded to blow smoke out of its nostrils. The neck of the dragon has been shortened a few times. This was done because people could touch the dragon. There are no specific tales attached to the Dragon.

===The Troll King===
{{double image|right|Trollenkoning_2017.jpg|130|Uil Trollenkoning.jpg|130|The Troll King on his throne in a tree}}
The [[animatronic]] Troll King entered Efteling in 1988, for a total cost of 2.6 million guilders.  Although [[troll]]s are a widespread phenomenon in [[Scandinavian mythology]], no particular tale is attached to the Troll King.  The Scandinavian myths inspired Ton van de Ven, who had illustrated a Norwegian fairy tale book in 1974, to create this old, somewhat confused creature, sitting in a hollow tree, predicting the future of his visitors.

On a stone in front of the king, one can point at one of the twelve [[astrological sign]]s at which the king will wake up and mumble some words. Together with Hugo of [[Villa Volta]], the king is the most complex [[animatronic]] in Efteling.  It was a collaboration of Ton van de Ven, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] and [[Spitting Image]].  The animatronic can move 26 parts of its body, including eyebrows, eyes, jaws, back and wrists.  Its voice is that of Peter van Ostade, who also composed the music for [[The People of Laaf]].

===Tom Thumb===
{{double image|left|Kleinduimpje Efteling.jpg|130|Klein Duimpje Efteling.jpg|130|''Tom Thumb''}}
Based on [[Tom Thumb|the tale by Perrault]], the scene was designed by Van de Ven as ''Klein Duimpje''.
In the scene, Tom Thumb is stealing the boot of the sleeping giant.
To call Tom Thumb, you have to call his name in a log.

===Rumpelstiltskin===
[[Image:Rumpelstiltskin Efteling.jpg|130px|thumb|right|The soldier listens while ''Rumpelstiltskin'' reveals his name]]
Based on [[Rumpelstiltskin|the Grimm fairy tale]], the scene was designed by Van de Ven as ''Repelsteeltje''.
Guests can look inside Rumpelstiltskin's house through a window while he reveals his name in a song:
''Niemand weet, Niemand weet, Dat ik Repelsteeltje heet!'' [Translation: No one knows, no one knows, That my name is Rumpelstiltskin!]

===Rapunzel===
[[File:Efteling - Raponsje.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The witch climbing down Rapunzel’s hair]]
On May 18, 2001, [[Rapunzel]] made her appearance in Efteling in a 10 meter high tower.  A witch climbs Rapunzel's long hair 7 meters before she climbs down again.  The scene was designed by Ton van de Ven, who was inspired by towers from the Middle Ages.  The story is told by Wieteke van Dort; the witch’s sounds are by Robert-Jaap Jansen, an Efteling designer.

To create some publicity for the official opening, Efteling organized a contest to find the girl with the longest hair from the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and the [[UK]].  The winner was Patty Gisbers-Jenniskens from [[Overbetuwe|Heteren]] with a braid of 172 centimeters.  The Flemish winner, Katalin Willems, cut her 134&amp;nbsp;cm long braid later that year and donated her braid to Efteling.

===The Little Match Girl===
{{double image|right|Fairy tale ghost.jpg|130|Het meisje met de zwavelstokjes Efteling.jpg|130|''The Little Match Girl''. Inside and outside of the fairy tale building}}
Based on [[The Little Match Girl|the tale by Hans Christian Andersen]], the scene was designed by Michel den Dulk as ''Het Meisje met de Zwavelstokjes''.
This tale opened during the Winter Efteling in 2004 for the 200th anniversary of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen. It had cost approximately €1,300,000 and is set up as a walkthrough
With the help of special effects, such as holographs, and animatronics, The Little Match Girl is one of the most touching stories.

===Cinderella===
This classic fairy tale was brought to life by [[Karel Willemen]] and entered into the park scene in 2009. It was designed as ''Assepoester''.
The scene takes place inside [[Cinderella]]'s stepmother's house.  In the garden, the grave of Cinderella's real mother is seen, with a tree hanging over it.  The visitors enter the mansion, where they can watch through a window and look into a dark room, where birds are eating beans and a large music box stands in the middle.  During the story, various elements make noise or are shown with a spotlight.  These include a door, where visitors see the shadows of the stepsisters, complaining about Cinderella, and the music box, inside of which figures of Cinderella and the prince are dancing.  Then two animatronics of Cinderella and the prince are shown, with the prince fitting the glass slipper on Cinderella.  Finally, two doors behind the pair open up, revealing a distant castle and a carriage traveling toward it.

===The Fairy Tale Tree===
In 2008, Efteling began to build an interactive tree, ''De Sprookjesboom'', designed by Pim-Martijn Sanders and Karel Willemen, in the Fairy Tale Forest based on the character from their animated TV series ''[[Sprookjesboom]]'', but the plan was unexpectedly shelved until July 2009, opening only on April 1, 2010.  The tree is a wise old oak, which can speak and tell stories, typically about the other inhabitants of the Sprookjesbos.  It consists of 1,500 branches and 50,000 sheets.  The tree has several effects besides speaking: his whole structure - trunk, branches, leaves - move. It is home to several small animatronics, such as a squirrel, a woodpecker, a spider and talking mushrooms.
The old oak is located opposite The Little Match Girl, and is a structure 13 meters wide and 13 meters high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprookjesboom|url=http://www.sprookjesboom.com/|work=Sprookjesboom|publisher=Eftling|accessdate=3 June 2012|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104002513/http://sprookjesboom.com/|archivedate=4 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Emperor's New Clothes===
[[The Emperor's New Clothes]], designed as ''De Nieuwe kleren van de Keizer'', opened in fall 2012. It is an outdoor fairy tale, and partly uses shadow puppetry to tell the tale. When the emperor is carried to his palace naked, a fountain is used to hide his private parts, which is a comical addition to the attraction.

When the fairy tale opened, it was voiced by Toos van de Voorde-Verdult.
In December 2012, Toos' voice was replaced by Paul van Vliet.

===Pinocchio===
{{double image|left|Anton Pieck muizen.jpg|130|Detail Pinokkio.jpg|130|Geppetto's shop}}
[[Image:Pinokkio Efteling.jpg|150px|right|thumb|''Pinocchio'']]
The fairytale which was revealed to the public on the 24th of March 2016 depicts the story of the puppet who becomes a boy. In fairytale forest Geppetto's shop (designed as "la bottega di Geppetto) is shown desolate and with a note which informs the reader that [[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]] has left his home looking for [[Pinocchio]]. A few meters to the left of the shop the visitors can see monsterous fish which has devoured both Geppetto and Pinocchio who are visible when in opens its mouth.

The fairy tale was created by the Efteling in association with the'Fondazione Nazionale Carlo Collodi', an organasation from the city of [[Colledi]] which tries to promote the story of Pinocchio. Because of this the fairy tale has typical [[Italy|Italian]] influences.

From 2015 till 2016 a 'Pinocchio' musical was performed in the Efteling theatre to promote the fairy tale that would open around the same time.

'''''Golden Summer, Eaglemont''''' is an 1889 painting by Australian artist [[Arthur Streeton]]. Painted during a summer drought when Streeton was twenty-one years old, it is an idyllic depiction of sunlit, undulating plains in rural [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] on [[Melbourne]]'s outskirts. [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalistic]] yet poetic, and a conscious effort by Streeton to create his most epic work yet, it is a prime example of the artist's distinctive, high-keyed blue and gold palette, what he considered "nature's scheme of colour in Australia". It is one of his most famous works and is considered a masterpiece of [[Australian Impressionism]].

==Background==
Streeton painted it ''[[en plein air]]'' in January 1889 at an artists' camp he established the previous year at [[Eaglemont, Victoria|Mount Eagle]] (now Eaglemont), near [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]], on the outskirts of [[Melbourne]]. There, Streeton, [[Charles Conder]], [[Tom Roberts]] and occasionally other artists occupied an old weatherboard house. Streeton described the location in a letter to Roberts, calling it "our hill of gold":

{{quote|I sit here in the upper circle surrounded by copper and gold, and smile with joy under my fly net as all the light, glory and quivering brightness passes slowly and freely before my eyes. Nothing happier than this. I shout and laugh at my immense wealth, all free and without responsibility. Who could steal this from me? No one.}}

Years later, Streeton recalled painting ''Golden Summer'' as he, Conder, and fellow ''plein air'' painter [[John Ford Paterson]] shared cheese and a bottle of [[Bordeaux wine|claret]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1675780 "Australian Art: Mr Streeton's Return: Memories of Heidelberg"] (3 February 1922), ''The Argus''.

''The Argus''. 4 May 1889. p. 12. Retrieved 18 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conder took ''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' to [[London]] in April 1890, where, the following year as ''Golden Summer, Australia'', it became the first painting by an Australian-born artist to be exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. In 1892, it appeared at the [[Paris Salon]], and won an award. One critic noted the popularity of ''Golden Summer'' with "the crowds that throng the Salon", saying that it was "simply impossible" to pass by the painting "as it is utterly different from any other picture in the vast collection".&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8450318 "The Australian Artists in Paris"] (17 August 1892), ''The Argus''. Retrieved 24 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Australian artist [[John Longstaff]], then based in Paris, said the painting "created quite a sensation and stood out in oneness and quality all through everything else on the walls."&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

==Provenance==
Scottish shipbuilder [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]] purchased ''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' on the opening day of the 1892 Paris Salon. It remained part of his estate until Streeton re-acquired the painting from Mitchell's widow in 1919.

Ahead of its public auction in Australia in 1924, [[Lionel Lindsay]] extolled the work in the hope that it would enter a public gallery:&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Lionel (28 November 1923).

A private collector acquired it for 1,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s, then a record for a painting by an Australian artist.

'''''Le Dépiquage des Moissons''''', also known as '''''Harvest Threshing''''', and '''''The Harvesters''''', is an immense oil painting created in 1912 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]] (1881–1953). It was first revealed to the general public at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], ''Galerie La Boétie'' in Paris, October 1912 (no. 43). This work, along with ''La Ville de Paris'' (''City of Paris'') by [[Robert Delaunay]], is the largest and most ambitious [[Cubism|Cubist]] painting undertaken during the pre-War Cubist period. Formerly in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, this monumental painting by Gleizes is exhibited at the [[National Museum of Western Art]], in Tokyo, Japan.

==Description==
The work is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 269 x 353&amp;nbsp;cm (106 x 138 in), signed and dated lower right, Gleizes, 1912. "''Harvest Threshing''", wrote curator and art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] for the Gleizes Guggenheim Retrospective in 1964, "summarizes Gleizes' interest in presenting an epic panorama of mountains, valleys, clouds and smoke, towns, workers and wheat, a simultaneous celebration of the harvest, nature and man in idealistic harmony." Gleizes' painting, as [[Henri Le Fauconnier]]'s ''Abundance'', likely takes its theme from the social and synthetic program of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], and too, from the poem of [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], ''La Montagne, Poèmes légendaires'', part 5 of ''La Terrestre Tragedie'' (Paris, Mercure de France, 1908): ''Les Moissonneurs dans les Epis, armes de faux et de faucilles...'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R.

While the [[still-life]] and [[nude]] are common themes of pre-[[World War I]] Cubism, the work of Gleizes is characterized by ambitious subjects:&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke 2012"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/Du%20Cubisme/contents Peter Brooke, ''On "Cubism" in context'', 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the harvest, the hunt, the city, and, later, ''Broadway'' in New York City, and the ''Brooklyn Bridge'' (1915, Guggenheim, New York), one of his most abstract paintings of this period.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2191 Daniel Robbins, MoMA, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes took this, according to Peter Brooke, as symbolic of the need to express the whole vast drama, the collection of unprecedented sensations of modern life.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke 2012" /&gt;
''Harvest Threshing'' represents a big subject, rich in plastic possibilities. The interest of the painting resides in its rich and complex fabric of interwoven latticework, with 'the institution of relations between straight lines and curves' or the 'thousand surprises of fire and of shadow' proposed in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (co-authored with [[Jean Metzinger]] in 1912). The subject matter is entirely, as Le Fauconnier and Gleizes himself says, 'a pretext'. A pencil transcription done to scale by Geneviève Dalban, as Peter Brooke points out, reveals the greatness of the construction. "The 'duration' that has been so much talked about is entirely a matter of the length of time that can be spent looking at it, as one thing leads to another, in and out and round about, in an endless visual dance. It is a mark of the failure of the Cubist revolution – its hi-jacking by the champions of the subject – that nearly one hundred years later there are writers on art who can see in such a picture only peasants, a church tower, a rustic meal, mountains, clouds..."&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke 2012" /&gt;

In this painting can be observed the summing up of all present in the art of [[Georges Seurat]]: "the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value", it represented the furthest extension of [[Paul Cézanne]]'s preoccupations: his will to deconstruct, his revolt against imitation and refusal of Renaissance perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com Alex Mittelmannn, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much as that of ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses]]'' and ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'' painted the same year, the subject matter of ''Harvest Threshing''—a semi-urban landscape that possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, juxtaposing sharply contrasting elements of both traditional and modern life—is derived from an unsentimental observation of the world.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke 2012" /&gt; On the one hand the artist makes illusion to the traditional process of [[threshing]]—a step in grain preparation after [[harvest]]ing and before [[winnowing]], now mostly done by machine—and on the other, the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization. Yet the compositional relationships between the two are formally resolved. The representation of this transition between classical tradition and contemporary life was noticeably of interest to Gleizes, as it was to other artists of the [[Section d'Or]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

"The organic process of life and civilization, moving irresistibly toward harmonious interaction," wrote [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Robbins]], "was the subject of Gleizes' art." It was treated neither as a "confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but was instead presented in concrete and precise terms. Gleizes' ''Harvest Threshing'', the masterpiece of the Section d'Or (no. 34), is not merely an anecdote in a scene. Rather, it is a multiple panorama celebrating the worker, his material life and his collective activity in securing that life on a permanently changing land. Gleizes confronts us not with one action or place, but with many: not with one time, but with past and future as well as present."(Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

==In contrast to Picasso and Braque==
[[File:Braque fruitdish glass.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Georges Braque]], ''Fruitdish and Glass'', [[papier collé]] and charcoal on paper, 1912]]
[[File:L'Aveyron, Decazeville, 1918, Les Usines, CPA.jpg|thumb|right|L'Aveyron, Decazeville, 1918, Les Usines, postcard]]
Gleizes had no intention of analyzing and describing neutral objects from daily life; a bowl of fruit, a pipe, violin or guitar. His 'empathetic' consciousness and complex idealistic concepts of the world led him to portray—rather than 'mundane' objects—subjects of vast proportion, of provocative social and cultural significance. For Gleizes, consciousness and reality could meet and reconcile on the surface of the canvas. There is no period that corresponds closely to the analytic Cubism developed by Picasso and Braque in the work of Gleizes, as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]]. The ''iconography'' of these artists, in contrast to that of Picasso and Braque, helps elucidate the reasons. At the same time, iconography explains how Gleizes and Delaunay were to become abstract painters, theoretically closer to  [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] than to Picasso, Braque or even [[Juan Gris|Gris]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The intention of Gleizes had been to reconstitute and synthesize the real-world according to his own consciousness. Important factors in this process were the relationships and interactions between volumes to convey solidity, structure, weight, placement. Also important was a principal lessons of Cézanne: the indivisibility of form and color; a change in one would alter the other.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Unlike Picasso and Braque, the work of Gleizes always involved the synthetic treatment of broad subjects, each section of canvas receiving equal attention. As a consequence, almost a year after the completion of ''The Harvesters'', Gleizes would develop compositional innovations: broad tilting planes that provide a transition from the outer rectangles to the rotating forms at the core of the work.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Gleizes was aware of the differences between his own interests and those of Picasso and Braque. He wrote an article after seeing Picasso's work for the first time (in 1911). After quoting Apollinaire about returning to the principles of structure, color and inspiration, he wrote that the "valuable [precieuses] indications of Picasso and Braque, in spite of everything, did not depart from an impressionism of form which, nevertheless, they opposed (an impressionism of) color."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

==''Du "Cubisme"''==

Exhibited at Salon d'Automne, Paris, 1912, [[Armory show]], New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913. The setting: an urban backdrop of bridge-girders, smokestacks and train tracks viewed from the balcony of a surgeon's office, avenue de l'Opéra, Paris]]
In preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, and in the wake of their controversial showing at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1911, Albert Gleizes and [[Jean Metzinger]] published a major defense of Cubism and the first theoretical essay on the new movement, entitled ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]''.

Passages of their text which attempted to reconcile goals and methods of modern painting were read to the circle around the Duchamp brothers (the Puteaux group) during the summer of 1912 and it was published before the conclusion of the Salon de la Section d’Or, where Gleizes exhibited his monumental Cubist painting ''The Harvesters''. Gleizes believed that artists could explain themselves in writing as well as (or better than) critics. He continued writing throughout the following years as ''Du "Cubisme"'' enjoyed wide circulation within a continuously growing circle of artists and connoisseurs. By placing the artist at the centre of society, Albert Gleizes, along with a generation of painters from diverse classes and nations, helped revolutionize the bourgeois canons. By observing and thinking, as opposed to serving solely as an ornamenter, Gleizes concluded, the artist realized a fundamental service to humanity.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, MoMA"/&gt;

Shortly after the 1912 publication of ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', Guillaume Apollinaire published ''Les Peintres Cubiste'' (1913, written in 1912), in which he wrote "Majesty: this is what, above all, characterizes the art of Albert Gleizes. [...] This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination; considered from the plastic point of view, it is the immensity of things. [...] The pictures of Albert Gleizes are realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels."&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Aesthetic Meditations on Painting, The Cubist Painters'' (Second Series), written in 1912, published in 1913 (Edition Figuière, Paris), translated and published in [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/render.php?id=1299781650906252&amp;view=mjp_object ''The Little Review'', Quarterly Journal of art and letters, ''Stella Number'', Autumn 1922, New York, London] (Administration; Margaret Anderson, Francis Picabia and Ezra Pound).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
* Solomon R. Guggenheim (acquired from the artist in 1938)

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the outset of 1938, Gleizes learned that the religious community that owned Moly Sabata, a large house he had rented in Sablons, was ready to sell. Despite his success at the 1937 [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]], he lacked the funds necessary to purchase the house. In August, however, the American collector, Solomon R.

[[File:Fatherland's 1964 Europe.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of [[Europe]] detailing a victorious German Reich in 1964 as described in [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' 1992 novel  [[Fatherland (novel)|''Fatherland'']]. Although fictional, many of the named regions were real or planned ones for parts of the Nazi [[lebensraum]] effort.]]

A '''hypothetical Axis victory in World War II''' has become a common concept of [[alternative history]] and [[counterfactual history]]. Such writings express ideas of what the world would be like had the [[Axis powers]] of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and  [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] won [[World War II]]. Numerous examples exist in several languages worldwide.&lt;ref name=Noa/&gt;&lt;ref name=SH&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020715/time.shtml |title= The Time of the Other: Alternate History and the Conquest of America |accessdate= 2 January 2009 |author= Fred Bush |date= July 15, 2002 |work=[[Strange Horizons]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100103121939/http://strangehorizons.com/2002/20020715/time.shtml |archivedate= 3 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Pax Germanica''', [[Latin]] for "[[Germany|German]] peace", is sometimes used for this theoretical period,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=JW2LyrRqB9hdShkHzyksTg3VqP7pqJJZvXkJL674PbQxyhcVzzS2!878188508?docId=5002377756 Carl Tighe: ''Pax Germanica - the Future Historical''. Journal of European Studies, Vol. 30, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy to [[List of periods of regional peace|similar terms for peaceful historical periods]]. In some cases, this term is used for a hypothetical [[German Empire|Imperial German]] victory in [[World War I]] as well, having a historical precedent in Latin texts referring to the [[Peace of Westphalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camena/pexen/books/pexenfelderapparatus_10.html "CAPUT LXVIII. Chronologia."] in CAMENA. See for years 1648 et 1649.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of Axis supremacy as a fictional  [[Drama (fiction)|dramatic]] device began in the [[English-speaking world]] before the start of [[World War II]], with [[Katharine Burdekin]]'s novel ''[[Swastika Night]]'' coming out in 1937. Subsequent popular fictional depictions of an Axis-powers victory include: ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]] (1962), ''[[SS-GB]]'' by [[Len Deighton]] (1978), and ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]] (1992).

Some have viewed the enduring interest in the "what-ifs" of an Axis-powers victory as the result of the resonance of related themes, for example, how ordinary individuals deal with the [[humiliation]] and anger of being dominated.&lt;ref name="Noa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McManus"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/nov/12/swastika-night-nineteen-eighty-four|title= ''Swastika Night'': ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''{{'s}} lost twin|first= Darragh|last= McManus|date= 12 November 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]}}

==Depiction of Axis victory in fiction==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}

===Central themes and motifs===

In terms of [[Tone (fiction)|tone]], the concept of a victory usually creates a background of depressing [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], audiences seeing plots unformed in a dark, strained atmosphere. Examples of writers using this device include [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Robert Harris (English author)|Robert Harris]], and [[Philip Roth]] among many others.&lt;ref name=Noa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/alternative-history-what-might-have-been-had-hitler-won-1.433657|title=Alternative History: What Might Have Been Had Hitler Won?|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early depictions===

''[[Swastika Night]]'', authored by [[Katherine Burdekin]] under the pseudonym "Murray Constantine" in 1937, is a unique case given that it came out before World War II began. It is thus a novel of [[future history]] rather than an "alternative" one. Writing in 2009 for ''[[The Guardian]]'', journalist Darragh McManus remarked that "[t]hough a huge leap of imagination, Swastika Night posits a terrifyingly coherent and plausible" story-line. He also wrote, "And considering when it was published, and how little of what we know of the Nazi regime today was then understood, the novel is eerily prophetic and perceptive about the nature of Nazism". The journalist particularly noted the "violence and mindlessness" as well as the "irrationality and superstition" found in the post-victory [[dictatorship]].&lt;ref name=McManus/&gt;

The first Nazi-victory 'alternate history' as such, in any language, was published in 1945 months after [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's suicide]] and written by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] author Laszlo Gaspar.&lt;ref name=Noa/&gt; Titled ''We, Adolf I'' (Adolf the First), the novel envisions German success [[Battle of Stalingrad|after fighting in Stalingrad]] eventually leading to the victorious Hitler crowning himself a new modern 'Emperor'. Erecting in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] a huge Imperial Palace incorporating elements of the French [[Eiffel Tower]] and the U.S. [[Statue of Liberty]] among other spectacles, the [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] despot prepares a dynastic marriage with a Japanese princess in order to produce an heir who would [[World domination|rule the whole world]].

Often known in English by the title ''The Last Jew'', the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] work ''Ha-Yehudi Ha'Aharon'' (היהודי האחרון) by the [[Revisionist Zionist]] physician and political activist Jacob Weinshall came out in [[Tel Aviv]] 1946. In it, hundreds of years in the future, a completely Nazi-dominated world ruled by a "League of Dictators" discovers a last surviving Jew hiding in [[Madagascar]]. The Nazi rulers plan to publicly execute this last Jew during the forthcoming [[Olympic Games]]. However, before this can take place, the Moon moves close to the Earth as a result of the Nazis' misguided attempt to colonize it. The catastrophe causing the end of human civilization and thus of Nazi rule. Weinshall's Hebrew text, as of 2000, has never received a full, formal translation into other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Eshed, "Israeli Alternate Histories" (in Hebrew) published by the Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy, November 2, 2000 [http://www.sf-f.org.il/sf-f/old_site/story_60.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel should not be confused with Yoram Kaniuk's novel ''The Last Jew'', which has been translated to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Last Jew: A Novel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8GoxhVWAeZIC|publisher = Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|date = 2007-12-01|isbn = 9781555848385|language = en|first = Yoram|last = Kaniuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work ''[[Peace in Our Time (play)|Peace in Our Time]]'' explored a fascist-dominated [[London]] and the deleterious effects of occupation on regular people. [[English people|English]] [[playwright]] [[Noël Coward]], whose name appeared on a [[Gestapo]] [[The Black Book|arrest list]] in the event of a ground invasion of the UK, authored the drama, and it received its stage debut in 1947. Although facing a muted response at first, lingering interest in Coward's work as well as the specific themes of ''Peace in Our Time'' have meant that subsequent productions have gone on, even into the [[21st century]].&lt;ref name=Review/&gt;

Counterfactual scenarios are also written as a form of academic paper rather than necessarily as fiction and/or novel-length fiction.

* In the 2003-2004 [[Captain America]] story arc "''Cap Lives''" (''Captain America'' Vol. 4, issues 17-20), Captain America awakens from suspended animation in 1964 to find that Nazi Germany has won WWII and conquered much of the world, including the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4345">.'''Jean Rigaud''' (15 June 1912 – 1999) was a well-listed French painter.

== Early life ==
He was born on 15 June 1912 in [[Bordeaux]], France to the well-known painter, [[Pierre Gaston Rigaud]] (1874–1939).  The Rigauds moved to the village of Guyenne in 1914, shortly after World War I began.  It was during this time that Jean Rigaud received his first formal training under his father, Pierre Gaston, who was also a well-respected teacher.  During this time, Jean was encouraged to develop his own style and talents, which utilized "pure color tones (ochres, yellows and red cadmium) which [stood] out triumphantly against grey skies."{{ref|greyskies}}

In 1925 Jean Rigaud was invited to exhibit his works at the ''Salon d'Art Ancien Espagnol'' in Paris, where he became a regular.  Jean also continued his formal education at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris at the ''Atelier André Dewambez''.  While at the ''Atelier'', Jean Rigaud began to develop his unique [[impressionism|impressionistic]] style and techniques.  He also began painting marine subjects for which he became known.  However, this did not mean that he did not paint other scenes.  As "a painter of instinct", who focused on scenery, villages and abodes were not out of the realm.  Examples of these works include "Tolede:  Contre Jour" a 28 ¾" x 19 ¾" oil on canvas painting "L'Isle Adam", and "Ker Guerin, Île d'Yeu."  However, according to a brief biography by ''Banks Fine Art'', Rigaud "saved little room for precise depictions of the human figure in his works."

From 1938 to 1976, Jean Rigaud participated in 53 one-man exhibitions, including at the [[Galerie Durand-Ruel]] in which he was featured every other year from 1956 to 1974.  Furthermore, as a tribute, The Galerie Durand Ruel featured Rigaud's work in their final exhibition as a "Grand Finale."

During his lifetime, Jean Rigaud was invited to exhibit his work at all of the leading Paris Salons, which included the [[Société Nationale des Beaux Arts|Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], [[Salon "Comparaisons"]], ''Salon du Dessin et de la Peinture a l'eau'' and the ''Salon de la Marine''.  Rigaud also exhibited his works in [[Casablanca]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Strasbourg]].  He also received a Gold Medal at The International Exhibition in Paris in 1937, the Prize of Messageries Maritimes in 1952, the Prize of Morocco in 1953, and the Prize of [[Charles Cottet]] in 1957 as well as "Painter of the French Navy" honors in 1956.

Jean Rigaud's works are featured in many private and public collections across the world.  His paintings are also permanently exhibited at the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne|National Museum]] in Paris, [[Musée national de la Marine|Musée de la Marine]], Musée de Niort, Musée de [[Tours, France|Tours]], Musée de Poitiers, Musée Mulhouse, Musée Chalet, Musée Pontoise, and Musée [[Strasbourg]]. Jean Rigaud is also well listed in over a dozen prestigious books on art.  
Jean Rigaud died in 1999 in Paris, and immediately after his death, the Musée national de la Marine mounted a one-man retrospective of his work, which was met with great critical acclaim.  
"Jean Rigaud is placed without doubt in the great tradition of realist and [[impressionist]] [[Painting|painter]]."{{ref|greattradition}}

==His friends==

Among his colleagues, his closest friends were [[Louis Vuillermoz]], [[Daniel du Janerand]] and chiefly [[Maurice Boitel]] whom he brought in car for painting to [[Yport]] ([[Normandy]]), into [[Ile de Sein]] ([[Brittany]]), and whom he convinced to come and paint in [[Ile d'Yeu|Yeu island]].

'''Kendall Lewis Walton''' (born 1939) is an American [[philosopher]], the Emeritus Charles Stevenson Collegiate Professor of [[Philosophy]] and Professor of Art and Design at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/people/professoremeritus Philosophy faculty listing], Univ. of Michigan, retrieved 2010-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; His work mainly deals with theoretical questions about the arts and issues of philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and philosophy of language. His book ''Mimesis as Make Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts'' develops a theory of make-believe and uses it to understand the nature and varieties of representation in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. "Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts". Harvard University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; He has also developed an account of photography as transparent, defending the idea that we see through photographs, much as we see through telescopes or mirrors,&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures: On the Nature of Photographic Realism' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 79-116&lt;/ref&gt; and written extensively on pictorial representation, fiction and the emotions, the ontological status of fictional entities, the aesthetics of music, metaphor, and aesthetic value.

==Education and career==
Walton studied as an undergraduate at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], originally pursuing a major in music, having been a serious musician, probably headed towards music theory. 
However, a philosophy course in his sophomore year convinced him to change his major, tentatively, from music to philosophy. After a few more courses, he became convinced he had found his calling, stating that he had always been “more or less hooked” on philosophy, despite not knowing it by that name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his background in music, Walton expected that he would have an interest in aesthetics and philosophy of art, but was unmoved by his contacts with these fields at Berkeley. After graduating in 1961, he pursued postgraduate studies at [[Cornell University]] where he attended a seminar with the British philosopher and aesthetician [[Frank Sibley (philosopher)|Frank Sibley]] that he discovered “how exciting aesthetics can be, how serious, rigorous philosophical thought can connect with real, real-world interests in the arts.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his dissertation, 'Conceptual Schemes: A Study of Linguistic Relativity and Related Philosophical Problems', with Sydney Shoemaker on philosophy of language, mind and metaphysics, and graduated in 1967 with a Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/klwalton/files/cv-24jan10.docx Curriculum vitae] from Walton's web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

After having been invited to teach a course on aesthetics that he was not fully prepared for (having only had the one seminar with Sibley), he stayed up nearly all night brainstorming topics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt; which led to his paper 'Categories of Art'.&lt;ref&gt;'Categories of Art' reprinted in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic tradition]] had not explored aesthetics at the time, he was drawn to the idea of being a pioneer, staying “That is more fun, for me, than fine tuning ideas others have worked on for decades or centuries. And I don’t have to leave behind my interests in music and the other arts”&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1965, and became Charles L. Stevenson Collegiate Professor in 1999. He was elected as a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1998, and received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Nottingham]] in 2005. He was president of the American Society for Aesthetics from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/klwalton/files/cv-24jan10.docx Curriculum vitae] from Walton's web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
===Make-believe theory===
Walton's major contribution to philosophy is his theory of representation, known as the make-believe theory. In the context of ontology, the same theory is usually referred to as pretence theory, and in the context of representational arts, prop theory. Walton has been working on this philosophical theory since 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Pictures and Make-Believe', The Philosophical Review (July 1973), pp.  
283-319.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is expounded in his 1990 magnum opus ''Mimesis as Make -Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. "Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts". Harvard University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is a development of Ernst Gombrich's sketched ideas concerning the relationship between toys and art, presented in his famous essay 'Meditations on a Hobby Horse', which Walton has described as having been “largely ignored” by most of philosophy of art.&lt;ref&gt;'Pictures and Hobby Horses' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walton's theory, representational art can be understood as props that prescribe specific imaginings, analogous to the way children's toys such as dolls and teddy bears function as props in children's games of make-believe, albeit with greater sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Via certain principles of generation, any such prop generates fictional truths, which collectively constitute fictional worlds.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Walton identifies two kinds of such worlds: the game world of each participant and the work world, which can be thought of as containing only such content as is true in any well-formed game world.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 58-61&lt;/ref&gt; Props are divided into two forms: sensory depictions (such as paintings, sculpture and certain kinds of music), and verbal representations (such as novels and the spoken component of theater).&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 293-384&lt;/ref&gt;

A key clarification that the make-believe theory offers is the idea that the term 'fictional' can be taken to mean “true in the appropriate game of make-believe” or, equivalently, true in the fictional world of the representation.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Walton states that “Imagining aims at the fictional as belief aims at the true. What is true is to be believed; what is fictional is to be imagined.”&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; He develops this concept into an ontology of fictional objects that eliminates any “voodoo metaphysics”&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; by recognising that people sometimes refer to fictional entities ''as if'' they were referring to real entities. Walton identifies a pretence construal whereby a person ''pretends'' to describe the real world, when actually describing a fictional world.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 390-392&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis of the make-believe theory can be found in Walton's 1978 paper 'Fearing Fictions',&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Fearing Fictions', Journal of Philosophy, vol. 75, no. 1, 1978, pp. 5-27.&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses the [[Paradox of fiction]] i.e. how can we be moved by things that do not exist in the case of fiction?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/ 'Paradox of Fiction', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, accessed 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Walton's solution is to accept that our responses to fiction are genuine emotions, but to deny that they correspond to the conventional feelings that we refer to – rather, it is ''fictional'' that they are the conventional emotions. So, for instance, when a person who has watched a horror movie declares that they felt afraid, it is true that they were emotionally moved, but fictional that what they were moved to was ''fear''. Walton refers to these fictional emotions as quasi emotions.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 241-249&lt;/ref&gt;

In later papers, Walton has expanded his theory to recognize a distinction between ''content oriented make-believe'', which describes a participant's relationship to the fictional worlds of novels, films, paintings etc. and ''prop oriented make-believe'', in which the participant's interest is in the nature of the prop itself, not in the fictional world that attaches to it.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Metaphor and Prop Oriented Make-Believe', European Journal of Philosophy, no. 1, 1993, pp. 39–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphors are a classic example of prop oriented make-believe: the phrase “we are in the same boat” is not intended to elicit imaginings about the fictional boat we are in, but to communicate by drawing our attention to a specific prop (the boat).&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Existence as Metaphor?' in A. Everett and T. Hofweber (eds.), Empty Names, Fiction and the Puzzles of Non-Existence, Stanford, CA, CSLI Publications, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Yablo has developed Walton's concept of prop oriented make-believe in connection with numbers and concluded that our understanding of cardinality is essentially based upon fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Yablo, Stephen. 'Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary vol. 72, no. 1, 1998, pp. 229–262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yablo, Stephen. 'Go Figure: A Path through Fictionalism', Midwest Studies in Philosophy, vol. 25, 2002, pp. 72-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
The make-believe theory has been described by [[Jerrold Levinson]] as “the most significant event in Anglo-American aesthetics in many a year”, and compares it to [[Nelson Goodman|Nelson Goodman's]] ''[[Languages of Art]]'' (1968), [[Richard Wollheim|Richard Wollheim's]] ''[[Art and Its Objects]]'' and [[Arthur Danto|Arthur Danto's]] ''[[Transfiguration of the Commonplace]]''  by suggesting that it “joins a small pantheon of landmark books”.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Jerrold. 'Making Believe', Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review, vol. 32, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simo Säätelä compared Walton's approach with the make-believe theory to that of [[Gilbert Ryle]] in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), albeit far wider in scope.&lt;ref&gt;Säätelä, Simo. 'Fiction, Make-Believe and Quasi Emotions',  
British Journal of Aesthetics, vol. 34, no. 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Maynard]] has praised Walton's achievement, saying: "he has worked out a theory of representation relevant to the arts. In an age of aesthetics glib about theory, I wonder if it will be appreciated how significant an accomplishment this is."&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, Patrick. 'Real Imaginings, Walton Symposium in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, vol. 51, no. 2, June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game designer and philosopher [[Chris Bateman]] has adapted the make-believe theory to games and videogames.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ihobo.com/2010/05/game-design-as-makebelieve.html "Game Design as Make-Believe] 27 May 2010. Retrieved 23 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/imaginary-games.html "Imaginary Games"], 22 February 2011. Retrieved 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later theories===
Walton has developed several additional philosophical theories pertaining to art. He has developed the groundwork for a theory of aesthetic value in which aesthetic pleasure is understood as being partly constituted by the admiration a participant feels for an artwork,&lt;ref&gt;'“How Marvelous!”: Toward a Theory of Aesthetic Value'' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 3-19&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that styles in art can be understood by comparison to the adjective qualities we attach to the actions that artists apparently took in making a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;'Style and the Products and Processes of Art' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 221-248&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, he has developed a transparency thesis of photography,&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures: On the Nature of Photographic Realism' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 79-116&lt;/ref&gt; which is summarized in the following claim: “Photographs are ''transparent''. We see the world ''through'' them.”&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Walton recognizes that this use of 'see' may differ from its conventional usage, but considers it parallel to the way we talk about 'seeing' through a telescope or other such tool.&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; In viewing a photograph, we thus have ''two'' related experiences: we see through the photograph to the circumstances it was originally taken, and we have a fictional experience using the photograph as a prop e.g. if one looks at a photograph of Aunt Mabel grimacing one may say “Aunt Mabel is grimacing” - it is fictional that one sees her grimacing, but in addition one actually sees through the photograph an actual grimace that she had on her face in the past.&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">In philosophical discourse, '''lexis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: λέξις "word") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.

== Lexis according to Plato ==

According to [[Plato]], lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into [[mimesis]] (imitation properly speaking) and [[diegesis]] (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: "Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad".&lt;ref&gt;"Boundaries of a Narrative," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1–13. JSTOR. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to [[Gerald Prince]], diegesis in the ''Iliad'' is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the'' Iliad'' is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince. ''A Dictionary of Narratolog''y. 2003. University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the "direct representation of the actors speaking to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Gennette 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis according to Aristotle ==

According to Jose M. Gonzalez, "Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis."&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Gonzalez, "Phantasia and Aristotle." JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.
 
Gonzalez also points out that, "By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis." [[Phantasia (philosophy)|Phantasia]] is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as "our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image." &lt;ref&gt;Jana Noel. "Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis". 1997.[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/eps/PES-Yearbook/97_docs/noel.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.

== Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle ==

Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an "elevated subject of inquiry," he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech.  Often calling it "style," he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness.  Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.".&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle''. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed.  [[Donald McQuade|Donald, McQuade]]. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the "proper method of delivery." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. 
 
'''Voice''' 

At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice.  They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Rhetoric]]'', Aristotles says, "proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions.  The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice.  This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, "voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Stoehr. "Tone and Voice."  ''College English'' Nov. 1968:  JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO.  28 April 2008. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/374450]. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice.  Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Stoehr 150&lt;/ref&gt;       

'''Language'''

As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude.  The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life.  However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.

The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking.  In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life.  They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech.  Most of all, the speaker must "give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. 

Also, a speaker must avoid using very many "strange words, compound words, and invented words.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak.  However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of [[metaphor]] because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.

== Two forms of lexis ==

According to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style.  However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms.  The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: ''lexis graphike'' and ''lexis agonistike'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Sonkowsky, ”An Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.” p. 259 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/283710?seq=4&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=agonistike&amp;term=graphike&amp;term=lexis&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlexis%2Bgraphike%2Band%2Blexis%2Bagonistike%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;cookieSet=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms.  Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.

''Lexis graphike'' comes from the term ''zographia'', meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same.   His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ''lexis graphik''e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lexis agonistike'' however is from the term ''skiagraphia'', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting.  Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ''lexis agonistike'' does not need questions asked, but only answers.  The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

To further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered.  ''Lexis graphike'' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence.  The delivery of ''lexis graphike'' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation.  ''Lexis graphike'' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech.  ''Lexis agonistike'' contradicts ''lexis graphike'' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance.  The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, various '''condominium projects have been proposed for the [[Las Vegas Valley]]'''. [[Park Towers (Las Vegas)|Park Towers]] and [[Turnberry Place]], two high-rise condominium properties located near the [[Las Vegas Strip]], were completed in 2001; they subsequently inspired a condominium boom that started in 2003, when various developers began announcing projects that were planned throughout the Las Vegas Valley.

Many projects were ultimately cancelled because of a rise in construction costs, as well as a lack of skilled construction workers and contractors who were qualified to build high-rises; both reasons were attributed to the large number of projects being announced. The following list includes notable condominium projects that were both completed and cancelled, as well as projects that are on hold.

==History==
===Early history===
[[#Regency Towers|Regency Towers]], built in 1974, was the first high-rise condominium property to open in the [[Las Vegas Valley]],&lt;ref name=bide/&gt; with 226-units. The property was initially unsuccessful, selling only eight units before going into foreclosure. In the late 1990s, Las Vegas was the fastest-growing area in the United States.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr8-1999/&gt; As a result, five new high-rise condominium projects were being planned for the Las Vegas Valley in 1998, for a total of 12 new condominium towers. Among the five proposed projects was [[#Turnberry Place|Turnberry Place]] and [[#Park Towers|Park Towers]].&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr8-1999&gt;{{cite news|last=Macy|first=Robert|title=Developers pitching pricey penthouses as Vegas enters the condo market|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/1999/apr/08/developers-pitching-pricey-penthouses-as-vegas-ent/|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=April 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Luxury towers eclipse rivals|url=http://www.lvrj.com/lvrj_home/2001/May-15-Tue-2001/business/16096051.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=May 15, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812080253/http://www.lvrj.com/lvrj_home/2001/May-15-Tue-2001/business/16096051.html|archivedate=August 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart Simpson, the senior vice president of development for the project, said at the start of construction, "Most of these projects, they have a concept, they option for a piece of land and go out and start explaining it.

The project was to be built in phases, with construction planned to begin at the end of 2005, and the first phase being potentially completed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kulin|first=Dan|title=LV Council OKs condo complex|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/jun/02/lv-council-oks-condo-complex/|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=June 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was ultimately cancelled due to further opposition from nearby residents.

===Aqua Blue===
By December 2004, the newly created high-rise development division of Prudential Americana Group Realtors was planning Aqua Blue, a luxury condominium-hotel project.

Aqua Blue would have included a {{convert|12000|sqft|abbr=on}} casino that would be operated by Gary Ellis, who owned the Ellis Island.

The project was to be located near the southern entrance to [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area]].

===Charlie Palmer Hotel===
{{Main|Charlie Palmer Hotel}}
The Charlie Palmer Hotel was announced by chef [[Charlie Palmer (chef)|Charlie Palmer]] in April 2006. The project was to include a 35-story [[boutique hotel|boutique]] condo hotel with 400 to 500 rooms, and initially was to be built on the three-acre site of the Golden Palm Hotel, at the intersection of Tropicana Avenue and [[Dean Martin]] Drive. The $400 million project was scheduled to break ground later in 2006, with completion expected for mid-2008.&lt;ref name=April2006&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=New condo-hotel proposed: Celebrity chef plans $400 million project|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Apr-07-Fri-2006/business/6743185.html|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=April 7, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408154120/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Apr-07-Fri-2006/business/6743185.html|archivedate=April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's proposed location was later changed to [[Symphony Park]] in downtown Las Vegas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Park (61 acres)|url=http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/61acres.htm|publisher=VegasTodayAndTomorrow.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519013800/http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/61acres.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the condominium aspect removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toplikar|first=Dave|title=Developer: Charlie Palmer hotel planned for downtown Las Vegas still on hold|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2011/mar/02/developer-charlie-palmer-hotel-still-hold/|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=March 2, 2011|quote=He said his plans no longer include any condominiums for sale in the hotel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cielo Vista===
In March 2005, the Seattle-based Northwest Resource Management Group filed plans with the city of Las Vegas for Cielo Vista, a 25-story condominium tower with 414 units, as well as {{convert|32000|sqft|abbr=on}} of commercial space on the first floor. Above the first floor would be six floors used for parking, and 18 floors for condominium units. The project was designed by Las Vegas-based MWT Ofra, and was scheduled for a vote by the Las Vegas Planning Commission and the City Council in May and June 2005, respectively.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr1-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cielo/&gt;

Cielo Vista would have been the company's first Las Vegas project. The company had previously developed single-family residential homes in California, as well as an 11-story building in Seattle. Cielo Vista was to be built at the southeast corner of East Washington Avenue and Veterans Memorial Drive, west of [[Cashman Field]] and north of downtown Las Vegas, on a 2.8-acre site that the company purchased for $1.2 million on March 29, 2005.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr1-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cielo/&gt; A local expert believed that the project was in a bad location: an older part of Las Vegas with little development.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr1-2005/&gt; The area was also known for a high rate of crime and homelessness; Steve Hartley, a partner for Northwest Resource Management Group, said the company had previously developed a project in California that had similar demographics.&lt;ref name=Cielo/&gt;

The low price of the land allowed the company to sell condominium units ranging from {{convert|1000|sqft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2000|sqft|abbr=on}} at a starting price of $295,000, and exceeding $500,000. Condominium units in the project could be reserved for a refundable fee of $5,000, compared to a $25,000 fee that was being charged by some other high-rise condominium projects in the city. Construction was expected to begin in late 2005, as long as the project received approval from the city. Completion was expected by early 2007.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr1-2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubinski|first=Jennifer|title=Developer plans condos in high-risk area near downtown|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/apr/01/developer-plans-condos-in-high-risk-area-near-down/|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=April 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cielo&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Another LV high-rise in the works|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-06-Wed-2005/business/1030424.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=April 6, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907073924/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-06-Wed-2005/business/1030424.html|archivedate=September 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project received unanimous approval from the Las Vegas Planning Commission in June 2005. At the time, 155 units had been reserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Work continues at Centennial Plaza shopping center|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jun-06-Mon-2005/business/1979513.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=June 6, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051213074526/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jun-06-Mon-2005/business/1979513.html|archivedate=December 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months after the announcement of Cielo Vista, Northwest Resource suspended sales and delayed the project because of rising construction costs, choosing instead to wait until it was further along in the construction cost process before beginning sales; 300 units had been reserved up to that point, and some buyers received a refund. As final construction costs were being determined in March 2006, Eric Radovich, Northwest Resource's managing director of public relations and marketing, said, "We're getting close to a number and we think it's real. We didn't feel we could tell people truthfully what the product was going to cost and whether we can afford to build it."&lt;ref name=bide&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=High-rise builders bide their time, wait their turn; Failures of quick-to-market projects have developers delaying sales|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Mar-12-Sun-2006/business/6108360.html|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=March 12, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910003557/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Mar-12-Sun-2006/business/6108360.html|archivedate=September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project never materialized.&lt;ref name=SelloutNewport&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Sellout of Newport Lofts condo project seen as positive sign for area|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/sellout-newport-lofts-condo-project-seen-positive-sign-area|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of right now, we have no competition in the locals affordable market. A lot of guys are doing luxury."&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Club/&gt;

The project would include {{convert|20000|sqft|abbr=on}} of retail space, located on the first floor.&lt;ref name=LVS-Club/&gt; Other amenities on the lower floors were to include restaurants, a food market, child day care, and dry cleaners.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Club/&gt; An additional {{convert|78000|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space would be located on the 13th and 14th floors, with condominium units beginning on floor 15. The top two floors, 58 and 59, were to include a private club and fitness center. The project was planned for the southeast corner of Casino Center Boulevard and Bonneville Street in downtown Las Vegas. Presale reservations were expected to begin in March 2005.&lt;ref name=LVS-Club/&gt; At the time of its announcement, the project was reported to cost $400 million to construct.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Club&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Developer plans condominium project for locals|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jan-31-Mon-2005/business/25760479.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=January 31, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215155216/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jan-31-Mon-2005/business/25760479.html|archivedate=December 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost was later reported as being $250 million.&lt;ref name=Club-Feb15/&gt;

As of February 2006, the cottages remained on the site, with little progress on Club Renaissance. Gilles Pageau, a Canadian developer and the uncle of Philippe Pageau-Goyette, said he had invested $60 million of his money into the project and that he had been offered an additional $400 million from various banks to cover the construction costs. Pageau said at the time that the project would still be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Club Renaissance will get built, developer vows|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Feb-13-Mon-2006/business/5772051.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=February 13, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216044725/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Feb-13-Mon-2006/business/5772051.html|archivedate=February 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Goodman gave the developers two weeks to demonstrate to the Las Vegas City Council that the project was nearing construction; otherwise, he said the approval for the project would be revoked. Leanord Mussina, a spokesman for the project, had told the City Council, "We're just a victim of construction costs. Financing has dried up to a large extent for Las Vegas. We're redesigning, trying to value engineer, to do something affordable. We're in negotiations with some large construction companies to joint venture at this point, because that's the only way to finance it." Mussina estimated that the project could take up to a year before construction started, to which Goodman responded, "I'm not interested in a year. I've been to three groundbreakings there so far and haven't seen ground broke." Approximately $8 million or $9 million had already been spent on the project up to that point.&lt;ref name=LVS-Feb11-2007&gt;{{cite news|last=McGrath Schwartz|first=David|title=Council pressures downtown builders|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Feb-11-Sun-2007/news/12515962.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=February 11, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404174743/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Feb-11-Sun-2007/news/12515962.html|archivedate=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2005, the project had been redesigned after Lorenzo Doumani, developer of the adjacent [[#Majestic Las Vegas|Majestic Las Vegas]], raised concerns about the Icon blocking views for tenants at the Majestic, among other issues.

In January 2006, Related announced the cancellation of Icon despite that buyers had signed contracts for most of the project's 514 units.

===Krystle Sands===
On April 1, 2004, reservations opened for floors 4 to 38 of a 45-story, 510-foot condominium-hotel tower known as Krystle Sands. The project was officially announced in May 2004 by F.W. "Freddie" Schinz, a Florida developer.&lt;ref name=LVS-May7-2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Office building going up in Southern Highlands|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/May-10-Mon-2004/business/23817328.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=May 10, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121122328/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/May-10-Mon-2004/business/23817328.html|archivedate=January 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Krystle Sands project was to replace the 105-room [[Algiers Hotel]], located on a 3.6-acre site on the Las Vegas Strip, adjacent to the [[#Turnberry Place|Turnberry Place]] complex and to the former site of the [[El Rancho Hotel and Casino]]. At the time of the announcement, 70 percent of the project's 600 units had been reserved.&lt;ref name=LVS-May7-2004/&gt;

Units would range from {{convert|852|sqft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1329|sqft|abbr=on}}, and would range in price from $400,000 to more than $700,000. Although the tower was to be 45 stories high, it would skip the 13th floor.&lt;ref name=LVS-May7-2004/&gt; The tower's penthouses, starting at $1 million,&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Mar23-2005/&gt; would be located from floors 39 to 44, and would range from {{convert|2400|sqft|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|3000|sqft|abbr=on}}. Restaurants and retail were planned for the tower's first and second floors. The third floor was to consist of a recreation center and pool for condominium owners and renters. A rooftop restaurant was also planned. JMA Architecture Studios was the architect. Perini Construction Company was to be the general contractor. Krystle Sands was to cost $400 million,&lt;ref name=LVS-May7-2004/&gt; and was to begin construction in October 2004,&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Mar24-2005/&gt; with an opening in summer 2006.&lt;ref name=LVS-May7-2004&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubinski|first=Jennifer|title=Algiers deal to make way for condo project on Strip|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/may/07/algiers-deal-to-make-way-for-condo-project-on-stri/|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=May 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schinz paid more than $26.2 million for the land, and closed on the deal in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubinski|first=Jennifer|title=Trump in new LV condo deal|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2004/jul/30/trump-in-new-lv-condo-deal/|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=July 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was to be handled by Krystle Sands LLC, a limited liability company formed by Schinz in Florida. The company name was later changed to Krystle Towers LLC.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr4-2005/&gt; In March 2005, Schinz sold Krystle Towers LLC and the property for $97 million to Turnberry Associates, which owned the Turnberry Place complex and the former land of the El Rancho.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Mar23-2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Valley high-rise project 'dead in the water'|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Mar-23-Wed-2005/business/925100.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=March 23, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324204727/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Mar-23-Wed-2005/business/925100.html|archivedate=March 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Mar24-2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Turnberry confirms land buy|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Mar-24-Thu-2005/business/937009.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=March 24, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051213052140/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Mar-24-Thu-2005/business/937009.html|archivedate=December 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/mar/23/business-briefs-for-march-23-2005/|title=Business briefs for March 23, 2005|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=March 23, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr4-2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubinski|first=Jennifer|title=Cancellation of condo project spurs lawsuits|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/apr/04/cancellation-of-condo-project-spurs-lawsuits/|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=April 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid paying a [[real estate transfer tax]], Turnberry purchased the Krystle Sands project in addition to the property on which it was to be built.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Jun3-2006/&gt; Turnberry announced the cancellation of Krystle Sands to buyers in a letter on March 25, 2005, stating that it was unable to receive construction financing to build the project.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr4-2005/&gt;

Shortly after the cancellation was announced, some buyers of the project's condominium units filed five lawsuits against Schinz, Krystle Sands LLC, Krystle Towers LLC, and Fidelity National Title Agency of Nevada. One lawsuit sought class-action status. Each lawsuit alleged that Schinz never planned to build the tower and was in the process of seeking a buyer for the property while selling the project's 600 units, in an alleged attempt to make what would ultimately become a $70 million profit. Other claims in the lawsuits included allegations of fraud, deceptive trade practices and civil conspiracy. Plaintiffs sought at least $70 million in damages, as well as the return of escrow money to the buyers. One lawsuit alleged that Turnberry had made false statements regarding its reason for cancelling Krystle Sands, noting that four days earlier, Turnberry had announced that it received construction financing for a separate 636-unit tower at its Turnberry Place complex.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr4-2005/&gt;

A class action lawsuit consisting of 150 buyers was underway by June 2006, alleging that Turnberry had an obligation to provide condominium units to buyers who signed purchase and sale agreements and placed 10 percent of the purchase price in escrow. Turnberry stated that all deposits made on Krystle Sands units had been returned and that the company had no intention of building the project. A lawyer representing the group alleged that Turnberry lied to buyers about being unable to obtain construction financing for Krystle Sands as part of an attempt to build the [[#Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas|Fontainebleau resort]] on the property: "They had to figure a way to lie to buyers and not tell the truth that they're going to jettison the project to build Fountainbleu [sic]." The case was expected to go to trial in March 2007.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Jun3-2006&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Krystal Sands buyers file lawsuit over failed project|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jun-03-Sat-2006/business/7758674.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=June 3, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629140633/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jun-03-Sat-2006/business/7758674.html|archivedate=June 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Vegas Plaza was planned as a multibillion-dollar resort on the site of the demolished New Frontier hotel and casino. The project was to include 2,600 condominium units.

Scandia and The Congress Group agreed to delay the initial escrow closing date of May 2005, so that final costs for the new project could be completed. As part of the agreement, the Scandia fun center would remain open through the summer, its busiest period, before its scheduled closing date on September 6, 2005.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Mar26-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=LVS-Mar28-2005/&gt;

At the time of the announcement, the property was in the process of being sold by Highrise Partners to The Congress Group for an undisclosed amount of money, with escrow expected to close in September 2005. Groundbreaking was expected to occur in the first quarter of 2006, with the first units available for occupancy in spring 2008. Opus Las Vegas would have featured 1,400 parking spaces spread across four levels, along with {{convert|20000|sqft|abbr=on}} of residential retail stores. A {{convert|3|acre|abbr=on}} pool would be located on the property's six-story deck.

The Falconi Honda dealership was demolished in July 2007, to make room for the new project.

By the time of demolition, [[Marnell Corrao Associates]] had been chosen as the new general contractor. Groundbreaking was scheduled for later in 2007, with the opening planned for spring 2010. Approximately 2,000 construction jobs would be created by the project, which would ultimately employee 500 people upon opening.

In January 2008, Green Cable LLC filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Pinnacle condominium buyers. Green Cable sued the development team for an alleged breach of contract, as construction had yet to begin after three years. The lawsuit stated that buyers initially purchased units with the belief that Pinnacle would be opened by August 2008, and sought at least $5 million in returned deposits, damages and attorney's fees.

Sam Schwartz, a principal for Green Cable, said, "Generally, we believe Pinnacle is an excellent project.

===Rocker Tower===
In 1995, Thomas Greenough relocated his bar and restaurant, Tommy Rocker's, to Dean Martin Drive, west of Interstate 15 and the Las Vegas Strip. In 2004, Greenough began receiving numerous offers from condominium developers for the one-acre lot that Tommy Rocker's occupied. Greenough, who was unable to work out a deal with potential developers that would incorporate Tommy Rocker's into any planned condominiums, later chose to build his own condominium on the property. In January 2006, Greenough received approval for a 46-story, 252-unit condominium tower, to be constructed on his property at a cost of $150 million.&lt;ref name=Rockers-LVRJ/&gt; The structure was to be named Rocker Tower.&lt;ref name=Rocker/&gt;

The tower was expected to be the first in southern Nevada to feature a computerized [[Automated parking system|automated parking structure]], with the intention of saving space and decreasing pollution.&lt;ref name=Rockers-LVRJ/&gt; Greenough had toured [[Vienna|Viennese]] parking garages as part of his research into automated-garage technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Katsilometes|first=John|title=Cover-up at Tommy Rocker's returns the notorious club to former form|url=https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2009/oct/05/coverup-tommy-rockers-returns-club-former-form/|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenough hoped that the building would be certified by the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Green Building Rating System.&lt;ref name=Rockers-LVRJ/&gt; Construction was expected to begin approximately one year later,&lt;ref name=Rockers-LVRJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Packer|first=Adrienne|title=Tommy Rocker joins condo craze: 46-story tower planned for site of sing-along club|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jan-05-Thu-2006/business/5208193.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=January 5, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110041721/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jan-05-Thu-2006/business/5208193.html|archivedate=January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; with completion expected in summer 2008.&lt;ref name=Rocker&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocker Tower|url=http://www.4275deanmartindrive.com/|website=4275DeanMartinDrive.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328153830/http://www.4275deanmartindrive.com/|archivedate=March 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2006, construction was scheduled to begin in fall 2007, with completion scheduled for January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocker Tower|url=http://www.4275deanmartindrive.com/|website=4275DeanMartinDrive.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621161056/http://www.4275deanmartindrive.com/|archivedate=June 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2007, Greenough had shelved his plans to build the condominium due to increasing labor and material costs in the Las Vegas Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Katsilometes|first=John|title=John Katsilometes on what might be the next phase of Tommy Rocker's Cantina (Hint: Think topless)|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2007/jan/18/john-katsilometes-on-what-might-be-the-next-phase-/|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of film [[filmmaking]]''', [[film distribution]] companies. A [[production company]] may specialize in producing their in-house films or own subsidiary development companies. Major production companies often distribute films from independent production companies. This list includes both active and no longer active (defunct) companies. Active production companies are either run by themselves or as a subsidiary.

[[Film studio]]s also create [[television program]]s for [[broadcast syndication]].

[[File:BreyersVintage.jpg|thumb|Breyer model horses]]
'''Model horses''' are scale [[replicas]] of real [[horse]]s. They originated simultaneously—but independently—in the USA, Canada, and the UK, followed later by Sweden (UK-influenced), Germany (US-influenced), Australia. They encompass a wide variety of [[fanbase]] activities, from those who simply like to collect, to those who enthusiastically show their models at model horse shows. Unlike [[model cars]] or [[rail transport modeling|trains]], model horse collectibles do not need to be assembled from kits, although they can be altered to the collector's liking.

==Brand History==

The earliest popular brands of mass-produced model horses in the UK and the USA strongly influenced the collecting and showing trends in these two countries - the latex-bodied and haired Julips in the UK, and the injection moulded, hard plastic Breyers in the USA.

===UK Brands=== 
Model horses have long been popular toys, mainly as mounts for soldiers or figures for model farms - essentially accessories for action figures. In 1920 [[Britains (toy brand)|Britains Ltd]] became one of the first companies to mass produce these types of figures. Over the years their range of equine figures expanded though they remained generic action figures; [[Roy Selwyn-Smith]] created some very detailed 54 mm ('mini') horses for Britains Ltd.

[[Julip Horses Ltd]], in 1947, created the first mass produced, stand-alone equine figures. Originally, Julips were stuffed soft toys in the tradition of companies such as Edith Reynolds, but later switched to hand-casting in latex (Julip Originals). Other companies such as Isis, Pegasus, and Otway, soon released their own lines of latex composition (the forerunner of resin) equines. Pamela du Boulay took the latex models to the next level with the creation of Rydal models in 1969 - highly accurate, airbrushed sculptures, each an artist original. 

In 2008 Helen and Alice Moore launched a line of detailed latex models, the Equorum Model Horse Stud. Hobby artist Donna Chaney, known for her porcelain figures, introduced a small number of latex equine molds known as RubberNedz in 2015.

Many toy companies produce plastic equine figures as companions or accessories and a few of these have dedicated equine lines. One of these earlier companies was Dream Ponies, a product of Swallow Horsetoys. In 1971, they released a small range of [[Injection moulding|injection moulded]] plastic equine models and accessories; Dream Ponies was later sold and re-launched as Magpie Models. Other brands with a significant following includes My Beautiful Horses by Vivid Imaginations; Plastech, manufactures of Thelwell Pony figures; and Sindy, a British version of Barbie which included a variety of horses in their product line. 

In 2015 Utterly Horses, the largest model horse distributor in the UK, announced the creation of a new model horse company, CopperFox Model Horses. The mission of this new enterprise is to produce accurate and high quality examples of British breeds which are underrepresented in the plastic arena dominated by USA-based companies.

Ceramic horses are also popular, though more fragile collectibles. Companies such as Beswick, Border Fine Arts (ceramic and resin), Alchemy Ceramics – later purchased by Animal Artistry, Melba Ware and many others offer a variety of equine figures.

===USA Brands===

In the late 1940s - early 1950s, Hartland Collectibles and [[Breyer Animal Creations]] (now a division of Reeves International) began producing realistic injection moulded plastic model horses. Both companies' first models were standing western horses next to or over a clock. 

Most of Breyer's original horses, dogs and cattle were sculpted by Chris Hess, though many artists have contributed to create a wide variety of breeds and poses. Breyer Animal Creations hosts BreyerFest, a weekend-long celebration of the product every year at the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Breyer Horses traditionally come in five scales, from largest to smallest: Traditional (1:9), Classic (1:12), Little Bit/Paddock Pal (1:24), Stablemate (1:32), and Mini Whinny (1:64). A 1:6 scale model was added in 2014, though it is unknown whether this scale group will be expanded and given a name. In addition to their fully hard plastic line, Breyer also produces haired 'toy' models, soft toys, ceramic and resin models, books, ornaments, and craft kits.

Hartland Collectibles changed ownership many times throughout their history and suffered devastating flooding in 1986 and 1994 which damaged product and machinery. The latest purchase took place in 2001 and production ceased again around 2008.

In the mid-1990s, Peter Stone, son of Sam Stone who originally helped create Breyer Animal Creations, worked for Breyer most of his life but eventually parted ways and started his own company. Stone Horses are known for a handful of molds released in a wide range of special, limited edition runs and collectible decorator colors, as well as turning a popular Quarter Horse resin by Carol Williams into plastic. Today Stone and Breyer horses are the top two popular plastic model horse brands.

Companies such Grand Champion, Blue Ribbon, Creata, and many others produce some form of model horse, but these are generally considered too toy-like to be of major interest to collectors.

[[Hagen-Renaker]] is a California-based company which produces model horse figures. These figures are highly collectible and a number of the molds were leased by Breyer for production in plastic.

===Artist Resins===

Limited edition artist resins (usually original sculptures rather than customs), first began to appear in the 1980s. The very first were castings taken from customized Breyers, issued by Black Horse Ranch owned by the late Karen Grimm. Carol William's famous "Quarter Horse 1" or "RRQH1" ("RR" for "Rio Rondo", the name of Williams' modeling enterprise) was one of the first to be cast from an original sculpture. 

Resin models - high-quality castings of an original artist's sculpture - are typically sold unpainted, ready to finish by the customer. They took the hobby by storm in the 1990s, and are very popular and much-sought after today. A resin can be an affordable way to own a favorite artist's work, with the price dependent on the rarity of the piece. Some resins are released in highly limited editions of 50 pieces or less. Such models sell out rapidly, and might be resold with higher secondary-market prices.

==Brief history==

In the late 1960s, UK collectors came together through PONY magazine, and several clubs and newsletters were born, the most important being The Postal Pony Club. From this was created the Lindfield Model Showing Association and later Model Horse News (MHN), a bi-monthly magazine which ran until 1989. In 1979 The International Arabist magazine appeared, which though restricted to Arab horses and their descendants, was the first magazine to actively seek to unite hobbyists from around the world. While MHN remained largely in the original tradition of Julips, etc., TIA promoted realism through custom Breyers. TIA changed its name to Model Horse International (MHI) to reflect its move away from purely Arabian interest, but the magazine folded around 1989. MHN also folded around this time, but was replaced by Model Horses Unlimited (MHU) catering for both realistic and more traditional models, and which is still in existence today.

During the 1960s, hobbyists such as Ellen Hitchins, Simone Smiljanic, and Marney Walerius began to organize photo shows. One of the earliest known clubs was the IMHA, or International Model Horse Association, which was run by Hitchins and Smiljanic. Many young hobbyists got their start after reading a short article about model horse collecting, which was published in the March 1969 issue of [[Western Horseman]] magazine. In the 1970s, US model horse collectors decided that their horses should be doing something else than just sitting on a shelf. They began to seek each other out, and early model horse magazines such as Breyer's ''Just About Horses'' and ''Model Horse Showers Journal'' were the means for collectors to socialize. Realism became the goal and the hobby grew a larger fanbase. With more techniques being shared, the shift in realism became more apparent. For example, an early bridle might have been made out of string. Today it would be made from leather, and include actual miniature bits.

Clubs also formed as an outlet for collectors. Most clubs are devoted to particular breeds, performance activities (such as racing, eventing etc.) or regions, and just like real horse clubs, there are year-end awards, club events, point programs and newsletters for members.

==Model horse activities==

===Collecting===
Due to the vast amount of model horses available, some hobbyists collect only one kind of breed, scale or particular mold. Most model horses are in the 1:9 scale, while others are no bigger than mice. Usually a model is released in a particular color for a number of years or a limited run. The model horse company may decide to make portrait models of famous horses as well, such as [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] and [[Man o' War (horse)|Man o' War]]. Having a collection of several color versions of one mold is referred to as a "conga line". Hobbyists simply collect what they like, and others may collect in hopes of selling at a profit later on. There is no guarantee that models will increase in value over time. Since the advent of [[eBay]], comparing prices has become much easier, so prices have fallen. Buyers can now purchase a horse for much less than what it was originally bought.

While the original scope of collecting may have focused on plastic horses, they may now be made of resin or ceramic. Common brands are: [[Breyer Horses]], [[Paradise Horses]], [[Stone Horses]], [[Hagen-Renaker]], Royal Doulton, North Light, Grand Champion and Schleich. While most model horses are sold as toys, some, like resins, are delicate, much more expensive and are not made for children. Common plastic model horses may be bought from toy stores, tack shops, authorized dealers or other collectors. Prices range from a few dollars to many thousands for an artist resin.

Some hobbyists also collect Model Horse catalogs, magazines and promotional items.

===Customizing===
[[File:Custom Painted Hagen-Renaker.jpg|right|thumb|Custom repaint of a Hagen-Renaker Mini Shetland Pony Mare (circa 2005). Acrylics and pastels on ceramic.]]

Not content with factory produced models, hobbyists took to remaking factory-made models by adding hair, removing tails or altering the position or color. Many of these early customs are considered crude by today's standards. These early models often had fake fur manes and tails, or were painted with spray paint and even [[permanent markers]]. Legs were moved by heating plastic with hair dryers or candles.

However, in the late 1970s, British artists finally gained access to Breyers (which were not then commercially available in the UK), and began to rework them using more sophisticated techniques in a deliberate attempt to replicate the realism of the du Boulay Rydals. This comprised the use of airbrushes, fine mohair tops and epoxy putty for re-sculpting. Today these techniques and the term "customizing" have been adopted worldwide to become effectively hobby standard. 

[[Acrylic paint|Acrylics]] (brushed or air-brushed), [[oil paint]]s, brushed-on [[pastel]] dust, and etching away the original finish paint with an x-acto knife are all common materials and methods for altering the appearance of a model. [[Coloured pencils]], [[watercolour]] (pencil and paint), and even [[ink]] are sometimes used as well. The preference for sculpted or hair manes and tails goes in and out of vogue and can vary by region as well. [[Mohair]] is generally used, though some artists use glue-coated embroidery thread to great effect creating something between a sculpted and haired appearance.

Many sculpting pastes have been used over the years with varying levels of success and durability. [[Wood putty]] and [[plumber's putty|plumber's epoxy]] was most commonly used in the beginning, but now new epoxy-type products are available which have been designed for artistic use. Products such as Apoxie Sculpt and Gapoxio have longer drying times, a finer texture, and more flexibility than the earlier sculpting materials.

Customized models can range from simple repaints of an otherwise unaltered model to those which have been so thoroughly manipulated and re-sculpted as to make the original form totally unrecognizable. Many artists make their living from customizing models, with certain artists widely sought after.

===Showing the model horse===
{{Main article|Model horse showing}}
Model horse showing has two ways in which to participate - photo showing (online or postal) and live showing. Photo showing is convenient for people who aren't able to travel or don't live near other collectors. Showholders publish a classlist and
invite people to enter for a nominal fee. The shower then takes photos of their horse, usually against a background. On the back of the photo, the horse's vitals are recorded along with the shower's address. A piece of tape is also placed on the back, on which the shower writes down the numbers of the classes in which the horse will be entered. Once the showholder receives all the entries, They are sorted by class numbers and begin judging. A showholder may place a horse based on quality of photo, accuracy of breed depiction, and condition. Usually championships and reserves are offered as well. Sometimes ribbons or small prizes are sent to the show entrants along with the returned photographs and show results.  More recently, photo shows posted on the Internet have eliminated the cost of postage and long wait for returns.

Live showing is much different. Here again the showholder publishes a classlist and invites other showers to attend. The show is usually held in a large space such as a hotel or arena, and entrants travel in person to attend.  Each shower usually gets a table to use as a "home base" in the show hall. The "rings" are tables with ring numbers, where showers place their horses as classes are called.  Live shows classlists are usually divided between original finish and customized models, and some also have separate divisions for china figurines, artist resins, and very-rare original finish.  Live shows frequently have multiple judges and judge several classes at once to accommodate the long classlists.  As in photo showing, judges consider condition and breed correctness. Live shows may also include collectibility classes, or may judge breed classes simultaneously for collectibility as well, in which models are thereby evaluated on the bases of rarity and condition, verses breed correctness. Any profits from the shows are often donated to animal-related charities.

If a shower belongs to a club, they may record points earned from their horses' placings for year-end awards.  There are many clubs that hold periodic—often monthly—photo or online shows that allow members the opportunity to earn points for their horses that may be applied to end-of-the-year and cumulative awards.

NAN cards are also sought after. These pink and green cards allow a particular horse to enter the North American Nationals (NAN), a yearly show organized by the North American Model Horse Show Association (NAMHSA). The show and the qualification cards carry a lot of prestige in the hobby world - a model which is "NAN qualified" goes up in value. In the UK the Model Equine Championships (MECs) have a similar concept to NAN and have been running since 1998.

Postal showing was the original method of showing, where a horse's details were sent to a judge and places were awarded by rolling dice. Now postal showing is more usually the preserve of performance disciplines such as racing or dressage, and the model events often mirror real events. Places may be awarded by pairing a model with a real participant whose luck it shares, or in the case of racing, with reference to a sophisticated handicapping system.

===Props and Tack===

Hobbyists also use props, tack and riders. It is important that props and tack are in scale to the model for added realism.

Props are anything which might enhance a scene, such as dogs, jumps, trees, trail elements, backgrounds and fences. Some classes such as jumping, roping, and trail require the use of props.

Dolls range from pre-packaged jointed dolls, to one-of-a-kind creations by skilled dollmakers. They currently are optional for performance showing in the United States, elsewhere, however, they are required.

Hobby tack covers the entire range of real horse tack, from numnahs to full saddle sets; from simple barn halters to extravagant multiple horse harness hitches; and from stable blankets to hand-stitched Arabian horse costumes. They are made out of a variety of materials such as leather hide, leather lace, satin and grosgrain ribbon, jewelry chain, and various fabrics. Hardware can be made by hand out of wire, or cast metal such as pewter and white bronze. Much research goes into making high-quality tack, with some tack makers accumulating reference libraries of online image folders and books. Tack can be made from scratch, or using kits. Knowledge of leather stamping, carving, dying, and sewing are all skills the model horse tackmaker uses in his or her craft.

===Pedigreeing===

In the pursuit of realism, many hobbyists also research and give their models [[Breed registry|pedigrees]] and names. Pedigree assignment—commonly abbreviated "PA"—is a way to learn about different breeds and creating [[Offspring|progeny]]. Some pedigrees are researched from real horses or other models. Model horse breeders may offer their horse's parentage for a nominal fee and usually issue a certificate to the [[foal]]'s owner.  Some clubs keep records of real mares and their open years for members who want to make sure that the model they PA from living parents does not have the same [[Mother|dam]] and foaling year as a model belonging to another member.  In keeping with the hobby's attempt to maintain realism, collectors assigning pedigrees to models usually try to use only years that a real mare did not have a foal, or, in the case of scarce breeds, a year that she had a foal that was gelded (and thus could not reproduce).

The '''Mooghaun North Hoard''' or ''Great Clare Find'' is the name of an important Bronze Age hoard found at [[Mooghaun]] North, near Newmarket-on-Fergus in [[County Clare]], Ireland. Considered one of the greatest [[Bronze Age]] hoards of gold ever found north of the Alps, unfortunately most of the treasure was melted down soon after its discovery. What remains of the hoard is currently split between the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin and the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/info/objectsandtechniques.aspx National Museum of Ireland website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=5133&amp;plaA=5133-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; It is no. 11 in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''.

==Discovery==
In March 1854, some workers building the [[West Clare Railway]] near [[Newmarket-on-Fergus]] were realigning a [[ditch|dyke]] near [[Mooghaun]] Lake, when they accidentally uncovered a huge cache of gold jewellery from the Bronze Age. While shifting a stone they brought to light a large cavity in the ground where the treasure was kept.  Most of the precious objects were sold to local dealers who melted them down for their [[bullion]] value and only 29 out of a total of over 150 objects survived. Most of the British Museum's share of the find was purchased from [[William Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen|William Willoughby Cole]], 3rd Earl of Enniskillen in 1857.

==Description==
When discovered, the Mooghaun North Hoard was one of the largest Bronze Age treasures ever found in Northern or Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|13}}  It consisted of over 150 gold objects including 138 bracelets, six collars, two [[torc]]s and several other items which in total weighed over 5&amp;nbsp;kg. Just 29 objects survived the melting pot - 15 in the [[National Museum of Ireland|National Museum]] and 14 in the [[British Museum]]. The extant items of jewellery from the hoard are mostly crescent-shaped bracelets (23) and six neck collars. Fortunately many pieces from the hoard were copied before they were destroyed. Archaeologists are unsure why the hoard was deposited in the stone chamber - it may have been for safe-keeping during a local crisis or was perhaps a [[votive offering]] to the gods.

Recent research indicates that much of the gold used in the creation of these pieces came from the [[Mourne Mountains]] in County Down.&lt;ref name="Arch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carthy|first=Hugh|title=Burren Archaeology|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848891050|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}

The '''Musical Arts Conference''' or '''MAC''' is a local circuit for [[marching band]] competitions, based in [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Massachusetts]].  The conference was formed in 2001.  Band class is arranged by the total number of instrumentalists (band proper, pit and percussion) and drum majors.  The color guard is not included in the total number of performers (only for classification purposes). The smallest bands are assigned to Class 1 and the largest bands are assigned to Class 5, with a rubric to determine each class size.

In addition to marching band, MAC also hosts winter guard and winter percussion competitions.  There are several classifications in both guard and percussion, which is broken up by the ability and talent of the units, and not by size.

'''''Negro Life at the South''''' (1859) is a painting by American artist [[Eastman Johnson]] that depicts the private life of African-American slaves in Washington, DC. It was painted in [[Washington, D.C.]] and is now owned by the [[New-York Historical Society]].&lt;ref name=NYHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Negro Life at the South|url=http://www.nyhistory.org/node/44213|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=15 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208174041/http://www.nyhistory.org/node/44213|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ejh"/&gt;

==The painting==
''Negro Life at the South'' is considered Johnson's masterpiece, and it gained attention at its first exhibit among more than 800 works at the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York City in 1859. There were numerous accounts in newspapers. The first review noted the painting was set in Washington, DC, but it soon became popularly known as ''[[My Old Kentucky Home|Old Kentucky Home]]'', after ''Home Journal'' used this title in a feature article about it.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; Subsequent coverage mostly overlooked that Johnson's painting was of an urban "back street" scene from [[Washington, D.C.]], believed to be next to the home of Johnson's father.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYHS/&gt;

The painting is a domestic scene behind a dilapidated house; to the right is a house in better condition. On the left in the foreground is a young couple courting, of which the woman is light-skinned; in the middle, a banjo player makes music while a boy watches, and an adult woman dances with a child, as others look on. At the right edge, a young white woman in a refined white dress is stepping over a threshold into "black life in the interior of a city block."&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3051254 John Davis, "Eastman Johnson's Negro Life at the South and Urban Slavery in Washington, D.C."], ''Art Bulletin,'' March 1998, at JSTOR, accessed 26 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Behind her is another black figure. The white woman may represent Johnson's sister.&lt;ref name=NYHS/&gt;

An adult black woman looks out an upstairs window as she steadies a small mixed race child sitting on the partially collapsed roof. The darkest skin belongs to the woman dancing with the child in the middle foreground. The skin color variations, with nearly each individual shown as a different "person of color", reflected African-American society, but may also have been intended to invite the viewer to contemplate the mixed racial ancestry of those portrayed.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt; Several elements hint at or symbolize relations to an unseen, wealthier white male - the mulatto children, the ladder from the Negro quarters leaning against a larger house next door (although not near any door or window) and, symbolically, the rooster high in the tree near the taller house and hen on the Negroes' house roof. and the white cat, a tomcat perhaps, crawling in the bedroom window.&lt;ref name=ejh/&gt;

Its seemingly contradictory elements have implications that have been interpreted at length.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Hills. "Painting Race: Eastman Johnson's Pictures of Slaves, Ex-Slaves, and Freedmen", In Teresa A. Carbone and Patricia Hills, ed., ''Eastman Johnson: painting America'', 1999, Brooklyn Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ejh/&gt; The painting was interpreted by both proponents and detractors of slavery as supporting their position. Southerners associated it with plantation life and noted that the Negroes seemed cheerful in their leisure time. Northerners might concentrate on the top half of the painting, with the dilapidated roof representing the degradation of slavery and the light-skinned woman and child suggesting a theme of [[miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ejh&gt;[[Eleanor Jones Harvey]]. 2012.

'''Passionism''' is a [[contemporary art]] movement in [[Scandinavia]], anti-avantgarde in its approach. The term was coined by art critique [[Merete Sanderhoff]] in her work ''Sorte Billeder'' [Black Pictures] &lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff (2007): Sorte Billeder&amp;nbsp;– kunst og kanon. Rævens Sorte Bibliotek.&lt;/ref&gt; as an attempt to categorise talents outside the avantgarde canon, that did not fit into any known art category. They are referred to as the black sheep of the contemporary art scene.&lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff (2007): Sorte Billeder&amp;nbsp;– kunst og kanon. Rævens Sorte Bibliotek, p. 37ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passionist artists are concerned with the continuation of pre-avantgarde painting traditions without turning into a repetition of these works. They are not simply postmodernists because they actually take the content and the techniques of these traditional paintings seriously. The content focuses on [[narratives]] of riddles, yearning, and solemnity. That does not mean they lack humour, but their paintings are meant to be taken seriously. There is a tendency to create very dark paintings hence the title ''black pictures''. Furthermore, they often comment on the [[doctrine]]s of the [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] art and art theories, moving beyond these rigid constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff. This is not a canon. Canonization and its effect on contemporary art. In Nordisk Museologi 2005/2. pp. 74-88. Abstract: ''How does canonization affect contemporary art and the definition of cultural heritage? This subject is right now topical in Denmark, where the Ministry of Culture recently issued a much debated canon of Danish culture. This article looks behind the concept of canonization and examines the structures that determine why some artists and art works are canonized, while others are disregarded. The focus of the article is a marginalized group of contemporary Danish artists, named passionists, who have deliberately chosen to oppose the prevailing standards of art production. These standards are based on the tradition of the avant-garde, which itself forms a canon within art historiography today.'' {{cite web |url=http://www.nordiskmuseologi.com/Summaries/Abstracts061.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007233653/http://www.nordiskmuseologi.com/Summaries/Abstracts061.html |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Passionism differs from the Scandinavian's in that these Passionist artists claim their art is "born independently of the will of the artist, with no pre-planning or founding concept" (www.passionism.com). This strain of Passionism was created by Cat Moss and [[metcuc]] in May 2000, and launched to the public at the Forum de Nice in 2002 (see press and radio archive footage, Nice Matin Press and Radio FR3). It further claims to be "the first French artistic movement of the 21st Century, and the first artistic movement in the history of art to be spearheaded by women and followed by artists of all types around the globe. Passionist artists include writers, painters, photographers, poets, musicians, film directors, and fashion designers" (www.passionism.com)

===Origin and History===
[[File:Pattachitra - Archaeological Activities Exhibition - Directorate of Archaeology &amp; Museums - West Bengal - Kolkata 2014-09-14 7907.JPG|thumb|Archaeological activities exhibition of [[West Bengal|Bengal]] Patachitra]]
Patachitra is known for its excellent play of colour. It is a traditional folk art form of rural Bengal. There are some controversial opinions about the dates of ancient Patas. But it has been suggested on the basis of historical themes connected with the accompanied songs like [[Patua Sangeet]]. It dates back to the Pre- Pala period  which is still tucked away with small villages of [[Midnapore]], [[Bankura]], [[Purulia]], [[Howrah]], [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]] and [[24 Parganas]]. Bengal Patachitra is referred to in the ''Buddhist literature'' in 1st century A.D., in ''Haribansha'' in 2nd century, in ''Abhigyanashakuntalam'' and ''Malavikagnimitra'' in 4th century, ''Harshacharita'' and ''Uttararamacharita'' in 6th and 7th-8th centuries respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Niranjan (1973), The Patas and Patuas of Bengal. Indian Publications Calcutta, Page number 54-55 (Annexure C,V)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book '''Folk Art of Bengal''', author ''Ajitcoomar Mookerjee''  has mentioned that there are some Jadu-Patuas painting of mural style in the temples of [[Bankura district|Bankura District]].&lt;ref&gt;Mookerjee Ajitcoomar (1939), Folk Art of Bengal. university of calcutta, Page number 18-19 (Annexure C.Vll)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular pots depicts important news events, scandals accidents etc such as bus accidents at Narayangarh, rural elections, the rationing system, family planning, evils of the dowry system etc. Every Patachitra has a song related to it, which the artists sing while unfurling the Patachitra. Singing pot in Bengal is called [[Patua Sangeet]]. Patua Sangeet or Poter Gan is a cultural tradition of the singing Bengal Patachitra. It is performed by [[Patua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bangiyo Loko-Sangeet Ratnakosh|last=Sri Ashutosh Bhattacharya|first=|publisher=Paschimbanga Loko Sanskriti Gobeshona Kendra|year=|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=1041}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is famous in the village part of [[West Bengal]] like [[Birbhum]], [[Jhargram]], [[Bardhaman]] and [[Murshidabad]] as a folk song of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chitrolekha.com/myths-and-folktales-patachitra/|title=Myths and Folktales in the Patachitra Art of Bengal: Tradition and Modernity - The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|date=2015-08-02|work=The Chitrolekha Journal on Art and Design|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of patachitra is also worshiped is [[Katwa]]. Durga Pot has a semi-circular Patachitra where Patachitra of Durga is in the middle position. Ram, Sita, Shib, Nandi-Vringi, Brahma, Vishnu, Shumbha-Nishumbha are painted on this kind of Chalchitra. [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanager]] Rajrajeshwari Durga is seen to be uniquely noticed. In the middle of the Chalchitra, there is Panchanan Shib and Parvati is beside him, on one side there is Dasha-mahabidya and the other side, there is [[Dashavatara|Dashabatar]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/state/%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%95-%E0%A6%B7%E0%A7%9F-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%AA-%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AE-%E0%A6%9D-%E0%A6%AC-%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9A-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%9A-%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%B0-1.74260|title=অবক্ষয় আর অবলুপ্তির মাঝে বাংলার চালচিত্র - Anandabazar|last=ভট্টাচার্য|first=বিভূতিসুন্দর|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technique===
The Patachitra a of different districts of [[West Bengal]] are characterized by many peculiarities in colour and design. The patachitra of [[Manbhum]], now known as [[Purulia district|Purulia]] can easily be distinguished by their preference for one particular shade of burnt sienna relieved by white and yellow patches and densely packed composition. The seated figures of [[Dasaratha]] and [[Chand Sadagar]] of [[Medinipur]] crowning the [[Ramayana]] and Kamale-Kamini scrolls are impressive and monumental.&lt;ref&gt;Craft council of west Bengal-1985-86, The Jarana Patachitra of Bengal- Mahamaya, p-112&lt;/ref&gt; In the scrolls of pot of [[Birbhum district|Birbhum]], [[Bankura district|Bankura]] and [[Burdwan district|Burdwan]] preference for Indian red background usually found, the scrolls of [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]] preferred a dark brown. The [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]] and [[Manbhum]] 'pats' are peculiar and definitely modernistic with the abstract linear treatment.&lt;ref&gt;D. P. Ghosh, FOLK ART OF BENGAL, Visvabharati, p-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
Use of natural color is one of the individual characteristics of the Bengal Patachitra. In general, blue, [[yellow]], [[green]], [[red]], [[brown]], [[black]] and [[white]] are used in the Patachitra of [[West Bengal]]. Chalk dust is used for white color, pauri for yellow color, cultivated indigo for blue, bhushakali for black and mete sindur for red color.&lt;ref&gt;http://ipindiaservices.gov.in/GI_DOC/564/564%20-%20Statement%20of%20Case%20-%2017-08-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Odisha Pattachitra ==
Pattachitra is a traditional painting of Odisha, India.&lt;ref name="odisha.gov.in"&gt;http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/November/engpdf/46-48.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are based on [[Hindu mythology]] and specially inspired by [[Jagannath]] and [[Vaishnava]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patta Chitra|url=http://www.odisha.gov.in/portal/ViewDetails.asp?vchglinkid=GL010&amp;vchplinkid=PL060&amp;vchslinkid=SL036}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All colours used in the Paintings are natural and paintings are made fully old traditional way by Chitrakaras that is Oriya Painter. Pattachitra style of painting is one of the oldest and most popular art forms of Odisha. The name Pattachitra has evolved from the Sanskrit words patta, meaning canvas, and chitra, meaning picture. Pattachitra is thus a painting done on canvas, and is manifested by rich colourful application, creative motifs and designs, and portrayal of simple themes, mostly mythological in depiction.&lt;ref&gt;http://india.gov.in/knowindia/pattachitra.php&lt;/ref&gt; The traditions of pattachitra paintings are more than thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;http://craftorissa.com/b2c/product_info.php?products_id=112{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/culture_heritage.php?id=106|title=Pattachitra Painting|publisher=archive.india.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin and History ===
The paintings of Orissa can be divided into three categories from the point of view of medium, i.e. paintings on cloth or 'Patta Chitra', paintings on walls or 'Bhitti Chitra' and palm leaf engravings or "Tala Patra Chitra' or "Pothi, Chitra'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unnatisilks.com/patachitra-introduction-indian-crafts.html|title=Crafts of India -Patachitra - Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=Unnati Silks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of all these remains more or less the same at a specific time because the then artists were commissioned to work in all these media, it is believed.

The painting the 'pattachitra' resemble the old murals of Odisha especially religious centres of [[Puri]], [[Konark]] and  [[Bhubaneshwar]] region, dating back to the 5th century BC. The best work is found in and around Puri, especially in the village of [[Raghurajpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paramparik-karigar.org/bystates/pattachitra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227115716/http://www.paramparik-karigar.org/bystates/pattachitra.html |archivedate=2011-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This old tradition of Odia painting still survives in the places like Puri, Raghurajpur, [[Paralakhemundi]], Chikiti and [[Sonepur, Odisha|Sonepur]].In the past professionerise, there was no distinct separation between the master painters and master sculptors; so the possibility of a simultaneous origin of painting and sculptural art in Odisha can not be ruled out. Even today in Odisha, these two crafts are combined in one and these artists and known as Chitrakaras, their title remains mostly Mohapatra or Maharana. Strangely enough, painting appeared in Odisha rather later, several centuries after the construction of the great temples of Bhubaneswar, Puri and Konark.here exists a good number of paintings from 18th century onwards in many temples and Mathas especially in the southern districts of Odisha. Lord Jagannath in the present from is being taken as the origin of the Patta style. The colour schemes of the deities of Puri are quite similar to those of the Patta style. The oldest record of Patta Paintings does not probably go beyond the establishment of the present shrine of Shri Jagannath at Puri. It may be due to the fact that paintings do not survive like sculptures. The paints inside the shrines of Lord Jagannath at Puri make the date probable. The oldest classical marble paintings of Sitabanji at [[Keonjhar]] do not conform to the present style of Patta painting wholly. The wooden statues of the three deities are also covered with cloth and then overlaid with glue mixed with chalk, and then given paint only with four limited colours of red, yellow, white and black. The deities who are held in high esteem by the Odias and who inspire religion, life and activity of the people also carry with them a tradition of art and painting which is as old as the deities themselves. If the Savara origin of Jagannath is accepted, the date of the Patta paintings can be dated back to an earlier period. These paintings were originally substitutes for worship on days when the temple doors were shut for the 'ritual bath' of the deity.

[[File:Patta Chitra 02.jpg|thumb|centre|600px|Pattachitra are based on [[Hindu Mythology]]. Depicted here is a parade of the god [[Ganesha]].]]

=== Theme and Style ===
The theme of Odia painting centres round the [[Jagannath]] and the [[Vaishnava]] sect. Since beginning of Pattachitra culture, Lord [[Jagannath]] who was an incarnation of Lord [[Krishna]] has been the major source of inspiration. The subject matter of Patta Chitra is mostly mythological, religious stories and [[folk lore]]. Themes are chiefly on Lord Jagannath and [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]], different "Vesas" of Shri Jagannath, [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]], temple activities, the ten incarnations of [[Vishnu]] basing on the '[[Gita Govinda]]' of [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]], Kama Kujara [[Navagunjara]], [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianart.in/indian-art-journey/patta-chitra-paintings.html|title=Indian Art  » Blog Archive   » Patta Chitra Paintings|publisher=indianart.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual paintings of gods and goddesses are also being painted.
The Pattachitra  style are mix of both folk and classical elements but leanings more towards folk forms. The dress style has [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] influences. All of the poses have been confined to a few well-defined postures. These are not free from monotonous repetitions, though at times this is necessary to accentuate the narrative character of the style. The lines are bold and clean and angular and sharp. Generally there are no landscapes, perspectives and distant views. All the incidents are seen in close juxtaposition. The background on which the figures are represented, is delineated with decorations of flowers and foliages and is mostly painted in red colour. All the paintings are given decorative borders. The whole painting is conceived in the form of a design on a given canvas.

The themes may be classified into following categories&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html categories of Pattachitra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729235958/http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |date=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technique ===
[[File:Patta Chitra 01.jpg|thumb|centre|600px|Pattachitra were inspired by [[Jagannath]] [[culture]] in Odisha]]
Traditionally the painters are known as chitrakars. A patta painter's home with all the members of family is his studio. Woman members prepare the glue, the canvas and apply colours what we call the fill-in, and give the final lacquer coating. The master hand, mostly the male member, draws the initial line and gives the final finishing.
Patta paintings are done on small strips of [[cotton]] cloth. The [[canvas]] is prepared by coating the clothe with a mixture of chalk and gum made from [[tamarind]] seeds. Then it is rubbed by taking the help of two different stones and then the cloth is dried.The mixture of gum and [[chalk]] gives the cloth's surface a leathery finish on which the artists paint with vegetable, earth and stone colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mumbaipluses.com/thaneplus/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=2&amp;contentid=201001302010020115560358832bd438&amp;sectxslt=&amp;comments=true&amp;pageno=1 The meticulous process of Pattachitra paintings]&lt;/ref&gt;
The painters do not use pencil or [[charcoal]] for the preliminary drawings. They are so expert in the line that they simply draw directly with the brush either in light red or yellow. Then the colours are filled in. The final lines are drawn and the patta is given a lacquer coating to protect it from weather, thus making the painting glossy. This process of [[(Glaze (painting technique))|glazing]] or [[varnishing]] is quite interesting. The painting is held over a fireplace so that the back of the painting is exposed to heat. On the surface of the painting fine lacquer is applied.

=== Colour ===
In the 16th century, with the emergence of [[Bhakti movement]] the paintings of Radha and Krishna were painted in vibrant shades of orange, red and yellow. There are typical scenes and figures like Krishna, Gopis, elephants, trees and other creatures are seen in these paintings. Krishna is always painted in blue and Gopis in light pink, purple or brown colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mumbaipluses.com/thaneplus/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=2&amp;contentid=201001302010020115560358832bd438&amp;sectxslt=&amp;comments=true&amp;pageno=1 Radha, Krishna and Gopis in Pattachitra]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painters use vegetable and mineral colours without going for factory made poster colours. They prepare their own colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729235958/http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |archivedate=2010-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; White colour is made from the [[conch]]-shells by powdering, [[boiling]] and [[filter (chemistry)|filtering]] in a very hazardous process. It requires a lot of patience. But this process gives brilliance and premanence to the [[hue]]. 'Hingula', a mineral colour, is used for red. 'Haritala', king of stone ingredients for yellow, 'Ramaraja' a sort of indigo for blue are being used. Pure [[Oil lamp|lamp]]-[[black]] or black prepared from the burning of [[coconut]] shells are used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html natural colours used in Pattachitra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729235958/http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |date=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no blue either cobalt or ultramarine in the earlier colour schemes. The colours used in the Patta paintings are primarily bright colours, limited to red, yellow, indigo, black and white. The brushes that are used by these 'Chitrakaras' are also indigenous and are made of hair of domestic animals. A bunch of hair tied to the end of a [[bamboo]] stick make the brush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html colour brushes used in Pattachitra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729235958/http://www.rabindraart.com/how-to-do-pattachitra.html |date=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is really a matter of wonder as to how these painters bring out lines of such precision and finish with the help of these crude brushes.

=== Palm leaf Pattachitra ===
Palm leaf pattachitra which is in Oriya language known as ''Tala Pattachitra'' drawn on palm leaf. First of all palm leaves are left for becoming hard after being taken from tree.Then these are sewn together to form like a canvas. The images are traced by using black or white ink to fill grooves etched on rows of equal-sized panels of palm leaf that are sewn together. These panels can also be easily folded like a fan and packed in a compact pile for better conservation.Often palm-leaf illustrations are more elaborated, obtaining by superimposing layers that are glued together for most of the surface, but in some areas can open like small windows to reveal a second image under the first layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jagannatha.net/painting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106124430/http://www.jagannatha.net/painting.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }} Palm leaf pattachitra&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Greek pottery''', due to its relative durability, comprises a large part of the archaeological record of [[ancient Greece]], and since there is so much of it (over 100,000 painted vases are recorded in the [[Corpus vasorum antiquorum]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvaonline.org/cva/default.htm |title=The Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum ('Corpus of Ancient Vases') is the oldest research project of the Union Académique Internationale |work=[[Corpus vasorum antiquorum]] |access-date=16 May 2016 |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |agency=[[Union Académique Internationale]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has exerted a disproportionately large influence on our understanding of [[Greek Society#Politics and society|Greek society]].  The shards of pots discarded or buried in the 1st millennium BC are still the best guide available to understand the customary life and mind of the ancient Greeks. There were several vessels produced locally for everyday and kitchen use, yet finer [[pottery]] from regions such as [[Attica]] was imported by other civilizations throughout [[History of the Mediterranean|the Mediterranean]], such as the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans in Italy]].&lt;ref name="oakley 2012 p641"&gt;John H. Oakley (2012). "Greek Art and Architecture, Classical: Classical Greek Pottery," in Neil Asher Silberman et. al. (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology, Vol 1: Ache-Hoho'', Second Edition, 641–644. Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-973578-5}}, p. 641.&lt;/ref&gt; There were various specific regional varieties, such as the [[South Italian ancient Greek pottery]].

Throughout these places, [[Typology of Greek vase shapes|various types and shapes of vases]] were used. Not all were purely utilitarian; large [[Geometric]] [[amphorae]] were used as grave markers, [[kraters]] in [[Apulia]] served as tomb offerings and [[Panathenaic Amphorae]] seem to have been looked on partly as ''objets d’art'', as were later terracotta figurines.  Some were highly decorative and meant for elite consumption and domestic beautification as much as serving a storage or other function, such as the krater with its usual use in diluting wine.
 
Earlier Greek styles of pottery, called "Aegean" rather than "Ancient Greek", include [[Minoan pottery]], very sophisticated by its final stages, [[Cycladic art#Pottery|Cycladic pottery]], [[Minyan ware]] and then [[Mycenaean pottery]] in the [[Bronze Age]], followed by the cultural disruption of the [[Greek Dark Age]]. As the culture recovered [[Sub-Mycenaean pottery]] finally blended into the [[Protogeometric art|Protogeometric style]], which begins Ancient Greek pottery proper.

The rise of [[Ancient Greek vase painting|vase painting]] saw increasing decoration. [[Geometric art]] in Greek pottery was contiguous with the late Dark Age and early [[Archaic Greece]], which saw the rise of the [[Orientalizing period]]. The pottery produced in Archaic and [[Classical Greece]] included at first [[black-figure pottery]], yet other styles emerged such as [[red-figure pottery]] and the [[white ground technique]]. Styles such as [[West Slope Ware]] were characteristic of the subsequent [[Hellenistic period]], which saw vase painting's decline.

==Rediscovery and scholarship==
[[File:DSC00276 - Processione di donne - 570-550 a.C. - Foto G. Dall'Orto.jpg|thumb|230px|{{lang|la|Disjecta membra}} (a fragment of ancient Greek pottery)]]
Interest in Greek art lagged behind the revival of classical scholarship during the Renaissance and revived in the academic circle round [[Nicholas Poussin]] in [[Rome]] in the 1630s.  Though modest collections of vases recovered from ancient tombs in Italy were made in the 15th and 16th centuries these were regarded as [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]]. It is possible that [[Lorenzo de Medici]] bought several [[Attic vases]] directly from [[Greece]];&lt;ref&gt;A letter of 1491 to Lorenzo from [[Angelo Poliziano]] made an offer of 3 vases as an addition to an implied existing collection&lt;/ref&gt; however the connection between them and the examples excavated in central [[Italy]] was not made until much later. [[Winckelmann]]'s ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' of 1764 first refuted the Etruscan origin of what we now know to be Greek pottery&lt;ref&gt;Though the first conjecture belongs to A.S Mazochius, ''In regii herculanensis musaei tabulas hercleenes commentarii'', 1754-8, however Winckelmann had access to greater resources including the first plates of the Hamilton collection. See D. von Bothmer, ''Greek vase-painting'' in ''Paper on the Amasis Painter and his World'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; yet [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s two collections, one lost at sea the other now in the [[British Museum]],  were still published as "Etruscan vases"; it would take until 1837 with [[Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (archaeologist)|Stackelberg]]'s ''Gräber der Hellenen'' to conclusively end the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Thanks to the ability of scholars to compare Greek finds with Italian ones following the Greek War of Independence, however the textual analysis in g. Kramer, ''Uber den Styl und die Herunft der bemalten griechischen Thongefasse'' 1837 and Otto Jahn's catalogue of the Vulci finds contributed to the changing consensus. See Cook, ''Greek Painted Pottery'', 1997, p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the early study of Greek vases took the form of production of albums of the images they depict, however neither [[Pierre-François Hugues D'Hancarville|D'Hancarville's]] nor [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|Tischbein]]'s folios record the shapes or attempt to supply a date and are therefore unreliable as an archaeological record. Serious attempts at scholary study made steady progress over the 19th century starting with the founding of the Instituto di Corrispondenza in Rome in 1828 (later the German Archaeological Institute), followed by [[Eduard Gerhard]]'s pioneering study ''Auserlesene Griechische Vasenbilder'' (1840 to 1858), the establishment of the journal ''Archaeologische Zeitung'' in 1843 and the ''Ecole d'Athens'' 1846. It was Gerhard who first outlined the chronology  we now use, namely: Orientalizing (Geometric, Archaic), Black Figure, Red Figure, Polychromatic (Hellenistic).

[[File:Vase-BlackBasalt-Wedgwood-BMA.jpg|thumb|[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] "Black Basalt" Ware vase by [[Wedgwood]], c. 1815 AD]]
Finally it was [[Otto Jahn]]'s 1854 catalogue ''Vasensammlung'' of the Pinakothek, Munich, that set the standard for the scientific description of Greek pottery, recording the shapes and inscriptions with a previously unseen fastidousness. Jahn's study was the standard textbook on the history and chronology of Greek pottery for many years, yet in common with Gerhard he dated the introduction of the red figure technique to a century later than was in fact the case. This error was corrected when the [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Aρχαιολογικη 'Εταιρεια]] undertook the excavation of the Acropolis in 1885 and discovered the so-called "[[Perserschutt|Persian debris]]" of red figure pots destroyed by [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invaders in 480 BC. With a more soundly established chronology it was possible for [[Adolf Furtwängler]] and his students in the 1880s and 90s to date the strata of his archaeological digs by the nature of the pottery found within them, a method of [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] [[Flinders Petrie]] was later to apply to unpainted Egyptian pottery.

Where the 19th century was a period of discovery and the laying out of first principles, the 20th century has been one of consolidation and intellectual industry. Efforts to record and publish the totality of public collections of vases began with the creation of the Corpus vasorum antiquorum under [[Edmond Pottier]] and the Beazley archive of [[John Beazley]].

Beazley and others following him have also studied fragments of Greek pottery in institutional collections, and have attributed many painted pieces to individual artists.  Scholars have called these fragments ''[[disjecta membra]]'' (Latin for "scattered parts") and in a number of instances have been able to identify fragments now in different collections that belong to the same vase.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron J. Paul, Fragments of Antiquity: Drawing Upon Greek Vases, Harvard University Art Museums Bulletin, Vol. V, No. 2 (Spring 1997), pp.. 4, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and types==
[[File:Attic Volute kraters-en.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of the parts of a typical Athenian vase, in this case a volute krater]]
The names we use for [[Typology of Greek vase shapes|Greek vase shapes]] are often a matter of convention rather than historical fact, a few do illustrate their own use or are labeled with their original names, others are the result of early archaeologists attempt to reconcile the physical object with a known name from Greek literature – not always successfully.
To understand the relationship between form and function Greek pottery may be divided in four broad categories, given here with common types:&lt;ref name="oakley 2012 p641"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodford, 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/default.htm |title=Shapes |work=[[Beazley Archive]] |location=Oxford |access-date=2 May 2018 |publisher=Classical Art Research Centre |date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* storage and transport vessels, including the [[amphora]], [[pithos]], [[pelike]], [[hydria]], [[pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]],
* mixing vessels, mainly for ''[[symposia]]'' or male drinking parties, including the [[krater]], and [[dinos]], 
* jugs and cups, several types of [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] also just called cups, [[kantharos]], [[patera|phiale]], [[skyphos]], [[oinochoe]] and [[loutrophoros]],
* vases for oils, perfumes and cosmetics, including the large [[lekythos]], and the small [[aryballos]] and [[alabastron]].

Some vase shapes were especially associated with rituals, others with athletics and the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodford, Susan, ''An Introduction To Greek Art'', 1986, Duckworth, {{ISBN|978-0801419942}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Within each category the forms are roughly the same in scale and whether open or closed, where there is uncertainty we can make good proximate guesses of what use a piece would have served. Some have a purely [[ritual]] function, for example [[White ground technique|white ground]] [[lekythoi]] contained the oil used as funerary offerings and appear to have been made solely with that object in mind. Many examples have a concealed second cup inside them to give the impression of being full of oil, as such they would have served no other useful gain. Some vessels were designed as [[Ancient Greek funerary vases|grave markers]].

There was an international market for Greek pottery since the 8th century BC, which [[Athens]] and [[Corinth]] dominated down to the end of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="oakley 2012 p642"/&gt; An idea of the extent of this trade can be gleaned from plotting the find maps of these vases outside of Greece, though this could not account for gifts or immigration. Only the existence of a second hand market could account for the number of panathenaics found in [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tombs. [[South Italian ancient Greek pottery|South Italian wares]] came to dominate the export trade in the Western Mediterranean as Athens declined in political importance during the [[Hellenistic period]].

==Clay==
The process of making a pot and firing it is fairly simple. The first thing a potter needs is [[clay]]. Attica's high-iron clay gave its pots an orange color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Pottery/|title=Greek Pottery|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022065208/http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Pottery/|archivedate=2016-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Levigation====
When clay is first dug out of the ground it is full of rocks and shells and other useless items that need to be removed. To do this the potter mixes the clay with water and lets all the impurities sink to the bottom. This is called levigation or [[elutriation]]. This process can be done many times. The more times this is done, the smoother clay becomes.

====Wheel====
The clay is then kneaded by the potter and placed on a [[Potter's wheel|wheel]]. Once the clay is on the wheel the potter can shape it into any of the many shapes shown below, or anything else he desires. Wheel made pottery dates back to roughly 2500 BC where before the coil method of building the walls of the pot was employed. Most Greek vases were wheel-made, though as with the [[Rhyton]] mould-made pieces (so-called "plastic" pieces) are also found and decorative elements either hand formed or by mould were added to thrown pots. More complex pieces were made in parts then assembled when it was leather hard by means of joining with a slip, where the potter returned to the wheel for the final shaping, or turning. Sometimes, a young man helped turn the wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://camws.org/meeting/2010/program/abstracts/04B1.Hasaki.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019062436/https://camws.org/meeting/2010/program/abstracts/04B1.Hasaki.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasa.net/writings/pots.html|title=ancient greek pottery|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021095050/http://www.rasa.net/writings/pots.html|archivedate=2016-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slip====
The pots were usually made in sections such as the body and feet and spout. Even the body, if it were larger than 20 centimeters, might be made in separate sections and glued together later with a thin watery clay called [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]. After the pot is made then the potter paints it with a very pure black slip made from a specially prepared clay &lt;ref name="Walton, M. 2014"&gt;Walton, M., Trentelman, K., Cianchetta, I., Maish, J., Saunders, D., Foran, B., Mehta, A. (2014), Zn in Athenian Black Gloss Ceramic Slips: A Trace Element Marker for Fabrication Technology.

"Evaluation of the relief line and the contour line on Greek red-figure vases using reflectance transformation imaging and three-dimensional laser scanning confocal microscopy." Studies in Conservation 58.4 (2013): 338–359.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was thus slipped and then incised ready for the [[kiln]].

===Firing===
[[File:Plaque Penteskouphia MNB2858.jpg|thumb|A potter's workshop. Side B from a Corinthian black-figure [[pinax]], ca. 575–550]]
Previously it was believed that Greek pottery, unlike today's pottery, was only fired once, but that firing had three stages. New studies instead provide material evidence that the pottery was made with two or more separate firings &lt;ref&gt;Walton, M., Trentelman, K., Cummings, M., Poretti, G., Maish, J., Saunders, D., Foran, B., Brodie, M., Mehta, A. (2013), Material Evidence for Multiple Firings of Ancient Athenian Red-Figure Pottery. Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 96: 2031–2035. doi: 10.1111/jace.12395&lt;/ref&gt; in which the pottery is subjected to multiple firing stages. The most commonly described sequence of firing stages is one in which the pottery is stacked inside the [[kiln]] the potter heats the kiln up to around 800&amp;nbsp;°C with all the vents on the sides open to let air in. This turns the pottery and the paint red all over. Once the kiln reaches 800&amp;nbsp;°C the vents are closed and the temperature is raised to 950&amp;nbsp;°C and then allowed to drop back to 900&amp;nbsp;°C. This turns the pottery and the paint all black. The potter then starts the third and final phase by opening the vents and allowing the [[kiln]] to cool all the way down. This last phase leaves the slip black but turns the pottery back to red. This happens because when the clay is given air it turns red, but when the black slip is heated to 950&amp;nbsp;°C it no longer allows air in. Thus, the slipped area stays black while the bare areas stay red. While the description of a single firing with three stages may seem economical and efficient, it is equally possible that each of these stages was confined to separate firings.

The striking black slip with a metallic sheen, so characteristic of Greek pottery, was a fine suspension ([[colloidal]] fraction) of an [[Illite|illitic]] clay with very low calcium oxide content which was rich in iron oxides and hydroxides, differentiating from that used for the body of the vase in terms of the calcium content, the exact mineral composition and the particle size. This clay suspension was most probably collected in situ from illitic clay beds and was then processed through levigation. To aid in the levigation step, it is likely that the Attic black slip was treated with [[deflocculant]]s as indicated by trace levels of contaminants to the clay, such as Zn associated with vitriol.&lt;ref name="Walton, M. 2014" /&gt; This clay suspension was thickened by concentration to a paste and was used for the decoration of the surface of the vase. The paint was applied on the areas intended to become black after firing.

The black color effect was achieved by means of changing the amount of oxygen present during firing. This was done in a process known as [[three-phase firing]] and was likely accomplished with multiple firings of the pottery. First, the kiln was heated to around 920–950&amp;nbsp;°C, with all vents open bringing oxygen into the firing chamber and turning both pot and slip a reddish-brown (oxidising conditions) due to the formation of [[hematite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in both the paint and the clay body. Then the vent was closed and green wood introduced, creating carbon monoxide which turns the red [[hematite]] to black [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); at this stage the temperature decreases due to incomplete combustion. In a final reoxidizing phase (at about 800–850&amp;nbsp;°C) the kiln was opened and oxygen reintroduced causing the unslipped reserved clay to go back to orange-red.
In the previous phase, chemical composition of the slipped surface had been altered, so it could no longer be oxidized and remained black. The technique which is mostly known as the "iron reduction technique" was decoded with the contribution of scholars, ceramists and scientists since the mid 18th century onwards to the end of the 20th century, i.e. [[Comte de Caylus]] (1752), Durand-Greville (1891), Binns and Fraser (1925), Schumann (1942), Winter (1959), Bimson (1956), Noble (1960, 1965), Hofmann (1962), Oberlies (1968), Pavicevic (1974), Aloupi (1993), Walton (2009), Walton (2014).&lt;ref&gt;For an extended review on the studies of Attic black slip and research published by several authors see R.E.

The most familiar aspect of ancient Greek pottery is painted vessels of fine quality. These were not the everyday pottery used by most people but were sufficiently cheap to be accessible to a wide range of the population.

Few examples of [[Ancient Greek art#Painting|ancient Greek painting]] have survived so modern scholars have to trace the development of [[ancient Greek art]] partly through ancient Greek vase-painting, which survives in large quantities and is also, with [[Ancient Greek literature]], the best guide we have to the customary life and mind of the ancient Greeks.

====Development of pottery painting====

=====Bronze Age=====
Fine painting on Greek pottery goes back to the [[Minoan pottery]] and [[Mycenaean pottery]] of the [[Bronze Age]], some later examples of which show the ambitious figurative painting that was to become highly developed and typical. After many centuries dominated by styles of geometric decoration, becoming increasingly complex, figurative elements returned in force in the 8th century.  From the late 7th century to about 300 BC evolving styles of figure-led painting were at their peak of production and quality and were widely exported.
[[Image:Amphora protogeometric BM A1123.jpg|thumb|left|140px|right|Protogeometric amphora, BM]]
During the [[Greek Dark Age]], spanning the 11th to 8th centuries BC, the prevalent early style was that of the [[protogeometric art]], predominantly utilizing circular and wavy decorative patterns. This was succeeded in [[mainland Greece]], the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]], [[Anatolia]], and [[Italy]] by the style of pottery known as [[geometric art]], which employed neat rows of geometric shapes.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Oakley (2012). "Greek Art and Architecture, Classical: Classical Greek Pottery," in Neil Asher Silberman et. al. (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology, Vol 1: Ache-Hoho'', Second Edition, 641–644. Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-973578-5}}, p. 641-642.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of [[Archaic Greece]], beginning in the 8th century BC and lasting until the late 5th century BC, saw the birth of [[Orientalizing period]], led largely by [[History of Corinth|ancient Corinth]], where the previous stick-figures of the geometric pottery become fleshed out amid motifs that replaced the geometric patterns.&lt;ref name="oakley 2012 p642"&gt;John H. Oakley (2012). "Greek Art and Architecture, Classical: Classical Greek Pottery," in Neil Asher Silberman et. al. (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology, Vol 1: Ache-Hoho'', Second Edition, 641–644. Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-973578-5}}, p. 642.&lt;/ref&gt;

======Protogeometric styles======
{{see also|Protogeometric art}}
Vases of the [[Protogeometric art|protogeometrical period]] (c. 1050–900 BC) represent the return of craft production after the collapse of the Mycenaean Palace culture and the ensuing [[Greek dark ages]]. It is one of the few modes of artistic expression besides jewelry in this period since the sculpture, monumental architecture and mural painting of this era are unknown to us. By 1050 BC life in the Greek peninsula seems to have become sufficiently settled to allow a marked improvement in the production of earthenware. The style is confined to the rendering of circles, triangles, wavy lines and arcs, but placed with evident consideration and notable dexterity, probably aided by compass' and multiple brushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John K. |last=Papadopoulos |first2=James F. |last2=Vedder |first3=Toby |last3=Schreiber |title=Drawing Circles: Experimental Archaeology and the Pivoted Multiple Brush |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=102 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=507–529 |jstor=506399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site of [[Lefkandi]] is one of our most important sources of ceramics from this period where a cache of grave goods has been found giving evidence of a distinctive Euboian protogeometric style which lasted into the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony M. |last=Snodgrass |title=The Dark Age of Greece |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=102 |isbn=0415936357 }} See also Popham, Sackett, ''Excavations at Lefkandi, Euboea'' 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

======Geometric style======
{{see also|Geometric art|Boeotian vase painting}}
[[Image:Hydria Boeotia Louvre A574.jpg|thumb|Boeotian Geometric Hydria lamp, Louvre]]
Geometric art flourished in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. It was characterized by new motifs, breaking with the representation of the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] periods: meanders, triangles and other geometrical decoration (hence the name of the style) as distinct from the predominantly circular figures of the previous style. However, our chronology for this new art form comes from exported wares found in datable contexts overseas.

[[File:Dypilon vase 1.jpg|thumbnail|left|The ''[[Dipylon Amphora]]'', mid-8th century BC, with human figures for scale. The vase was used as a grave marker.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;Woodford, Susan. (1982) ''The Art of Greece and Rome''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 40. {{ISBN|0521298733}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], Athens.]]

With the early geometrical style (approximately 900–850 BC) one finds only abstract motifs, in what is called the "Black Dipylon" style, which is characterized by an extensive use of black varnish, with the Middle Geometrical (approx. 850–770 BC), figurative decoration makes its appearance: they are initially identical bands of animals such as horses, stags, goats, geese, etc. which alternate with the geometrical bands. In parallel, the decoration becomes complicated and becomes increasingly ornate; the painter feels reluctant to leave empty spaces and fills them with [[Meander (art)|meanders]] or [[swastika]]s. This phase is named [[horror vacui]] (fear of the empty) and will not cease until the end of geometrical period.

In the middle of the century there begin to appear human figures, the best known representations of which are those of the vases found in [[Kerameikon|Dipylon]], one of the cemeteries of [[Athens]]. The fragments of these large funerary vases show mainly processions of chariots or warriors or of the funerary scenes: πρόθεσις / prothesis (exposure and lamentation of dead) or ἐκφορά / ekphora (transport of the coffin to the cemetery). The bodies are represented in a geometrical way except for the calves, which are rather protuberant. In the case of soldiers, a shield in form of a [[diabolo]], called “dipylon shield” because of its characteristic drawing, covers the central part of the body. The legs and the necks of the horses, the wheels of the chariots are represented one beside the other without perspective. The hand of this painter, so called in the absence of signature, is the  [[Dipylon Master]], could be identified on several pieces, in particular monumental amphorae.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship between the iconography of grave markers and social change is essayed in James Whitley ''Style and Society in Dark Age Greece'', 1991. See also Gudrun Ahlberg, Gudrun Ahlberg-Cornell, ''Prothesis and Ekphora in Greek Geometric Art'', 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the period there appear representations of mythology, probably at the moment when [[Homer]] codifies the traditions of [[Troy|Trojan]] cycle in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Here however the interpretation constitutes a risk for the modern observer: a confrontation between two warriors can be a Homeric duel or simple combat; a failed boat can represent the shipwreck of [[Odysseus]] or any hapless sailor.

Lastly, are the local schools that appear in Greece. Production of vases was largely the prerogative of Athens – it is well attested that as in the proto-geometrical period, in [[Corinth]], [[Boeotia]], [[Argos]], [[Crete]] and [[Cyclades]], the painters and potters were satisfied to follow the [[Attic style]]. From about the 8th century BC on, they created their own styles, Argos specializing in the figurative scenes, Crete remaining attached to a more strict abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Diffusion of the style is detailed in John Nicolas Coldstream, ''Greek Geometric Pottery: A Survey of Ten Local Styles and Their Chronology'', 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

======Orientalizing style======
{{see also|Orientalizing period}}
[[Image:Skyphos genius animals Louvre MNB2030.jpg|thumb|Protocorinthian skyphos, c. 625 BC, Louvre]]
The orientalizing style was the product of cultural ferment in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and Eastern Mediterranean of the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Fostered by trade links with the city-states of [[Asian Minor|Asia Minor]], the artifacts of the East influenced a highly stylized yet recognizable representational art. Ivories, pottery and metalwork from the [[Neo-Hittite]] principalities of northern [[Syria]] and [[Phoenicia]] found their way to Greece, as did goods from [[Anatolia]]n [[Urartu]] and [[Phrygia]], yet there was little contact with the cultural centers of Egypt or [[Assyria]]. The new idiom developed initially in [[Corinth]] (as Proto-Corinthian) and later in Athens between 725 BC and 625 BC (as Proto-Attic).&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Manuel Cook]], ''Greek Painted Pottery'', Routledge, 1997, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Olpe sphinx Louvre Cp10475.jpg|thumb|left|Proto-Corinthian ''[[Olpe (container)|olpe]]'' with registers of lions, bulls, ibex and [[sphinx]]es, c. 640–630 BC, Louvre]]
It was characterized by an expanded vocabulary of motifs: [[sphinx]], [[griffin]], [[lion]]s, etc., as well as a repertory of non-mythological animals arranged in friezes across the belly of the vase. In these friezes, painters also began to apply lotuses or palmettes. Depictions of humans were relatively rare. Those that have been found are figures in silhouette with some incised detail, perhaps the origin of the incised silhouette figures of the black-figure period. There is sufficient detail on these figures to allow scholars to discern a number of different artists' hands. Geometrical features remained in the style called proto-Corinthian that embraced these orientalizing experiments, yet which coexisted with a conservative sub-geometric style.

The ceramics of Corinth were exported all over Greece, and their technique arrived in Athens, prompting the development of a less markedly Eastern idiom there. During this time described as Proto-Attic, the orientalizing motifs appear but the features remain not very realistic. The painters show a preference for the typical scenes of the Geometrical Period, like processions of chariots. However, they adopt the principle of line drawing to replace the silhouette. In the middle of the 7th century BC, there appears the black and white style: black figures on a white zone, accompanied by polychromy to render the color of the flesh or clothing. Clay used in Athens was much more orange than that of Corinth, and so did not lend itself as easily to the representation of flesh. Attic Orientalising Painters include the [[Analatos Painter]], the [[Mesogeia Painter]] and the [[Polyphemos Painter]].

[[Crete]], and especially the islands of the [[Cyclades]], are characterized by their attraction to the vases known as “plastic”, i.e. those whose paunch or collar is moulded in the shape of head of an animal or a man. At [[Aegina]], the most popular form of the plastic vase is the head of the griffin. The Melanesian amphoras, manufactured at [[Paros]], exhibit little knowledge of Corinthian developments. They present a marked taste for the epic composition and a horror vacui, which is expressed in an abundance of swastikas and meanders.

Finally one can identify the last major style of the period, that of [[Wild Goat Style]], allotted traditionally to Rhodes because of an important discovery within the necropolis of [[Kameiros]]. In fact, it is widespread over all of [[Asia Minor]], with centers of production at [[Miletos]] and [[Chios]]. Two forms prevail [[oenochoes]], which copied bronze models, and dishes, with or without feet. The decoration is organized in superimposed registers in which stylized animals, in particular of feral goats (from whence the name) pursue each other in friezes. Many decorative motifs (floral triangles, swastikas, etc.) fill the empty spaces.

=====Attic vase painting=====
The subject is dominated mostly by [[Attica|Attic]] vase painting. Attic production was the first to resume after the Greek Dark Age and influenced the rest of Greece, especially [[Boeotia]], [[Corinth]], the [[Cyclades]] (in particular [[Naxos Island|Naxos]]) and the [[Ionians|Ionian]] colonies in the east [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref&gt;The diffusion of protogemetric pottery is a complex subject best summerized by V. Desborough, ''Protogeometric Pottery'', 1952. The picture is further complicated with the presence of a lingering sub-Mycenaean style in some Greek centres during this period, see {{cite book |last=Desborough |first= |title=The Last Mycenaeans and their Successors: An Archaeological Survey, c. 1200 – c. 1000 B.C. |year=1964 |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of vases was largely the prerogative of Athens – it is well attested that in Corinth, Boeotia, Argos, Crete and Cyclades, the painters and potters were satisfied to follow the Attic style.

By the end of the Archaic period the styles of [[black-figure pottery]], [[red-figure pottery]] and the [[white ground technique]] had become fully established and would continue in use during the era of [[Classical Greece]], from the early 5th to late 4th centuries BC. Corinth was eclipsed by Athenian trends since Athens was the progenitor of both the red-figure and white ground styles.&lt;ref name="oakley 2012 p642"/&gt;

======Black figure======
{{see also|Black-figure pottery}}
[[Image:Achilles Penthesileia BM B209.jpg|thumb|Achilles and [[Penthesileia]] by Exekias, c. 540 BC, BM. London.]]

Black-figure is the most commonly imagined when one thinks about Greek pottery. It was a popular style in ancient Greece for many years. The black-figure period coincides approximately with the era designated by [[Winckelmann]] as the middle to late [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]], from c. 620 to 480 BC. The technique of incising silhouetted figures with enlivening detail which we now call the black-figure method was a Corinthian invention of the 7th century&lt;ref&gt;The terminus ante quem of the late Corinthian black-figure style was established by M. T. Campbell ''A Well of the Black-figured Period at Corinth'', Hesperia, vii (1938), pp. 557–611.&lt;/ref&gt; and spread from there to other city states and regions including [[Sparta]],&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Stibbe ''Lakonische Vasenmaler des sechsten Jahrhunderts v.chr.'', 2 vols, 1972. M. Pipili ''Laconian Iconography of the Sixth Century BC'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boeotia]],&lt;ref&gt;K. Kilinski II ''Boiotian Black Figure Vase Painting of the Archaic Period'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euboea]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ''Pottery from Eretria'', Annu. Brit. Sch. Athens, xlvii, 1952, pp. 1–48&lt;/ref&gt; the east Greek islands&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Cook and P. Dupont ''East Greek Pottery'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and Athens.

The Corinthian fabric, extensively studied by [[Humfry Payne]]&lt;ref&gt;H. G. G. Payne ''Necrocorinthia: A Study of Corinthian Art in the Archaic Period'', 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; and Darrell Amyx,&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Amyx, ''Corinthian Vase-painting of the Archaic Period'', 3 vols, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; can be traced though the parallel treatment of animal and human figures. The animal motifs have greater prominence on the vase and show the greatest experimentation in the early phase of Corinthian black-figure. As Corinthian artists gained in confidence in their rendering of the human figure the animal frieze declined in size relative to the human scene during the middle to late phase. By the mid-6th century BC, the quality of Corinthian ware had fallen away significantly to the extent that some Corinthian potters would disguise their pots with a red slip in imitation of superior Athenian ware.

At Athens researchers have found the earliest known examples of vase painters signing their work, the first being a [[dinos]] by [[Sophilos]] (illus. below, BM c. 580), this perhaps indicative of their increasing ambition as artists in producing the monumental work demanded as grave markers, as for example with [[Kleitias]]'s [[François Vase]]. Many scholars consider the finest work in the style to belong [[Exekias]] and the [[Amasis Painter]], who are noted for their feeling for composition and narrative.

Circa 520 BC the red-figure technique was developed and was gradually introduced in the form of the [[Bilingual pottery|bilingual vase]] by the [[Andokides Painter]], [[Oltos]] and [[Psiax]].&lt;ref&gt;However, the earliest red-figure vase was not a bilingual, see Beth Cohen, ''The Colors of Clay'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt; Red-figure quickly eclipsed black-figure, yet in the unique form of the Panathanaic Amphora, black-figure continued to be utilised well into the 4th century BC.

======Red figure======
{{see also|Red-figure pottery}}

[[Image:Reveller courtesan BM E44.jpg|thumb|Reveller and courtesan by Euphronios, c. 500 BC, BM E 44]]

The innovation of the red-figure technique was an Athenian invention of the late 6th century. It was quite the opposite of black-figure which had a red background. The ability to render detail by direct painting rather than incision offered new expressive possibilities to artists such as three-quarter profiles, greater anatomical detail and the representation of perspective.

The first generation of red-figure painters worked in both red- and black-figure as well as other methods including [[Six's technique]] and [[White Ground Technique|white-ground]]; the latter was developed at the same time as red-figure. However, within twenty years, experimentation had given way to specialization as seen in the vases of the [[Pioneer Group]], whose figural work was exclusively in red-figure, though they retained the use of black-figure for some early floral ornamentation. The shared values and goals of The Pioneers such as [[Euphronios]] and [[Euthymides]] signal that they were something approaching a self-conscious movement, though they left behind no testament other than their own work. John Boardman said of the research on their work that "the reconstruction of their careers, common purpose, even rivalries, can be taken as an archaeological triumph"&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman: Athenian Red Figure Vases: The Archaic Period, 1975, p29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of late [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] vase painters (c. 500 to 480 BC) brought an increasing naturalism to the style as seen in the gradual change of the profile eye. This phase also sees the specialization of painters into pot and cup painters, with the [[Berlin Painter|Berlin]] and [[Kleophrades Painter]]s notable in the former category and [[Douris (vase painter)|Douris]] and [[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]] in the latter.

[[Image:Hoplitodromia Louvre CA214.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neck amphora]] depicting an athlete running the [[hoplitodromos]] by the [[Berlin Painter]], c. 480 BC, Louvre]]

By the early to high classical era of [[red-figure painting]] (c. 480–425 BC), a number of distinct schools had evolved. The mannerists associated with the workshop of Myson and exemplified by the [[Pan Painter]] hold to the archaic features of stiff drapery and awkward poses and combine that with exaggerated gestures. By contrast, the school of the Berlin Painter in the form of the [[Achilles Painter]] and his peers (who may have been the Berlin Painter’s pupils) favoured a naturalistic pose usually of a single figure against a solid black background or of restrained [[#White ground technique|white-ground lekythoi]]. [[Polygnotos (vase painter)|Polygnotos]] and the [[Kleophon Painter]] can be included in the school of the [[Niobid Painter]], as their work indicates something of the influence of the [[Parthenon]] sculptures both in theme (e.g., Polygnotos’s centauromachy, Brussels, Musées Royaux A. &amp; Hist., A 134) and in feeling for composition.

Toward the end of the century, the "Rich" style of Attic sculpture as seen in the [[Temple of Athena Nike|Nike Balustrade]] is reflected in contemporary vase painting with an ever-greater attention to incidental detail, such as hair and jewellery. The [[Meidias Painter]] is usually most closely identified with this style.

Vase production in Athens stopped around 330–320 BC possibly due to [[Alexander the Great]]'s control of the city, and had been in slow decline over the 4th century along with the political fortunes of Athens itself. However, vase production continued in the 4th and 3rd centuries in the Greek colonies of southern Italy where five regional styles may be distinguished. These are the [[Apulia]]n, [[Lucanian]], [[Sicily|Sicilian]], [[Campanian]] and [[Paestum|Paestan]]. Red-figure work flourished there with the distinctive addition of polychromatic painting and in the case of the [[Black Sea]] colony of [[Panticapeum]] the gilded work of the [[Kerch Style]]. Several noteworthy artists' work comes down to us including the [[Darius Painter]] and the [[Underworld Painter]], both active in the late 4th century, whose crowded polychromatic scenes often essay a complexity of emotion not attempted by earlier painters. Their work represents a late mannerist phase to the achievement of Greek vase painting.

======White ground technique======
{{see also|White ground technique}}
[[File:Mainade Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2645.jpg|thumb|Raging [[maenad]] by the [[Brygos Painter]] - she holds a ''[[thyrsos]]'' in her right hand, her left is swinging a leopard through the air, and a snake is winding through the diadem in her hair - [[Tondo (art)|Tondo]] of a ''[[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'', 490–480 BC, [[Munich]], [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]]]
The white-ground technique was developed at the end of the 6th century BC. Unlike the better-known black-figure and red-figure techniques, its coloration was not achieved through the application and firing of [[slip (ceramics)|slips]] but through the use of paints and gilding on a surface of white clay. It allowed for a higher level of polychromy than the other techniques, although the vases end up less visually striking. The technique gained great importance during the 5th and 4th centuries, especially in the form of small ''[[lekythos|lekythoi]]'' that became typical grave offerings. Important representatives include its inventor, the [[Achilles Painter]], as well as [[Psiax]], the [[Pistoxenos Painter]], and the [[Thanatos Painter]].

=====Relief and plastic vases=====
Relief and plastic vases became particularly popular in the 4th century BC and continued being manufactured in the Hellenistic period. They were inspired by the so-called "rich style" developed mainly in Attica after 420 BC. The main features were the multi-figured compositions with use of added colours (pink/reddish, blue, green, gold)and an emphasis on female mythological figures. Theatre and performing constituted yet one more source of inspiration.

[[Delphi Archaeological Museum]] has some particularly good examples of this style, including a vase with [[Aphrodite]] and [[Eros]]. The base is round, cylindrical, and its handle vertical, with bands, covered with black colour. The female figure (Aphrodite) is depicted seated, wearing an [[himation]]. Next to her stands a male figure, naked and winged. Both figures wear wreaths made of leaves and their hair preserve traces of golden paint. The features of their faces are stylized. The vase has a white ground and maintains in several parts the traces of bluish, greenish and reddish paint. It dates to the 4th century BC.

In the same room is kept a small lekythos with a plastic decoration, depicting a winged dancer. The figure wears a Persian head cover and an oriental dress, indicating that already in that period oriental dancers, possibly slaves, had become quite fashionable. The figure is also covered with a white colour. The  total height of the vase is 18 centimeters and it dates to the 4th century BC.

=====Hellenistic period=====

The [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]], ushered in by the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], saw the virtual disappearance of black and red-figure pottery yet also the emergence of new styles such as [[West Slope Ware]] in the east, the [[Centuripe Ware]] in [[Sicily]], and the [[Gnathia vases]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;John H.

Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-973578-5}}, p. 642-643.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of mainland Greece other regional Greek traditions developed, such as those in [[Magna Graecia]] with the various styles in South Italy, including [[Apulian vase painting|Apulian]], [[Lucanian vase painting|Lucanian]], [[Paestan vase painting|Paestan]], [[Campanian vase painting|Campanian]], and [[Sicilian vase painting|Sicilian]].&lt;ref name="oakley 2012 p642"/&gt;

Inscriptions on Greek pottery are of two kinds; the incised (the earliest of which are contemporary with the beginnings of the Greek alphabet in the 8th century BC), and the painted, which only begin to appear a century later. Both forms are relatively common on painted vases until the [[Hellenistic period]] when the practice of inscribing pots seems to die out. They are by far most frequently found on Attic pottery.
[[Image:Sophilos me grafsen inscription Lebes BM 1971.11-1.1.jpg|thumb|left|Signature (written retrograde) SOΦΙLOS MEΓΡΑΦSEN ("Sophilos megraphsen" – ''Sophilos drew me''), c. 570 BC, [[British Museum]], GR 1971.11–1.1]]
A number of sub-classes of inscription can be distinguished. Potters and painters occasionally signed their works with ''epoiesen'' and ''egraphsen'' respectively. Trademarks are found from the start of the 6th century on Corinthian pieces; these may have belonged to an exporting merchant rather than the pottery workfield and this remains a matter of conjecture.) Patrons' names are also sometimes recorded, as are the names of characters and objects depicted. At times we may find a snatch of dialogue to accompany a scene, as in ‘Dysniketos’s horse has won’, announces a herald on a Panathenaic amphora (BM, B 144). More puzzling, however, are the [[Kalos inscription|kalos]] and kalee inscriptions, which might have formed part of courtship ritual in Athenian high society, yet are found on a wide variety of vases not necessarily associated with a social setting. Finally there are [[abecedaria]] and nonsense inscriptions, though these are largely confined to black-figure pots.&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Immerwahr, [http://www.reference-global.com/doi/pdfplusdirect/10.1515/KADMOS.2007.009 ''Aspects of Literacy in the Athenian Ceramicus'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figurines==
[[Greek terracotta figurines]] were another important type of pottery, initially mostly religious, but increasingly representing purely decorative subjects. The so-called [[Tanagra figurine]]s, in fact made elsewhere as well, are one of the most important types.  Earlier figurines were usually [[votive offering]]s at temples.

==Relationship to metalwork and other materials==
Several clay vases owed their inspiration to metalwork forms in bronze, silver and sometimes gold.  These were increasingly used by the elite when dining, but were not placed in graves, where they would have been robbed, and were often treated as a store of value to be traded as bullion when needed.  Very few metal vessels have survived as at some point they were melted down and the metal reused. 

In recent decades many scholars have questioned the conventional relationship between the two materials, seeing much more production of painted vases than was formerly thought as made to be placed in graves, as a cheaper substitute for metalware in both Greece and Etruria.  The painting itself may also copy that on metal vessels more closely than was thought.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to ''Ancient Greek Pottery'' (Ashmolean Handbooks) by Michael Vickers (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Derveni Krater]], from near [[Thessaloniki]], is a large bronze [[volute]] [[krater]] from about 320 BC, weighing 40 kilograms, and finely decorated with a 32-centimetre-tall frieze of figures in relief representing [[Dionysus]] surrounded by [[Ariadne]] and her procession of [[satyr]]s and [[maenad]]s.

The [[alabastron]]'s name suggests ''[[alabaster]]'', stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sparkes|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;Glass was also used, mostly for fancy small perfume bottles, though some [[Hellenistic glass]] rivalled metalwork in quality and probably price.

'''Riva Helfond''' (March 8, 1910 - May 13, 2002) was an American artist and printmaker best known for her [[Social realism|social realist]] studies of working people's lives.

==Early life and education==
Riva Helfond was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. She spent some of her childhood in Russia and returned to New York at the age of eleven, living in New York or New Jersey for most of the rest of her life. Between 1928 and 1940, she studied at the School of Industrial Art and the Art Students League; her teachers included [[William von Schlegell]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], and [[Morris Kantor]] for painting and [[Harry Sternberg]] for printmaking. Among her fellow students were [[Alexander Brook]] and her future husband, the sculptor William (Bill) Barrett (d. 1967).

==Teaching==
Helfond began teaching in the College Art Association Program (1933–36) and then taught printmaking at the Harlem Arts Community Center (1936–38). Initially she taught lithography alongside [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Romare Bearden]], and others before moving to the graphic arts division, where she worked with Louis Lozowick and Jacob Kainen, and the silkscreen division, which was supervised by [[Anthony Velonis]] and which had [[Harry Gottlieb]] and [[Elizabeth Olds]] as founding members. Among her students at the Center was [[Robert Blackburn (artist)|Robert Blackburn]], who would go on to found New York's Printmaking Workshop in the 1940s. Later on, Helfond taught printmaking at New York University (1964), and she was on the faculty of Union College in Cranford, New Jersey, from 1980 onwards.

==Artwork==
From 1936 to 1941, Helfond was an artist in the New York [[Works Progress Administration]] program's graphics division, creating work in a variety of media, including lithographs, woodcuts, etchings, aquatints, collograph, and silkscreens. Some of her work shows the impact that color had as it entered American printmaking during this period, and she was adventurous in exploring the possibilities opened up by screen printing.&lt;ref&gt;Viso, Olga M. [http://tfaoi.org/aa/9aa/9aa175.htm  "The Golden Age of American Printmaking 1900-1950."] In ''Artists of the American Scene: A Selection from the Dr. Robert B. and Mrs. Dorothy M. Gronlund Collection of Twentieth-Century American Prints'', Norton Gallery of Art exhibition catalog, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; She printed all of her own work, which ranged from austere, often monochromatic social realist portraits of working people and cityscapes in the 1920s and 1930s to colorful, abstract, lyrical landscapes in later years. Some of her color abstractions originated as watercolors from nature during travels in Greece and France and were then turned into oil paintings.

Helfond was politically progressive, and along with contemporaries like Elizabeth Olds, [[Beatrice Mandelman]], and [[Minna Citron]], she is especially well known for works that "pointedly condemned the state of labor, and the relationship between big business and big government, in the 1930s." &lt;ref&gt;Doss, Erika. "Toward an Iconography of American Labor: Work, Workers, and the Work Ethic in American Art, 1930-1945." ''Design Issues'', 1997, pp. 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these include ''Custom Made'' (1940), a lithograph showing a woman slumped over her work in a WPA sewing room, and ''Snow Clearing'' (1933), showing men at work shoveling a street.

There are also a number of prints about the grim lives of coal miners, such as ''Miner and Wife'' (1937), an ''American Gothic''&amp;ndash;style portrait of a couple, with the husband showing a closed fist; ''Out of the Pit'' (1935), a double portrait of miners with blackened faces; and ''Coal Picker'' (1938), showing elderly women scavenging in a coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Elizabeth M. "Viewing Work Historically Through Art: Incorporating the Visual Arts into Organizational Studies." ''Journal of Management History'', vol. 12, no. 2, 2006, pp. 137-153.&lt;/ref&gt; After Helfond married Bill Barrett, whose Welsh relatives worked in the mines, she used these new connections to bring other artists interested in social justice together with the miners. Helfond ran into several obstacles while working in the coal districts of Pennsylvania. For one thing, she was irked that the gatherings of miners and her male artist friends in the local bars tended to exclude her and other women, making it harder for her to develop the relationships necessary to her work.&lt;ref&gt;Langa, Helen. ''Radical Art: Printmaking and the Left in 1930s New York''. University  of California Press, 2004, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Another obstacle sprang from cultural differences: Helfond recounted how in the mining town of Lansford, the local women became less friendly when she revealed that she was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marion A., and Deborah Dash Moore, eds. ''Gender and Jewish History''. Indiana University Press, 2011, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these challenges, Helfond's prints of coal miners are considered an important addition to the body of work documenting the lives of the working poor during the New Deal.&lt;ref&gt;Francey, Mary. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/9aa/9aa156.htm "American Women at Work: Women Printmakers and the Federal Art Project". 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Helfond's work has been exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1960), the Newark Museum of Fine Arts (1964, 1967), and elsewhere. It is represented in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Brooklyn Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Art, the Springfield Museum of Fine Art, the Newark Museum of Fine Art, and the Library of Congress, among other institutions. In 2009, her work was featured in the exhibition "Industrial Strength: Precisionism and New Jersey" at the Jersey City Museum.

Helfond counted as friends a wide circle of Abstract Expressionist artists and critics, including [[Willem DeKooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Harold Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Greengard, Stephen. "Ten Crucial Years: A Panel Discussion by Six WPA Artists." ''Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', vol. 1, no. 1, Spring 1986, pp. 46-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life she lived in Plainfield, New Jersey, where she owned and managed the Barrett Art Gallery on East Front Street, which she had started with her husband in the 1960s. In the early 1950s, she designed a rose window for the First Unitarian Society of Plainfield's All Souls Church.

'''''Rocket Thrower''''' is a 1963 [[bronze sculpture]] by American [[sculptor]] [[Donald De Lue]]. Created for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], it is located in [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park]] in [[Queens]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. De Lue was among a total of five sculptors who would create pieces for the fairground. He was contracted in 1962 for the amount of $105,000 with a deadline for completion of under six months. De Lue completed a full plaster model in 1963 at which time it was sent to Italy to be cast.

==Description==
[[File:Rocket thrower knee jeh.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Southwestern side]]
''Rocket Thrower'' stands {{convert|43|ft|abbr=off}} high and depicts an athletic and god-like man launching, with his right hand, a small sphere into the sky which leaves an arcing trail of flames behind. His left hand is raised skyward and reaches for a swirl of stars which encircle the path of the rocket. ''Rocket Thrower''{{'s}} left leg strains and crouches with his left foot planted on an arched perch. His right leg extends out fluidly. On the front of the perch (facing the [[Unisphere]]) are three distinct stars arranged in an angled line across its short width.

Over time the statue has been affected by corrosion and the structural integrity has diminished. One arm was repaired in 1989. The statue was significantly restored in 2013.&lt;ref name="Colangelo 2013"/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Unisphere Fountains - The Rocket Thrower 01.jpg|thumb|Another view of ''Rocket Thrower'']]
When released, the critics of the time had mixed reviews of the work. De Lue explained the work as "the spiritual concept of man’s relationship to space and his venturesome spirit backed up by all the powers of his intelligence for the exploration of a new dimension."  However, ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]] described it as "the most lamentable monster, making [[Walt Disney]] look like [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo Da Vinci]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art All Over the Fair; Sculptured Wall for the Japanese Pavilion Appears Finest Single Work |first=John |last=Canaday |authorlink=John Canaday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/25/archives/art-all-over-the-fair-sculptured-wall-for-the-japanese-pavilion.html | format= Abstract |subscription=yes | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 25, 1964 |page=12 |accessdate= February 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ste McCabe''' (from [[Liverpool]], England) is an English DIY, [[queercore]] singer-songwriter, previously based in [[Manchester]], and later [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].

==Career==
McCabe started performing solo in 2006, using only a drum machine and electric guitar as an alternative to a full band.

'''''The Boar Hunt''''' (Spanish - ''La caza del jabalí'') is a 1775 painting by [[Francisco de Goya]], now in [[El Escorial]]. The earliest surviving tapestry cartoon by the artist, it belongs to his first series of cartoons, intended for a series of tapestries on hunting themes for [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles, Prince of Asturias]] and [[Maria Luisa of Parma]]. Its authorship is confirmed by its dimensions in receipts for the tapestries from the Real Fábrica archives.

Goya's work was supervised by his brother in law [[Francisco Bayeu]] and Francisco's brother [[Ramón Bayeu|Ramón]]. Francesco delivered this and four other cartoons to Cornelio Vandergroten on 24 May 1775.&lt;ref&gt;GASSIER, Pierre; Juliet Wilson Bareau (1974). ''Vida y obra de Francisco Goya.''

'''''Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba''''' is an oil painting by [[Claude Lorrain]] (born Claude Gellée, traditionally known as Claude), in the [[National Gallery]], London, signed and dated 1648. The large oil on canvas painting was commissioned by [[Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne]], [[Duc de Bouillon]], general of the [[Papal army]], together with Claude's ''Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca''. It depicts the departure of the [[Queen of Sheba]] to visit to [[King Solomon]] in Jerusalem, described in the tenth chapter of the [[Books of Kings|First Book of Kings]].  A more usual subject would be their meeting; this is one of many harbour scenes painted by Claude. The Queen is departing from a city with classical buildings, with the early morning sun lighting the sea, as vessels are loaded.

The composition draws the eye to a group of people on the steps to the right, at the intersection of a line of perspective (the steps) and a strong vertical (the left column of the building's portico).  The Queen wears a pink tunic, royal blue cloak, and golden crown, and is about to board a waiting launch to take her to her ship – perhaps the ship partially concealed by the pillars to the left, or the one further out to sea, over the picture's [[vanishing point]].  

The painting was one of the first works to be acquired by the National Gallery in 1824, being one of five works by Claude Lorrain bought from the collection of [[John Julius Angerstein]]. It has the catalogue number NG14. This and similar works by Claude inspired [[J. M. W. Turner]] to paint ''[[Dido Building Carthage]]'' and ''[[The Decline of the Carthaginian Empire]]'', which Turner left to the nation as part of the Turner Bequest on the condition that they were to be hung besides Claude's pair of works.

It is numbered 114 in Claude's ''[[Liber Veritatis]]''.

'''The Place''' is a [[dance]] and [[performance]] centre in Duke's Road near [[Euston railway station|Euston]] in the [[London Borough of Camden]]. It is the home of [[London Contemporary Dance School]], [[Richard Alston Dance Company]], and the Robin Howard Dance Theatre.

==History==
The building was designed by Robert Edis as the headquarters of the [[Artists Rifles|20th Middlesex (Artists) Volunteer Rifle Corps]] and built by Charles Kynoch and Company of Clapham between 1888 and 1889.&lt;ref name=blb&gt;{{cite web|author=Good Stuff |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-477148-the-place-and-attached-railings-17-camde |title=The Place and Attached Railings - Camden - Greater London - England |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date=1997-08-01 |accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently officially opened by the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name=blb/&gt; The 20th Middlesex (Artists) Volunteer Rifle Corps became the [[London Regiment|28th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Artists Rifles)]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=step&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steppingforwardlondon.org/assets/docs/sections/17.pdf|title=Drill Hall Register: A list of the locations of London Drill Halls since 1908|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/london.htm|title=The London Regiment|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the London Regiment was broken up and the battalions reallocated to other units in August 1937, the hall became the home of the [[Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own)|Artists Rifles, The Rifle Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was disbanded in 1945, after the [[World War II|Second World War]], but reformed again in the Rifle Brigade in January 1947 but transferred to the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] in July 1947 as the [[Special Air Service|21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists Rifles)]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; The drill hall fell vacant when the 21st Special Air Service Regiment moved out to the [[Duke of York's Headquarters]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SCio3hI8G7wC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;lpg=PT54&amp;dq=%22Duke+of+York%27s+barracks%22+21st+Regiment+SAS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xRpJoqlOCq&amp;sig=0EQsKgX1xE4SFDP4uZ1A03ZLXFY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9o6T9tKHUAhUJBsAKHahnAxYQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Duke%20of%20York's%20barracks%22%2021st%20Regiment%20SAS&amp;f=false|title=Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know|first=Ranulph |last=Fiennes|publisher=Hodder|year=2008|isbn=978-0340951699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drill hall, which had been colloquially known as "The Artists Place", became simply "The Place" when the Contemporary Ballet Trust took over the premises in 1969.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplace.org.uk/history-place|title=A History of The Place|publisher=The Place|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the Contemporary Ballet Trust, under the leadership of [[Robin Howard]], acquired the freehold of the premises as well as a site in Flaxman Terrace so facilitating an extension studio block to be built.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In the 1970s the Contemporary Ballet Trust established the [[London Contemporary Dance School]] and the [[London Contemporary Dance Theatre]] both of which were formed at The Place; in 1994 the latter body was succeeded by the [[Richard Alston Dance Company]] which remains located at The Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcds.ac.uk/|title=London Contemporary Dance School|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1999 a major redevelopment programme, principally funded by the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], allowed the refurbishment of the original drill hall and the replacement of the studio block with six new state-of-the-art dance studios designed by architects [[Allies and Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/a-sense-of-place/184828.article|title=A Sense of Place|publisher=Architect's Journal|date=18 October 2001|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further dance studios, the Weston Studio and the Monument Studio, were added in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcds.ac.uk/history-london-contemporary-dance-school|title=History of London Contemporary Dance School|publisher=The Place|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer 101.jpg|thumb|280px|''The Suicide of Lucretia'', 168 x 75cm]]
'''''The Suicide of Lucretia''''' is an oil on lime [[panel painting]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]], signed and dated 1518, in the collection of the [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]. It shows the [[Ancient Rome]]an heroine [[Lucretia]] (died c. 510 BC), wife of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], in a tall and narrow framing, in the act of killing herself rather than  face the shame of being raped by her cousin [[Sextus Tarquinius]].&lt;ref name="Alte"&gt;''

Munich: Bruckmann, 1992. 101-102. {{ISBN|978-3-7654-2454-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucretia stands in front of a cramped and harshly lit room containing the bridal bed on which she was raped. She looks to the sky, as if asking the gods to witness her suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hults, 218&lt;/ref&gt; Her face betraying feelings of disgrace, as she stabs herself with a sword to the belly. Dürer has earlier completed a 1508 pencil on green paper drawing of Lucretia, now in the [[Albertina|Albertina Museum]], [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Bubenik, x&lt;/ref&gt;

Her wound is not at the center of her belly, as in the 1508 drawing, but below her right breast, echoing Christ's lance wound. Critics have mentioned how the act is bloodless, without any of the spatterings on bed sheets usually associated with similar treatments from the time. However the painting was executed with finesse, with the brush strokes representing the cloths especially detailed, and composed of a variety of red, blue, and green pigments. The white drapery around her hips is a later addition, from around 1600.

The panel is Dürer's second treatment of Lucretia, following a very similar 1508 drawing. Art historians tend not to view it as one of his best paintings, and it is often compared, unfavourably, to a similar work by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. However, art historians see the Dürer as a less formal treatment, more inward and concerned with confronting death and dying.&lt;ref name="Alte" /&gt; Between 1959-60, [[Alberto Giacometti]] completed a ''Sketch after Durer's Lucretia'' using ball-point pen on paper.&lt;ref&gt;Carluccio, Luigi.

Her face bears elements of idealisation, although for the most part she is presented as a real woman. Her expression, near identical to the 1508 drawing, is difficult to interpret, as it contains none of the passivity, chastity, or sly sidelong glances usually associated with contemporary depictions of her.&lt;ref&gt;Hults, 226&lt;/ref&gt; She is given a monumental and statuesque pose, but without the sense of pagan sensuality present in his 1507 ''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'' in the [[Prado]], [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Sander, 206&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have remarked unfavourably on her sour expression, unnaturally elongated and disproportional figure, and uncomfortable [[contrapposto]] pose.&lt;ref&gt;Hults, 209&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting has been described as one of Dürer's most unpopular works, with many art historians, including [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max Friedländer]] and [[Erwin Panofsky]], commenting unfavourably on apparent qualities such as "austerity and awkwardness".&lt;ref&gt;Hults, 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 121, 201&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[Fedja Anzelewsky]] described her as "a parody rather than an exaltation of the classical feminine figure."&lt;ref&gt;Tsaneva, Maria. ''Durer: 201 Paintings and Drawings''. Lulu, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist scholar Linda Hults observes how "there is a mechanical quality to Lucretia's suicidal gesture; it seems to operate apart from her facial expression, and it does not seem to require the assistance of her other arm, which is oddly placed behind her back."&lt;ref&gt;Hults, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5692">A '''tour manager''' (or '''concert tour manager''') is the person who helps to organize the administration for a schedule of appearances of a [[musical ensemble|musical group (band) or artist]] at a sequence of [[Music venue|venue]]s (a [[concert tour]]). In general, [[road manager]]s handle small to medium-sized tours, and tour managers are used on large-scale tours.

The performances on a concert tour are booked by the act’s [[Talent agent#Music agents|booking agent]], who works with [[Promoter (entertainment)|concert promoters]] to place the act in suitable venues and [[Music festival|festivals]] in a time frame and territory agreed with the act’s [[Talent manager|management]]. Individual concert promoters negotiate the financial, technical and hospitality requirements of the artist  and make an offer to the booking agent for the show. The tour is announced and tickets put on sale when agreement is reached on the tour dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddell|last2=Barnet|last3=Berry|title=This Business of Concert Promotion and Touring: A Practical Guide to Creating, Selling, Organizing, and Staging Concerts|publisher=Billboard Books|location=New York|year=2007|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern concert touring involves complex financial, legal and technical arrangements, the booking agent or artist manager hire a concert tour manager to organize the logistics. Concert tour managers are usually [[freelancer]]s working on a tour-by-tour basis.

==Duties==

The tour manager is given the itinerary for the tour by the booking agent. Working from this itinerary, the tour manager handles the following activities.

===Financial===
The itinerary includes information about the potential ticket income (fees) for each show. Using this information the tour manager can produce a budget for the tour, calculating costs for crew wages, [[per diem]]s, accommodation, transport, sound, lighting and video equipment, visas and work permits, rehearsals and other expenses such as booking agent commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|title=The Tour Book|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston|year=2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly reports are submitted to the business manager. Tour manager are on financial stabilities due to them being ahead of the whole tour.

===Advancing===
Advancing is the process of contacting each promoter and venue to ensure the entire [[Rider (theater)|artist's technical and hospitality demands]] (the ''rider'') are met and to resolve any problems the promoter or venue can foresee. The artist's rider covers catering, production (sound, lights, stagehands needed), security, general show, and legal issues. During the advancing process the tour manager checks contact names and addresses, arrival times, equipment load-in times, sound check and performance times, any supporting/opening acts, and live music curfews.

This information is collated into a "tour book" which is issued to the band and crew.

===On the road===
The tour manager travels with the band on the tour. The job on the road varies depending on the type and success level of the act. A tour manager's day-to-day workload can include:&lt;ref&gt;One for the Road: How to Be a Music Tour Manager by Mark Workman&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign indicating "Museo del Prado" was added in the original glass negative, circa 1890.]]

'''''Two Old Ones Eating Soup''''' (Spanish: '''''Dos viejos comiendo sopa''''') or '''''The Witchy Brew''''' (Spanish: '''''Dos Brujas''''')&lt;ref name="J84"&gt;Junquera, 84&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the fourteen ''[[Black Paintings]]'' created by [[Francisco Goya]] between 1819–1823. By this time, Goya was in his mid-70s and deeply disillusioned. He painted the works on the interior walls of the house known as the [[Quinta del Sordo]] ("House of the Deaf Man"). They were not intended for public display. ''Two Old Men Eating Soup'' likely occupied a position above the main door to the house, between ''[[La Leocadia]]'' and ''[[Two Old Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, G. "[http://www.theartwolf.com/goya_black_paintings.htm Goya: The Black Paintings]". theartwolf.com, August 2006. Retrieved 4 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the other ''Black Paintings'', it was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]] in 1874–1878 under the supervision of [[Salvador Martínez Cubells]], a curator at the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid. The owner, [[Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger|Baron Émile d'Erlanger]], donated the canvases to the Spanish state in 1881, and they are now on display at the Prado.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image, two elderly figures loom forward from a black background; although they are assumed to be men, their gender is not readily apparent. The mouth of the left figure is drawn into a grimace, possibly from lack of teeth. In stark contrast to this animated expression, the face of the other figure hardly seems alive at all. Its eyes are black hollows and the head in general bears the aspect of a skull.

As in the rest of the ''Black Paintings'', Goya's use of his medium displays an assurance that comes only from a lifetime of experience. Paint is handled freely and rapidly yet with great decisiveness. The palette knife is also used to apply paint in some areas. Blacks, ochres, earth tones and grays are the only colors used, as in the rest of the black paintings.

The '''Western canon''' is the body of [[Western literature]], [[European classical music]], philosophy, and [[works of art]] that represents the [[high culture]] of Europe and North America: "a certain Western intellectual tradition that goes from, say, [[Socrates]] to [[Wittgenstein]] in philosophy, and from [[Homer]] to [[James Joyce]] in literature".&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt;  The word [[wikt:canon|canon]] is derived from ancient Greek ''κανών, kanṓn'', meaning a measuring rod, or standard. The [[Bible]], a product of [[ancient Jewish]] culture, from western Asia, has been a major force in shaping [[Western culture]], and "has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Bible: A Very Short Introduction|edition= |last= Riches|first= John|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-285343-1|page= 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canon of books has been fairly stable, although it has expanded to include more women and [[racial minorities]], while the canons of music and the visual arts have greatly expanded to cover the [[Middle Ages]] and subsequent centuries once largely overlooked. But some examples of newer media such as [[Film|cinema]] have attained a precarious position in the canon. Also during the twentieth century there has been a growing interest in the West as well as globally, in major works, both in literature and in the other arts, of the cultures of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America and the former colonies of European countries.

There has been an ongoing debate internationally, over the nature and status of the canon since at least the 1960s, much of which is rooted in [[critical theory]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Hicks 2004 p. 18"&gt;[[Stephen Hicks|Hicks, Stephen]]. (2004). ''Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault''. Scholargy Press, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[postmodern]] studies have argued that the body of scholarship is [[bias]]ed because the traditional main focus of academic studies of [[Western culture]] and history has only been on works produced by Western [[Patriarchy|men]].

==A classic==
[[Image:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|100ox|thumb|In painting, the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], c. 1503–1506, is the archetypal masterpiece, though it was not produced for admission to a guild or academy.]]
A [[classic]] is a book, or any other work of art, accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy, for example through an [[imprimatur]] such as being listed in a list of [[great books]], or through a reader's personal opinion. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature, music and art, etc. from all traditions, such as the [[Chinese classics]] or the [[Veda]]s. A related word is [[masterpiece]] or ''chef d'œuvre'', which in modern use refers to a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, or workmanship. Historically, the word refers to a work of a very high standard produced in order to obtain membership of a [[Guild]] or [[Academy]].

The first writer to use the term "classic" was [[Aulus Gellius]], a 2nd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writer who, in the [[miscellany]] ''Noctes Atticae'' (19, 8, 15), refers to a writer as a ''classicus scriptor, non proletarius'' ("A distinguished, not a commonplace writer"). Such classification began with the Greeks' ''ranking'' their cultural works, with the word ''[[wikt:canon|canon]]'' (ancient Greek κανών, kanṓn: "measuring rod, standard"). Moreover, early [[Christianity|Christian]] Church Fathers used ''canon'' to rank the authoritative texts of the [[New Testament]], preserving them, given the expense of [[vellum]] and [[papyrus]] and mechanical book reproduction, thus, being comprehended in a ''canon'' ensured a book's preservation as the best way to retain information about a civilization.&lt;ref name="Gellius"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gellius |first1=Aulus |title=Auli Gellii Noctes Atticae: ex editione Jacobi Gronovii, cum notis et interpretatione in usum Delphini, variis lectionibus, notis variorum, recensu editionum et codicum, et indice locupletissimo, accurate recensitae |date=1824 |publisher=curante et imprimente A.J. Valpy, A.M. |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sc5GAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=5 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/auligelliinocte02gellgoog/page/n3 |archivedate=March 25, 2008|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporarily, the Western canon defines the best of [[Western culture]]. In the ancient world, at the [[Alexandrian Library]], scholars coined the Greek term ''Hoi enkrithentes'' ("the admitted", "the included") to identify the writers in the canon.

==Literary canon (mainly)==

===Classic book===
{{List to table|date=November 2018}}
{{main article|Classic book|Great books}}
With regard to books, what makes a book "classic" has concerned various authors, from [[Mark Twain]] to [[Italo Calvino]], and questions such as "Why Read the Classics?", and "What Is a Classic?" have been considered by others, including Calvino, [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], [[Michael Dirda]], and [[Ezra Pound]].

The terms "classic book" and Western canon are closely related concepts, but are not necessarily synonymous. A "canon" is a list of books considered to be "essential", and it can be published as a collection (such as [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Modern Library]], [[Everyman's Library]], or [[Penguin Classics]]), presented as a list with an academic's imprimatur (such as [[Harold Bloom]]'s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bloom, Harold|title= The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|location= New York|publisher= Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|date= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or be the official reading list of a university.

Some of the writers who are generally considered the most important in [[Western literature]] are [[Homer]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]],  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[François Rabelais]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Molière]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[John Milton]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Stendhal]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Herman Melville]], [[George Eliot]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[T.S. Eliot]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Fernando Pessoa]], [[Albert Camus]] and [[Samuel Beckett]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]], ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]'', 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304173,00.html|title=Book Review: 'The Western Canon: The Books and the School of the Ages'; Books|work=EW.com|date=21 October 1994|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Bloom]] has divided the body of Western Literature into four ages&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonic.net/~rteeter/grtbloom.html|title=Bloom. Western Canon|first=Teeter,|last=Robert|date=|website=sonic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

*The Theocratic Age (2000 BC - 1321 AD), with five main traditions that influenced the West:
**The Ancient Near East; e.g. ''[[Gilgamesh]]'', ''[[The Book of the Dead]]'' and the ''[[Bible]]''

**United States; e.g. ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' ([[Mark Twain]]) and ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' ([[Herman Melville]])

*The Chaotic Age (1900-today), which includes a multitude of countries and authors.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Great Books Program===
[[Image:Great Books.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' in 60 volumes]]
A university or college [[Great Books]] Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s by Prof. [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] of [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |title=radicalacademy.com |publisher=radicalacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western [[liberal arts]] tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included [[Robert Hutchins]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Jacques Barzun]], and [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of [[higher education]] by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.

The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's ''Republic'', or Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.

Over 100 institutions of higher learning, mostly in the United States, offer some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casement|first=William|title=College Great Books Programs|url=http://www.coretexts.org/college-great-books-programs/#tz|publisher=The Association for Core Texts and Courses (ACTC)|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate===
{{anchor|Dead white men}}
There has been an ongoing debate, especially in the US, over the nature and status of the canon since at least the 1960s, much of which is rooted in [[critical theory]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Hicks 2004 p. 18"/&gt; In particular, [[postmodern]] studies have argued that the body of scholarship is biased, because the main focus traditionally of the academic studies of history and [[Western culture]] has only been on Europe and men. American philosopher [[Jay Stevenson]] argues:
:[In] the postmodern period […] [t]raditional literature has been found to have been written by "dead white males" to serve the ''ideological'' aims of a conservative and repressive Anglo ''hegemony'' […] In an array of reactions against the race, gender, and class biases found to be woven into the tradition of Anglo lit, multicultural writers and political literary theorists have sought to expose, resist, and redress injustices and prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Stevenson|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to English Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoL1Di1HRBIC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2007|publisher=Alpha Books|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classicist]] [[Bernard Knox]] made direct reference to this topic when he delivered his 1992 [[Jefferson Lecture]] (the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]).&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved May 25, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Knox used the intentionally "provocative" title "The Oldest Dead White European Males"&lt;ref&gt;Nadine Drozan, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/06/style/chronicle-879492.html  "Chronicle"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 6, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; as the title of his lecture and his subsequent book of the same name, in both of which Knox defended the continuing relevance of [[Classics|classical]] culture to modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Knox, ''The Oldest Dead White European Males and Other Reflections on the Classics'' (1993) (reprint, W.

Some intellectuals have championed a "high conservative modernism" that insists that universal truths exist, and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald J. Russello, ''The Postmodern Imagination of Russell Kirk'' (2007) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Many argued that "[[natural law]]" was the repository of timeless truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyrum S.

Bloom further comments: "But one thing is certain: wherever the Great Books make up a central part of the curriculum, the students are excited and satisfied."&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bloom (2008), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was widely cited by some intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by [[cultural relativism|cultural relativists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Keith Booker|title=Encyclopedia of Literature and Politics: A–G|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcFC4oiDmpgC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood|pages=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Williams, ed. ''PC wars: Politics and theory in the academy'' (Routledge, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yale University]] Professor of Humanities and famous literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] (no relation) has also argued strongly in favor of the canon, in his 1994 book ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]'',  and in general the canon remains as a represented idea in many institutions,&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt; though its implications continue to be debated.

Defenders maintain that those who undermine the canon do so out of primarily political interests, and that such criticisms are misguided and/or disingenuous. As [[John Searle]], Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, has written:
{{Quote|There is a certain irony in this [i.e., politicized objections to the canon] in that earlier student generations, my own for example, found the critical tradition that runs from [[Socrates]] through the [[The Federalist Papers|''Federalist Papers'']], through the writings of [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]], down to the twentieth century, to be liberating from the stuffy conventions of traditional American politics and pieties. Precisely by inculcating a critical attitude, the "canon" served to demythologize the conventional pieties of the American bourgeoisie and provided the student with a perspective from which to critically analyze American culture and institutions. Ironically, the same tradition is now regarded as oppressive. The texts once served an unmasking function; now we are told that it is the texts which must be unmasked.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;Searle, John. (1990) "The Storm Over the University", ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the main objections to a canon of literature is the question of authority; who should have the power to determine what works are worth reading? Searle's rebuttal suggests that "one obvious difficulty with it [i.e., arguments against hierarchical ranking of books] is that if it were valid, it would argue against any set of required readings whatever; indeed, any list you care to make about anything automatically creates two categories, those that are on the list and those that are not."&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt;

[[Charles Altieri]], of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], states that canons are "an institutional form for exposing people to a range of idealized attitudes." It is according to this notion that work may be removed from the canon over time to reflect the contextual relevance and thoughts of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-literary-canon.htm|title=What is a Literary Canon? (with pictures)|author=|date=|website=wisegeek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; American historian [[Todd M. Compton]] argues that canons are always communal in nature; that there are limited canons for, say a literature survey class, or an English department reading list, but there is no such thing as one absolute canon of literature. Instead, there are many conflicting canons. He regards Bloom's "Western Canon" as a personal canon only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toddmcompton.com/infinitecanonsprint.htm Compton, "''Infinite Canons: A Few Axioms and Questions, and in Addition, a Proposed Definition. A response to Harold Bloom''"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of defining the boundaries of the canon is endless. The philosopher [[John Searle]] has said, "In my experience there never was, in fact, a fixed 'canon'; there was rather a certain set of tentative judgments about what had importance and quality. Such judgments are always subject to revision, and in fact they were constantly being revised."&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt; One of the notable attempts at compiling an authoritative canon for literature in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world was the ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' program. This program, developed in the middle third of the 20th century, grew out of the curriculum at the [[University of Chicago]]. University president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] and his collaborator [[Mortimer Adler]] developed a program that offered reading lists, books, and organizational strategies for reading clubs to the general public.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} An earlier attempt had been made in 1909 by [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W. Eliot]], with the [[Harvard Classics]], a 51-volume anthology of classic works from world literature. Eliot's view was the same as that of Scottish philosopher and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]]: "The true University of these days is a Collection of Books". ("The Hero as Man of Letters", 1840)

===In the English-speaking world===

==== British renaissance poetry ====

{{main article|Elizabethan literature|Metaphysical poets}}
The canon of Renaissance English poetry of the 16th and early 17th century has always been in some form of flux and towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was criticized, especially by those who wished to expand it to include, for example, more women writers.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Gary F.|title=English Poetry of the Sixteenth Century|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0582090962|pages=263–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9gFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Waller,+Gary.+English+Poetry+of+the+Sixteenth+Century|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the central figures of the British renaissance canon remain, [[Edmund Spenser]], Sir [[Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and [[John Donne]].&lt;ref&gt;"English Poetry" James P. Bednarz. Oxford Bibliographies [http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0209.xml]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[John Donne|Donne]], and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] were major influences on 17th-century poetry. However, poet [[John Dryden]] condemned aspects of the metaphysical poets in his criticism. In the 18th century [[Metaphysical poetry]] fell into further disrepute,&lt;ref&gt;"Life of Cowley," in Samuel Johnson's ''Lives of the Poets''&lt;/ref&gt; while the interest in [[Elizabethan literature|Elizabethan poetry]] was rekindled through the scholarship of [[Thomas Warton]] and others. However, the canon of Renaissance poetry was formed in the Victorian period with anthologies like Palgrave's ''[[Golden Treasury]]''.&lt;ref&gt; Gary F. Waller, (2013). ''English Poetry of the Sixteenth Century''. London: Routledge. p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Yvor Winters]] were two literary critics who were especially concerned with revising the canon of renaissance English literature. Eliot, for example, championed poet [[Sir John Davies]] in an article in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' in 1926. During the course of the 1920s, Eliot did much to establish the importance of the metaphysical school, both through his critical writing and by applying their method in his own work. However, by 1961 [[A. Alvarez]] was commenting that "it may perhaps be a little late in the day to be writing about the Metaphysicals. The great vogue for Donne passed with the passing of the Anglo-American experimental movement in modern poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later, a hostile view was expressed that emphasis on their importance had been an attempt by Eliot and his followers to impose a 'high Anglican and royalist literary history' on 17th-century English poetry.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Brown &amp; Taylor (2004), ''ODNB''&lt;/ref&gt;

The American critic [[Yvor Winters]] suggested in 1939 an alternative canon of [[Elizabethan poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258-72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; which would exclude the famous representatives of the [[Petrarchan|Petrarchan school]] of poetry, represented by Sir [[Philip Sidney]] and [[Edmund Spenser]]. Winters claimed that the Native or Plain Style ''anti-Petrarchan'' movement had been undervalued and argued that [[George Gascoigne]] (1525–1577) "deserves to be ranked […] among the six or seven greatest lyric poets of the century, and perhaps higher".&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258–72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967: 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was increasingly under fire.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Expansion of the literary canon in the 20th century===
In the twentieth century there was a general reassessment of the [[literary canon]], including [[Women's writing in English|women's writing]], [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of historically marginalized groups. This reassessment has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western literary canon has also expanded to include the literature of Asia, Africa, the [[Middle East]], and South America. Writers from countries like Turkey, China, Egypt, Peru, and Colombia, Japan, etc., have received Nobel prizes since the late 1960s. Writers from Asia and Africa have also been nominated for, and also won, the [[List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize for Fiction|Booker prize]] in recent years. 

==== Feminism and the literary canon ====
{{See also|Écriture féminine|List of American feminist literature|List of feminist literature|List of feminist poets}}
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] at [[Balzac]] Memorial ]]
The feminist movement produced both feminist fiction and non-fiction and created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-04854-8 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in Britain and America at least women achieved major literary success from the late eighteenth century, and many major nineteenth-century British novelists were women, including [[Jane Austen]], the [[Brontës|Brontë family]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], and [[Mary Ann Evans|George Eliot]]. There were also three major female poets, [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]],&lt;ref name="Leighton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela Leighton|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wHp90dJD7fkC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-25451-1|pages=8–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christina Rossetti]] and [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref name="Bloo9"&gt;Bloom (1999), 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1966), 122&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century there were also many major female writers, including [[Katherine Mansfield]], [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Eudora Welty]], and [[Marianne Moore]]. Notable female writers in France include [[Colette]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]; and in Russia, [[Anna Akhmatova]].

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early 20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation.

====Black authors====
In the twentieth century, the Western literary canon started to include black writers not only from [[African-American literature|black American writers]], but also from the [[African diaspora|wider black diaspora]] of writers in Britain, France, Latin America, and Africa. This is largely due to the shift in social and political views during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States.  The first global recognition came in 1950 when [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] was the first black American to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Literature. [[Chinua Achebe]]'s novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' helped draw attention to [[African literature]]. Nigerian [[Wole Soyinka]] was the first African to win the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature in 1986, and American [[Toni Morrison]] was the first black woman to win in 1993.

Some early American [[Black writers]] were inspired to defy ubiquitous racial prejudice by proving themselves equal to white American authors. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has said, "it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"&gt;"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States. Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as "something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"/&gt; This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination. By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the [[African diaspora]], African-American literature broke "the mystique of connection between literary authority and [[patriarchal]] power."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Marjorie Pryse in "The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz, from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. This view of African-American literature as a tool in the struggle for Black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades, most famously by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref name = "jhu_theory"&gt;Mason, [http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html "African-American Theory and Criticism"] (accessed July 6, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia and Africa====
Since the 1960s the Western literary canon has been expanded to include writers from Asia, Africa, the Middle East. This is reflected in the Nobel prizes awarded in literature.

[[Yasunari Kawabata]] (1899 – 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yasunari Kawabata - Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1968/kawabata-facts.html|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[novelist]] and [[short story]] writer whose spare, lyrical, subtly-shaded prose works won him the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1968, the first Japanese author to receive the award. His works have enjoyed broad international appeal and are still widely read.

[[Naguib Mahfouz]] (1911 &amp;ndash; 2006) was an [[Egypt]]ian writer who won the 1988 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. He is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers of [[Arabic literature]], along with [[Tawfiq el-Hakim]], to explore themes of [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Haim Gordon|title=Naguib Mahfouz's Egypt: Existential Themes in His Writings|url=http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336/0313268762|accessdate=2007-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927042834/http://doi.contentdirections.com/mr/greenwood.jsp?doi=10.1336%2F0313268762|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of movie scripts, and five plays over a 70-year career. Many of his works have been made into [[Egyptian cinema|Egyptian]] and foreign films.

[[Kenzaburō Ōe]] (b. 1935) is a Japanese writer and a major figure in contemporary [[Japanese literature]]. His novels, short stories, and essays, strongly influenced by French and American literature and [[literary theory]], deal with political, social, and philosophical issues, including [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[nuclear power]], [[anticonformism|social non-conformism]], and [[existentialism]]. Ōe was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1994 for creating "an [[imaginary world|imagined world]], where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today".&lt;ref name="shimbun2008"&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080518dy01.htm "Oe, Pamuk: World needs imagination"], Yomiuri.co.jp; May 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latin America====
[[Octavio Paz Lozano]] (1914&amp;nbsp;– 1998) was a Mexican poet and diplomat. For his body of work, he was awarded the 1981 [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], the 1982 [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]], and the 1990 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

[[Gabriel García Márquez]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/garcia+marquez "García Márquez"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  (1927 – 2014) was a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist. Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century and one of the best in the [[Spanish literature|Spanish language]], he was awarded the 1972 [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] and the 1982 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1982/ | title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1982 | accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

García Márquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' (1967), ''[[The Autumn of the Patriarch]]'' (1975), and ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as [[magic realism]], which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called [[Macondo]] (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace [[Aracataca]]), and most of them explore the theme of [[solitude]].

==Canon of Western philosophers==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}

{{see also|List of important publications in philosophy}} 

The discussion of the literary canon above, especially with regard to "Great Book" and the "debate" over the canon, is also relevant.

[[Ancient Greek philosophy]] has consistently held a prominent place in the canon. Only a relatively small number of works of Greek philosophy have survived, essentially those thought most worth copying in the Middle Ages. [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and, indirectly, [[Socrates]] are the primary figures. [[Roman philosophy]] is included, but regarded as less significant (as it tended to be even by the Romans themselves).  The [[ancient philosophy]] of other cultures now receives more attention than before the 20th century.  The vast body of [[Christian philosophy]] is typically represented on reading lists mainly by Saints [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the 12th-century Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] is now usually represented, mostly by ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]''. The academic canon of [[early modern philosophy]] generally includes [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], though influential contributions to philosophy were made by many thinkers in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Aloysius Martinich, Fritz Allhoff, Anand Vaidya, ''Early modern philosophy: essential readings with commentary''. Oxford : Blackwell, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women in philosophy|Women have engaged in philosophy]] throughout the field's history. There were female [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, notably [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active c. 325 BC) and [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC), and some were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, but almost no female philosophers have entered the philosophical Western canon.&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane.

While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greeks===
Many [[philosopher]]s today agree that Greek philosophy has influenced much of [[Western culture]] since its inception. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] once noted: "The safest general characterization of the [[Europe]]an philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to [[Plato]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead (1929), ''[[Process and Reality]]'', Part II, Chap. I, Sect. I.&lt;/ref&gt; Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]] to [[Early Islamic philosophy]], the European [[Renaissance]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141031222017/http://kevinscharp.com/Kevin%20Scharp%20-%20%20Diagrams.htm Kevin Scharp (Department of Philosophy, Ohio State University) – Diagrams].&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophy was probably influenced by the philosophy and mythological cosmogonies of the [[ancient Near East]], as well as Indian Vedanta philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[Plato]] was a [[philosopher]] in [[Classical Greece]] and the founder of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in the [[Western world]]. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the [[Western philosophy|Western tradition]], unlike nearly all of his [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophical contemporaries]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his invention" ({{cite web |last=Kraut |first=Richard |title=Plato |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/ |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |publisher=Stanford University |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=3 April 2014 |ref=harv}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John M.; Hutchinson, D. S., eds. (1997): "Introduction".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] and scientist. His writings cover many subjects –&amp;nbsp;including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[Aristotle's biology|biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], politics and government—and constitute the first comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name="philosophy1972"&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] had a profound influence on medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and his views were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as "The First Teacher" ({{lang-ar|{{big|المعلم الأول}}}}). His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cicero |first=Marcus Tullius |publication-date=1874 |origyear=106–43 BC |chapter=Book II, chapter XXXVIII, §119 |title=The Academica of Cirero  |editor-first=James S. |editor-last=Reid  |location=London |publisher=Macmillian and company |ref=harv}} "''veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles''", (Google translation: "Aristotle will come pouring forth a golden stream of eloquence")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian philosophy===

Major Western writers and philosophers have been influenced by [[Eastern philosophy]]. 

Through his teacher [[Ammonius Saccas]] (died {{circa|AD 265}}, the Greek speaking philosopher [[Plotinus]] may have been influenced by Indian thought, because of the similarities between [[neoplatonism]] and the [[Vedanta]] philosophies of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bussanich. The roots of Platonism and Vedanta. International Journal of Hindu Studies. January 2005, Volume 9, Issue 1, pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R.

===Renaissance philosophy===
Major philosophers of the [[Renaissance]] include [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Galileo Galilei]].

===Seventeenth-century philosophers===
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
The seventeenth century was important for philosophy, and the major figures were [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626), [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679), [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677), [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716),  and [[Isaac Newton]] (1642– c.1726).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Western Philosophy", [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy/Modern-philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eighteenth-century philosophers===
Major philosophers of the eighteenth century include [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), [[David Hume]] (1711–1776), [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832), [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Nineteenth-century philosophers===
Important nineteenth century philosophers include [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770-1831), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813-1855), [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900).

===Twentieth-century philosophers===

Major twentieth century figures are [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859-1938), [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872-1970), [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889-1976) and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (1889–1951). A porous distinction between [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Continental philosophy|continental]] approaches emerged during this period. The term "continental" is misleading, as many prominent British philosophers such as [[R. G. Collingwood]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] were non-analytic, and many non-British European philosophers like [[Wittgenstein]] were analytic. Moreover, analytic approaches are dominant in the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Germany, and parts of east-central Europe today. Some argue in English-speaking countries, it is better to distinguish between the dominant approaches of university departments, where Modern Language departments tend to favor continental methods and philosophy department tends to favor analytic ones. However, the humanities/social sciences departments in general such as history, sociology, anthropology, and political science departments in English-speaking countries tend to favor continental methods such as those by [[Michel Foucault]] (1926-1984), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930-2002) and [[Jürgen Habermas]] (1929- ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most cited authors of books|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/most-cited-authors-of-books-in-the-humanities-2007/405956.article|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the most-cited publications in the social sciences (according to Google Scholar)?|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female philosophers have begun to gain prominence in the last hundred years. Notable female philosophers from the contemporary period include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), and [[Martha Nussbaum]] (1947–  ).

==Classical music==
[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach.jpg|left|thumb|[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] ]]
The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as a golden age. In addition to Bach and Beethoven, the other major figures from this period were [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from about 1836.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"&gt;"Classical", ''The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'', ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), ''Oxford Reference Online''. Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical music]], during the nineteenth century a "canon" developed which focused on what was felt to be the most important works written since 1600, with a great concentration on the later part of this period, termed the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], which is generally taken to begin around 1750. After Beethoven, the major nineteenth-century composers include [[Robert Schumann]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Top Romantic Composers".''Gramapne'' [https://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/top-10-romantic-composers].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the standard concert repertoire of professional orchestras, chamber music groups, and choirs tends to focus on works by a relatively small number of mainly 18th- and 19th-century male composers. Many of the works deemed to be part of the musical canon are from genres regarded as the most ''serious'', such as the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[string quartet]], and [[opera]]. [[Folk music]] was already giving [[art music]] melodies, and from the late 19th century, in an atmosphere of increasing [[nationalism]], folk music began to influence composers in formal and other ways, before being admitted to some sort of status in the canon itself.

Since the early twentieth century [[non-Western music]] has begun to influence Western composers. In particular, direct homages to [[Java]]nese [[gamelan music]] are found in works for western instruments by [[Claude Debussy]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[John Cage]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 Western Artists and Gamelan]", ''CoastOnline.org''.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307082145/http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debussy was immensely interested in non-Western music and its approaches to composition. Specifically, he was drawn to the Javanese [[Gamelan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rest Is Noise|last=Ross|first=Alex|publisher=Fourth Estate|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84115-475-6|location=London|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which he first heard at the 1889 Paris Exposition. He was not interested in directly quoting his non-Western influences, but instead allowed this non-Western aesthetic to generally influence his own musical work, for example, by frequently using quiet, unresolved dissonances, coupled with the damper pedal, to emulate the "shimmering" effect created by a [[gamelan]] ensemble. American composer Philip Glass was not only influenced by the eminent French composition teacher [[Nadia Boulanger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard|last=Kostelanetz|year=1989|editor-first=Richard|editor-last=Kostelanetz|title=Writings on Glass|chapter=Philip Glass|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|page=109|isbn=0-520-21491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the Indian musicians [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Alla Rakha]], His distinctive style arose from his work with Shankar and Rakha and their perception of rhythm in Indian music as being entirely additive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Joan|last=La Barbara|year=1989|editor-first=Richard|editor-last=Kostelanetz|title=Writings on Glass|chapter=Philip Glass and Steve Reich: Two from the Steady State School|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|pages=40–41|isbn=0-520-21491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the latter half of the 20th century the canon expanded to cover the so-called [[Early music]] of the pre-classical period, and [[Baroque music]] by composers other than Bach and [[George Frideric Handel]]. including [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[François Couperin]], [[Heinrich Schütz]], and [[Dieterich Buxtehude]]. Earlier composers, such as [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus]] and [[William Byrd]], have also received more attention in the last hundred years.{{Citation needed|reason=List of names with no source|date=January 2017}}

The absence of female composers from the canon has been debated in the twentieth century, even though there have been [[women composers|female composers]] throughout the classical music period.  Marcia J Citron, for example, has examined "the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women [sic] composers from the received 'canon' of performed musical works."&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Marcia J. "Gender and the Musical Canon." CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the music of [[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098–1179), a German Benedictine abbess, has been rediscovered, and both the Russian [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (born 1931) and Finnish [[Kaija Saariaho]] (born 1952) have achieved international reputations. Saariaho's opera ''[[L'amour de loin]]'' has been staged in some of the world's major opera houses, including The [[English National Opera]] (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Fiona Maddocks | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/12/rusalka-glyndebourne-opera-review-coliseum | title=Singin' through the pain | work=The Guardian | date=2009-07-11 | accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York.

{{main article|Art history}}
The backbone of traditional Western [[art history]] are [[artwork]]s commissioned by wealthy patrons for private or public enjoyment. Much of this was religious art, mostly [[Roman Catholic art]]. The [[classical art]] of Greece and Rome has, since the Renaissance, been the fount of the Western tradition.

[[Giorgio Vasari]] (1511–1574) is the originator of the artistic canon and the originator of many of the concepts it embodies.  His ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' covers only artists working in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;With nods in the text to [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]], but not lives.&lt;/ref&gt; with a strong pro-Florentine prejudice, and has cast a long shadow over succeeding centuries.  Northern European art has arguably never quite caught up to Italy in terms of prestige, and Vasari's placing of [[Giotto]] as the founding father of "modern" painting has largely been retained.  In painting, the rather vague term of [[Old master]] covers painters up to about the time of [[Goya]].

This "canon" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection present in art history textbooks, as well as the prices obtained in the [[art trade]]. But there have been considerable swings in what is valued. In the 19th century the [[Baroque]] fell into great disfavour, but it was revived from around the 1920s, by which time the [[Academic art|art]] of the 18th and 19th century was largely disregarded. The [[High Renaissance]], which Vasari regarded as the greatest period, has always retained its prestige, including works by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]], but the succeeding period of [[Mannerism]] has fallen in and out of favour. 

In the 19th century the beginnings of academic art history, led by German universities, led to much better understanding and appreciation of [[medieval art]], and a more nuanced understanding of classical art, including the realization that many if not most treasured masterpieces of sculpture were late Roman copies rather than Greek originals. The European tradition of art was expanded to include [[Byzantine art]] and the new discoveries of [[archaeology]], notably [[Etruscan art]], [[Celtic art]] and [[Upper Paleolithic art]].

Since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of art made by women; vernacular creativity, especially in printed media; and an expansion to include works in the Western tradition produced outside Europe.  At the same time there has been a much greater appreciation of non-Western traditions, including their place with Western art in wider global or [[Eurasia]]n traditions. The [[decorative arts]] have traditionally had a much lower critical status than [[fine art]], although often highly valued by collectors, and still tend to be given little prominence in undergraduate studies or popular coverage on television and in print.

===Women and art===

====Historical exclusion of Women====
Women were discriminated against in terms of obtaining the training necessary to be an artist in the mainstream Western traditions. In addition, since the Renaissance the [[Nude (art)|nude]], more often than not female,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} has had a special position as subject matter. In her 1971 essay, "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]", [[Linda Nochlin]] analyzes what she sees as the embedded privilege in the predominantly male Western art world and argues that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|author-link=Linda Nochlin|chapter=[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]|title=Women, Art and Power and Other Essays|year=1971|publisher=Westview Press|url=&lt;!-- |accessdate = 2014-11-28 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt;

In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, and questioned which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Atkins |first1= Robert |author-link1= |year= 2013|title= Artspeak: A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present |edition= 3rd|location= New York|publisher= Abbeville Press |isbn= 9780789211507 |oclc=855858296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is articulated by artist [[Judy Chicago]]:
"[I]t is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chicago|first1=Judy|author-link1=Judy Chicago|last2=Lucie-Smith|first2=Edward|author-link2=Edward Lucie-Smith|title=Women and Art: Contested Territory|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-5852-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary anthologies of renaissance literature====
The preface to the [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] anthology of ''Renaissance Literature'' from 2003 acknowledges the importance of online access to literary texts on the selection of what to include, meaning that the selection can be made on basis of functionality rather than representativity".&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Payne &amp; John Hunter (eds). Renaissance Literature: an anthology''. Oxford: Blackell, 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-19897-0}}, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; This anthology has made its selection based on three principles. One is "unabashedly ''canonical''", meaning that Sidney, Spenser, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Jonson have been given the space prospective users would expect. A second principle is "non-canonical", giving female writers such as [[Anne Askew]], [[Elizabeth Cary, Lady Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]], [[Emilia Lanier]], [[Martha Moulsworth]], and [[Lady Mary Wroth]] a representative selection. It also includes texts that may not be representative of the qualitatively best efforts of Renaissance literature, but of the quantitatively most numerous texts, such as homilies and erotica. A third principle has been thematic, so that the anthology aims to include texts that shed light on issues of special interest to contemporary scholars.

The Blackwell anthology is still firmly organised around authors, however. A different strategy has been observed by ''The Penguin Book of Renaissance Verse'' from 1992.&lt;ref&gt;''David Norbrook &amp; H. R. Woudhuysen (eds.): ''The Penguin Book of Renaissance Verse''. London: Penguin Books, 1992, {{ISBN|0-14-042346-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the texts are organised according to topic, under the headings ''The Public World'', ''Images of Love'', ''Topographies'', ''Friends, Patrons and the Good Life'', ''Church, State and Belief'', ''Elegy and Epitaph'', ''Translation'', ''Writer, Language and Public''. It is arguable that such an approach is more suitable for the interested reader than for the student. While the two anthologies are not directly comparable, since the Blackwell anthology also includes prose and the Penguin anthology goes up to 1659, it is telling that while the larger Blackwell anthology contains work by 48 poets, seven of which are women, the Penguin anthology contains 374 poems by 109 poets, including 13 women and one poet each in Welsh, [[Siôn Phylip]], and Irish, [[Eochaidh Ó Heóghusa]].

'''William Greet''' (1851 &amp;ndash; 25 April 1914) was a British theatre manager from the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century. Originally a business manager for other theatre licensees in the 1880s, he branched out as an independent manager in the 1890s and was associated with various London theatres, principally the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric]], the [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]] and the [[Adelphi Theatre]]s.

==Biography==
Greet was the seventh child and eldest son of Captain Wiliam Greet [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], commander of the recruiting ship H.M.S. Crocodile, and the former Sarah Vallance Barling.  Greet's younger brother was the actor-manager [[Ben Greet]]. Greet was born on his father's ship, christened at [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]] at the [[Tower of London]], and educated at the [[Royal Naval School]], [[New Cross]].  He served as a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Marine Artillery]] from 1871 to 1877.  

===Career===
He worked first as a farmer and then began working in theatre management in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pnlowe/egerton/g0000006.html#I342 William Greet] at Rootsweb&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1884 and 1890, Greet was successively business manager at the [[Folly Theatre|Toole's Theatre]] under its licensee, [[J. L. Toole]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 28 December 1884, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Novelty Theatre]] (licensee, [[Willie Edouin]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 22 November 1885, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royalty Theatre]] (licensee, [[Kate Santley]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/evanion/FullImage.aspx?EvanID=024-000001699&amp;ImageId=50659 British Library catalogues]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]] (licensee, Horace Sedger),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 January 1888, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1890 to 1894 the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], also for Sedger, with whom Greet's wife collaborated on a stage adaptation of the novel ''The Little Squire''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 October 1890 and 6 April 1894&lt;/ref&gt;

Greet became a producer and theatre manager in his own right in 1894, as licensee of the [[Playhouse Theatre|Avenue Theatre]], starting successfully with the long-running ''[[Dandy Dick Whittington]]'' by [[George R. Sims]] and [[Ivan Caryll]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 November 1894, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and a popular comedy by [[F. C. Burnand]], ''Mrs Ponderbury's Past'' (later billed as ''Mrs Ponderbury''), directed by and starring [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 4 November 1895 and 2 March 1896&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1896, Greet gave up the licence at the Avenue and moved to the Lyric, where he presented the long-running ''The Sign of the Cross'' by [[Wilson Barrett]], also producing an American tour of the play.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 29 August 1896, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed that success with another, ''Dandy Dan the Lifeguardsman'' by [[Basil Hood]] and [[Walter Slaughter]], starring [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]] and [[W. H. Denny]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 6 January 1898, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Greet sat on the Board of Directors of The Lyceum Theatre Ltd. from 1899 until 1902.&lt;ref name=irving&gt;[http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/landlord.htm The Irving Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Greet leased the [[Savoy Theatre]] from [[Helen Carte]], the widow of [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].  He then managed the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s revival of ''[[Iolanthe]]'' at the Savoy and its production of several new [[comic opera]]s including ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'', ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902) and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (1903), both at the Savoy and on tour.  At the same time, he also leased the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] in London, producing ''Mice and Men'' in 1902, ''The Light that Failed'' in 1903 and [[Edwardian musical comedy|the musical comedies]] ''The Medal and the Maid'' (1903), and ''[[The Duchess of Dantzic]]'' (1904).  He also leased the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London, where he produced the hit musicals ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (operetta)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' and ''[[Morocco Bound]]'', both in 1902.

Greet continued to produce musical comedies and operettas, many of them very successful, including ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] (1903), ''The Talk of the Town'' (1905, Lyric Theatre), ''Blue Moon'' (1905, Lyric), ''The Sign of the Cross'' (Terriss Theatre), ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1908), ''A White Man'' (1908, Lyric), ''Little Hans Andersen'' (1909, by [[Basil Hood]]), ''The Fires of Fate'' (1909, Lyric), ''The Rivals'' (1910, Lyric), ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'' (1910, Lyric), ''Baby Mine'' (1911, [[Vaudeville Theatre]]), ''Nightbirds'' (1911, Lyric), and ''[[The Girl in the Taxi]]'' (1912, Lyric).

Greet died in [[Bournemouth]] at the age of 62 and was buried at [[Shillingford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~pnlowe/egerton/g0000002.html#I342 Rootsweb]&lt;/ref&gt;

What later came to be known as the '''William and Mary style''' is a [[furniture]] design common from 1700 to 1725 in the [[Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of England]], the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and later, in England's [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]]. It was a transitional style between [[Mannerism|Mannerist furniture]] and [[Queen Anne style furniture|Queen Anne furniture]]. Sturdy, emphasizing both straight lines and curves, and featuring elaborate carving and [[woodturning]], the style was one of the first to imitate Asian design elements such as [[japanning]].

==About the design==
In 1688, [[James II of England]] was deposed by his daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], and her husband, [[William III of England|William of Orange]], in what came to be known as the "[[Glorious Revolution]]". From birth in 1650, William had reigned over five provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]], and Mary had lived in the Netherlands with him after their marriage in 1677.  William and Mary brought to their kingdoms a taste for Dutch furniture styles, as well as a number of Dutch furniture-makers.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} Although movement toward what would come to be called the William and Mary style had begun during the reign of [[Charles II of England]], primarily due to the influence of his [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-born queen, [[Catherine of Braganza]], the style became defined and widely accepted during the reigns of William (d. 1702) and Mary (d. 1694),{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|pages=108-109}} initially jointly and then after Mary's death, of William alone.

The William and Mary style was influenced by recent [[French furniture]] traditions, which in turn were influenced by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] furniture designs.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} William and Mary style furniture emphasized unity, so that all elements contributed to an overall shape or look. It also featured [[Relief#High relief|high relief]] carving, strong curves,{{Efn|Known as "Flemish curves".{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}}}} and elaborate [[woodturning]].{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} Despite these elements, the style was fairly squat,{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}} heavy-looking, and obviously sturdy.{{sfn|Gura|2016|page=16}} Straight lines are common.{{sfn|Gura|2016|page=16}} Paint, [[wood stain|stain]]s, or different kind of wood were used to create contrasting colors, which was another element of this style.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} [[Japanning]], a technique of [[varnish]]ing which was very popular at the time, was also used on this furniture design.{{sfn|Gura|2016|page=16}} For chairs, [[Caning (furniture)|woven cane]] seats{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=26}} and heavily-scrolled backs predominated.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}} Toward the end of the style, cane-woven seats and backs had given way to leather, and straight or slightly angled backs had given way to serpentine forms.{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}}

Other decorative arts such as architecture, ceramics, silver, and textiles could also feature elements of the William and Mary style. The design movement had an extremely positive impact on the craftsmanship and quality of British furniture.{{sfn|''Grove Dictionary of Art''|2000|page=364}}

The William and Mary style was a transitional style between Mannerist and Queen Anne furniture.{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}} The William and Mary style was very popular in Britain from 1700 to 1725,{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} and in America until about 1735.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}} It was largely supplanted in both nations by [[Queen Anne style furniture]].{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}}

===English variations===
[[Daniel Marot]], a [[French people|French]] [[Huguenots|Huguenot]], was employed by King William and Queen Mary to design furniture for them, and became deeply influential on English, Scottish, and Welsh furniture during this period.{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}} Dutch furniture craftsman [[Gerrit Jensen]] was appointed royal Cabinet Maker to the king and queen, and a great many works of his design were sold to wealthy British citizens of the day.{{sfn|''Grove Dictionary of Art''|2000|page=364}}

In Britain, case furniture{{Efn|Case furniture is any kind of furniture that suggests a box. Typical case furniture includes [[chest of drawers|bureaus]], [[cabinetry]], [[Chest (furniture)|chests]], [[cupboard]]s, [[desk]]s, and [[sideboard]]s.{{sfn|Thiel|2015|page=139}}}} in the William and Mary style tended to feature simple flat surfaces but exquisitely carved trim.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} Provincial furniture-makers in Britain moved away from the woven cane seat, and developed the [[leather]]-covered wooden seat as a [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] design.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}} Split [[Spindle (furniture)|spindles]] also came into use, first rurally and then urbanly.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}}

The [[daybed]] was developed in Britain as part of the William and Mary style.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}} So, too, was the [[writing desk]], which was an adaptation of the bureau-cabinet.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=27}}{{Efn|The bureau-cabinet consisted of a chest of drawers atop which was a smaller set of shelves, pigeon-holes, and drawers set back from the front. A panel covered these drawers at an angle; when pulled forward and down, the panel served as a writing space. Atop the second set of drawers was a much taller third set of drawers, usually concealed behind two doors.{{sfn|Campbell|2006|pages=160-162}}}}

===American variations===
[[File:Side Chair, America, c. 1700, walnut and cane - Brooklyn Museum - DSC09086.JPG|thumb|A William and Mary style chair made in America.]]
American craftsmen working in the William and Mary style favored a tapered [[Foot (furniture)|scroll foot]] for their designs.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} [[Juglans|Walnut]] and, to a lesser extent, [[maple]] were the preferred woods, with walnut [[burl]] [[Wood veneer|veneers]] and "ebonization" (black japanning) common.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=26}}

Over time, American forms of William and Mary furniture became simplified. Although the Baroque influence was still seen in the crests, feet, and scrolls, other elements and the overall look of pieces began to shed this influence in favor of plain but strong curves. American chairmakers began using woven cane in the [[Splat (furniture)|splats]] of chairs as well. For armchairs, American designers favored seats and splats covered in leather, attached with brass nails.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=26}}  In parts of America like [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], which had a heavy Dutch cultural influence, the ''[[kast (furniture)|kast]]'' became popular. The ''kast'' was of Dutch origin, and featured a large drawer in the base unit. Atop the base were shelves concealed behind one or two heavy doors. An elaborate [[cornice]] usually ran along the upper edges. Influenced by the William and Mary style, the American ''kast'' featured removable feet, simplified the cornice, and eliminated the intricate [[inlay]]s favored by the Dutch.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=27}}

The "Boston chair" became one of the best-known examples of a William and Mary style chair made in America. This spoon-back chair{{Efn|The spoon-back chair features a back which curves slightly inward and then outward as it rises. The serpentine form looks like the curvature of a spoon handle, hence the name.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=110}}}} with leather-covered seat and splat featured turned front legs and a turned [[Stretcher (furniture)|stretcher]] between them. The side and rear stretcher as well as the rear legs, however, were undecorated straight lines. The corners of the frame around the splat were usually rounded down (although not turned), and the crest was a simplified geometric or curving design. They were usually painted black or red. Made primarily in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], these chairs were manufactured in large numbers and very popular in America. They were also widely exported to Britain.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=110}} Benches and [[Couch|settees]] manufactured in America were less influenced by the William and Mary style. Panels, developed in the 1600s, were used for the seat, back, and (where used) arms, with trim and legs reflecting the new style. Leather seats were, however, sometimes added.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=26}}

Another innovation was the [[Tallboy (furniture)|highboy]].{{sfn|Gura|2016|page=16}} Essentially two chests of drawers, the lower slightly larger than the upper, American highboys often featured [[Solomonic column|Solomonic]] or [[trumpet]]-shaped legs. It was somewhat common for the faces of the drawers to have a walnut burl veneer.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=27}}

The William and Mary style lasted past the mid-1700s in rural America, often incorporating both Mannerist and Queen Anne styles. Slats began to be used in backs, and [[yoke]]-shaped crests became common.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=110}}

==Modern popularity==
The William and Mary style has long been overshadowed in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] by the far more popular styles which came after it. Few reproductions of the furniture may be found today. However, numerous examples of William and Mary style furniture can still widely be found in British rural homes.{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}}

'''Wistman's Wood''' is one of only three remote high-altitude oakwoods on [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]], [[England]]. (The other two are Black Tor Beare on the [[West Okement]] at SX565892 and Piles Copse on the [[River Erme]] at SX644620.)

==Geography==
It lies at an altitude of 380–410 metres in the valley of the [[West Dart]] River near [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]], &lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/654b7294-0f84-11e5-b968-00144feabdc0.html |title=Twisted oaks and tales on the trail of Devon's pygmy forest |last=Wilson |first=Matthew |newspaper=Financial Times |date=19 June 2015 |accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at grid reference SX612774.

The source of the [[Devonport Leat]], at a weir on the West Dart River, is just north of the wood.

==Preservation status==
This is one of the highest oakwoods in Britain and, as an outstanding example of native upland oak woodland, was selected as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="sssi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1001201|title=Natural England - SSSIs : SSSI information|publisher=www.english-nature.org.uk|accessdate=2008-10-13}} Choose "View citation" to access the citation (pdf file).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[A Nature Conservation Review|NCR site]] and forms part of the Wistman’s Wood [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|National Nature Reserve]]. The wood was also one of the primary reasons for selection of the Dartmoor [[Special Area of Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dartmoor SAC web page http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0012929&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The wood is split into three main blocks (North, Middle and South Groves or Woods), which in total cover about 3.5 ha (9 acres).&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; These occupy sheltered, south-west facing slopes, where a bank of large granite boulders ("clitter") is exposed, and pockets of acid, free-draining, brown earth soils have accumulated. It is owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; and has been managed since 1961 under a nature reserve agreement with the [[Nature Conservancy Council]], [[English Nature]] and [[Natural England]]. There is no active management, but many people visit the site on foot (mostly accessing the southern end of South Wood), and cattle and sheep have free access where the terrain permits, outside of a small fenced exclosure in South Wood.

===Flora===
The vegetation conforms mostly to W17a ''Quercus petraea-Betula pubescens-Dicranum majus'' woodland, ''Isothecium myosuroides-Diplophyllum albicans'' sub-community in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]]. The trees are mainly [[pedunculate oak]], with occasional [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]], and a very few [[Ilex aquifolium|holly]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], and [[Salix aurita|eared-willow]]. Tree branches are characteristically festooned with a variety of [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] mosses and lichens and, sometimes, by grazing-sensitive species such as [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]] and [[Polypodium vulgare|polypody]]. On the ground, boulders are usually covered by lichens and mossy patches – frequent species include ''Dicranum scoparium'', ''Hypotrachyna laevigata'', ''Rhytidiadelphus loreus'' and ''Sphaerophorus globosus'' – and, where soil has accumulated, patches of acid grassland grow with [[Galium saxatile|heath bedstraw]], [[Potentilla erecta|tormentil]] and [[Rumex acetosa|sorrel]]. In places protected from livestock, grazing-sensitive plants such as [[Oxalis acetosella|wood sorrel]], [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]], [[Luzula sylvatica|wood rush]] and [[Rubus fruticosus|bramble]] occur. A fringe of [[Pteridium aquilinum|bracken]] surrounds much of the wood, demarcating the extent of brown earth soils.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; The wood supports approximately 120 species of lichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hoare |first1=Ben |title=Wild Month |work=BBC Wildlife |date=November 2018 |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
The wood is home to a large population of [[Vipera berus|adders]].&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==History==
Wistman's Wood has been mentioned in writing for hundreds of years. It is likely a left-over from the ancient forest that covered much of Dartmoor c. 7000 BC, before [[Mesolithic]] hunter/gatherers cleared it around 5000 BC.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; Photographic and other records show that Wistman's Wood has changed considerably since the mid-19th century; at the same time climatic conditions have also generally become warmer.&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Proctor, M.C.F., Spooner, G.M. and Spooner, M. 1980. Changes in Wistman’s Wood, Devon: photographic and other evidence. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 112, Pages 43-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mountford"&gt;Mountford, E,P., Backmeroff, C.E. and Peterken, G.F. 2001. Long-term patterns of growth, mortality, regeneration and natural disturbance in Wistman’s Wood, a high altitude oakwood on Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 133, Pages 231-262.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only have the older oak trees grown from a stunted/semi-prostrate to a more ascending form, but a new generation of mostly straight-grown and single-stemmed oaks has developed. The oldest oaks appear to be 400–500 years old, and originated within a degenerating oakwood that survived in scrub form during two centuries of cold climate.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; In c. 1620 these old trees were described as "no taller than a man may touch to top with his head". Tree height increased somewhat by the mid-19th century, and during the 20th century approximately doubled (in 1997 the maximum and average height of trees was around 12 m and 7 m respectively).&lt;ref name="Mountford"/&gt; In addition, a wave of marginal new oaks arose after c. 1900, roughly doubling the area of wood. Part of the evidence for these changes comes from a permanent vegetation plot located in the southern end of South Wood. This is the oldest known of its kind in British woodland, with a small part having been recorded by Hansford Worth in 1921.&lt;ref name="Christy"&gt;Christy, M. and Worth, R.H. 1922. The ancient dwarfed oak woods of Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 54, Pages 291-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Buller Stone'', a boulder to the east of the wood, commemorates an attempt in 1866 to date the trees, when Wentworth Buller (with permission from the Duchy) felled an oak. It was estimated to be 168 years old.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==Myths, art and literature==
The wood has been the inspiration for numerous artists, poets, photographers and appears in hundreds of nineteenth century accounts. One tradition holds that it was planted by [[Isabella de Forz, Countess of Devon|Isabella de Fortibus]] (1237-93).&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; 

The wood is described in detail and discussed as a point of great interest in ''The Tree'', a 1978 essay on naturalism by English novelist [[John Fowles]].

The name of Wistman's Wood may derive from the dialect word 'wisht' meaning 'eerie/uncanny',&lt;ref name="Westwood2"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub. Grafton Books, London. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. P. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘pixie-led/haunted’.&lt;ref name="hemery"&gt;{{cite book |title=High Dartmoor |author=Eric Hemery |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |year=1983 |pages=454–455 |isbn=0-7091-8859-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary [[Wild Hunt]] in Devon is particularly associated with Wistman's Wood – the [[hellhound]]s of which are known as Yeth (Heath) or Wisht Hounds in the Devonshire dialect.&lt;ref name="Westwood"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion.
