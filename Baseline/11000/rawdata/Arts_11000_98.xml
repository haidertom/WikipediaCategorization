[[File:Fra Angelico, Fra Filippo Lippi, The Adoration of the Magi.jpg|thumb|440px|[[Fra Angelico]] and Fra [[Filippo Lippi]], ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'', c. 1440/1460]]&lt;!-- NO infobox please --&gt;
The '''''Adoration of the Magi''''' is a [[Tondo (art)|tondo]], or circular painting, of the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' assumed to be that recorded in 1492 in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in [[Florence]] as by [[Fra Angelico]].  It dates from the mid-15th century and is now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C.  Most art historians think that [[Filippo Lippi]] painted more of the original work, and that it was added to some years after by other artists, as well as including work by assistants in the workshops of both the original masters. It has been known as the '''Washington Tondo''' and '''Cook Tondo''' after a former owner, and this latter name in particular continues to be used over 50 years after the painting left the Cook collection.&lt;ref&gt;For example in 2005 by Kanter and Palladino, 282&lt;/ref&gt;

The tondo is painted in [[tempera]] on a wood panel, and the painted surface has a diameter of 137.3&amp;nbsp;cm (54 1/16 in.).  The National Gallery of Art dates it to "c. 1440/1460".&lt;ref&gt;NGA&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historians are agreed that the painting was produced over a considerable period, with significant changes in the composition, and contributions from a number of hands. While some are critical of the discordances this history has produced,&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 10–13; Kanter and Palladino, 282&lt;/ref&gt; for [[John Walker (curator)|John Walker]], the second director of the National Gallery of Art, the result was &lt;blockquote&gt;among the greatest Florentine paintings in the world. It is a climax of beauty, a summary in itself of the whole evolution of the Italian schools of painting in the first half of the fifteenth century.  For it stands at a crossroad of art.  The old style, the gay, colorful, fairy tale painting of the Middle Ages, is ending in an outburst of splendor; and the new style, scientific in observation, studious in anatomy and perspective, realistic in its portrayal of life, is beginning its long development.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Fra Angelico and Fra Filippo Lippi - The Adoration of the Magi - Google Art Project (central cropped).jpg|thumb|370px|Detail of the central area]]
The painting shows the three Magi or "kings" presenting their gifts to the infant Jesus, who is held by his mother. [[Saint Joseph]] stands beside her, and the manger, ox and ass of the usual depiction of the Nativity are behind this main group. Thus far the composition contains the inevitable components in a very standard arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 110–114; Palazzo Medici&lt;/ref&gt;

As very often, the subject has been combined with the ''[[Adoration of the Shepherds]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 114&lt;/ref&gt; who are represented by three figures in ragged dress, one behind Joseph, and two at the right side of the stable building behind.  Only the first of these is looking at Jesus and Mary, from an oblique angle almost behind them. Of the other two, the kneeling one points in the direction of the manger, well behind the sacred figures.  The manger is placed outside the stable, and the ox and ass are also in the open air.  The interior of the stable is occupied by what are presumably the Magi's horses and their grooms, removing their tack and in one case checking a horseshoe.&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo Medici&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the magi on the left a large procession of their retinues continue to arrive, passing through an arch that is part of a large ruined structure. To the right of the main group the city walls of Bethlehem run up a steep slope, with a road or path running in front of the walls.  Down this another large group, presumably more of the Magis' parties, is coming, riding on [[camel]]s and horses.&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo Medici, though they say "On the extreme right is a walled city, where the straggling tail of the Magi's cortege is clambering up a steep path with their camels", when they are clearly coming ''down'' the slope.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of townsfolk have come out through a gateway in the walls, and are looking and pointing, in one case kneeling in prayer, but all looking in a different direction from the final location of the main figures.&lt;ref&gt;Palazzo Medici; Kanter and Palladino, 282&lt;/ref&gt;
At the top of the hill a large but indistinctly painted group form a crowd, perhaps funnelling down the narrow path.
[[File:Fra Angelico and Fra Filippo Lippi - The Adoration of the Magi - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|330px|detail around the arch]]

On the top of the stable a large [[Indian peafowl|peacock]] perches, looking over his shoulder.  There are two other birds to his right, which have been identified as a [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]] seizing a [[Common pheasant|pheasant]].&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Though they look as though they too are on the roof they should be imagined as in flight in mid-air in front of it. This partly explains their discrepancy in scale with the two shepherds below them, though perhaps not entirely.

The painting is marked by several such discrepancies, to a degree that is somewhat surprising in a work of this date, and probably mostly explained by the spatial complexity of the composition, and the number of changes as it developed. The peacock's feet clearly grasp the end of a beam from the stable roof, but the bird is far too large compared to the figures and animals below him in the middle ground.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 9–10, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Another of the most obvious discrepancies in scale is around the arch to the left, between the size of the figures of the procession coming through the arch, and those of the locals and unmounted horses to the right of the arch.  Who the nearly naked youths standing on the ruins are supposed to represent has puzzled art historians,&lt;ref&gt;The NGA writes "The nudes standing on the walls remain mysterious. Perhaps they are people who were formerly outcasts but who are now brought into the welcoming fold of the new religion".&lt;/ref&gt; but their compositional function seems clearly to be to suggest a grander scale for the building than the procession through the arch would do. They also represent "an early indication of that preoccupation with human anatomy, which was to obsess Italian artists until it reached its climax with [[Michelangelo]]."&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of painting ==
[[File:Fra Angelico and Fra Filippo Lippi - The Adoration of the Magi - Google Art Project (cropped right).jpg|thumb|Detail probably including work from three phases]]
The painting as it now appears is believed to have developed in several stages.  In the usual reconstruction, first advanced by [[Bernard Berenson]],&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 76; [http://cavallinitoveronese.co.uk/general/view_artist/25 ''Cavallini to Veronese – Italian Renaissance Art''], accessed 21 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the painting was begun by Fra Angelico and his workshop, probably in the 1440s. The hand of Fra Angelico himself is detected in the face of the Virgin Mary, but other parts of the painting seem to be by assistants.  The small figures on the steep path at the right of the painting fit his workshop stylistically, and it has been pointed out that the direction they face, and in which some point, does not relate well to the composition as it is today.  The same can also be said of many of the smaller figures on the left side of the work. Angelico's workshop was very busy, and his career was dogged by a number of disputes over uncompleted commissions.  Progress on the tondo seems to have stalled. At some point, perhaps upon Angelico's death in 1455, the unfinished work appears to have passed to the workshop of Filippo Lippi, the other main Florentine painter of the period.  Both Angelico and Lippi worked on other commissions for the [[Medici family]], then at the peak of their wealth and power.&lt;ref&gt;NGA; Sale, 4–7; Kanter and Palladino, 282–283&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole stable has been described as "an awkward later addition", perhaps occupying a space once intended for the main figures,&lt;ref&gt;Kanter and Palladino, 282–283, 283 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; and the peacock and other birds on the roof of the stable are painted over finished areas, rather than areas "reserved" as would be the case if they had been planned from the start. They appear to come from an even later phase of painting, and have been connected with emblems adopted by [[Cosimo de' Medici]]'s sons [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]] (1416–1469) and [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni]] (1421–1463).  The former used a [[falcon]] holding a ring, with the motto "SEMPER" ("always" or "for ever" in Latin) and the latter a peacock with the motto "REGARDE-MOI" ("Watch me" in French).&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the dog on the grass at the bottom of the painting, they were perhaps added by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]] around the time he was working on the famous [[fresco]] cycle of the [[Magi Chapel]] in the Medici Palace in 1459–61.  Gozzoli was a former member of Fra Angelico's workshop who by then ran his own studio.  The chapel frescos also centre on elaborate processions of the Magi, and include several birds, and feathers, one of which is a goshawk, and another a peacock in a very similar pose to the one in the tondo.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 7–13&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Gozzoli magi.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Eastern wall of the Medici [[Magi chapel]], ''The Procession of the Youngest Magi'', 1459–61, [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]]]
The painting has been generally identified with one recorded in an inventory of the contents of the Medici Palace made in 1492 after the death of [[Lorenzo the Magnificent]], by which time the painting was several decades old.  It was in one of the ground floor "grand rooms" that also contained the three large paintings of ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' that are the best known works of [[Paolo Uccello]], and are now divided between London, Paris and Florence.  It was given a larger value than these, or any other painting in the palace:&lt;ref&gt;NGA&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A large tondo with a gilt frame depicting our Lady and our Lord and the Magi who come to make an offering, from the hand of fra'Giovanni: [[Florin (Italian coin)|f.]]  100.&lt;ref&gt;Stapleford, 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From at least the late 16th century it belonged to the Florentine [[Guicciardini]] family, but it was sold in July 1810 to Chevalier François-Honoré Dubois, chief of police in Florence during the [[Napoleon]]ic occupation, described as by [[Botticelli]].  It was sold again in London in 1826 and then remained in England until World War II, passing through a number of collections, and attributed to a number of artists: Fra Angelico in 1826, Filippo Lippi in 1849, [[Filippino Lippi]] in 1874. It ended in the important collection of [[Francis Cook, 1st Viscount of Monserrate|Sir Francis Cook]] and subsequent [[Cook Baronets]] in [[Doughty House]], [[Richmond, Surrey]]. In 1941 it was one of 25 pictures from the Cook collection sent to the United States for safe-keeping during the war.  It was due to return in 1947 but was sold just before the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 41; [http://cavallinitoveronese.co.uk/general/view_artist/25 ''Cavallini to Veronese – Italian Renaissance Art''], accessed 21 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought by the [[Samuel H. Kress]] Foundation, New York (attributed to Filippo Lippi), and in 1952 it was donated to the National Gallery of Art.&lt;ref&gt;NGA Provenance; Palazzo Medici&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography and context==
[[File:Domenico Veneziano - The Adoration of the Magi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Domenico Veneziano]], ''Adoration of the Magi'', [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]], probably a Medici commission of c. 1439–1442]]
A high quality Florentine tondo featuring the Magi would be suspected of originating with a Medici commission even without the evidence of the inventory, as the family had a very particular interest in both the subject and the form.  The Magi had been the key Medici devotion for decades, apparently beginning with the papacy of [[Antipope John XXIII]] (1410–1415) when they had become the main bankers of the Papacy, or at least those parts John controlled. The Medici belonged to the ''Compagnia de' Magi'', a Florentine [[confraternity]] based at the [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]] complex just by the Medici Palace, both of which Cosimo de' Medici rebuilt a few years before the tondo was painted.  An annual procession on the [[feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6 was organized by the confraternity, and passed in front of the Medici Palace. It was a costumed re-enactment of their arrival at the nativity, with the main parts taken by the leading members, including the Medici and their associates.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 6–7; NGA&lt;/ref&gt;  The Magi were regarded as saints, and so in the tondo have rather unusual [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] of gold dots, unlike the discs of the Holy Family.  Their combination of sainthood with the possession and giving of luxury goods may have been a factor in their attraction for the Medici.

The tondo shape for large paintings may itself have been a Medici innovation, possibly representing the gold ring with a diamond that became used as a device by the family from the 1440s.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The shape probably represents an inflation of the far smaller painted ''[[desco da parto]]'' or "birthing-tray", a decorated wooden tray, round or twelve-sided, that was traditionally presented by a Florentine husband to his wife after childbirth, and then used for serving refreshments to her visitors as she lay in state for a period of days after.   The same 1492 inventory that probably records the tondo shows that Lorenzo de' Medici kept the ''desco da parto'' presented on his own birth in 1449 hanging on his bedroom wall until his death.  These ''desci'' were typically decorated with allegorical or mythological scenes, while the large tondo was mostly used for religious subjects. But the shape was not found in paintings for churches, and may have carried a deliberate suggestion of a commission for a palace.&lt;ref&gt;NGA&lt;/ref&gt;   
    
Apart from the tondo being discussed, another with a loosely similar composition showing the ''Adoration of the Magi'', by [[Domenico Veneziano]] (now [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]) is probably a Medici commission of c. 1439–1442; it may also be another painting recorded in the 1492 inventory (though that Magi tondo is there attributed to [[Pesellino]]).  Among other similarities it also has a peacock perched on the stable roof, and [[falconry]] imagery, with hawks attacking cranes both in the air and on the ground.  The figure in black and white, behind the Magi and holding a falcon, may be a portrait of Piero de' Medici. There were several other important images of the Magi made for the Medici, apart from these and those in the palace chapel. The 1492 inventory lists four paintings, three probably from the period of Cosimo.  Later, [[Botticelli]] was to paint several Medici portraits in his [[Adoration of the Magi of 1475 (Botticelli)|1475 painting in the Uffizi]], commissioned by a close associate of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 6–9&lt;/ref&gt;  A Botticelli Magi tondo in the [[National Gallery, London]] of around 1470–75 has a comparable screen of ruined antique buildings running behind the main figures (as well as a peacock).  Cosimo's personal cell in San Marco has a fresco Magi scene by Fra Angelico.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 6; NGA&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Adorazione dei Magi - National Gallery London.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The [[Botticelli]] Magi tondo in London]]

A number of aspects of the arrangement of the figures and the general composition are probably borrowed from a Magi scene of about 1370–71 by [[Jacopo di Cione]] that was then part of his large [[altarpiece]] at the nearby church (now destroyed) of San Pier Maggiore.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, 8&lt;/ref&gt;  The altarpiece is now dispersed, but the majority of the panels, including the Magi scene, are in the National Gallery, London.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 48, 45–54&lt;/ref&gt;

More general meanings that were attached to objects in the painting include the [[pomegranate]] held by the Christ child, whose many seeds were regarded as symbolizing the souls in the care of the church.  The flesh of the peacock was though to resist decay, and so the bird symbolized eternity, and the [[Resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;NGA&lt;/ref&gt;

===The buildings to the rear===
A grand but "crumbling pagan building" is a very common feature of Renaissance Nativity scenes, often acting as the stable itself.  This generally represents the passing of the era of the [[Mosaic law]] and contract, replaced at the birth of Christ by the new Christian covenant.  But it also often includes an allusion to the legend that on the night of Christ’s birth the "Temple of Peace" in the [[Roman Forum]] fell down, in fulfilment of a prophecy of Apollo that it would stand until a virgin gave birth.  This was in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and other sources; it supposedly contained a statue of [[Romulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lillie&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In the 15th century the "Temple of Peace" was wrongly identified with the [[Basilica of Maxentius]] next door, in fact a building of 308–312 AD.  About a third of this building survives today, with the three enormous barrel vaults of the north aisle the largest Roman structures surviving in the Forum.  It also contained a colossal statue, that of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], whose head, hand, foot, and other bits are now in the courtyard of the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. Other Nativity paintings draw from the architecture of the ruins of the basilica, including the Botticelli tondo in London, and the Lippi seems to do so too.&lt;ref&gt;Lillie&lt;/ref&gt;  Architectural historians remark that the architecture of the basilica drew from the massive public bath complexes of Rome, and possibly some awareness of this similarity led Lippi to represent his nude figures on the ruins as bathers, who might be imagined coming out from a still-functional bathing part of the complex to see what all the noise was about.

The '''Articella''' is a collection of medical treatises bound together in one volume that was used mainly as a textbook and reference manual between the 13th and the 16th centuries. In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], several versions of this anthology circulated in manuscript form among medical students. Between 1476 and 1534, [[printing|printed]] editions of the Articella were also published in several [[Europe]]an cities.

The collection grew around a synthetic exposition of [[ancient Greek medicine|classical Greek medicine]] written in [[Baghdad]] by the [[physician]] and [[polyglot (person)|polyglot]] [[Hunayn bin Ishaq]], better known in the West as Ioannitius. His synthesis was in turn based on [[Galen]]'s ''Ars Medica'' (''Techne iatrike'') and thus became known in Europe as ''Isagoge Ioannitii ad Tegni Galieni'' (''Hunayn's Introduction to the Art of Galen'').

In the mid-13th century, the emergence of formal medical education in several European universities fueled a demand for comprehensive textbooks. Instructors from the influential [[Scuola Medica Salernitana]] popularized the practice of binding other treatises together with their manuscript copies of the Isagoge. These included [[Hippocrates]]’ Prognostics as well as his Aphorisms, [[Theophilus Protospatharius]]'s De Urinis and De Pulsibus and many other classic works.

[[Image:bachgesell.gif|thumb|200px|A page from the Bach-Gesellschaft edition of J. S. Bach's ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', BWV 244, as published in 1856]]

The German '''Bach-Gesellschaft''' (Bach Society) was a society formed in 1850 for the express purpose of publishing the complete works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] without editorial additions. The collected works are known as the '''Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe'''. On completion of the project, the Society dissolved itself.

The nineteenth-century society needs to be distinguished from its successor, the [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] (New Bach Society), founded in 1900.

==Origins of the Bach-Gesellschaft==

The founders of the society were [[Moritz Hauptmann]], cantor of the [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig]], (and thus a successor of Bach); [[Otto Jahn]], author of a noted biography of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]; [[Carl Ferdinand Becker (organist)|Carl Ferdinand Becker]], teacher at the Leipzig Conservatory; and the composer [[Robert Schumann]].&lt;ref name="nbr"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hans T. David &amp; Arthur Mendel, eds. | title = The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents | edition = (Revised and expanded by Christoph Wolff) | location = New York | publisher = Norton | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-393-31956-3 | pages = 503–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==

The Bach-Gesellschaft began publishing Bach's works in 1851 with a volume that started with [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV]] 1, the cantata ''[[Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1]]''.&lt;ref name="ngbf1"&gt;{{cite book | author = Christoph Wolff | title = The New Grove Bach Family | location = New York | publisher = Norton | year = 1983 | isbn = 0-393-30088-9 | page = 178 |display-authors=etal}} (Worklist for J.S. Bach).&lt;/ref&gt; It completed publication in 1900 with its forty-sixth volume.&lt;ref name="nbrx"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hans T. David &amp; Arthur Mendel, eds. | title = The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents | edition = (Revised and expanded by Christoph Wolff) | location = New York | publisher = Norton | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-393-31956-3 | page = 504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the edition of ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'' by [[Wolfgang Graeser]], published in 1926, is sometimes counted as "Volume 47"&lt;ref name="aof"&gt;{{cite book | author = Johann Sebastian Bach | title = The Art of the Fugue and A Musical Offering | location = New York | publisher = Dover | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-486-27006-8 | nopp = true | page = title page verso and "Publisher's Note" on unnumbered page }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was issued as a supplement to the Bach-Gesellschaft publication by [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], publishers of the original series.&lt;ref name="tunni"&gt;{{citenews | first=Stephen | last=Tunnicliffe | title= Wolfgang Graeser (1906-28): A forgotten genius |date=Spring 2000 | publisher= | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3870/is_200004/ai_n8899522/pg_1 | work=The Musical Times | accessdate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Vol. 45, part 1 includes a revised edition ("Neue berichtige Ausgabe")&lt;ref name="bg45"&gt;{{cite book | author = Ernst Naumann, ed. | title = Joh. Seb. Bach's Clavierwerke | edition = Zweiter Band. Neue berichtige Ausgabe. | location = Leipzig | publisher = Herausgegeben von der Bach-Gesellschaft | year = 1895 | id = | nopp = true| page = title page }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[English Suites, BWV 806-811|English Suites]] and [[French Suites, BWV 812-817|French Suites]] that had previously been published in Vol. 13.

Among the editors was [[Alfred Dörffel]]. [[Brahms]] was one of the subscribers to the project and also served on the [[editorial board]]. A list of subscribers was printed in each volume.&lt;ref name="musiclibrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53519953.html | title=Joahann Sebastian Bach: Ratswahlkantaten, II.(Review) | publisher=[[Music Library Association]] via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required) | work=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] | date=1998 | accessdate=September 26, 2012 | author=Melamed, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of the edition==

The volumes varied somewhat in editorial quality and accuracy; Bach scholar Hans T. David particularly criticized Vol. 31's presentation of ''[[The Musical Offering]]'' for numerous incorrect readings,&lt;ref name="david"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hans T. David | title = J. S. Bach's Musical Offering. History, Interpretation, and Analysis | location = New York | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1972 | edition = (reprint of orig. ed. by G. Schirmer) | origyear = 1945 | isbn = 0-486-22768-5 | page = 102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] calls the edition as a whole "of very unequal merit."&lt;ref name="ref1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bach, Johann Sebastian |volume=3 |page=130 |first=Donald Francis |last=Tovey}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Britannica'' both lauds the editing of [[Wilhelm Rust]] for the edition and notes a deterioration of standards after his death, including a volume in which "the bass and violin are a bar apart for a whole line" (apparently a reference to sloppy editing).&lt;ref name="ref1911"/&gt; In his edition of the ''[[Goldberg Variations]],'' [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]] also calls attention to several "mistakes of the Bachgesellschaft edition" that he has corrected, particularly with regard to the presentation of [[Ornament (music)|ornaments]].&lt;ref name="kirk"&gt;{{cite book | author = Ralph Kirkpatrick, ed. | title = J. S. Bach, The "Goldberg" Variations, Piano or Harpsichord | location = New York | publisher = G. Schirmer Inc. | year = 1938 | edition = | origyear = | isbn = 0-7935-2245-5 | page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is worth noting that the Bach-Gesellschaft volume containing the ''Goldbergs'' was one of the first to be published—Vol. 3, which appeared in 1853.)

Nevertheless, the Bach-Gesellschaft's volumes were a groundbreaking achievement and contributed greatly to the study and appreciation of Bach's music. They remained the standard edition of Bach's complete works until the publication of the [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]] by [[Bärenreiter]] and the Deutscher Verlag für Musik (1954-2007).&lt;ref name="ngbf2"&gt;{{cite book | author = Christoph Wolff | year = 1983 | title = The New Grove Bach Family | page = 172 |display-authors=etal}} (section of J.S.

'''Camaïeu''' (also called ''en camaïeu'') is a technique that employs two or three [[tint]]s of a single [[color]], other than gray, to create a [[monochromatic]] image without regard to local or realistic color. When a picture is monochromatically rendered in gray, it is called [[grisaille]]; when in yellow, [[cirage]].{{ref|reference1}}

The term is also applied to monochrome painting in enamels. This technique uses a buildup of white enamel to create highlights and light areas. However, instead of using a black background, as in grisaille, transparent enamel is laid in first, beneath the whites. This technique is frequently used on [[snuffbox]]es, watches and medallions.

''{{lang|fr|Camaïeu}}'' can also refer, following the French usage, to [[chiaroscuro]] [[woodcut]] [[old master print|prints]] that imitate highlighted drawing on tinted paper. However, the correct term in English for these is ''chiaroscuro woodcuts''.

This French word once was synonymous with ''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'', but its meaning became restricted in the early eighteenth century.{{ref|reference2}}

Camaïeu is also a registered trademark of a manufacturer.

'''''Changgeuk''''' or ''ch'angguk'' is a traditional [[Koreans|Korean]] [[opera]], performed as a play but in the Korean folk song style known as ''[[pansori]]''. It is therefore also called ''Korean pansori opera'' in English.&lt;ref name="Freyer"&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/entertainment/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110329000665 Opera director Achim Freyer leads The National Changgeuk Company’s ‘Mr. Rabbit and the Dragon King’]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a ''changgeuk'' play will include 20 to 30 actors, and 30 to 50 orchestra members.

==An example==
''[[Sugungga|Suggungga]]'' (''Mr. Rabbit and the Dragon King'') tells a story about a shrewd rabbit who manages to return home safely using clever tricks after having visited the Dragon King’s palace, which is located under the sea. The Dragon King had invited the rabbit to his palace to eat its liver after being told it that rabbit liver is the only cure for his illness. ''Sugungga'' is full of humor and also contains metaphors criticizing society.&lt;ref name="Freyer"/&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19559">The '''''Cheap Repository Tracts''''' consisted of more than two hundred moral, religious and occasionally political [[tract (literature)|tracts]] issued in a number of series between March 1795 and 1817, and subsequently re-issued in various collected editions until the 1830s. They were devised by [[Hannah More]] and intended for sale or distribution to literate poor people, as an alternative to what she regarded as the immoral traditional [[broadside ballad]] and [[chapbook]] publications. The tracts proved to be enormously successful with more than two million copies sold or distributed during the first year of the scheme.

==Background==
During the early 1790s there was widespread concern about the possibility of a popular uprising in Britain following the French Revolution, and the radical ideas which were circulating in popular publications. The English religious writer and philanthropist [[Hannah More]] referred to the ‘corrupt and vicious little books and ballads which have been hung out of windows in the most alluring forms or hawked through town and country.’&lt;ref&gt;Cheap Repository (1795)&lt;/ref&gt; Following the commercial success of her ''Village Politics'' (1792), which was a rebuttal of [[Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine's]] ''[[Rights of Man]]'', she decided that an entire series might be undertaken to provide 'religious and useful knowledge, as an antidote to the poison continually flowing thro’ the channel of vulgar and licentious publications. These, by their cheapness, as well as by their being, unhappily, congenial to a depraved taste, obtain a mischievous popularity among the lower ranks.&lt;ref&gt;''A plan for establishing a repository of cheap publications,'' (1795).&lt;/ref&gt; She, drew up her plan for publishing such works in the [[West Country]] during 1794 and circulated it among her friends who encouraged her to extend it to cover the whole country and to appoint London distributors. A committee to form the Cheap Repository for Moral and Religious Tracts was established with [[Henry Thornton (reformer)|Henry Thornton]] as Treasurer. A printed prospectus was issued listing eighteen titles,&lt;ref&gt;Cheap Repository (1795)&lt;/ref&gt; to secure subscriptions to underwrite the project.

The new tracts were intended to point out the pitfalls of [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]], [[:wikt:debauchery|debauchery]], [[idle]]ness, [[gambling]], [[riot|riotous assembly]], and seeking to rise above one’s [[Social status|station]], whilst simultaneously praising the [[virtue]]s of [[honesty]], [[Diligence|industry]], thrift, [[patience]] and an [[acceptance]] of one’s pre-ordained place in [[society]], by means of simple ballads and short instructive tales. They were published as either [[octavo]] [[chapbook]]s or else as [[broadside ballads]], emulating the traditional forms of [[Street literature]]. Approximately one third of them were designated as ‘Sunday Reading’ and contained simplified Bible stories or else a more specifically religious message.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2013), p.97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
More than half of the official series of tracts were written by [[Hannah More]]&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Spinney, (1939–40), pp. 295–340.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further six were perhaps written by her sister Sarah, others by evangelical friends such as the poet [[William Mason (religious writer)|William Mason]], the philanthropists and campaigners against slavery [[Zachary Macaulay]], [[John Newton]], and [[Henry Thornton (reformer)|Henry Thornton]], or else [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]], the artist and writer on the picturesque. A few titles were condensed versions of existing well-known works, such as [[Isaac Watts]]’, ''[[Divine Songs Attempted in Easy Language for the Use of Children|Divine Songs]]'' or [[Daniel Defoe]]’s ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year|The History of the Plague in London in 1665]]'', or else retellings of Bible stories.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, (1952), p.138.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was subsidised by subscriptions from supporters enabling the publications to be sold at below cost price.

==Publication==
[[File:Divine songs for children.jpg|thumb|''Divine Songs ... for children'' - the seventh Cheap Repository Tract to be issued, printed at Bath by Samuel Hazard in March 1795]] 
The individual tracts have a complex bibliographical history often going through many editions and involving several different individuals who were designated 'Printer to the Cheap Repository,' together with many distributors and publishers. Retail sales were made by 'booksellers, newsmen, and [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]], in town and country.'&lt;ref&gt;This statement appears on the majority of the tracts.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important printers involved were Samuel Hazard of Bath; [[John Marshall (publisher)|John Marshall]] of London, William Watson of [[Dublin]]; and John Evans of 42 Long Lane, London. Several copies were also reprinted in the U.S.A. by printers in both New York and Philadelphia. Until the end of 1798 the publisher undertaking the work was 'The Cheap Repository', but thereafter the copyrights of the official tracts were sold and later collected editions were published by John and James [[Rivington (publishers)]] for the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (S.P.C.K.)

===Hazard Series (March–May 1795)===
Under More’s initial scheme the tracts were all to be printed by Samuel Hazard, of Cheap Street [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and distributed by him and by John Marshall in [[London]] and by Richard White in [[Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2013), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; Publication commenced in March 1795 and in the first six weeks (March 3 – April 18, 1795) the [[Bath Chronicle]] reported that 300,000 copies were sold wholesale and the presses hardly able to keep pace with orders arriving from all parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett (2008) p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; By July of the same year, the number sold had more than doubled;&lt;ref&gt;Altick, (1957), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ‘Advertisement’ prefacing one of the collected editions of the tracts: ''Many persons exerted their influence, not only by circulating the tracts in their own families, in schools, and among their dependants, but also by encouraging booksellers to supply themselves with them; by inspecting retailers and hawkers, to whom they gave a few in the first instance, and afterwards directed them in the purchase; also by recommending the tracts to the occupiers of stalls at fairs, and by sending them to hospitals, workhouses, and prisons. They were also liberally distributed among soldiers and sailors, through the influence of their commanders.&lt;ref&gt;'' Cheap repository shorter tracts'', (1798).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazard/Marshall Series (May 1795-January 1796)===
[[File:Cheap Repository broadside ballad.jpg|thumb|The Carpenter, 1795 in the format of a broadside ballad. Both Hazard and Marshall are described as 'Printer to the Cheap Repository']]
By the end of April 1795 it was apparent that Hazard would be unable to cope with the demand for new titles and for reprints from his limited business in Bath and so after the twenty-third tract issued in May 1795 John Marshall (who operated a far more substantial printing and publishing business at 4 Aldermary Churchyard, London) was recruited to become a joint ‘Printer to the Cheap Repository’.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2013), p.103.&lt;/ref&gt; The next twenty-six or twenty-seven tracts were therefore issued simultaneously in editions printed in London and in Bath.&lt;ref&gt;Spinney, (1939), p.322-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The discrepancy is because one title ''The middle way is the best'' appears to have been withdrawn after printing. Marshall also began to reprint editions of the earlier tracts.

The tracts were still selling well by December 1795 but there continued to be distribution problems particularly in those parts of the United Kingdom more remote from London (notably Scotland and the north of England). Hannah More also began to realise that the cost of producing simultaneous editions at two different centres in England was not sustainable in the long term, and she was hearing complaints about the low level of discounts offered to the hawkers who were expected to distribute many of the copies. At the same time she was receiving requests from the wealthier supporters of the scheme for an edition printed on better quality paper in the more compact duodecimo format which might be bound into annual collected volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2013), p.103-4.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result the publication scheme was re-organised in January 1796, and a new prospectus issued.&lt;ref&gt;Cheap Repository for Moral and Religious Publications, (1796).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:MoreShepherd.png|thumb|right|''The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain'', one of the most popular tracts. Only Marshall is now described as ‘Printer to the Cheap Repository’]]

===Marshall Official Series (February 1796-December 1797)===
Following the re-organisation, John Marshall became the sole printer of the tracts with Samuel Hazard demoted to the role of a distributor. William Watson also was appointed as “Printer to the Cheap Repository” in Dublin and permitted to reprint the existing titles once they had been issued in London. An additional distributor, John Elder, of North Bridge, Edinburgh, was appointed to cover Scotland and Northern England.

A further sixty five new titles were printed and published by John Marshall between February 1796 and December 1797 in the two chapbook formats but the broadside ballad editions were gradually phased out, and the existing ballads were re-issued in small booklets containing three or four titles. Annual collected editions of the tracts were also published for the years 1795 and 1796.

However, as the scheme progressed through 1796 and 1797 Hannah More found it increasingly difficult to find authors for new tracts and relations with her publisher began to deteriorate leading her decision to reduce the rather of publication to three tracts each quarter after December 1797.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2013), p.105-7.&lt;/ref&gt; John Marshall had by this time devoted virtually the whole of his business to the production and distribution of the tracts and their cessation would have been a financial disaster to him. He was on the point of issuing a third collected volume of the tracts in November 1797 when he quarrelled with More over the ownership of copyrights. This led to his refusal to continue as printer and the main distributor of the tracts, and the appointment of John Evans in his place.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2017), p.320-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Contented cobler.jpg|thumb|’’The contented cobler’’ (1798) one of John Marshall’s 'unofficial' series of tracts.]] 
===Marshall's 'Unofficial' Series (January 1798-December 1799)===
Marshall felt aggrieved by his treatment by Hannah More and as an experienced publisher of ballads and chapbooks he had no difficulty in securing further suitable texts to continue the series. He therefore issued a further seventy-three 'unofficial' Cheap Repository tracts on his own over the next two years whilst he reorganised his business.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker (2013), pp.111-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall eventually finished his series at the end of 1799. Marshall's unofficial tracts are similar in format, and general appearance to the official series, often using the same woodcuts, but contained only his name as printer and distributor. They are often confused with the other series but were sometimes a little racier in content.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1952), p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watson Dublin Series (1796-1800)===
Early in 1796 William Watson, 'Printer of the Association for Discountenancing Vice and Promoting the Knowledge and Practice of Religion and Virtue,’ of 7 Capel Street Dublin was also appointed ‘Printer to the Cheap Repository’ in Ireland and permitted to reprint the titles.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pollard, ''Dictionary of members of the Dublin book trade 1550-1800,'' London: Bibliographical Society, 2000, pp.595-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Irish tracts were reprints of the English equivalents although a few were given new titles. Watson continued to re-issue tracts until his death in 1805, when he was succeeded by his son, also named William Watson (d.1818). He was succeeded by his widow Ann Watson who continued to issue the tracts well into the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt; Pollard, 2000, pp.596.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:The Black Prince 1798.jpg|thumb|right|The Black Prince, printed by John Evans in 1798.]]
===Evans Official Series (1798-1800)===
After the resignation of Marshall in December 1797, a further fifteen new titles in the official Cheap Repository Tracts series, written by Hannah More were printed by [[John Evans (printer)|John Evans]]. These were issued between December 1797 and October 1798, starting with ''The fall of Adam'', which contained an announcement of the new publishing arrangements.”&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2017), p.321-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The new series includes at least one tract, commenting on the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], which does not later appear in Hannah More's collected works.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; These do not appear to have had the same impact as the earlier series of tracts. Nevertheless, reprints of the original individual titles continued to be printed by John Evans and his successors. These included, J. Evans &amp; Co. (1799-1802), Howard and Evans (1802-1811), John Evans (1811), J. Evans and son (c.1812-1817), John Evans and sons (1818-20) and J.&amp; C. Evans (1820-29), and J.E. Evans (1829-1846).&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2017), p.329-30 &amp; 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivington Collected Editions (1798-1830)===
In addition to the continuing demand for reprints of individual tracts, there was also a demand for collected editions, aimed at a middle-class audience. In the Spring of 1798 the committee under Henry Thornton sold the copyrights of all the existing titles to Francis and Charles Rivington, printers to the S.P.C.K. This firm published a collected edition of official tracts in three volumes, (also printed by Evans), in the same year. This edition was reprinted in 1799 and 1800, and then at regular intervals until 1830. More would later regretted having 'given half the profits' to Rivington.&lt;ref&gt;Stott (2003), 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series published in the USA (1799-1803)-===
Individual tract titles were imported to the USA soon after their publication in England. From 1797 a few U.S. editions also began to be published in Philadelphia by B. Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, (1946).p.542 &amp; 634.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1799 about sixty of the tracts (together with a few other non-Cheap Repository titles) appeared in two collected volumes of the tracts were published in New York by Cornelius Davis. Then during the course of 1800 a further forty-two of the titles were published in Philadelphia by B. &amp; J. Johnson in a numbered Cheap Repository series.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, (1946).p. 636-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Further American collected editions were published by E. Lincoln of Boston in 1802 and 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, (1946).p. 639-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cheap Repository - the Delegate.jpeg|thumb|One of Hannah More's 'Spa Fields' Tracts from 1817]]

==='Spa Fields' Tracts (1817)===
The period immediately following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] saw popular dissatisfaction in England culminating in the [[Spa Fields riots]] of December 1816 and an abortive attempt to take control of the government. Hannah More therefore issued a number of entirely new, pro-establishment, titles during 1817 including ''The loyal subjects political creed''; ''The Delegate''; ''The Private Virtues of public Reformists''; and ''Fair words and foul meaning''. She also amended several of the earlier tracts to give them a stronger political message.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker, (2017), p.332-343.&lt;/ref&gt; These were later republished in a collected edition, together with some of the more political earlier titles, entitled ''Cheap Repository Tracts, suited to the present times,'' in 1819.

==Impact of the Cheap Repository Tracts==
The publication of the ''Cheap Repository Tracts'' has been represented by some political historians as a conservative reaction to the success enjoyed by Thomas Paine’s ''The Rights of Man and Age of Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class (New York: Vintage Books, 1966), 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be an oversimplification of Hannah More’s motives. Only a small proportion of the 1790s tracts were political in content; the majority attempted to reform the morals of the working classes, “adopting the forms, writing styles,and even distribution channels of popular literature”.&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen,(1986),p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; 

They were an undoubted publishing phenomenon and according to Richard Altick: "there had never been anything like it in the history of English books."&lt;ref&gt;Altick, (1957), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the titles, such as ''The shepherd of Salisbury plain'' were later translated in French, German and Russian. Yet the extent of the impact that they may have had on the lives of the working classes, at whom they were aimed, has also been questioned. They may have been: "a huge hit among the middle classes, who …had set up 'very respectable Societies' throughout the country, in order to distribute them."&lt;ref&gt;Stott,(2003),p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Croatia Association of Theatre Critics and Theatre Scholars''' (HDKKT) is a professional, nonprofit organization.

== History ==
The association was founded on 22 October 1975 at founding assembly in [[Zagreb]] and registered into Civil Association Register on 9 March 1976.

HDKKT is a member of International Association of Theatre Critics (AICT/IACT) and collaborates with The International Federation for Theatre Research (FITR/IFTR). It was founded with goal to develop and promote quality of the profession, cooperation with other similar associations and theatres in [[Croatia]] and abroad and to protect [[Morality|moral]] and material interests of its members. The associations structure comprises: Assembly, Executive Committee and President, Supervisory Committee and Court of Honour. Association first resides in Ilica 42 and later in Amruševa Street 19, Zagreb. It has about 50 active members and 15 retired and since 2013 dance critics are also admitted.

Association is funded by [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Ministry of Culture]]. Shortly after foundation, HDKKT launched Theatrology Library (Teatrologijska biblioteka) with Nikola Batušić as editor in chief and from1979 till 1992 thirty-three titles were published. In year 1994 Theatrology Library merged with Library Prolog (Biblioteka Prolog), former CKD, which was inherited by [http://www.agm.hr/ AGM] (Zagreb). The new library was named Actor′s Booklet Prolog (Glumišna knjižnica Prolog) with editorial board: Nikola Batušić, Branko Hećimović and Igor Mrduljaš. From 1992 till 1997 library published eleven books in cooperation with AGM after which AGM completely took over the publishing  activities.

In 80′s association introduced the Award for the Best Play of the Season through members′ survey.

Laurent de Lara published ''Elementary instruction in the Art of Illumination, and Missal Painting on Vellum'' in 1850, which went to several editions. From the second expanded edition (1857), he described himself on the title page as illuminating artist to [[Queen Victoria]], though he may simply have supplied teaching materials to the Royal children, if not actually taught them illumination which they were studying from at least 1855.&lt;ref name=rowan/&gt; The book consisted of 48 pages, with six illustrations, four coloured, and was published by [[Rudolph Ackermann|the firm of Ackermann]], who specialised in such instructive books and also sold the papers, designs and pigments called for in order to follow the instructions within.&lt;ref name=rowan/&gt; In the book, Laurent de Lara described [[Henry Noel Humphreys]]'s ''Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages'' as too advanced for a beginner, and did not mention Humphreys' 1856 book ''The Art of Illumination and Missal Painting'', which Alice H. R. H. Beckwith points out was the first manual for illuminators, although aimed at professionals rather than to the amateurs targeted by Laurent de Lara.&lt;ref name=vweb&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beckwith|first1=Alice H. R. H.|title=Frontispiece and title-page from "Elementary Instruction on the Art of Illumination" by  David Laurent de Lara (active 1850s &amp; '60s)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/design/beckwith/6.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Beckwith has argued that while Laurent de Lara was a good self-promoter, he was not skilled at his art, and suggests that it was him who J.

Beckwith notes that by the 1860s, Laurent de Lara's manual had competition in the form of other, more successfully developed publications by [[Winsor &amp; Newton]], [[Daler-Rowney|George Rowney &amp; Company]], and J. Barnard and Son; and says he failed to grasp the idea that illumination was about an unity between text and ornament.&lt;ref name=vweb/&gt; Instead, Laurent de Lara suggested that illumination was about the carefully drawn mechanical repetition of fussy detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laurent de Lara|first1=David|title=Elementary Instruction on the Art of Illumination and Missal Painting on Vellum: with Illustrations for Copying for the Student|date=1850|publisher=Ackermann &amp; Co|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his granddaughter, the pianist and composer [[Adelina de Lara]]'s autobiography, David Laurent de Lara was the son of a Spanish count called Laurent de Lara.&lt;ref name=autobiog/&gt; David married a London-born Polish Jewish woman, Sarah Cracour.&lt;ref name=pal/&gt;&lt;ref name=autobiog/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NB: Palgrave spells Sarah's surname Crawcour.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Epigram of Amazaspos''' ({{lang-ka|ამაზასპის ეპიგრამა}}) is a [[funerary text|funerary]] [[epigram]] written in [[Ancient Greek]] on an inscription found in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It [[Memorialization|memorialises]] the [[death]] of the [[Pharnavazid dynasty|Pharnavazid]]&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; royal prince Amazaspos, brother of kings [[Mihrdat I of Iberia|Mihrdat I]] and [[Rhadamistus]], son of king [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]], who died at [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]] while accompanying the emperor [[Trajan]] on his Parthian expedition during the [[Roman–Parthian Wars]].&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Sydney, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The epigram seems to be a work of some ''[[litterateur]]'' in emperor Trajan's company during his Parthian expedition and it seems he was personally aware of Amazaspos' charms where he is compared to "modest maidens". It is suggested that this poet may have been emperor [[Hadrian]] himself. Authorship of the epigram for prince Amazaspos by Hadrian would explain how the text was available to be inscribed in [[Rome]] as the stone may have been erected there in a public place during Hadrian's reign as a reminder of the cost to the [[Roman Empire]] of its policy of expansion as Hadrian quickly gave up almost all the lands Trajan had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Chaniotis, Corsten, Stroud &amp; Tybout, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably the prince's remains had also been transferred by Hadrian to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Braund, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is dated 114-117 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Chaniotis, Corsten, Stroud &amp; Tybout, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Amazaspos is also mentioned in [[Armazi stele of Vespasian]],&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt; though according to [[Cyril Toumanoff]] that Amazaspos is King [[Amazasp I of Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand von Wright''' (19 March 1822, Haminalahti, near [[Kuopio]] - 31 July 1906, Kuopio) was a [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swedish]] painter. He is best known for his landscapes and animal paintings, especially his detailed depictions of birds, but he also created [[still-life]]s and portraits.

==Biography==
His ancestors were Scottish merchants who had settled in [[Narva]] during the 17th-Century and his father was a retired Major who owned a large, well-known estate. He was the youngest of nine surviving children and was tutored at home. Two of his older brothers, [[Magnus von Wright|Magnus]] and [[Wilhelm von Wright|Wilhelm]], also became painters and illustrators. Following in their footsteps, he showed an early aptitude for art, developed during time spent hunting and exploring nature while making sketchbooks.

He travelled to Sweden for the first time when he was fifteen, visiting [[Bohuslän]] Province with Wilhelm,&lt;ref name="Y"&gt;[https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/taiku/taiku_opiskelu/kurssit/klassikot/materiaalit/ferdinand Brief biography] @ the [[University of Jyväskylä]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; who was working as an illustrator for the zoologist [[Bengt Fredrik Fries]]. The following year, he went by himself to work for the amateur [[ornithologist]], Count Nils Bonde, who had recently subsidized the publication of a multi-volume ''Svenska Fåglar'' (Swedish Birds), with illustrations by Magnus and Wilhelm. 
[[File:Ferdinand von Wright - The Fighting Capercaillies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Fighting [[Capercaillies]] (1886)]]
After a few months back in Finland, he returned to Sweden where, in 1842, he briefly studied at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] with the sculptor [[Johan Niclas Byström]]. He went home again in 1844, having been in Sweden for almost six years. Five years later, he went to [[Turku]], where he took some additional lessons from [[Robert Wilhelm Ekman]].&lt;ref name="Y" /&gt; In 1852, he and his brothers went to Helsinki, where he set up a studio and began painting more detailed scenes, rather than individual animals. Six years later, he took a trip to [[Dresden]], where he spent two months studying with the noted animal painter {{ill|Johann Siegwald Dahl|de}}.&lt;ref name="Y" /&gt; He then travelled to [[Orust]] with Wilhelm, staying for a year.

In 1863, he built a home near his family's estate, which he named "Lugnet" (serenity or tranquility in Swedish).&lt;ref name="L"&gt;[http://www.lahteilla.fi/fi/person/ferdinand-von-wright Brief biography] @ Lähteillä.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived there for the next twenty years, occasionally spending time with his sisters in Kuopio. In the early 1870s, he had several strokes and was often bedridden,&lt;ref name="Y" /&gt; but continued to paint as much as possible. Eventually, he had to move out of the main part of his home and occupy two smaller guest rooms upstairs. He made his last trip in 1881, to Orust, visiting Wilhelm, who was also ill.

His work became more commercial after this and, in 1886, he produced his best-known work ''The Fighting Capercaillies''.&lt;ref name="Y" /&gt; He also contributed articles to various ornithological journals. About this time, he received a state artists' pension.&lt;ref name="L" /&gt; Many former students came to visit and, in the late 1890s, the bird painter {{ill|Matti Karppanen|fi}} stayed on to be his pupil and assistant. Slowly, he became more withdrawn and died in 1906.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}

A '''first-person narrative''' is a [[narrative mode|mode of storytelling]] in which a narrator relays events from their own [[Narration#Narrative point of view|point of view]] using the [[grammatical person|first person ]] {{no wrap| i.e. "I" or "we", etc.}}&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: First-person narrative|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095820156|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be narrated by a first person [[protagonist]] (or other [[focal character]]), first person re-teller, first person witness,&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature Glossary - First-person Narration|url=http://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/first-person-narration.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanzel1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanzel, F.K.|title=A Theory of Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=13 March 1986|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-31063-5|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847),&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; in which the [[title character]] is also the narrator telling her own story,&lt;ref name=schmoop1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Eyre Narrator Point of View|url=http://www.shmoop.com/jane-eyre/narrator-point-of-view.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of Writing in First Person|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-writing-in-first-person.html#OlI0VVEcAI4abdEW.99|website=YourDictionary|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This device allows the audience to see the narrator's [[mind's eye]] view of the [[fictional universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evers|first1=Stuart|title=The dangers of first-person narrative|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/13/thedangersoffirstpersonnar|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view.&lt;ref name=schmoop1/&gt; Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An [[unreliable narrator]] is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiehardt|first1=Ginny|title=How to Recognize and Create an Unreliable Narrator|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-unreliable-narrator-in-fiction-1277141|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Balance|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point of view device==
The telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of "I." An example would be [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which begins "Call me Ishmael."&lt;ref name=Perdue&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/terms/firstperson.html "First Person Narration", Perdue University College of Liberal Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt; First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.

===Identity===
A story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Point of View and Narrative Voice|url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref/fiction/pov.html|website=Literary Analysis|publisher=Ohio University|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
First-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid. ''The Narrator'', Iran:Baqney. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.

Character weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. [[Unreliable narrators]] are not uncommon.

In the first-person-plural [[Narrative mode|point of view]], narrators tell the story using "we". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:

* [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "[[A Rose for Emily]]" (Faulkner was an avid experimenter in using unusual points of view; see also his ''[[Spotted Horses]]'', told in third person plural).
* [[Frank B. Gilbreth]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]'s memoir ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.
* [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "Crate."
* [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[Man Plus]]''.
* [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]''.
* [[Karen Joy Fowler]]'s ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club]]''.
* [[Joshua Ferris]]'s ''[[Then We Came to the End]]''.
* [http://thenormalschool.com/fiction/ Heidi Vornbrock Roosa's short story "Our Mother Who Art."]

Other examples include ''[[Twenty-Six Men and a Girl]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]], ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar'' by [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], ''During the Reign of the Queen of Persia'' by [[Joan Chase]], ''Our Kind'' by [[Kate Walbert]], ''[[I, Robot]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], and ''We Didn't'' by [[Stuart Dybek]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3DF1538F93BA25757C0A9629C8B63|title=We the Characters|publisher=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2007-02-25|date=April 18, 2004 | first=Laura | last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narrators can also be multiple, as in [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s ''[[In a Grove]]'' (the source for the movie ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'') and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner's]] novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''. Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.

There can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their "own" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak "live" about the same event.

The first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' or [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as "first person major" or "first person minor" points of view.

The narrator can be the [[protagonist]] (e.g., [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]] in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions ([[Dr. Watson]] in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called "frame narrators": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by [[Emily Brontë]]; and the unnamed narrator in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.

A rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are ''[[The Book Thief]]'' by [[Markus Zusak]], where the narrator is [[Death]], and ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' by [[Alice Sebold]], where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, [[Out-of-body experience|extracorporeal]] viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.

==Autobiography==
In [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]], the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include [[Jim Carroll]] in ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]'' and [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]] in ''[[Timequake]]'' (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—"the book in your hands"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]], and ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]]. Another example is a fictional "Autobiography of James T. Kirk"  which was "Edited" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's '''Star Trek''') as he wrote the novel.

==Detective fiction==
Since the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for [[detective fiction]], so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the "Watson", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of [[Doctor Watson|Dr Watson]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

==Forms==
First-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]]''; dramatic monologue, also in [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]''; or explicitly, as [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]].''

Other forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.

==Styles==
With a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

First-person narratives can tend towards a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|Interior monologue]], as in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a [[false document]], such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a [[frame story]] presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

First-person narrators are often [[unreliable narrator]]s since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''), lie (as in ''[[The Quiet American]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], or ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' series by [[Gene Wolfe]]), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], or in [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'']]). [[Henry James]] discusses his concerns about "the romantic privilege of the 'first person'" in his preface to ''[[The Ambassadors]]'', calling it "the darkest abyss of [[Romanticism|romance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goetz |first=William R. |title=Henry James and the Darkest Abyss of Romance |year=1986 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=0-8071-1259-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=35807&amp;pageno=11 ''The Ambassadors'' (p. 11) on Project Gutenberg] Accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a multi-level narrative structure is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which has a double framework: an unidentified "I" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an "I" narrator introducing a storyteller as "he" (Marlow), who talks about himself as "I" and introduces another storyteller as "he" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of "I".

==Film==
First person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt;

New possibilities opened up by the concept of [[four-dimensional space]] (and difficulties involved in trying to visualize it) helped inspire many modern artists in the first half of the twentieth century. Early [[Cubists]], [[Surrealists]], [[Futurists]], and [[Abstract art|abstract]] artists took ideas from higher-dimensional mathematics and used them to radically advance their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/fourth-dimension-and-non-euclidean-geometry-modern-art |title=Overview of ''The Fourth Dimension And Non-Euclidean Geometry In Modern Art, Revised Edition'' |first1=Linda Dalrymple|last1=Henderson |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Picasso Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 1910.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Picasso's ''Portrait of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'', 1910, [[The Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1912-1913, L'Oiseau bleu, (The Blue Bird) oil on canvas, 230 x 196 cm, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris..jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1912-1913, ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu, (The Blue Bird)]]'', oil on canvas, 230 x 196 cm, [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]]]

French [[mathematician]] [[Maurice Princet]] was known as "le mathématicien du cubisme" ("the mathematician of cubism").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Décimo |first=Marc |title=Maurice Princet, Le Mathématicien du Cubisme |year=2007 |publisher=Éditions L'Echoppe |location=Paris |language=French |isbn=2-84068-191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An associate of the [[School of Paris]], a group of [[Avant-garde|avant-gardists]] including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Jean Metzinger]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]], Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to the cubists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]] during the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Arthur I. |title=Einstein, Picasso: space, time, and beauty that causes havoc |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2001 |type=Print|page=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet introduced Picasso to [[Esprit Jouffret]]'s ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''Science and Hypothesis'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional page. Picasso's ''[[Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'' in 1910 was an important work for the artist, who spent many months shaping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |title=Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |page=28 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |type=Print |year=2006|isbn= 9780300110395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait bears similarities to Jouffret's work and shows a distinct movement away from the [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] [[fauvism]] displayed in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', to a more considered analysis of space and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |title=Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought  |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |type=Print|pages=28–30 |year=2006|isbn= 9780300110395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early cubist [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]] wrote an article entitled "In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View", for [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s July 1910 issue of ''[[Camera Work]]''. In the piece, Weber states, "In plastic art, I believe, there is a fourth dimension which may be described as the consciousness of a great and overwhelming sense of space-magnitude in all directions at one time, and is brought into existence through the three known measurements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Max |last1=Weber |authorlink=Max Weber |year=1910 |title=In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View |journal= [[Camera Work]]|volume= 31|issue= July 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on the School of Paris was that of [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Albert Gleizes]], both painters and theoreticians. The first major treatise written on the subject of Cubism was their 1912 collaboration ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', which says that:&lt;blockquote&gt; "If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidian mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of [[Bernhard Riemann#Euclidean geometry versus Riemannian geometry|Riemann's theorems]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Du "Cubisme" (Edition Figuière)| first1=Albert| first2= Jean| last1=Gleizes |last2=Metzinger |authorlink1=Albert Gleizes |authorlink2=Jean Metzinger |location=Paris|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American modernist painter and photographer [[Morton Livingston Schamberg]] wrote in 1910 two letters to [[Walter Pach]],&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Schamberg in Philadelphia to Walter Pach in Paris, 29 December 1910, Pach Papers, Reel: 4216, fr. 856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Schamberg in Philadelphia to Pach in Paris, 29
December 1910, fr. 857&lt;/ref&gt; parts of which were published in a review of the [[Armory Show|1913 Armory Show]] for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morton Livingston Schamberg, "Post-Impression Exhibit Awaited", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 19 January 1913, col. 2, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; about the influence of the fourth dimension on avant-garde painting; describing how the artists' employed "harmonic use of forms" distinguishing between the "representation or rendering of space and the designing in space":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oja|first1=Carol J.|title=Making Music Modern: New York in the 1920s|page=84|year=2000, February 2003|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA}}{{ISBN|9780195162578}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we still further add to design in the third dimension, a consideration of weight, pressure, resistance, movement, as distinguished from motion, we arrive at what may legitimately be called design in the fourth dimension, or the harmonic use of what may arbitrarily be called volume. It is only at this point that we can appreciate the masterly productions of such a man as Cézanne.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/33294 Jill Anderson Kyle, ''Cézanne and American Painting 1900 to 1920''], The University of Texas at Austin, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired the Cubists to experiment with [[simultaneity]], complex multiple views of the same subject, as observed from differing viewpoints at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensionist manifesto==
In 1936 in Paris, [[Charles Sirato|Charles Tamkó Sirató]] published his ''Manifeste Dimensioniste'',&lt;ref name="dimensionalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artpool.hu/TamkoSirato/manifest.html |title=Dimensionist Manifesto |first1=Charles Tamkó |last1=Sirató |location=Paris |year=1936 |format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described how {{quote|the Dimensionist tendency has led to: 
# Literature leaving the line and entering the plane. 
# Painting leaving the plane and entering space.
# Sculpture stepping out of closed, immobile forms.
# …The artistic conquest of four-dimensional space, which to date has been completely art-free.}}

The manifesto was signed by many prominent modern artists worldwide. [[Hans Arp]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and Marcel Duchamp amongst others added their names in Paris, then a short while later it was endorsed by artists abroad including [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Joan Miró]], [[David Kakabadze]], [[Alexander Calder]], and [[Ben Nicholson]].&lt;ref name="dimensionalist"/&gt;

==''Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)''==
[[File:Dali Crucifixion hypercube.jpg|150px|thumb|Dalí's 1954 painting ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'']]
In 1953, the [[surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]] proclaimed his intention to paint "an explosive, nuclear and hypercubic" crucifixion scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalí |first1=Salvador |authorlink1=Salvador Dalí|last2=Gómez de la Serna|first2=Ramón  |title=Dali |location=Secaucus, NJ |publisher=Wellfleet Press |origyear=1988 |year=2001  |page=41 |isbn=1555213421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spanisharts.com/history/del_impres_s.XX/arte_sXX/vanguardias1/i_surrealismo_dali.html |title=Salvador Dalí (1904–1989) |publisher=SpanishArts |year=2013 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, "This picture will be the great metaphysical work of my summer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dali-gallery.com/html/analyses/1954_02a.htm |title=Crucifixion ('Corpus Hypercubus'), 1954 |publisher=Dalí gallery website |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed the next year, ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'' depicts Jesus Christ upon the net of a hypercube, also known as a [[tesseract]]. The unfolding of a tesseract into eight cubes is analogous to unfolding the sides of a cube into six squares. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] describes the painting as a "new interpretation of an oft-depicted subject. ..[showing] Christ's spiritual triumph over corporeal harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/210009107 |title= ''Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)'' |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstract art==
Some of [[Piet Mondrian]]'s (1872–1944) abstractions and his practice of [[Neoplasticism]] are said to be rooted in his view of a utopian universe, with perpendiculars visually extending into another dimension.&lt;ref name="Kruger"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Runette |last1=Kruger |title=Art in the Fourth Dimension: Giving Form to Form – The Abstract Paintings of Piet Mondrian |publisher=Spaces of Utopia: An Electronic Journal |number=5 |date=Summer 2007 |pages=23–35 |url=http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/4351.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |issn=1646-4729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 (fourteen chapters) is about [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|the Democratic primary race]] between Obama and Clinton as well as the Edwards affair. Part 2 (three chapters) is about [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|the Republican primary race]]. Part 3 (six chapters) describe the fall campaign between Obama and [[John McCain]].

==Book==
''Game Change'' included several new assertions about the 2008 campaign that had not previously been reported. Among them were that [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Schumer]] privately had urged [[Barack Obama]] to run for president in the fall of 2006, in hopes that it would energize the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] base and improve the party's chances of winning the presidency. The book also detailed an hour-long meeting between [[Hillary Clinton]] and pollster [[Mark Penn]], during which Clinton accused Obama of "playing the [[race card]]" and importing people into [[Iowa]] to improve his chances at the caucus. The book also alleges that Hillary Clinton wanted to make a bigger issue out of Obama's drug use, but was dissuaded by certain members of her staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/01/game-change-even-more-juicy-stuff/33234/|title=Game Change: Even More Juicy Stuff|date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=January 10, 2010|work=[[The Atlantic]]|first=Marc|last=Ambinder|authorlink=Marc Ambinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this meeting, she allegedly said, "I hate the choice that the country's faced with. I think it is a terrible choice for our nation."&lt;ref name="ZelenyBlog" /&gt;

Heilemann and Halperin wrote in ''Game Change'' that Clinton had considered entering the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential race]], and that polls indicated her odds were encouraging. She was encouraged to run by her husband, former-President [[Bill Clinton]], but their daughter [[Chelsea Clinton]] advised her against it. Clinton was also against running because when she was running for senator, she made the voters the promise that she would complete her full senate term. Also in 2006, according to ''Game Change'', advisers to Clinton worked on a strategy to deal with any public disclosure over an affair which some of Hillary Clinton's advisers had believed Bill Clinton was then carrying on. The book did not provide any further details, except that the affair was "a sustained romantic relationship".&lt;ref name="ZelenyBlog" /&gt;

''Game Change'' also included details of [[John Edwards]]'s affair with [[Rielle Hunter]], and his handling of it before it was made public. According to the book, Edwards angrily rejected requests by his advisers to distance himself from Hunter. The book also described, in some depth, Sarah Palin's role in [[John McCain]]'s campaign. In response to concerns that Palin was depressed and unresponsive to debate training, McCain reportedly suggested debate sessions for Palin be moved from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Sedona, Arizona]], so Palin could be closer to her family. McCain aides reportedly were also concerned about Palin's failure to understand basic facts prior to her [[ABC News]] interviews with [[Charles Gibson]], including why [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] are separate countries. She also allegedly believed [[Saddam Hussein]] was behind the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="ZelenyBlog" /&gt;

The book ends with Obama being elected [[President of the United States]] and reporting on how he offered Clinton the job of [[United States Secretary of State]] in his administration. After initially turning Obama down in part out of fear that Bill Clinton would become a distraction for them both, she accepts the job after a late night phone conversation with Obama, who convinces her that she would be the best person for the position. She would serve for Obama's entire first term before stepping down. She would be replaced by Senator [[John Kerry]].

==Response==
{{wikinews|US Senate Majority leader Harry Reid criticized over "Negro" comments}}
[[Harry Reid]] was heavily criticized for comments he previously made about [[Barack Obama]], which had not been made public until they were published in ''Game Change''. According to the book, Reid said he believed Obama could become the country's first black president because he was "light-skinned" and had "no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one". Reid acknowledged and apologized for the comments, and his apology was accepted by Barack Obama. The disclosure came at a time Reid was facing a difficult [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|reelection campaign]] in his home state of [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Zeleny0109"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zeleny |first=Jeff |title=Reid Apologizes for Racial Remarks About Obama |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 9, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/us/politics/10reidweb.html?hp |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/01/09/reid-apology-for-negro-dialect-comment/|title=Reid apologizes for 'Negro dialect' comment|date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=[[CNN]]|first=Mark|last=Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen0109"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0110/31299.html|title=Palin attacks book; Reid regrets|date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=January 9, 2010|first=Mike|last=Allen|authorlink=Michael Allen (journalist)|work=[[The Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] Chair [[John Cornyn]], [[Republican National Committee]] Chair [[Michael Steele]], Senate Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] and Senate Minority Whip [[Jon Kyl]] called on Reid to step down as [[Senate majority leader|majority leader]] for his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0110/31325.html|title=Republicans charge Lott-Reid double standard|date=January 10, 2010|accessdate=January 10, 2010|first=John|last=Bresnahan|work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid ultimately won reelection for his seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Damon|first=Anjeanette|title=Sen.

Also reported for the first time was a comment [[Bill Clinton]] supposedly made in trying to convince [[Ted Kennedy]] not to back Obama's candidacy but rather that of his wife, [[Hillary Clinton]].  Clinton reportedly said to Kennedy that "a few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee." There is no evidence that Clinton ever made the remark.  However, the alleged belittling of Obama's candidacy supposedly helped lead to Kennedy's endorsement of Obama shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="fox011110"/&gt;  [[Reverend Al Sharpton]] condemned Clinton's alleged remark, saying, "I think that's far more disturbing [than Senator Reid's comments] because this is someone seeking to stop Mr. Obama's campaign...  If someone said that he would have been getting us coffee like that in the context they said he said it, that would be very offensive to me, and I would definitely take Mr. Clinton on".&lt;ref name="fox011110"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/01/11/sharpton-clinton-coffee-remark-obama-disturbing/ | title=Sharpton: Clinton 'Coffee' Remark About Obama 'Disturbing' | publisher=[[Fox News]] | date=January 11, 2010 | accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics questioned the lack of explicit sourcing in ''Game Change'', which was done on "[[Source (journalism)#.22Speaking terms.22|deep background]]" with no sources being identified in any way.&lt;ref name="usa011210"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/01/obama-reid-and-the-latest-washington-book-frenzy/1 | title=Obama, Reid, and the (latest) Washington book frenzy | first=David | last=Jackson | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=January 12, 2010 | accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pol-cald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=1AECC264-18FE-70B2-A88C3D2347C82C8B |title='Game Change': The freak show |first=Michael |last=Calderone |newspaper=[[The Politico]] |date=January 10, 2010 |accessdate=February 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123014714/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=1AECC264-18FE-70B2-A88C3D2347C82C8B |archivedate=January 23, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed the approach made famous in many of [[Bob Woodward]]'s books.&lt;ref name="usa011210"/&gt;  A [[Poynter Institute]] journalism ethics scholar said a danger of this method is that "both accuracy and fairness can be in jeopardy when anonymous sources are overused and misused" and that deep background sources "cannot be held easily accountable."&lt;ref name="pol-cald"/&gt;  [[Michiko Kakutani]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the authors of ''Game Change'' "serve up a spicy smorgasbord of observations, revelations and allegations — some that are based on impressive legwork and access, some that simply crystallize rumors and whispers from the campaign trail, and some that are hard to verify independently as more than spin or speculation on the part of unnamed sources."&lt;ref name="nyt-rev"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/books/11book.html | title=In ‘Game Change,’ Insight on the 2008 Campaign | first=Michiko | last=Kakutani | authorlink=Michiko Kakutani | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 10, 2010 | accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kakutani and [[Marc Ambinder]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' both said that at times the book veered into gossip.&lt;ref name="ambinder1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-rev"/&gt;  The authors defended themselves against such criticism, with Halperin saying they maintained "an incredibly high standard" and that they left material out if it was not verifiable or relevant, and Heilemann saying "We tried to tell a story of the intimate reality of what it's like to run for president. Gossip is that which is unverified ... Everything in our book is factual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/01/game-change-book-gossip-or-journalism.html | title='Game Change': Is the book gossip or journalism? | first=Johanna | last=Neuman | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=January 11, 2010 | accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was also criticized as being the embodiment of insider, establishment journalism.&lt;ref name="pol-cald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-rev"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011501702.html | title=Book review of 'Game Change' by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin | first=Alan | last=Wolfe | authorlink=Alan Wolfe | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 17, 2010 | accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Palin has criticized Heilemann and Halperin for ''Game Change'''s depiction of her candidacy. Meghan Stapleton, Palin's spokeswoman, suggested Palin's autobiography ''[[Going Rogue: An American Life]]'' was a more accurate portrayal of the campaign and Palin's role in it.&lt;ref name="Allen0109" /&gt; [[Jay Carney]], the White House Press Secretary, when he was Joe Biden's communications director, criticized the authors for not checking directly with any of Biden's staff to verify the accounts in the book, but did not comment on the accounts themselves.&lt;ref name="pol-cald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/game-change-authors-halperin-heilemann-shocked/story?id=9530045 | title='Game Change' Authors: 'We Were Shocked' by Revelations from 2008 Presidential Campaign | author=Dwyer, Devin | author2=Kerley, David | author3=Wong, Kristina | work=[[Good Morning America]] | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date=January 11, 2010 | accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Meghan McCain, the daughter of John McCain, condemned the book during a discussion on ABC'S ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]''. She compared the book to Michael Wolff's 2018 White House revelation, ''[[Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House]]''. Meghan McCain furthered by saying both books were unethical and are reasons why she does not trust journalists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chicksonright.com/2018/01/10/meghan-mccain-unloads-on-fire-and-fury-author-michael-wolff/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Game Change (film)}}

[[HBO Films]] produced a film adaptation of ''Game Change'' directed by [[Jay Roach]]. The film, which focuses primarily on the third part of the book, premiered on March 10, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/#/movies/game-change ''Game Change''], HBO webpage.&lt;/ref&gt; The film received numerous award nominations, and won four [[Emmy Award]]s, including the award for Outstanding Actress in a Miniseries for [[Julianne Moore]], who portrayed [[Sarah Palin]].

In light of recent sexual harassment charges brought by six women against Halperin, [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] has now canceled a 2016 version of his book and HBO has dropped its miniseries project based on the book as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/26/hbo-mark-halperin-game-change-movie-sexual-harassment-244214|title=HBO, Penguin cancel ‘Game Change’ over Halperin’s alleged sexual harassment|author=|date=|website=politico.com|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hamangia culture''' is a Late [[Neolithic]] [[archaeological culture]] of [[Dobruja]] ([[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]]) between the [[Danube]] and the [[Black Sea]] and [[Muntenia]] in the south. It is named after the site of [[Baia-Hamangia]], discovered in 1952 along [[Golovița Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dumitru Berciu]], ''Cultura Hamangia. Bucureşti: Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste România'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis and successor==
The Hamangia culture began around 5250/5200 BC and lasted until around 4550/4500 BC. It was absorbed by the expanding [[Boian-Giulesti|Boian]] culture in its transition towards the [[Gumelniţa culture|Gumelnitsa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistapontica.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/pontica-37-38-pag-9-20.pdf Vladimir Slavchev, Monuments of the final phase of Cultures Hamangia and Savia on the territory of Bulgaria, ''Revista Pontica'' vols. 37-38 (2004-2005), pp. 9-20.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Its cultural links with [[Anatolia]] suggest that it was the result of a settlement by people from Anatolia, unlike the neighbouring cultures, which appear descended from earlier Neolithic settlement.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nica, [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2023910 Unitate şi diversitate în culturile neolitice de la dunărea de jos = Unity and diversity of Neolithic cultures along the lower Danube], ''Revista Pontica'' vol. 30 (1997), pp. 105-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
[[File:Hamangia Muzeul din Constanta.JPG|thumb|The "sitting woman" and the "thinker" of Hamangia. National History and Archaeology Museum, [[Bucharest]]]]
The Hamangia culture attracted and attracts the attention of many art historians because of its exceptional clay figures.

===Pottery===
[[Image:2006 0814 Hamangia Histria Museum 20060300.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Some undecorated vassels]]
Painted vessels with complex geometrical patterns based on spiral-motifs are typical. The shapes include: bowls and cylindric glasses (most with of them with arched walls). They are decorated with dots, staight parallel lines and zig-zags, witch make Hamangia pottery very original.

===Figurines===
Pottery figurines are normally extremely stylized and show standing naked faceless women with emphasized breasts and buttocks. Two figurines known as "The Thinker" and "The Sitting woman" are considered masterpieces of Neolithic art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Settlements==
Settlements consist of rectangular houses with one or two rooms, built of [[wattle and daub]], sometimes with stone foundations ([[Durankulak]]). They are normally arranged on a rectangular grid and may form small [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]s. Settlements are located  along the coast, at the coast of lakes, on the lower and middle river-terraces, sometimes in caves.

==Inhumation==
Crouched or extended inhumation in cemeteries. Grave-goods tend to be without pottery in Hamangia I. Grave-goods include flint, worked shells, bone tools and shell-ornaments.

==Important sites==
*The [[Durankulak]] lake settlement commenced on a small island, approximately 7000 BC and around 4700/4600 BC the stone architecture was already in general use and became a characteristic phenomenon that was unique in Europe.
*[[Cernavodă]], the [[necropolis]] where the famous statues “The Thinker” and “The Sitting Woman” were discovered
*The eponymous site of [[Baia-Hamangia]], discovered in 1953 along Lake Golovița, close to the Black Sea coast, in the Romanian province of [[Northern Dobruja|Dobrogea]].

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}
'''''Hippias Major''''' (or '''''What is Beauty?''''' or '''''Greater Hippias''''' ({{lang-el|Ἱππίας μείζων}}, ''Hippías meízōn''), to distinguish it from the ''[[Hippias Minor]]'', which has the same chief character) is one of the dialogues of [[Plato]]. It belongs to the early dialogues, written while the author was still young.  Its precise date is uncertain, although a date of c. 390 BC has been suggested; its authenticity has been doubted.

In the ''Hippias Major'', [[Socrates]] and [[Hippias]] set out to find a definition for "beauty", but are destined to fail due to their inability to formulate an answer which encompasses the entire concept. The actual Greek term that is used in the dialogue is καλόν, which as an adjective often means fine or noble as well as beautiful.  For this reason, translators such as [[Paul Woodruff]] typically translate the term (τὸ καλόν—the abstract noun of the adjective) as "the Fine" (things) instead of "Beauty."

As in ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'', ''[[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]]'' and ''[[Euthyphro]]'', ''Hippias Major'' has an "anatreptic" purpose, that is, the result of the dialogue is to defeat commonly held opinions, without necessarily offering a resolution. The concept of something [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|good in and of itself]] (if only obliquely) makes its first appearance in this work. The dialogue can be read as much as a serious philosophical work as a light satirical comedy with two actors. The astuteness of Socrates in taking refuge under the authority of a supposed third protagonist in order to direct biting criticism at Hippias, endows the dialogue with humour.

==Personalities==
* [[Socrates]].
* [[Hippias]] of [[Elis]]: Hippias was a well known [[Sophist]], originally from Elis. Known throughout [[Ancient Greece]], he was reputed to have mastered [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[rhetoric]]; he boasted that he could speak on any subject at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] without preparation.  He is presented by [[Plato]], perhaps somewhat caricatured, as vain, narrow, and of limited intellect; much as he is in ''[[Hippias Minor]]''.

==Dialogue summary==

===Hippias meets Socrates===
[[Hippias]], whose business had kept him away from [[Athens]] for a long time, arrives in the city to give a lecture at Pheidostratus's&lt;ref&gt;This name occurs only in ''Hippias Major''; no reference in Smith's ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]''; the only other noted occurrence is as an [[Archon]] in 238 BC (see the list of [[Archon of Athens|eponymous archons]]); far too late to be contemporary.&lt;/ref&gt; school in the next few days.  He meets [[Socrates]], and the latter asks him why such a precious and wise man as Hippias has deprived the [[Athens|Athenians]] of his presence for so long. It is, explains the great [[Sophist]], because his native [[Elis]] was so in need of his services, and entrusted him with several important diplomatic missions to different cities; notably in [[Sparta]]. He made use of his travels throughout the [[Greece|Greek world]] to educate a large number of youth and earn large sums of money. One such example was the small town of [[Inycus]], in [[Sicily]], where the modest inhabitants sacrificed a good part of their savings to see their children educated{{r|plato}}.

===Could excessive application of the law lead to lawlessness?===
Socrates ironically assures him that this is all admirable. And if Hippias has spent such a large part of his time in Sparta, he asks, this must be where he earned the most?  But Hippias demurs: he did not touch an [[obolus]] there. It was not because the Spartans did not wish the best possible education for their children, and not because they did not comprehend the true value of Hippias.  The only reason was that ''"it is not the inherited usage of the [[Lacedaemonians]] to change their laws or to educate their children differently from what is customary."''

However, Socrates emphasized, the law is precisely made for use and happiness of the citizens, two things to which Hippias would have been greatly able to contribute.  By being too attached to the law and refusing the services of Hippias, the Spartans contradict the aim of their own laws and thus therefore could be considered as being unlawful. Hippias agrees.  Socrates then asks him then how he nevertheless had so much success in this severe city of [[Laconia]]. It is not, Hippias answers, for his knowledge of [[arithmetic]] or [[astronomy]], but rather ''"They are very fond of hearing about the genealogies of heroes and men, Socrates, and the foundations of cities in ancient times and, in short, about antiquity in general...[these being] beautiful pursuits"''.{{r|plato}}

===Socrates reveals his problem===
Socrates is happy that Hippias came to reminisce on beautiful things, because this is a subject that interests Socrates greatly and with good reason.  Recently, according to the latter, while criticising the beauty or ugliness of part of speeches, he claims to have been harassed by an acquaintance, who reproached him for not really knowing the definition of beauty. Thus embarrassed by this exposure, Socrates claims to be delighted that finally one as competent as Hippias will be able to provide his opinion on the nature of beauty. The great Sophist, flattered, does not object; and is goaded on by Socrates, who offers to reprise the discussion, playing the part of the harasser. This role-play on the part of Socrates adds to the comic nature of dialogue.

===Hippias' three responses===

====First definition: beauty is a pretty girl====
Hippias first response is: "For be assured, Socrates, if I must speak the truth, a beautiful maiden is beautiful ".{{r|plato}} Socrates estimates this to be, with his usual [[irony]], a brilliant answer. But cannot they say that a lyre, a horse or even a pot is beautiful? The most beautiful of pots of course would not stand up to comparison with a beautiful girl, but then in turn what is the beauty of a girl in comparison to that of a [[goddess]]? In short, there is an infinite number of beautiful things besides beautiful girls. In any case, this is not really the question; it is not a question of knowing what is beautiful and what is not, but rather to define beauty and to say what makes beautiful things "beautiful".

====Second definition: beauty is gold====
The second response offered by Hippias is:  "This that you ask about, the beautiful, is nothing else but gold... For we all know, I fancy, that wherever this is added, even what before appears ugly will appear beautiful when adorned with gold."{{r|plato}}No doubt, replies Socrates, but what to make then of the great statue of [[Athena]] at the [[Parthenon]]? This masterpiece of [[Phidias]] is mostly made of ivory and precious stones, and not of gold. Yet the statue is magnificent. Besides, gold or any other precious metal only gives rise to beauty if it is properly used. In the case of the pot, for instance, who is to say whether a wooden spoon or a golden spoon would be better to stir with, or which would be more beautiful?

====Third definition: beauty is to be rich and respected====
This time Hippias thinks that he understands: Socrates wants to know what no man will ever find ugly: "I say, then, that for every man and everywhere it is most beautiful to be rich and healthy, and honoured by the Greeks, to reach old age, and, after providing a beautiful funeral for his deceased parents, to be beautifully and splendidly buried by his own offspring." {{r|plato}} A scene follows, where Socrates shows his fear of the beating with a stick he would receive from his harasser if he had given that answer. What then of [[Achilles]] or [[Heracles]]? Was it beautiful for these two heroes, sons of the immortals, to be buried before their parents, before the gods? Was there no beauty in their lives because they were not buried by their offspring?  Beauty in this sense then applies to ordinary men, but it would be ugliness for heroes. The definition is thus incorrect.

===Socrates's three responses===

====First definition: beauty is that which is appropriate====
Tiring of the errors of [[Hippias]], [[Socrates]] offers a definition in his turn, which he holds came from his famous harasser: the beautiful is simply that which is appropriate. This response pleases Hippias. But further examination is needed: first of all, is it the appropriateness which makes things beautiful, or does it simply make them appear to be beautiful? The second hypothesis is tempting: even a ridiculous man, dressed in nice clothing, will appear more beautiful. But inside he would still be ridiculous; thus appropriate and beautiful are not the same.

Hippias suggests that appropriateness provides at the same time the reality and the appearance of beauty. But then, nothing could be less sure; if everything was that simple, citizens and politicians would no longer have to quarrel to decide which action was the nicer.{{r|plato}}

====Second definition: beauty is that which is useful====
[[Socrates]] proposes a second solution: if it is beautiful, is it useful? But here again problems surface: it is through power that men make things useful. Nevertheless, as is well known, power can as much serve evil as it serves good. And there is difficulty in qualifying actions as bad or good.  Which in turn requires that the definition be refocused; beauty is only usefulness applied to good ends, or those that are "favourable".{{r|plato}}

====Third definition: beauty is that which is favourable====
Identifying the beautiful and the favourable leads to a paradox: the favourable procreates the beautiful, as a father procreates a son. Since the favourable and the beautiful are thus considered to be one and the same, they arrive at the finding that beauty is the reason of goodness. In logic, a cause and an effect are two different things, as a father is different from the son. And thus they must conclude that Beauty is not good, and good is not beauty; an assertion which pleases neither Socrates nor [[Hippias]].{{r|plato}}

====Fourth definition: beauty is the pleasure that comes from seeing and hearing====
To conclude, [[Socrates]] brings out a final definition; at first glance quite amazing: "[what] if we were to say that that is beautiful which makes us feel joy ; I do not mean all pleasures, but that which makes us feel joy through hearing and sight?" This hypothesis, while appealing, contains according to Socrates himself a fundamental flaw; that it ignores the beauty of the more noble pleasures, drawn from the studious occupations or the study of laws.

On the other hand, it seems striking that only the senses of sight and hearing are taken into account. Is this a way to submit to common opinion, which is that touch, taste and smell are somehow more shameful and base than the other senses? Finally, it is not simply because pleasure comes from seeing or hearing that it is beautiful. Socrates throws himself into a series of considerations: taking into account pairs of objects, in the Majority of cases the term which they apply to both objects (A and B are beautiful, A and B are just) can apply also to an object taken separately (A is beautiful and B is beautiful). But in some rare cases it can happen that it this is not the case, notably when the sum of A and B forms an even number and A and B, taken in isolation, are two odd numbers.

In the case of beauty, it is the first category that is appropriate, because if a pair of two objects is beautiful, it stands to reason that each of them is. But a new paradox appears, since the beautiful, in discreet definition, must belong to both pleasures of sight and hearing, taken jointly, and cannot belong to only one of them. The definition as a result proves to be flawed. Exhausted by the many questions they have considered, [[Hippias]] berates Socrates and urges him instead of "''with mere talk and nonsense''" to seek beauty in "''the ability to produce a discourse well and beautifully in a court of law or a council-house or before any other public body before which the discourse may be delivered.''"{{r|plato}}
Socrates, taking his leave, pretends to feel bad about the situation, cornered between the attacks of Hippias and those of his mysterious opponent. His only certainty, he concludes with a sense of humour, is that from now on he better understands the [[Greece|Greek]] proverb "''beautiful things are difficult''"

==Authenticity==
The authorship of ''Hippias Major'' has been in dispute.  Although some works previously attributed to Plato have been determined to be inauthentic, this is one where authorship has still not been firmly established, though academic consensus tends toward its authenticity. The argument is summarized in (Sider 1977): "[[Dorothy Tarrant]] is the foremost advocate for the cause of spuriousness: cf. her edition of ''The Hippias Major Attributed to Plato'' (Cambridge, 1928). Opposing her in a series of articles is G.M.A. Grube, who wrote in 1926 and 1927.  [[W. K. C. Guthrie]], in ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' (Cambridge 1975) also argues for its genuineness."&lt;ref&gt;Sider, David. Plato's Early Aesthetics: 'The Hippias Major'. ''Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Art Criticism''; June 1977, Vol. 35 Issue 4, page 465, paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sider, writing in 1992 states that G. R. Ledger, in ''Re-counting Plato'' (Oxford 1989) carried out a computer text analysis and though not conclusive "''On balance the evidence for genuineness is fairly convincing''". He goes on to state that amongst other recent works, [[Paul Woodruff|P. Woodruff]], ''Plato: Hippias Major'' (Oxford 1982) also argues for authenticity and dates the document to "''around 390''" [[Anno Domini|BC]].

C. H. Kahn, "The Beautiful and the Genuine," ''OSAP'' 3 (1985:261–87) is the lone modern figure maintaining spuriousness.&lt;ref&gt;David Sider, Fordham University, reviewing Ivor Ludlam, ''Hippias Major: An Interpretation.'' in the  [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1992/03.05.11.html#NT1  Bryn Mawr Classical Review 3.5.11]; accessed 29 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Vander Waerdt (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Etrz2pkeZvwC&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Socratic Movement''], Cornell University Press, 1994, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy states "Of those [of Plato's works] we listed as authentic, above (in the early group), only the ''Hippias Major'' continues occasionally to be listed as inauthentic. The strongest evidence against the authenticity of the ''Hippias Major'' is the fact that it is never mentioned in any of the ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;James Fieser, Ph.D., and Bradley Dowden, Ph.D., general editors, ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/plato.htm The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]'' (University of Tennessee); accessed 29 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In summary then, although early 20th century scholarship argued that it was spurious, latest research indicates that on the balance it is more likely authentic than not.

'''Hypocatastasis''' is a [[figure of speech]] that declares or implies a [[wikt:resemblance|resemblance]], representation or comparison. It differs from a [[metaphor]], because in a metaphor the two nouns are both named and given; while, in hypocatastasis, only one is named and the other is implied, or as it were, is put down underneath out of sight. Hence hypocatastasis is an implied resemblance or representation: that is an implied simile or metaphor. A hypocatastasis has more force than a metaphor or simile, and expresses as it were a superlative degree of resemblance.

Attribution for the creation of the term is given derisively to a Mr. Lord by G. Bush in 1850.  The latter accuses the former of inventing this category of Biblical comparisons which do not seem to fit into the standard categories of metaphor or [[simile]].&lt;ref name="Bush1850"&gt;{{cite journal|author=George Bush|journal=Anglo-American New Church Repository and Monthly Review: 1851-Feb., 1854|title=The Letter and the Spirit, No. XI|volume=III|issue=4|date=April 1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdgRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA157|publisher=John Allen|pages=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then the term has mostly been confined to analysis of Biblical rhetoric, and it has never migrated to general public usage.  It does not appear in the 2009 version of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].

Bush says of Lord's term:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Hypocatastasis is the substitution, without a formal notice, of agents and objects of one sphere, or of one species, in the place of the persons or objects of another, as in [[Book of Isaiah|Is.]] iii. 15, "What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the faces of the poor?"  These acts, says Mr. L., are not literally impracticable, and therefore are not used metaphorically.  They are violent and extraordinary, and are employed by ''substitution'',  to signify analogous acts of extreme oppression and tyranny.&lt;ref name=Bush1850/&gt;  [Italics in original]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bullinger gives the following example: one may say to another, “You are ''like'' a beast.”&lt;ref&gt;Ethelbert William Bullinger, Figures of Speech Used in the Bible (London; New York: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode; E. &amp; J. B. Young &amp; Co., 1898), 744.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be simile, tamely stating a fact. If, however, he said, “You ''are'' a beast” that would be metaphor. But, if he said simply, “'''Beast!'''” that would be hypocatastasis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Companion Bible: The Authorized Version of 1611 with the Structures and Critical, Explanatory, and Suggestive Notes and with 198 Appendixes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiKjA4sqF_0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA25|accessdate=26 September 2013|date=1 August 1994|publisher=Kregel Publications|isbn=978-0-8254-2177-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the other part of the simile or metaphor (“you”), would be implied and not stated.  This figure, therefore, is calculated to arouse the mind and attract and excite the attention to the greatest extent.

[[File:SNGCop 491.jpg|290px|thumb|right|Coins of King [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]] - 280&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
'''Illyrian coinage''' which began in the 6th century BC continued up to the 1st century of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule. It was the southern [[Illyrians]] who minted the first coins followed by the northern Illyrian during the Roman era. Illyrian coins have also been found in other areas apart from [[Illyria]], such ancient [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonia]], Italy, Greece, [[Asia Minor]] and Egypt.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Early coins==

The earliest Illyrian coins were probably minted by the Tyntenoi north of [[Lake Ohrid]] minted coins around 540&amp;nbsp;BC with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] legend [[Tynteni]]. Their silver coins reached Italy, [[Egypt]] and many parts of [[Asia]]. They belonged to the group of '[[Thraco-Macedonian]]' coinages of this period, and they bore the same emblems as the coins of [[Ichnae]] at the head of the [[Thermaic Gulf]]. Production ceased in the early 5th century BC, most likely in 475&amp;nbsp;BC when this period was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost with mainland Greece and relations with Ionia via the [[Danube]] valley slackened.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Macedonia: 550–336 BC by Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond, Guy Thompson Griffith, page 93 ^ The Cambridge ancient history: The fourth century BC by D. M. Lewis, John Boardman,1994, page 427, "The silver coinage of the Tynteni ceased early in the fifth century. The period after 475 was one of comparative poverty, during which contacts were lost"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Messapians]] in southern [[Italy]] minted coins in the early 5th century BC. They were an early imitation of the Greek coins from [[Magna Grecia]]. The cities which minted these early mints were Valesio, [[Brindisi]], [[Nardò]], [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]], Ugento, Grax and Samadi. Valesio struck silver coins, Nardò silver and bronze while from the 3rd century BC only bronze coins were issued. The coins feature Lapagus, an ancient [[Iapygian]] hero. Other features included [[Athena]], [[Heracles]] and [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Messapi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the Messapians, the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] tribe of the [[Derrones]] were also producing coins. These coins are traditionally dated to 500&amp;nbsp;BC – 450&amp;nbsp;BC. Frequent depictions on the coins attributed to the Derrones are Oxen and Corinthian helmets. Their god, Darr(h)on, was worshipped by Paionians and Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Derivation of the Greek Word Paean |author=Grace H. Macurdy |journal=Language|volume=6 |issue=4 |date=December 1930|pages=297–303 |jstor=409430 |doi=10.2307/409430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wildwinds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/thraco_macedonian_tribes/derrones/t.html|publisher=wildwinds.com|title=Thraco Macedonian Tribes, Derrones, ancient coins index with thumbnails - WildWinds.com|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paeonian kings dealt greatly and seriously with the minting coins. However this activity in terms of quality and appearance did not differ much from Greek coins. Even the Paeonians themselves at this time were becoming hellenized more and more and lost to a great degree their characteristic as a non-Greek people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stipčević|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Illyrian coins in Illyria were minted from the start of the 4th century BC in the [[List of ancient cities in Illyria|Illyrian city]] of [[Damastion]] and Daparria&lt;ref name="wildwinds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/illyria/damastion/i.html|publisher=wildwinds.com|title=Illyria, Damastion - Ancient Greek Coins - WildWinds.com|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrian tribe]] of the [[Dyestes]] under [[Bardylis]], which had been influenced by [[Hellenization]] to an extent. For about 200 years, this city minted silver coins with symbols imitating those of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] cities in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], as well as original symbols such as tongs of a metal smelter. The circulation of Damastion coins included [[Kosovo]], southern [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and the [[Adriatic]] coast from [[Shkodër]] to [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. The presence of silver mines around the city in ancient sources made it possible for the minting of coins in such a great abundance.

==Illyrian kings==
[[File:NBHM-Rezhantsi-Treasure-Silver-tetradrachms-of-Patraus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]]s dated back to the reign of Patraus.]]
The only kings to have minted coins bearing their names were [[Lycceius]], [[Patraus]], [[Audoleon]], [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]], [[Mytilus of Illyria|Mytilus]], [[Gentius]] and [[Ballaios]].

===Patraus===
The coinage of Patraus is remarkable. They have on the obverse a head of [[Apollo]], which may be in allusion to the king's name, Apollo being known under the name of Patraus. On the reverse of the coins is a horseman riding over an enemy, in allusion to triumphs over the Macedonians and an inscription of the king.&lt;ref&gt;The Coin collector's manual, or Guide to the numismatic student in the ... By Henry Noel Humphreys page92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audoleon===
The coins of Audoleon have a head wearing a Corinthian helmet on the obverse and on the reverse a horse stepping, very boldly executed and the inscription of the king.

===Monunius===
[[File:Silver stater, Apollonia, 340-280 BC.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]'s coin. A cow and a suckling calf. Reverse: double stellate pattern within dual linear border and the inscription A Π O Λ around.]] 
The first [[Dardani]]an king to have minted silver coins was [[Monunius I of Dardania|Monunius]] in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, around 280&amp;nbsp;BC. He struck his coins in the Greek colony of [[Durrës]] and they differed only in having the jaw of a boar set over the cow, as a symbol of the royal Illyrian house. The coins also had the abbreviated inscription 'ΔYP' (for Durrës) to donate the place where they were minted, as well as showing royal sovereignty over the city. These coins have been found in great numbers in the Illyrian city of [[Gurazez|Gurëzeza]], and in the interior of [[Albania]] beyond [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. The Illyrian kingdom under Monunius extended as far as the [[Lyncestian]] Lakes, and from here Monunius could have intervened in the quarrel about the Macedonian throne, eventually turning into a claimant for it. This surely is the meaning of the minting of a second series of silver coins bearing his name and traditional Macedonian symbols, the head of [[Heracles]] on the face and on the reverse, Olympian [[Zeus]] sitting on his throne. That this, was a short lived dream of the Illyrian king is shown by the fact that so few coins were minted, so much that only one specimen is preserved today.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] 2005, p.114 {{ISBN|99943-672-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mytilus===
[[Mytilus of Illyria|Mytilus]], the successor of King Monunius, struck his coins 10 years later around 270&amp;nbsp;BC. His bronze coinage with the symbols of the city of [[Durrës]] in Albania bear his name. The coinage of Apollonia in the same period bore only his monogram, as well as symbols similar to those of the [[Aetolian League]].&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] 2005, {{ISBN|99943-672-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentius===
[[File:Face of King Gentius on Ancient Illyrian coin.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Gentius]] on a bronze coin.]]
The most productive conage is of [[Gentius]] who ruled from 181&amp;nbsp;BC. Two of his mints were located in [[Shkodra]], the ancient Illyrian capital at the time of his regn, and in [[Lezha]], both located in modern-day north-eastern Albania. His coins were also struck in [[Durrës]], where the royal title is absent from any silver coin, and the name Gentius, not uncommon to an Illyrian male, may belong not to the king but to a local magistrate. However, around 30 to 40 examples of bronze coins have been recorded with the legend 'King Genthios'. Upon his defeat by the Romans in 168&amp;nbsp;BC his treasury of 120,000 silver pieces were conveyed to [[Rome]].

===Ballaios===
[[File:Balajos.jpg|thumb|upright| King [[Ballaios]] on a bronze coin.]]
[[Ballaios]] reigned after the kingdom of Gentius was dissolved into the Roman Empire from around 167&amp;nbsp;BC – 135&amp;nbsp;BC. The abundance of the coinage of Ballaios in the region would suggest that he was a powerful and influential king although no literary of historical evidence of him exists. The coins of the well-known king Gentius are scarce in comparison to the coins of Ballaios. His silver issues are rare, but bronze coins (without the royal title) occur on [[Hvar]] in [[Croatia]], both in single finds and in hoards, and at [[Rhizon]], the ancient capital of Queen [[Teuta]], in a different series bearing the royal title. The coins of Ballaios were widely imitated in the region, sometimes so crudely that they are unintelligible. Ballaios struck coins in two cities: [[Hvar|Pharos]] and Rhizon. The weight of the bronze coins are between 1.0 and 4.5&amp;nbsp;g, while most of the documented specimens weigh between 2.0 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;g. The relativity great impact of the coinage of Ballaios is indicated by a large number of imitations of his coins. His coins are found in both the eastern Adriatic shores and frequently in Italy, which confirms the trade contacts between the two Adriatic coasts.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Épire, Illyrie, Macédoine: mélanges offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes|author1=Cabanes, P.|author2=Berranger, D.|author3=Centre de recherches sur les civilisations antiques|date=2007|publisher=Presses universitaires Blaise Pascal|isbn=9782845163515|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=I_kFU6h77ssC&amp;pg=PA129|page=129|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Illyria: An Archaeological Exploration|author1=Evans, A.|author2=Destani, B.D.|date=2006|publisher=I.

On the obverse of his coins a bust of the king facing left to right is depicted, while on the reverse [[Artemis]] (advancing or standing) is represented, with or without a torch and sometimes carrying one or two spears. It is significant that Ballaios also had [[silver]] coins minted, which indicates his wealth and power, since elsewhere in [[Dalmatia]], silver coinage is very rarely documented from the Greek and Illyrian mints.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"/&gt;

==City coins==

[[File:Monedha Labeate.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shkodër|Shkodra]]'s coin with the inscription: 'SKOΔRI-NΩN'.]]
The coins of ancient Lissus, modern-day [[Lezha]], with the legend 'LISSITAN' began with autonomous issues under the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] influences (211&amp;nbsp;BC – 197&amp;nbsp;BC). The coins were followed later by the issues of Gentius with a ship on the reverse and a third series from the period after the kings removal. Lissus minted coins on behalf of the community of the Lissians and minted a rare coin with an inscription over the head of an Illyrian god wearing a causia type hat. The face depicted on the Lissian coins was originally though to be of King [[Gentius]], although Albanian archaeologist, [[Hasan Ceka]] was proved it to by the head of the Illyrian sea god, [[Rodon (Illyrian god)|Rodon]]. The head of [[Artemis]] and an Illyrian shield is depicted on some Lissian coins. The Shkodra coins fall into three similar groups, the first and third with the legend 'SKODRI-NON' and the second with the legend of king Gentius. In the city of Rhizon a mint was established that issued several coinages. These incleded autonomous coinages of the town, in bronze, the royal coinage of king Ballaios, in silver and bronze, most probably, the coinage labeled “Coinage from the [[Bay of Kotor|Rhizonian Gulf]]”, which has been considered as the coinage of an alliance in which [[Rhizon]] played a part, in silver and bronze.

[[File:Daorson Coin.jpg|thumb|[[Daorson]] coin with a galley on the reverse.]]
The chronology of these coinages is still not defined with precision, primarily because the historical background of their issuance remains little known. There is hardly any mention in the literary sources of the town of Rhizon, and none of the king Ballaios. However, several features of these coinages - such as the characteristics of style, elements of inscription and iconography (especially the presence of the title “basileus” on the coinage of Ballaios, and the presence of a Macedonian shield on the “Coinage from the Rhizonian Gulf”), metrology, choice of coined metals, etc. – point to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE as the general chronological framework for the activity of the Rhizonian mint and for the successive issuance of the coinages of different issuing authorities there. Around [[Lake Scutari]] the [[Labeates]] issued a rare type of bronze coin, bearing the head of an Illyrian deity and a [[Liburnian warship]] with a dolphin swimming underneath. Between 217&amp;nbsp;BC and 84&amp;nbsp;BC the city of [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]] in Italy minted coins with the head of Lapagus, the ancient Iapygian hero. In [[Daorson]] the capital of the Daorsi in modern [[Bosnia]], 39 different coins (29 bearing the image of King [[Ballaios]] from 168&amp;nbsp;BC, and 9 with a Greek inscription and a boat image) have been discovered.&lt;ref name="coe" &gt;http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/regional/see/IRPPSAAH/PTA%20Ljubljana/BH_22-PTA-APPROVED_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Money was of immense importance to the Daorsi, ensuring the tribe's independence while also confirming their well developed business, cultural and trade links with other peoples.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illyrians|author=Wilkes, J.|date=1996|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780631198079|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&amp;pg=PA177|page=177|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Illyrian coins also appeare in other ancient cities especially those in the south of Illyria, such as in the Illyrian/Greek cities of [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Pelion (Chaonia)|Pelion]] and [[Olympe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John J.|title=The Illyrians|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1995|isbn=0-631-19807-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The koinon of the [[Bylliones]] centred on the city of [[Byllis]] minted its own bronze coins. The first coins came out around 270&amp;nbsp;BC and continued until 167&amp;nbsp;BC when the Romans dissolved the koinon.&lt;ref name="albca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1434|publisher=albca.com|title=www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1434|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intersection for the Arts''', established in 1965, is the oldest alternative [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] art space in [[San Francisco, California]]. Intersection's reading series is the longest continuous reading series outside of an academic institution in the state of [[California]].

Intersection produces and presents new and experimental work in the fields of [[literature]], [[theater]], [[music]], and the [[visual arts]]. Intersection's artists regularly provide classes and workshops to the local community. Intersection also maintains an incubation program for emerging literary, visual and performing arts groups.

Intersection is located in the SoMa district of San Francisco, on 925 Mission Street, between 5th and 6th Streets.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:766 Valencia - Intersection (1988).jpg|left|thumb|Intersection for the Arts in 1988 at their old location on 766 Valencia. The current location is now at 925 Mission St. Suite 109.]] --&gt;

Intersection was founded in the Tenderloin in 1965 by an interfaith coalition of three churches. The organization began as a merger of several faith-based experiments that were using art to reach disenfranchised neighborhood youth while also providing artists who were [[conscientious objector]]s with an alternative to serving in the [[Vietnam War]].  The founding Director was Laird Sutton and full-time staff members were poetry director Adrian Ravarour, Tom Dobson, Paul Donetti, and Juan Elorreaga. By 1967, it moved to North Beach and remained for 20 years. [[Robin Williams]], Father Guido Sarducci ([[Don Novello]]), [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Bill Irwin]] and [[Country Joe McDonald]]  performed there. [[Gregory Corso]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Ishmael Reed]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] read there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 1985 it lost its North Beach space and a year later, relocated to 766 Valencia Street in the Mission District, moving again in 1989, to a former furniture store on Valencia Street. [[Campo Santo Theatre Company]], [[Joe Goode]] and [[Erika Chong Shuch]], and  [[Marcus Shelby]] performed there. [[Denis Johnson]] and [[Dave Eggers]] read there.

Then it relocated to 925 Mission Street, Suite 109, a 5M space in The Chronicle building at Fifth Street and Mission Street.

Over the years, Intersection has evolved into a more diverse organization with a more prominent profile, but maintains strong ties with the local community.

Intersection has worked with a range of artists including [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[David Henry Hwang]], [[Carolyn Forché]], and [[Ishmael Reed]]. Recently, it has developed and presented work with [[Jessica Hagedorn]], [[Alice Walker]], [[bell hooks]], [[John Trudell]], [[Denis Johnson]], [[Lebbeus Woods]], [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]], [[Dave Eggers]], [[Jimmy Santiago Baca]], [[Stefon Harris]], [[Naomi Iizuka]], [[Claudia Bernardi]], [[Joe Goode]], and [[Gary Snyder]], as well as thousands of emerging artists.

Intersection for the Arts produces anywhere from 6-11 theatrical and dance productions, 10-12 literary readings, 12-16 concerts, and 4-6 art exhibits or installations in a given year, as well as workshops in each discipline taught by the resident artists. Intersection's building also hosts a variety of community, social, and artistic events for other San Francisco artistic organizations throughout the year, including the [[Litquake]] Festival, the [[Jackson Award]], and the [[Phelan Award]].

Intersection for the Arts's resident artists include the theater company [[Campo Santo (theater)|Campo Santo]] ([[Margo Hall]], [[Sean San Jose]], [[Luis Saguar]], [[Michael Torres]] - Founders. [[Denis Johnson]] - Resident Playwright), [[Erika Chong Shuch]] and her dance-theater company the [[Erika Shuch Performance (ESP) Project]], the jazz musician [[Howard Wiley]], [[Marc Bamuthi Joseph]] and [[Youth Speak]]'s theater program [[The Living Word Project]], and photographer [[Scott Chernis]].

Outside of academic institutions, Intersection for the Arts' literary series is the longest continual reading series in the state of California. The longevity of the series has attracted an increasing number of high-profile writers, but the series continues to regularly showcase the work of emerging, local writers in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In recent years, Intersection has complemented their literary series with the Independent Press Spotlight series, hosting talks with members of San Francisco independent publishers and literary magazines scene while authors perform readings from recent issues. Participants in this series include [[AK Press]],
''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'',
[[City Lights Publishers]],
''[[ColorLines Magazine]]'',
[[Fourteen Hills]],
[[Heyday Books]],
''[[LiP Magazine]]'',
[[Manic D Press]],
[[McSweeney’s]],
[[Mercury House (publishers)|Mercury House]],
[[New American Writing]],
[[Switchback (journal)|Switchback]],
[[Tachyon Publications]],

and ''[[ZYZZYVA]]'' as well as newer magazines, journals, and publishers.

== Intersection Incubator ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:intersectionincubator.jpg|thumb|Intersection Incubator Logo]] --&gt;
In addition to producing its own work, Intersection for the Arts provides members of its incubation program assistance in funding, developing, and promoting their artists' work. Through fiscal sponsorship, the program has encouraged funding agencies and contributors to take risks in funding new projects and emerging artists by ensuring that the funds will be well managed and spent according to the funder's guidelines.

Currently the Intersection Incubator provides support to more than 120 art projects and organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area across numerous disciplines and levels of experience. Several organizations that have been in the incubation program have gone on to have lasting impact in the San Francisco Bay Area, including [[Youth Speaks]], [[Flyaway Productions]], [[The Traveling Jewish Theater]], and [[Galería de la Raza]].

'''King &amp; McGaw''' is an art publisher and online retailer. It supplies high quality art prints and products to museums, galleries and retail stores as well as art prints direct to consumers through its online retail site. Production is based in their {{convert|50000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} factory in [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], Sussex.

The company was set up in Sussex in 1982 by three brothers Gyr, Quentin and Perry King under the name King Publishing, as a silkscreen printing company. The company designed upmarket posters for art galleries and small boutique shops.  The brothers negotiated the rights to works of art by new artists and photographers, as well as established artists such as [[Bridget Riley]], [[Howard Hodgkin]] and [[Terry Frost]].&lt;ref name="mynewsdesk.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/pressreleases/james-bidwell-appointed-ceo-of-easyart-as-fast-growing-online-art-company-secures-additional-funding-round-930212|title=James Bidwell appointed CEO of Easyart as fast growing online art... – Easyart UK|work=Mynewsdesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kingandmcgaw-newhaven-factory.jpg|left|thumb|King &amp; McGaw Warehouse in Newhaven]]
The company rebranded to King Posters by the late 1980s with the business developing into other areas including framing and product development for museum shops such as the [[Tate]], [[National Gallery]], [[Louvre]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="mynewsdesk.com" /&gt;

In 1989 King Posters was making annual sales of £2&amp;nbsp;million but later that year a fire destroyed the warehouse and resulted in £3&amp;nbsp;million worth of stock being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/article1037306.ece|title=How I Made It: Gyr King, founder of King &amp; McGaw – The Sunday Times|work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's bank loaned an additional £5000 so the stock could be reprinted and an American supplier, Bruce McGaw, offered to replace some of the missing stock for free, which, in turn, triggered a business deal. As a result, the company was renamed in 1990 to King &amp; McGaw.

During the 1990s, King &amp; McGaw's focused on turning to supplying department stores with pictures and posters as well as museums and galleries resulting in partnerships with [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], [[Next plc|Next]] and [[Debenhams]]. As a result, sales had reached $35&amp;nbsp;million a year by the end of 2000. Further developments occurred in 2007 when the company switched to digital printing, allowing them to print-to-order.
[[File:Kingandmcgaw-popup-shop-london-may2015.jpg|right|thumb|Pop Up Shop in Soho, London]]
By 2011 the company decided to expand into retail by acquiring the online retailer Easyart.com. Easyart was set up by Simon Matthews in 1999 during the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] and in 2002 faced legal allegations from [[Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou]], the founder of [[EasyJet]], over its use of the easy name, accusing Easyart of "passing off" on easyGroup's good name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/11/12/easyart_com_to_face_stelios/|title=Easyart.com to face Stelios in 'easy' court action|work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easyart won the court battle when easyGroup discontinued its legal action, saying it had bigger targets to go after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-3545|title=EasyGroup abandons domain claim against Easyart.com|author=Luisa Deas|publisher=[[Out-Law.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the company, then under CEO and co-founder Marc Lickfett, discontinued the Easyart brand and merged the site within the King &amp; McGaw brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fineart.co.uk/article/easyart-rebrands-as-king--mcgaw-966.aspx|title=Easyart rebrands as King &amp; McGaw|publisher=[[Fine Art Trade Guild]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 King &amp; McGaw used a [[pop-up retail|pop-up]] shop to showcase lithographic posters from the [[Mourlot Studios]] archives on [[D'Arblay Street]], [[Soho]], London.&lt;ref name="itsnicethat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/atelier-mourlot|title=It's Nice That – Gorgeous rare posters by the likes of Picasso, Míro and Le Corbusier|work=It's Nice That}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions from artists such as

were also held at the shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kingandmcgaw.com/inspiration/post/art-workshops-at-the-king-mcgaw-gallery|title=Art Workshops at the King &amp; McGaw Gallery|author=Milly|publisher=King and McGaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lady with an Ermine''''' ({{lang-it|Dama con l'ermellino}} {{IPA-it|ˈdaːma kon lermelˈliːno|}}; {{lang-pl|Dama z gronostajem}}) is a painting by Italian artist  [[Leonardo da Vinci]] from around 1489–1490 and one of [[Poland]]'s national treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/event/da-vincis-lady-with-an-ermine-among-polands-treasures|title=Da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine among Poland's "Treasures" - Event - Culture.pl|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait's subject is [[Cecilia Gallerani]], painted at a time when she was the mistress of [[Ludovico Sforza]], [[Duchy of Milan|Duke of Milan]], and Leonardo was in the Duke's service. It is one of only four [[portrait]]s of women painted by Leonardo, the others being the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', [[Ginevra de' Benci|the portrait of Ginevra de' Benci]], and ''[[La belle ferronnière]]''. The painting was purchased in 2016 from the [[Czartoryski Museum|Czartoryski]] Foundation by the Polish [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] for the [[National Museum, Kraków|National Museum in Kraków]], and has been on display in the museum's main building since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mnk.pl/wystawy/leonardo-da-vinci-dama-z-gronostajem |title=Leonarda da Vinci, "Dama z gronostajem" |year=2017 |website=Muzeum Narodowe w Krakowie |language=Polish |access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject and symbolism==
The small portrait generally called ''The Lady with the Ermine'' was painted in oils [[panel painting|on a wooden panel]]. [[Oil paint]] was relatively new to Italy at the time, having been introduced in the 1470s.

The subject has been identified with reasonable certainty as Cecilia Gallerani, the mistress of Leonardo's employer, [[Ludovico Sforza]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Kemp, entry for ''The Lady with an Ermine'' in the exhibition ''Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration'' (Washington-New Haven-London) pp 271f, states "the identification of the sitter in this painting as Cecilia Gallerani is reasonably secure;" Janice Shell and Grazioso Sironi, "Cecilia Gallerani: Leonardo's Lady with an Ermine" ''Artibus et Historiae'' '''13''' No. 25 (1992:47–66) discuss the career of this identification since it was first suggested in 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallerani was a member of a large family that was neither wealthy nor [[Nobility of Italy|noble]]. Her father served for a time at the Duke's court. When her portrait was painted, she was about 16 years old and was renowned for her beauty, scholarship and poetry. She was married at approximately age six to a young nobleman of the house of [[Visconti family|Visconti]], but she sued to [[Annulment|annul]] the marriage in 1487 for undisclosed reasons and the request was granted. She became the Duke's mistress and bore him a son, even after his marriage to [[Beatrice d'Este]] 11 years previously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creval.it/gallerie_en/eventi/cecilia.htm Who was Cecilia Gallerani?], Barbara Fabjan and Pietro C. Marani, Exhibition notes, October 15, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice was promised to the Duke when she was only 5, and married him when she was 16 in 1491. After a few months, she discovered the Duke was still seeing Gallerani, and forced the Duke to end the relationship by having her married to a local count named Bergamino.

The painting shows a half-height figure, the body of a woman turned at a three-quarter angle toward her right, but with her face turned toward her left. Her gaze is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a "third party" beyond the picture's frame. Gallerani holds a small white-coated [[stoat]], known as an ermine. Her dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a ''coazone'', confines her hair smoothly to her head with two bands of it bound on either side of her face and a long plait at the back. Her hair is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creval.it/gallerie_en/eventi/dama_catalogo.htm Notes for a portrait: the Lady's dress and hairstyle], Grazietta Butazzi, Exhibition notes, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several interpretations of the ermine's significance. In its winter coat, the ermine was a traditional [[symbol]] of purity, as it was believed it would face death rather than soil its white coat.&lt;ref&gt;Boria Sax, ''The Mythical Zoo: an encyclopedia of animals in world myth, legend, and literature'', 2001, ''s.v.'' "Beaver, porcupine, badger and miscellaneous rodents".&lt;/ref&gt; In his old age, Leonardo compiled a [[bestiary]] in which he recorded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;MODERATION&lt;/small&gt; The ermine out of moderation never eats but once a day, and it would rather let itself be captured by hunters than take refuge in a dirty lair, in order not to stain its purity.&lt;ref&gt;James Beck, "The Dream of Leonardo da Vinci", ''Artibus et Historiae'' '''14''' No. 27 (1993:185–198) p. 188; Beck adds, "the artist left a pictorial record to accompany his written testimony—the famous ''Portrait of a Lady with an ermine'' (Czartoryski Collection, Cracow)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He repeats this idea in another note, "Moderation curbs all the vices. The ermine prefers to die rather than soil itself."&lt;ref&gt;Beck 1009:191.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ermines were kept as pets by the aristocracy and their white pelts were used to line or trim aristocratic garments. For Ludovico il Moro, the ermine had a further personal significance in that he had been in the [[Order of the Ermine (Naples)]] in 1488 and used it as a personal emblem.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rona, "l'investitura di Lodovico il Moro dell'Ordine dell'Armellino" ''Archivio Storico Lombardo'' '''103''' (1979:346-58); as political allegory, see C. Pedretti, "La ''Dama dell'Ermellino'' come allegoria politica", ''Studi politici in onore di Luigi Firpo'' I, Milan 1990:161-81, both noted by Ruth Wilkins Sullivan, in "Three Ferrarese Panels on the Theme of 'Death Rather than Dishonour' and the Neapolitan Connection" ''Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte'' '''57'''.4 (1994:610–625) p. 620 and note 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the ermine with Cecilia Gallerani could have referred both to her purity and to make an association with her lover. Alternatively, the ermine could be a pun on her name: The Ancient Greek term for ermine, or other weasel-like species of animals, is ''galê'' ({{lang|grc|γαλῆ}}) or ''galéē'' ({{lang|grc|γαλέη}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=galh&amp;la=greek#lexicon Liddell, Scott and Jones Ancient Greek dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; This would be in keeping with Leonardo's placement of a [[juniper]] bush behind the figure in his portrait of [[Ginevra de Benci]] in reference to her name. Given that Gallerani gave birth to a son acknowledged by Lodovico in May 1491, and the association of weasels and pregnancy in Italian Renaissance culture, it also is possible the animal was a symbol of Cecilia's pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Musacchio, "Weasels and Pregnancy in Renaissance Italy", Renaissance Studies 15 (2001): 172–187.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been speculated that the animal in the painting may not be an ermine,&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Godse. [http://www.mcnews.com/ferrets/detail.aspx?aid=21240&amp;cid=3853 "Ermine or Ferret?"] FerretsMagazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; but a white [[ferret]], a colour favoured in the Middle Ages because of the ease of seeing the white animal in thick undergrowth.

As in many of Leonardo's paintings, the composition comprises a pyramidic spiral and the sitter is caught in the motion of turning to her left, reflecting Leonardo's lifelong preoccupation with the dynamics of movement. The three-quarter profile portrait was one of his many innovations. Il Moro's court poet, [[Bernardo Bellincioni]], was the first to propose that Cecilia was poised as if listening to an unseen speaker.

This work in particular shows Leonardo's expertise in painting the human form. Cecelia's outstretched hand was painted in great detail, with every contour of each fingernail, each wrinkle around her knuckles, and even the flexing of the tendon in her bent finger.

The art critic Maike Vogt-Luerssen postulated that the painting's subject is a member of the Royal Neapolitan House of Aragon, given her Catalan costume and that she is holding her dynasty's most important symbol, the ermine in its winter fur. Vogt-Luerssen believes she is Giovanna of Aragon (1478–1518), Queen of Naples, who was married to Ferrandino (or Ferdinand II) of Naples.

==Conservation==
''Lady with an Ermine'' has been subjected to two detailed laboratory examinations. The first was in the Warsaw Laboratories, with the findings published by K. Kwiatkowski in 1955. It underwent examination and restoration again in 1992 at the [[National Gallery of Art|Washington National Gallery Laboratories]] under the supervision of David Bull.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

The painting is in oil on a thin walnut wood panel, about {{convert|4|-|5|mm}} thick, prepared with a layer of white [[gesso]] and a layer of brownish [[Underpainting|underpaint]].&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://www.creval.it/gallerie_en/eventi/dama_conservazione.htm Preservation and Scientific examinations], David Bull&lt;/ref&gt; The panel is in good condition apart from a break to the upper left side. Its size has never been altered, as indicated by a narrow unpainted border on all four sides.

The background was thinly overpainted with unmodulated black, probably between 1830 and 1870, when the damaged corner was restored. [[Eugène Delacroix]] was suggested to have painted the background. Its previous colour was a bluish grey.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; The signature "LEONARD D'AWINCI" (which is Polish phonetical transcription of the name "da Vinci") in the upper left corner is not original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/english/The/first/lady/of/the/Renaissance/vists/Spain/elpepueng/20110525elpeng_7/Ten|title= The first lady of the Renaissance visits Spain|work=[[El País]]|accessdate= 11 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-ray and microscopic analysis have revealed the charcoal-pounced outline of the pricked preparatory drawing on the prepared undersurface, a technique Leonardo learned in the studio of [[Verrocchio]].&lt;ref name=Bull&gt;David Bull, ''Two Portraits by Leonardo: "Ginevra de' Benci" and the "Lady with an Ermine" ''Artibus et Historiae'' '''13''' No. 25 (1992:67–83), pp 76ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the black of the background and some abrasion caused by cleaning, the painted surface reveals the painting is almost entirely by the artist's hand. There has been some slight retouching of her features in red, and the edge of the veil in ochre. Some scholars believe there also was some later retouching of the hands.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

Leonardo's fingerprints have been found in the surface of the paint, indicating he used his fingers to blend his delicate brushstrokes.&lt;ref&gt;Bull 1993:81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was acquired in Italy in 1798 by Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]], the son of Princess [[Izabela Czartoryska]] and Prince [[Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski]], and incorporated into the Czartoryski family collections at [[Puławy]] in 1800. The inscription on the top-left corner of the painting, &lt;small&gt;LA BELE FERONIERE. LEONARD DAWINCI.&lt;/small&gt;, was probably added by a restorer shortly after its arrival in Poland,&lt;ref&gt;Shell and Sironi 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and before the background was overpainted.&lt;ref&gt;Bull 1992:78.&lt;/ref&gt; Czartoryski was clearly aware it was a Leonardo, although the painting had never been discussed in print; no record exists of any previous owner. The ''[[La Belle Ferronière|Belle Ferronière]]'' is the Leonardo portrait in the Louvre, whose sitter bears such a close resemblance, the Czartoryskis considered this sitter to be the same. 

The painting travelled extensively during the 19th century. Princess Czartoryska rescued it in advance of the invading Russian army in 1830, hid it, sent it to Dresden and on to the Czartoryski place of exile in Paris, the [[Hôtel Lambert]]; then returned it to [[Kraków]] in 1882. In 1939, almost immediately after the German occupation of Poland, it was seized by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and sent to the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]] in Berlin. In 1940, [[Hans Frank]], the Governor General of Poland, requested it be returned to Kraków, where it hung in his suite of offices. At the end of the Second World War it was discovered by Allied troops in Frank's country home in [[Bavaria]] and has since been returned to Poland at the [[Czartoryski Museum]] in Kraków. Since May 2017, it may be found in a branch of the National Museum in Kraków, just outside the Old Town.

==Reception==
When exhibited in [[The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] in 2003, the painting was described as "signal[ling] a breakthrough in the art of psychological portraiture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfah.org/exhibition.asp?par1=1&amp;par2=1&amp;par3=98&amp;par4=1&amp;par5=1&amp;par6=1&amp;par7=&amp;lgc=4&amp;eid=&amp;currentPage= Leonardo da Vinci and the Splendour of Poland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215033642/http://www.mfah.org/exhibition.asp?par1=1&amp;par2=1&amp;par3=98&amp;par4=1&amp;par5=1&amp;par6=1&amp;par7=&amp;lgc=4&amp;eid=&amp;currentPage= |date=2009-02-15 }}, exhibition February 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
''Lady with an Ermine'' was one of the visual inspirations for [[Philip Pullman]]'s concept of [[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmons]], appearing in the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' series of novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Robert Butler |title=An Interview with Philip Pullman |publisher=[[The Economist|Intelligent Life]] |date=2007-12-03 |url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/697 |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305011900/http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/node/697 |archivedate=2008-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Resnick]]'s [[science fiction]] novel ''Lady with an Alien'' (2005) was inspired by Resnick's opinion that the animal in Gallerani's arms "simply doesn't look like an ermine".&lt;ref name=Resnick&gt;''Lady with an Alien'', by [[Mike Resnick]], published 2005 by [[Watson-Guptill]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lady with an Ermine'' has inspired ''[[Vinci (film)|Vinci]]'' (2004), a Polish heist comedy film directed by [[Juliusz Machulski]].

The 2016 psychological horror video game ''[[Layers of Fear]]'' features a perversion of ''Lady with an Ermine'' as an example of the protagonist's insanity and [[musophobia]]. ''Lady with an Ermine'' is also an attainable [[Steam (software)|Steam]] badge in the game.

''Lady with an Ermine'' appears in the novel ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' (1992) by Robert Harris.

In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Thief of Time]], Lady LeJean is based on Woman Holding Ferret by Leonard of Quirm, a parody of this painting.

'''''Late Night Woman's Hour''''' (LNWH) is a late night edition of the long-running, [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Woman's Hour]]''. It started in 2015 with a one month pilot run, scheduled twice weekly on Thursday and Friday at 11 pm for one hour.&lt;ref name=Spec/&gt;  The presenters for this first run were [[Lauren Laverne]] and [[Jane Garvey (broadcaster)|Jane Garvey]] who led panels of five guests in discussion of a particular topic such as [[fan fiction]] or [[lust]].&lt;ref name=G15/&gt;  Lauren Laverne then became the permanent host when the programme started a regular schedule in 2016, being scheduled as a monthly podcast which was then broadcast on Radio 4 at 11 pm on the last Thursday of each month.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;&lt;ref name=G16/&gt; 

The topics discussed in the first run included the dating app, [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]], and lying.  The conversation was frank and adult, being broadcast after the [[Watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]].&lt;ref name=Spec/&gt;  This resulted in a gaffe when one of the guests, Guardian journalist Hannah Jane Parkinson, used an expletive, for which the host apologised.&lt;ref name=G15/&gt;  Other guests have included [[Irma Kurtz]], [[Kellie Maloney]] and [[Richard Herring]].&lt;ref name=Spec/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19362">{{Lie groups |Algebras}}

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, [[Sophus Lie]] introduced the notion of [[Lie group]] in order to study the solutions of [[ordinary differential equations]]&lt;ref name="Lie1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lie1890"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lie1893"/&gt; (ODEs). He showed the following main property: the order of an ordinary differential equation can be reduced by one if it is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under one-parameter Lie group of [[point transformation]]s.&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; This observation unified and extended the available integration techniques. Lie devoted the remainder of his mathematical career to developing these [[continuous group]]s that have now an impact on many areas of mathematically based sciences. The applications of Lie groups to [[differential system]]s were mainly established by Lie and [[Emmy Noether]], and then advocated by [[Élie Cartan]].

Roughly speaking, a Lie point symmetry of a system is a local group of transformations that maps every solution of the system to another solution of the same system. In other words, it maps the solution set of the system to itself. Elementary examples of Lie groups are [[Translation (geometry)|translations]], [[rotations]] and [[Scaling (geometry)|scalings]].

The Lie symmetry theory is a well-known subject. In it are discussed [[continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] opposed to, for example, [[discrete symmetry|discrete symmetries]]. The literature for this theory can be found, among other places, in these notes.&lt;ref name="Olver1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olver1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlumanKumei1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephani1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeviWinternitz2006"/&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Types of symmetries ===
Lie groups and hence their infinitesimal generators can be naturally "extended" to act on the space of independent variables, [[state variable]]s (dependent variables) and derivatives of the state variables up to any finite order. There are many other kinds of symmetries. For example, [[contact geometry|contact transformations]] let coefficients of the transformations infinitesimal generator depend also on first derivatives of the coordinates. [[Lie-Bäcklund transformation]]s let them involve derivatives up to an arbitrary order. The possibility of the existence of such symmetries was recognized by Noether.&lt;ref name="Noether1918"/&gt; For Lie point symmetries, the coefficients of the infinitesimal generators depend only on coordinates, denoted by &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Applications ===
Lie symmetries were introduced by Lie in order to solve ordinary differential equations. Another application of symmetry methods is to reduce systems of differential equations, finding equivalent systems of differential equations of simpler form. This is called [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]. In the literature, one can find the classical reduction process,&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; and the [[moving frame]]-based reduction process.&lt;ref name="Cartan1935"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FelsOlver1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FelsOlver1999"/&gt; Also symmetry groups can be used for classifying different symmetry classes of solutions.

== Geometrical framework ==

=== Infinitesimal approach ===
Lie's fundamental theorems underline that Lie groups can be characterized by elements known as ''infinitesimal generators''. These mathematical objects form a [[Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal generators. Deduced "infinitesimal symmetry conditions" (defining equations of the symmetry group) can be explicitly solved in order to find the closed form of symmetry groups, and thus the associated infinitesimal generators.

Let &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of coordinates on which a system is defined where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinal of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. An infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator &lt;math&gt;\delta : \mathbb{R}(Z)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; that has &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; in its kernel and that satisfies the [[Product rule|Leibniz rule]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (f_1,f_2) \in \mathbb{R}(Z)^2, \delta f_1 f_2 = f_1 \delta f_2 + f_2 \delta f_1&lt;/math&gt;.
In the canonical basis of elementary derivations &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial z_1},\dots,\frac{\partial}{\partial z_n}\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, it is written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_{z_i}(Z) \frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\xi_{z_i}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\left\{1,\dots,n\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Lie groups and Lie algebras of infinitesimal generators ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

[[Lie algebra]]s can be generated by a generating set of infinitesimal generators as defined above. To every Lie group, one can associate a Lie algebra. Roughly, a Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[algebra]] constituted by a vector space equipped with [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] as additional operation. The base field of a Lie algebra depends on the concept of [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. Here only finite-dimensional Lie algebras are considered.

=== Continuous dynamical systems ===

A [[dynamical system]] (or [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]) is a one-parameter [[group action]]. Let us denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; such a dynamical system, more precisely, a (left-)action of a group &lt;math&gt;(G,+)&lt;/math&gt; on a [[manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rccc}
\mathcal{D} : &amp; G\times M &amp; \rightarrow &amp; M \\
&amp; \nu \times Z &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{D}(\nu,Z)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
such that for all point &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(e,Z)=Z&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the neutral element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;;
* for all &lt;math&gt;(\nu, \hat{\nu})&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(\nu,\mathcal{D}(\hat{\nu},Z))=\mathcal{D}(\nu+\hat{\nu},Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

A continuous dynamical system is defined on a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that can be identified to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the group elements are continuous.

=== Invariants ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

An [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], roughly speaking, is an element that does not change under a transformation.

== Definition of Lie point symmetries ==

In this paragraph, we consider precisely ''expanded Lie point symmetries'' i.e. we work in an expanded space meaning that the distinction between independent variable, state variables and parameters are avoided as much as possible.

A symmetry group of a system is a continuous dynamical system defined on a local Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acting on a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. For the sake of clarity, we restrict ourselves to n-dimensional real manifolds &lt;math&gt;M=\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of system coordinates.

=== Lie point symmetries of algebraic systems ===

Let us define [[algebraic system]]s used in the forthcoming symmetry definition.

==== Algebraic systems ====

Let &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)=(p_1/q_1,\dots,p_k/q_k)&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of rational functions over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}[Z]&lt;/math&gt; i.e. in variables &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. An ''algebraic system'' associated to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the following equalities and inequalities:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
p_1(Z)= 0, \\
\vdots \\
p_k(Z)=0
\end{array}
\right.&amp; \mbox{and} &amp;
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
q_1(Z) \neq 0, \\
\vdots \\
q_k(Z) \neq 0.
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

An algebraic system defined by &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)&lt;/math&gt; is ''regular'' (a.k.a. [[Smooth algebraic variety|smooth]]) if the system &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is of maximal rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that the [[Jacobian matrix]] &lt;math&gt;(\partial f_i / \partial z_j)&lt;/math&gt; is of rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at every solution &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of the associated semi-algebraic [[algebraic variety|variety]].

==== Definition of Lie point symmetries ====

The following theorem (see th. 2.8 in ch.2 of &lt;ref name="Olver1995"/&gt;) gives necessary and sufficient conditions so that a local Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetry group of an algebraic system.

'''Theorem'''. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a connected local Lie group of a continuous dynamical system acting in the n-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt; define a regular system of algebraic equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
f_i(Z)=0 \quad \forall i \in \{1,\dots,k\}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetry group of this algebraic system if, and only if,
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta f_i(Z)=0 \quad \forall i\in \{1,\dots,k\} \mbox{ whenever } f_1(Z)=\dots=f_k(Z)=0
&lt;/math&gt;
for every infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example ====
Let us consider the algebraic system defined on a space of 6 variables, namely &lt;math&gt;Z=(P,Q,a,b,c,l)&lt;/math&gt; with:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left \{
\begin{array}{l}
f_1(Z)=(1-cP)+bQ + 1, \\
f_2(Z)=aP - lQ +1.
\end{array}
\right .
&lt;/math&gt;

The infinitesimal generator
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta = a(a-1) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial a} + (l+b)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial b}+ (2ac-c)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial c}+(-aP+P)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial P}
&lt;/math&gt;
is associated to one of the one-parameter symmetry groups. It acts on 4 variables, namely &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. One can easily verify that &lt;math&gt;\delta f_1 = f_1 -f_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta f_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the relations &lt;math&gt;\delta f_1 = \delta f_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; are satisfied for any &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^6&lt;/math&gt; that vanishes the algebraic system.

=== Lie point symmetries of dynamical systems ===

Let us define systems of first-order [[ordinary differential equations|ODEs]] used in the forthcoming symmetry definition.

==== Systems of ODEs and associated infinitesimal generators ====

Let &lt;math&gt;d\cdot / dt&lt;/math&gt; be a derivation w.r.t. the continuous independent variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. We consider two sets &lt;math&gt;X=(x_1,\dots,x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta = (\theta_1,\dots,\theta_l)&lt;/math&gt;. The associated coordinate set is defined by &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)=(t,x_1,\dots,x_k,\theta_1,\dots,\theta_l)&lt;/math&gt; and its cardinal is &lt;math&gt;n=1+k+l&lt;/math&gt;. With these notations, a ''system of first-order ODEs'' is a system where:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left \{
\begin{array}{l}
\dfrac{d x_i}{dt} = f_i(Z) \mbox{ with } f_i \in \mathbb{R}(Z) \quad \forall i \in \{1,\dots,k\}, \\
\dfrac{d \theta_j}{dt} = 0 \quad \forall j \in \{1,\dots,l\}
\end{array}
\right .
&lt;/math&gt;
and the set &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)&lt;/math&gt; specifies the evolution of state variables of ODEs w.r.t. the independent variable. The elements of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are called ''state variables'', these of &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; ''parameters''.

One can associate also a continuous dynamical system to a system of ODEs by resolving its equations.

An infinitesimal generator is a derivation that is closely related to systems of ODEs (more precisely to continuous dynamical systems). For the link between a system of ODEs, the associated vector field and the infinitesimal generator, see section 1.3 of.&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; The infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; associated to a system of ODEs, described as above, is defined with the same notations as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} + \sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(Z) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Definition of Lie point symmetries ====

Here is a geometrical definition of such symmetries. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous dynamical system and &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; its infinitesimal generator. A continuous dynamical system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie point symmetry of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; sends every orbit of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; to an orbit. Hence, the infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following relation&lt;ref name="Stephani1989"/&gt; based on [[Lie bracket]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
[\delta_\mathcal{D}, \delta_\mathcal{S}] = \lambda \delta_\mathcal{D}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is any constant of &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}\lambda = \delta_\mathcal{S} \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;. These generators are linearly independent.

One does not need the explicit formulas of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; in order to compute the infinitesimal generators of its symmetries.

=== Example ===

Consider [[Pierre François Verhulst]]'s [[logistic growth]] model with linear predation,&lt;ref name="Murray2002"/&gt; where the state variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; represents a population. The parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the growth and predation rate and the parameter &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the receptive capacity of the environment:
:&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{dx}{dt}= (a-bx)x, \dfrac{da}{dt}=\dfrac{db}{dt}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The continuous dynamical system associated to this system of ODEs is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rccc}
\mathcal{D}: &amp; (\mathbb{R},+) \times \mathbb{R}^4 &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathbb{R}^4 \\
&amp; (\hat{t},(t,x,a,b)) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \left(t+\hat{t}, \frac{axe^{a\hat{t}}}{a-(1-e^{a\hat{t}})bx}, a, b\right).
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
The independent variable &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; varies continuously; thus the associated group can be identified with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The infinitesimal generator associated to this system of ODEs is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_\mathcal{D} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} + ((a-bx)x)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

The following infinitesimal generators belong to the 2-dimensional symmetry group of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{\mathcal{S}_1} = -x \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}+b\dfrac{\partial}{\partial b},
\quad
\delta_{\mathcal{S}_2} = t\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}-x\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}-a\dfrac{\partial}{\partial a}
\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

== Software ==

There exist many software packages in this area.&lt;ref name="Heck2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwarz1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimas2005"/&gt; For example, the package liesymm of [[Maple (software)|Maple]] provides some Lie symmetry methods for [[partial differential equation|PDEs]].&lt;ref name="CarminatiDevittFee1992"/&gt; It manipulates integration of determining systems and also [[differential form]]s. Despite its success on small systems, its integration capabilities for solving determining systems automatically are limited by complexity issues. The DETools package uses the prolongation of [[vector field]]s for searching Lie symmetries of ODEs. Finding Lie symmetries for ODEs, in the general case, may be as complicated as solving the original system.

==19th century and earlier==
* [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s opuses 66-74 contain more than twenty posthumous works.
* "[[Beautiful Dreamer]]", published in 1864, shortly after the death of songwriter [[Stephen Foster]]; at the time of publication of its first edition, it was promoted as "the last song ever written by Stephen C. Foster, composed but a few days prior to his death,"&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of first editions of Stephen C. Foster (1826–1864)''. Library of Congress. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; though it actually may have been written as early as 1862.
* The [[phonautograph|phonautograms]] of [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]] were not able to be played back until long after his death in 1879, as they required digital technology

This article describes the '''architecture''' of the '''Muisca'''. The [[Muisca people|Muisca]], inhabiting the central highlands of the [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]] ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] and the southwestern part of that the [[Bogotá savanna]]), were one of the four great civilizations of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V. p.226&lt;/ref&gt; Other than the three civilizations in present-day [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]; the [[Aztec civilization|Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]] respectively, they did not construct grand [[Pre-Columbian architecture|architecture]] of solid materials. While specialising in [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] and [[Muisca art|gold-working, cloths and ceramics]], their architecture was rather modest and made of non-permanent materials as wood and clay.

Evidence for the Muisca architecture relies on archaeological excavations performed since the mid 20th century. In recent years larger areas showing evidence of the Early Muisca architecture have been uncovered, the biggest of them in [[Soacha]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/descubrimiento-arqueologico-mas-grande-de-colombia/367219-3 El descubrimiento arqueológico más grande de Colombia] - [[Semana (Colombia)|Semana]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/aldea-premuisca-enreda-transmision-de-luz-bogota-articulo-432960 Aldea premuisca enreda transmisión de luz a Bogotá] - [[El Espectador]]&lt;/ref&gt; All of the original houses and temples have been destroyed by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquerors and replaced with [[colonial architecture]]. Reconstructions of some houses (''bohíos'') and the most important temple in the [[Muisca religion]]; the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Temple of the Sun]] in [[Sogamoso]], called Sugamuxi by the Muisca, have been built in the second half of the 20th century.

Important [[List of Muisca scholars|scholars]] who have contributed to the knowledge about the Muisca architecture are [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], who made the first contact with the Muisca, early 17th century [[friar]]s [[Pedro Simón]] and [[Juan de Castellanos]] later bishop [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]] and modern [[archaeologist]]s [[Eliécer Silva Celis]], [[Sylvia M. Broadbent|Sylvia Broadbent]], [[Carl Henrik Langebaek]] and others.

== Background ==
The Altiplano Cundiboyacense, the high plateau in the Colombian Andes, has been inhabited for at least 12,400 years, with the earliest evidence in [[El Abra]], [[Tibitó]] and [[Tequendama]]. During this era, the [[paleoclimate]] and [[flora]] and [[fauna]] were different from today. It was the end of the [[Pleistocene]], when [[stadial]]s and [[interstadial]]s intercalated and the [[glacier]]s in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] were advancing and retreating. When the first [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived from the north (the [[Caribbean]] coast and earlier from [[Central America]]), they encountered still the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] on the highlands; ''[[Cuvieronius]]'', ''[[Stegomastodon]]'', ''[[Haplomastodon]]'' and ''[[Equus andium]]'' in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time and age, as is evidenced in [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations at various sites on the Altiplano, the people lived in caves and rock shelters. The [[Muisca Confederation#Prehistory|prehistorical]] period was followed by the [[Herrera Period]], commonly dated at 800 BCE to 800 CE. It was in this era that the agricultural advancement, that started in the latest [[Andean preceramic|preceramic]] times, caused a change towards population of the plains, away from the caves and rock shelters.&lt;ref&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to an increase in population which was modest in the early Herrera Period and more pronounced towards the end of it; the start of the Muisca Period at around 800 CE. Further population growth and a more stratified society is observed in archaeological analysis of the Late Muisca Period, from 1200 CE onwards. The first contact with the Muisca happened in 1537 by the troops of [[conquistador]] and explorer [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] and his brother [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada|Hernán]].

== Muisca architecture ==
=== Houses and settlements ===
The houses of the Muisca, called ''bohíos'' or ''malokas'', were circular structures made of poles of wood and walls of clay, with a conical reed roof. A long beam of wood supported the roof in the centre of the round structure and was attached to the wooden poles. The interior of the roof was decorated with cloths with thin strokes of different colours. On the floor fine straw was placed.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''bohíos'', probably those of the ''[[cacique]]s'' had [[ceramic]] floors, as evidenced by findings in [[Mosquera, Cundinamarca|Mosquera]]. This was atypical for the Muisca houses.&lt;ref&gt;Cardale de Schrimpff, 1985, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Spanish chroniclers have reported "great populations" of the Muisca territories,&lt;ref&gt;Efraín Sánchez, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; the people lived in small settlements, described by the Spanish conquerors as "dispersed homesteads". As the Maya people, the Muisca related the smaller settlements with their effective [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Houses on the Bogotá savanna were built on slightly elevated areas to prevent them from floodings of the various rivers, humedales and swamps, characteristic of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, 1974, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;
Each community had their own farmlands and hunting grounds surrounding their houses. The houses were constructed around a central square with the house of the ''cacique'' in the centre. Two or more "gates" in the ''cercado'' (enclosure) gave access to the village.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 1995a, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;
The exact number of houses in the villages remains unclear and requires more archaeological work. De Quesada described villages of 10 up to 100 houses. 
The Late Muisca Period, commonly defined as 1200-1537, is characterised by denser population and larger communities, especially in [[Suba (Bogotá)|Suba]] and [[Cota, Cundinamarca|Cota]] with more dispersed housing in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the [[Kennedy (Bogotá)|Las Delicias]] neighbourhood of Bogotá, on an alluvial terrace of the [[Tunjuelito River]] in 1990, exposed six circular structures of {{convert|4.6|m|ft}} in diameter, which is slightly smaller than living spaces found in other areas, e.g. in [[Facatativá]] ({{convert|5|m|ft}}).&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of these houses has been dated from the start of the Muisca Period until the colonial period. The living space was occupied in two stages, starting from 950 BCE, followed by a next phase dated at 750 BCE. The [[carbon dating|dating has been done based on carbon]], taken from the floors of the area. Ceramics, animal bones, swindles, seeds and jewellery has been found in this location too.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist [[Eliécer Silva Celis|Silva Celis]] uncovered in 1943 housing structures in Soacha with four different temporal levels with indications of population in the form of ash deposits from fires and animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars agree that the housing of the Muisca was egalitarian; little differentiation between the living spaces of the ''caciques'' and the lower-class people has been found, especially in Soacha.&lt;ref name=Kruschek_p180&gt;Kruschek, 2003, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henderson_p149&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been described -by [[Pedro Simón]] among others- that at the entrance posts of the houses of the ''caciques'' [[Muisca religion#Human sacrifices|human sacrifice remains]] were hanging and the posts smeared with blood from the victims, who were regarded as sacred when they were young boys (''moxas'') or captured from neighbouring indigenous groups. Archaeological evidence from Mosquera supported this thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roads ===
The roads of the Muisca people were unpaved, which makes it hard to identify them in archaeological excavations. Some of the roads were trade routes, with the eastern neighbours ([[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]]), in the north with the [[Guane people]] and in the west with the Panche and Muzo, others were sacred routes. Examples of holy roads, used for pilgrimages, were found in [[Guasca]] and [[Siecha Lakes|Siecha]]. Routes communicating Muisca territories with [[cotton]] producing areas ran through [[Somondoco]] and [[Súnuba]]. The roads crossing the mountains surrounding the Altiplano were narrow, making it more difficult for the Spanish conquistadores to cross them, especially with horses. Once they reached the open terrains of the Bogotá savanna, movement became easier.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 1995b, Ch.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temples ===
The Muisca, as part of their [[Muisca religion|religion]], built various temples throughout their territories. The most sacred were the Sun Temple in Sugamuxi and the [[Moon Temple (Chía)|Moon Temple]] in [[Chía, Cundinamarca|Chía]]. The Sun Temple was built to honour [[Sué]], the Sun god of the Muisca, and the Moon Temple was honouring his wife, [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]. Also notable was the [[Goranchacha Temple]], according to [[Muisca mythology|Muisca myths]] built by [[Goranchacha]]. On one of the islands in [[Lake Fúquene]] there had been a temple with grand decoration and 100 priests, as described by De Piedrahita.&lt;ref name=Casilimas_p135&gt;Casilimas, 1987, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedro Simón noted that the temples were built with wood from the ''[[Guaiacum officinale|guayacán]]'' tree, to make them last long.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

According to De Piedrahita, the ''moxas'' were raised in the temples to make them as sacred as possible for when they would be sacrificed, which meant a great honour to the families who donated the young boys.&lt;ref name=Casilimas_p135/&gt;

=== Other structures ===
Other structures of the Muisca were mostly religious in character. Apart from their celebrations at natural areas, such as [[Lake Guatavita]], [[Lake Iguaque]], [[Lake Tota]], [[Lake Fúquene]], [[Lake Suesca]] and the [[Siecha Lakes]], the Muisca constructed some places where religious ceremonies were held, such as the [[Cojines del Zaque]] and the [[Hunzahúa Well]], both in [[Tunja|Hunza]], present-day Tunja.

As an exception to the wood-and-clay structures of the houses and temples of the Muisca people, allegedly one of their structures had been made of stone; the [[Cajicá#History|fortress of Cajicá]], just north of present-day Bogotá. The structure is described with walls of {{convert|80|cm|in}} thick and {{convert|4|m|ft}} high, but modern scientists have cast doubt on the structure and if it existed in the [[pre-Columbian era]].&lt;ref&gt;Román, 2008, p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-conquest ==
The first construction of post-conquest architecture took place shortly after De Quesada had conquered the city of Bacatá, later called Santafe and known as the capital Bogotá in modern age. At the location of present-day [[Teusaquillo]], twelve houses and a church in the style of the Muisca -with wood and clay- had been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Salcedo, 2011, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a general policy of the Spanish, eased by the non-permanent architecture of the Muisca, that existing structures would be taken down and replaced by Spanish colonial architecture.

=== Reconstructions ===
Reconstructions of Muisca ''bohíos'' and the most important temple of Sogamoso, are displayed in the [[Archaeology Museum, Sogamoso|Archaeology Museum]] in Sogamoso. This work has been done in the early stage of archaeological research on the Altiplano, in the 1940s. [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] was the architect and archaeologist involved in the reconstructions.

Archaeological work has been hindered by the constant expansion of the capital Bogotá in which vicinity and territory many ancient structures were built. An archaeological expedition of 2002 proved that within months the previously unoccupied [[List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites|archaeological site]] was already covered with construction.&lt;ref&gt;Kruschek, 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OnceOnATime.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]])]]
'''''Once On A Time''''' is a [[fairy tale]] created by [[A. A. Milne]].

Written in 1917, Milne's own introduction begins 'This is an odd book', and indeed it is very difficult to classify.  Ostensibly a typical fairytale, it tells the story of the war between the kingdoms of Euralia and Barodia and the political shenanigans which take place in Euralia in the king's absence, all supposedly rewritten by Milne from the writings of the fictional historian "Roger Scurvilegs".

Milne created the story to contain believable, three-dimensional characters, rather than the stereotypes which will satisfy children. Hence the book introduces us to a princess who is far from helpless; a prince who, whilst handsome, is also pompous and vain; an enchantment which is almost entirely humorous; a villain who is not entirely villainous and receives no real comeuppance; a good king who is not always good; an evil king who is not always evil, and so on.  The result is a book which children may not enjoy as much as adults.

The book was written by Milne partly for his wife, upon whom the character of the Countess Belvane was partially based.

==Plot summary==

When the King of Barodia receives a pair of [[seven-league boots]] as a birthday present, his habit of flying over the King of Euralia's castle during breakfast provokes a series of incidents which escalate into war.  While the King of Euralia is away, his daughter Hyacinth tries to rule in his stead and counter the machiavellian ambitions of the king's favourite, the Countess Belvane.

==Characters==

'''King Merriwig of Euralia''':  fat, jolly if occasionally pompous and easily led.  He nevertheless can show great strength of mind, as related in an anecdote in which he outwitted a fairy, mostly by sheer stubbornness.

'''Princess Hyacinth''':  Merriwig's daughter.  Rather more savvy than her father, she is nevertheless at first out of her depth when trying to rule the kingdom in his absence.  Despite this, she grows into the role.

'''The King of Barodia''':  Bombastic, proud and arrogant, and takes inordinate pride in his moustache.

'''The Countess Belvane''':  A difficult character.  Beautiful, proud and haughty, she is inclined to melodramatics and emotional self-indulgence.  Ostensibly the villain of the piece, her motives are complex and subtle.

'''Lady Wiggs''':  Hyacinth's closest friend;  helpful and dreamy.

'''Lady Woggs''':  A palace servant;  well-meaning but terribly dim.

'''Prince Udo of Araby''':  Prince of a neighbouring realm, invited by Hyacinth to help her in her troubles with Belvane.  He turns out to be very little help at all, partly due to suffering an embarrassing enchantment, but mostly due to his personality.

'''Coronel''':  Udo's companion-at-arms and best friend.  Far more laid-back and likeable than the prince.

'''Roger Scurvilegs''':  Noted historian of Euralia, author of the monumental work ''Euralia Past and Present''.  The narrator gives him credit for the basic facts of the story whilst gently lampooning him for his stuffiness.

==Themes and issues==

Milne himself resisted characterising the book.  In his foreword to the 1922 edition he wrote of it:

"For whom, then, is the book intended?  That is the trouble. Unless I can say, "For those, young or old, who like the things which I like," I find it difficult to answer. Is it a children's book? Well, what do we mean by that? Is ''[[Wind in the willows|The Wind in the Willows]]'' a children's book? Is ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]''? Is ''[[Treasure Island]]''? These are masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how much more pleasure when we are grown-up. In any case, what do we mean by "children"? A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of fourteen - are they all to like the same thing? And is a book "suitable for a boy of twelve" any more likely to please a boy of twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;  even if the novel be described truly as "suitable for a man of thirty-seven"? I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult problems.  But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which children will like, unless he write it for himself first. That being so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups. [...]  But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what sort of book it is. Perhaps no explanation is necessary. Read in it what you like; read it to whomever you like;  be of what age you like; it can only fall into one of the two classes. Either you will enjoy it, or you won't.

"It is that sort of book.&lt;ref&gt;Milne, A.A.: "Once On A Time" pp vi-viii, 1922 US ed. published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap (New York)&lt;/ref&gt;".

A '''Penrose tiling''' is an example of non-periodic [[tessellation|tiling]] generated by an [[aperiodic set of prototiles|aperiodic set]] of [[prototile]]s. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir [[Roger Penrose]], who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both [[reflection symmetry]] and fivefold [[rotational symmetry]], as in the diagram at the right.

Penrose tiling is non-periodic, which means that it lacks any [[translational symmetry]]. It is [[self-similarity|self-similar]], so the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales. Thus, the tiling can be obtained through "inflation" (or "deflation") and every finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times. It is a [[quasicrystal]]: implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce [[Bragg diffraction]] and its diffractogram reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order.

Various methods to construct Penrose tilings have been discovered, including matching rules, [[substitution tiling|substitutions]] or [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]]s, cut and project schemes and coverings.

==Background and history==

===Periodic and aperiodic tilings===

{{anchor|Figure 1}}[[File:RegularRhombs.svg|right|thumb|150px|Figure 1. Part of a periodic tiling|alt=]]
Penrose tilings are simple examples of [[aperiodic tiling]]s of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]].&lt;ref&gt;General references for this article include {{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=1&amp;ndash;30}}, {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|pp=520&amp;ndash;548 &amp;amp; 558&amp;ndash;579}}, and {{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=170&amp;ndash;206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tessellation|tiling]] is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have a [[finite set|finite]] number of shapes, called ''[[prototile]]s'', and [[set (mathematics)|a set]] of prototiles is said to ''admit a tiling'' or ''tile the plane'' if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to these prototiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=20, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are [[periodic tiling|periodic]]: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by [[translation (mathematics)|translating]] all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a ''period'' of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be ''non-periodic''. A set of prototiles is said to be ''aperiodic'' if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest aperiodic tilings===
[[File:Wang tiles.svg|thumb|left|150px|An [[aperiodic set]] of [[Wang domino]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Culik|Kari|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]
The subject of aperiodic tilings received new interest in the 1960s when logician [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] noted connections between [[decision problem]]s and tilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wang|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges, now known as ''[[Wang domino]]es'' or ''tiles'', and posed the "''[[Domino Problem]]''": to determine whether a given set of Wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges. He observed that if this problem were [[recursive set|undecidable]], then there would have to exist an aperiodic set of Wang dominoes. At the time, this seemed implausible, so Wang conjectured no such set could exist.

[[File:Robinson tiles.svg|thumb|right|Robinson's six prototiles|alt=]]
Wang's student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] proved that the Domino Problem was undecidable (so Wang's conjecture was incorrect) in his 1964 thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=114475|title=Robert Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained an aperiodic set of 20426 Wang dominoes.&lt;ref name="AMSa"&gt;{{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles; the latter did not appear in his published monograph,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1968, [[Donald Knuth]] detailed a modification of Berger's set requiring only 92 dominoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color matching required in a tiling by Wang dominoes can easily be achieved by modifying the edges of the tiles like [[jigsaw puzzle]] pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphael Robinson]], in a 1971 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the Penrose tilings===
{{anchor|Figure 2}}[[File:Penrose Tiling (P1 over P3).svg|250px|thumb|left|Figure 2. The pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1) drawn in black on a colored rhombus tiling (P3) with yellow edges.&lt;ref name="S:173-174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]

The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an aperiodic set of six prototiles, introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] in a 1974 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but [[Johannes Kepler]] showed, in his 1619 work ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', that these gaps can be filled using [[pentagram]]s ([[star polygon]]s), [[decagon]]s and related shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of [[Albrecht Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luck|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling can be viewed as a completion of Kepler's finite ''Aa'' pattern.&lt;ref name="S:171"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penrose subsequently reduced the number of prototiles to two, discovering the kite and dart tiling (tiling P2 below) and the rhombus tiling (tiling P3 below).&lt;ref name="G:6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhombus tiling was independently discovered by [[Robert Ammann]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="G:19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose and [[John H. Conway]] investigated the properties of Penrose tilings, and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature; their findings were publicized by [[Martin Gardner]] in his January 1977 "[[Mathematical Games column]]" in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref name="G1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|loc=chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|De Bruijn]] explained a method to construct Penrose tilings&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Bruijn|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; from five families of parallel lines as well as a "cut and project method", in which Penrose tilings are obtained as two-dimensional projections from a five-dimensional cubic structure. In this approach, the Penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points, its vertices, while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges.

==The Penrose tilings==
[[File:Penrose Tiling (P1).svg|thumb|right|200px|A P1 tiling using Penrose's original set of six prototiles|alt=]]

The three types of Penrose tiling, P1&amp;ndash;P3, are described individually below.&lt;ref name="P1-P3"&gt;The P1&amp;ndash;P3 notation is taken from {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 10.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the [[golden ratio]]), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by ''matching rules'' in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces &amp;ndash; alternatively the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.&lt;ref name="AMSa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GS10.3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 10.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The original pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1)===
Penrose's first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes: a five-pointed "star" (a pentagram), a "boat" (roughly 3/5 of a star) and a "diamond" (a thin rhombus).&lt;ref name="P:32"/&gt; To ensure that all tilings are non-periodic, there are matching rules that specify how tiles may meet each other, and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles. It is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors, as in the figure above right.&lt;ref&gt;"However, as will be explained momentarily, differently colored pentagons will be considered to be different types of tiles." {{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}; {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=figure 10.3.1}}, shows the edge modifications needed to yield an aperiodic set of prototiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kite and dart tiling (P2)===

[[File:Step7wPaper600DPI.png|thumb|Part of the plane covered by Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2 (kite and dart). Created by applying several deflations, see section below.]]

Penrose's second tiling uses quadrilaterals called the "kite" and "dart", which may be combined to make a rhombus. However, the matching rules prohibit such a combination.&lt;ref&gt;"The rhombus of course tiles periodically, but we are not allowed to join the pieces in this manner." {{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=6&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the kite and dart are composed of two triangles, called ''[[Golden triangle (mathematics)#Golden gnomon|Robinson triangles]]'', after 1975 notes by Robinson.&lt;ref name="GS-R"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|pp=537&amp;ndash; 547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|image1=Kite Dart.svg|image2=Penrose vertex figures.svg|width=225|footer=Kite and dart tiles (top) and the seven possible [[vertex figure]]s in a P2 tiling.}}

*The ''kite'' is a quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 72, 72, 72, and 144 degrees. The kite may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 72 and 72 degrees).
*The ''dart'' is a non-convex quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 36, 72, 36, and 216 degrees. The dart may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees), which are smaller than the acute triangles.

The matching rules can be described in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices.&lt;ref name="S:173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.&lt;ref name="G:6"/&gt;

These rules often force the placement of certain tiles: for example, the [[concave polygon|concave]] vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites. The corresponding figure (center of the top row in the lower image on the left) is called an "ace" by Conway; although it looks like an enlarged kite, it does not tile in the same way.&lt;ref name="G:8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts (bottom right). In fact, there are only seven possible ways for the tiles to meet at a vertex; two of these figures &amp;ndash; namely, the "star" (top left) and the "sun" (top right) &amp;ndash; have 5-fold [[dihedral symmetry]] (by rotations and reflections), while the remainder have a single axis of reflection (vertical in the image).&lt;ref name="G:10=11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the ace and the sun, all of these vertex figures force the placement of additional tiles.&lt;ref name="G:12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhombus tiling (P3)===

The third tiling uses a pair of [[rhombus]]es (often referred to as "[[wikt:rhomb|rhombs]]" in this context) with equal sides but different angles.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt; Ordinary rhombus-shaped tiles can be used to tile the plane periodically, so restrictions must be made on how tiles can be assembled: no two tiles may form a parallelogram, as this would allow a periodic tiling, but this constraint is not sufficient to force aperiodicity, as [[#Figure 1|figure 1 above]] shows.

There are two kinds of tile, both of which can be decomposed into Robinson triangles.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt;
*The thin rhomb '''t''' has four corners with angles of 36, 144, 36, and 144 degrees. The '''t''' rhomb may be bisected along its short diagonal to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles.
*The thick rhomb '''T''' has angles of 72, 108, 72, and 108 degrees. The '''T''' rhomb may be bisected along its long diagonal to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles; in contrast to the P2 tiling, these are larger than the acute triangles.

The matching rules distinguish sides of the tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in the image on the right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;

There are 54 cyclically ordered combinations of such angles that add up to 360 degrees at a vertex, but the rules of the tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear (although one of these arises in two ways).&lt;ref name="S:178"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various combinations of angles and facial curvature allow construction of arbitrarily complex tiles, such as the ''[http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/books/BKMM7xpc.htm Penrose chickens]''.

==Features and constructions==

===The golden ratio and local pentagonal symmetry===
Several properties and common features of the Penrose tilings involve the [[golden ratio]] {{φ}} = (1+{{radic|5}})/2 (approximately 1.618).&lt;ref name="GS-R" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S:173"/&gt; This is the ratio of [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] lengths to side lengths in a [[regular pentagon]], and satisfies {{φ}} = 1 + 1/{{φ}}.

[[File:Rhomb pentagon.svg|left|thumb|Pentagon with an inscribed thick rhomb (light), acute Robinson triangles (lightly shaded) and a small obtuse Robinson triangle (darker). Dotted lines give additional edges for inscribed kites and darts.|alt=]]

Consequently, the ratio of the lengths of long sides to short sides in the ([[isosceles]]) Robinson triangles is {{φ}}:1. It follows that the ratio of long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also {{φ}}:1, as are the length ratios of sides to the short diagonal in the thin rhomb '''t''', and of long diagonal to sides in the thick rhomb '''T'''. In both the P2 and P3 tilings, the ratio of the [[Triangle#Computing the area of a triangle|area]] of the larger Robinson triangle to the smaller one is {{φ}}:1, hence so are the ratios of the areas of the kite to the dart, and of the thick rhomb to the thin rhomb. (Both larger and smaller obtuse Robinson triangles can be found in the pentagon on the left: the larger triangles at the top &amp;ndash; the halves of the thick rhomb &amp;ndash; have linear dimensions scaled up by {{φ}} compared to the small shaded triangle at the base, and so the ratio of areas is {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:1.)

Any Penrose tiling has local pentagonal symmetry, in the sense that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold [[rotational symmetry]] about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of [[reflection symmetry]] passing through the point, a [[dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetry [[group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt; This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.&lt;ref name="G:9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be at most one center point of global fivefold symmetry: if there were more than one, then rotating each about the other would yield two closer centers of fivefold symmetry, which leads to a mathematical contradiction.&lt;ref name="G:27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only two Penrose tilings (of each type) with global pentagonal symmetry: for the P2 tiling by kites and darts, the center point is either a "sun" or "star" vertex.&lt;ref name="GS:543"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation and deflation===
[[File:Pentagon with half dodecahedral net.svg|right|thumb|A pentagon decomposed into six smaller pentagons (half a dodecahedral net) with gaps|alt=]]
Many of the common features of Penrose tilings follow from a hierarchical pentagonal structure given by ''[[Substitution tiling|substitution rules]]'': this is often referred to as ''inflation'' and ''deflation'', or ''composition'' and ''decomposition'', of tilings or (collections of) tiles.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GS-Terms"&gt;In {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987}}, the term "inflation" is used where other authors would use "deflation" (followed by rescaling). The terms "composition" and "decomposition", which many authors also use, are less ambiguous.&lt;/ref&gt; The substitution rules decompose each tile into smaller tiles of the same shape as those used in the tiling (and thus allow larger tiles to be "composed" from smaller ones). This shows that the Penrose tiling has a scaling self-similarity, and so can be thought of as a [[fractal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandrarao P.,
''On the fractal nature of Penrose tiling'', Current Science '''79'''(2000) p364 [http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/aug102000/rc80.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Penrose originally discovered the P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one half of a [[Net (polyhedron)|net]] of a [[dodecahedron]]) and five half-diamonds; he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons.&lt;ref name="P:32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1978|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained one of the two P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S:171"/&gt;

====Robinson triangle decompositions====
[[File:Robinson triangle decompositions.svg|left|thumb|Robinson triangles and their decompositions|alt=]]
The substitution method for both P2 and P3 tilings can be described using Robinson triangles of different sizes. The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings (by bisecting kites and darts) are called A-tiles, while those arising in the P3 tilings (by bisecting rhombs) are called B-tiles.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt; The smaller A-tile, denoted A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, is an obtuse Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, is obtuse.

Concretely, if A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; has side lengths (1, 1, {{φ}}), then A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; has side lengths ({{φ}}, {{φ}}, 1). B-tiles can be related to such A-tiles in two ways:
* If B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; has the same size as A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; then B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is an enlarged version {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; of A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, with side lengths ({{φ}}, {{φ}}, {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{φ}}) &amp;ndash; this decomposes into an A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile and A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tile joined along a common side of length 1.
* If instead B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is identified with A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, then B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is a reduced version (1/{{φ}})A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; with side lengths (1/{{φ}},1/{{φ}},1) &amp;ndash; joining a B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tile and a B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile along a common side of length 1 then yields (a decomposition of) an A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile.

In these decompositions, there appears to be an ambiguity: Robinson triangles may be decomposed in two ways, which are mirror images of each other in the (isosceles) axis of symmetry of the triangle. In a Penrose tiling, this choice is fixed by the matching rules &amp;ndash; furthermore, the matching rules ''also'' determine how the smaller triangles in the tiling compose to give larger ones.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt;

{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|image1=Penrose tilings P2 and P3.svg|image2=Penrose tilings P3 and P2.svg|width=200|footer=Partial inflation of star to yield rhombs, and of a collection of rhombs to yield an ace.}}
It follows that the P2 and P3 tilings are ''mutually locally derivable'': a tiling by one set of tiles can be used to generate a tiling by another &amp;ndash; for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into A-tiles, and these can be composed in a canonical way to form B-tiles and hence rhombs.&lt;ref name="S:173-174"/&gt; The P2 and P3 tilings are also both mutually locally derivable with the P1 tiling (see [[#Figure 2|figure 2 above]]).&lt;ref name="GS:546"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decomposition of B-tiles into A-tiles may be written
: B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
(assuming the larger size convention for the B-tiles), which can be summarized in a ''substitution [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'' equation:&lt;ref name="S:157-158"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=157&amp;ndash;158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} B_L \\ B_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, .&lt;/math&gt;
Combining this with the decomposition of enlarged {{φ}}A-tiles into B-tiles yields the substitution
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \varphi A_L \\ \varphi A_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B_L \\ B_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
so that the enlarged tile {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; decomposes into two A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tiles and one A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tiles. The matching rules force a particular substitution: the two A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tiles in a {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile must form a kite &amp;ndash; thus a kite decomposes into two kites and a two half-darts, and a dart decomposes into a kite and two half-darts.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S:183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enlarged {{φ}}B-tiles decompose into B-tiles in a similar way (via {{φ}}A-tiles).

Composition and decomposition can be iterated, so that, for example
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^n\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The number of kites and darts in the ''n''th iteration of the construction is determined by the ''n''th power of the substitution matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n = \begin{pmatrix} F_{2n+1} &amp; F_{2n} \\ F_{2n} &amp; F_{2n-1} \end{pmatrix}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''th [[Fibonacci number]]. The ratio of numbers of kites to darts in any sufficiently large P2 Penrose tiling pattern therefore approximates to the golden ratio {{φ}}.&lt;ref name="G:7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar result holds for the ratio of the number of thick rhombs to thin rhombs in the P3 Penrose tiling.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;

====Deflation for P2 and P3 tilings====

[[File:AnimSun2k.gif|thumb|Consecutive deflations of the 'sun' vertex in a Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2]]
[[File:RectangleFill.gif|thumb|Consecutive deflations of a tile-set in a Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2 filling a 16:9 wide rectangle]]
[[File:AnimSun 13.png|thumb|8th deflation of the 'sun' vertex in a Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2]]

Starting with a collection of tiles from a given tiling (which might be a single tile, a tiling of the plane, or any other collection), deflation proceeds with a sequence of steps called generations. In one generation of deflation, each tile is replaced with two or more new tiles that are scaled-down versions of tiles used in the original tiling. The [[substitution tiling|substitution rules]] guarantee that the new tiles will be arranged in accordance with the matching rules.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt; Repeated generations of deflation produce a tiling of the original axiom shape with smaller and smaller tiles. &lt;!--Given sufficiently many generations, the tiling will contain a scaled-down version of the axiom that does not touch the boundary of the tiling. The axiom can then be surrounded by full-size tiles corresponding to tiles that appear in the scaled-down version. This extended tiling can be used as a new axiom, producing larger and larger extended tilings and ultimately covers the entire plane.--&gt;
&lt;!--This is an example of successive generations of deflation starting from different axioms. In the case of the 'Sun' and 'Star', the scaled-down interior version of the axiom appears in generation 2. The 'Sun' also appears in the interior of its generation 3.--&gt;

This rule for dividing the tiles is a [[subdivision rule]].

====Consequences and applications====
Inflation and deflation yield a method for constructing kite and dart (P2) tilings, or rhombus (P3) tilings, known as ''up-down generation''.&lt;ref name="G:8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSb"&gt;{{Harvnb|Austin|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S:183"/&gt;

The Penrose tilings, being non-periodic, have no translational symmetry &amp;ndash; the pattern cannot be shifted to match itself over the entire plane. However, any bounded region, no matter how large, will be repeated an infinite number of times within the tiling. Therefore, a finite patch cannot differentiate between the uncountably many Penrose tilings, nor even determine which position within the tiling is being shown.&lt;ref&gt;"... any finite patch that we choose in a tiling will lie inside a single inflated tile if we continue moving far enough up in the inflation hierarchy. This means that anywhere that tile occurs at that level in the hierarchy, our original patch must also occur in the original tiling. Therefore, the patch will occur infinitely often in the original tiling and, in fact, in every other tiling as well." {{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This shows in particular that the number of distinct Penrose tilings (of any type) is [[uncountably infinite]]. Up-down generation yields one method to parameterize the tilings, but other methods use Ammann bars, pentagrids, or cut and project schemes.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;

===Decagonal coverings and quasicrystals===
[[File:Gummelt decagon.svg|300px|thumb|right|Gummelt's decagon (left) with the decomposition into kites and darts indicated by dashed lines; the thicker darker lines bound an inscribed ace and thick rhomb; possible overlaps (right) are by one or two red aces.&lt;ref name="LR"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lord|Ranganathan|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]

In 1996, German mathematician Petra Gummelt demonstrated that a covering (so called to distinguish it from a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gummelt|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling can be obtained by inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.

These coverings have been considered as a realistic model for the growth of [[quasicrystals]]: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' analogous to the [[unit cell]]s from which crystals are constructed, and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.&lt;ref name="LR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinhardt|Jeong|1996}}; see also {{cite web|first=Paul J.|last=Steinhardt|title=A New Paradigm for the Structure of Quasicrystals|url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~steinh/quasi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related tilings===
[[File:Tie and Navette Tiling.png|300px|left|thumb|Tie and Navette tiling (in red on a Penrose background)]]
The three variants of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If the corners of one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by ''1,3,5,2,4'' an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise.
Points with the same label define a tiling by Robinson triangles while points with the numbers 3 and 4 on them define the vertices of a Tie-and-Navette tiling.&lt;ref&gt;Luck R., "Penrose Sublattices", ''Journal of Non Crystalline Solids'' 117-8 (90)832-5&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other related unequivalent tilings, such as the hexagon-boat-star and Mikulla&amp;ndash;Roth tilings. For instance, if the matching rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lançon|Billard|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold but it is not a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godrèche|Lançon|1992}}; see also {{cite web|url=http://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/substitution/binary|title=Binary|author= D.

The aesthetic value of tilings has long been appreciated, and remains a source of interest in them; here the visual appearance (rather than the formal defining properties) of Penrose tilings has attracted attention. The similarity with [[girih tiles|some decorative patterns]] used in the Middle East has been noted;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaslavskiĭ|Sagdeev|Usikov|Chernikov|1988}}; {{Harvnb|Makovicky|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Sebastian R. |last=Prange |author2=Peter J.

Art historian [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]] has observed that [[Albrecht Dürer]] sketched similar motifs of a rhombus tiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kemp|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Michael Wright - Lord Mungo Murray (Am Morair Mungo Moireach), 1668 - 1700. Son of 1st Marquess of Atholl - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Clan Murray|Lord Mungo Murray]], by [[John Michael Wright]], an early example of the full-length portrait in [[Highland dress]] (c. 1680)]]

'''Portrait painting in Scotland''' includes all forms of [[Portrait painting|painted portraiture]] in Scotland, from its beginnings in the early sixteenth century until the present day. The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]], particularly through contacts with the Netherlands. The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop [[William Elphinstone]], probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505. Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits, painted in oils on wood. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the [[Scotland in the early modern period|minorities and regencies]] it underwent for much of the sixteenth century. It began to flourish after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists [[Hans Eworth]], [[Arnold Bronckorst]] and [[Adrian Vanson]]. A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the "vendetta portrait", designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity. The [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local [[laird]]s became the major sources of patronage.

The first significant Scottish portrait artist was [[George Jameson]], who became one of the most successful painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He trained the [[Baroque]] artist [[John Michael Wright]]. In this period the full-length portrait in [[Highland dress]] became a common form of painting. [[William Aikman (painter)|William Aikman]] emerged as the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. He, like most Scottish painters of note before the late eighteenth century, migrated to London. [[John Alexander (painter)|John Alexander]] and William Mossman painted many of the figures of early-[[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Edinburgh. [[Allan Ramsay (painter)|Allan Ramsay]] established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. He later focused on royal portraits, anticipating the [[grand manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate. The leading portrait painter of the second half of the century was [[Henry Raeburn]], the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland, his subjects went beyond the nobility to the middle classes. His pupils included the brothers [[Alexander Robertson (artist)|William (Alexander)]], [[Archibald Robertson (painter)|Archibald]] and [[Andrew Robertson (miniaturist)|Andrew Robertson]]. The former two brothers founded the [[Columbian Academy of Painting]] in New York, and Andrew was the leading Scottish [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] of his day.

The generation of painters that followed Raeburn included David Watson, [[John Watson Gordon]] and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] who became one of the most influential British artists of the century. From the mid-nineteenth century, portrait painting, particularity the miniature, declined as an art, photography also began to influence painting. Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], [[Robert Scott Lauder]], [[William Quiller Orchardson]] and [[John Pettie]]. In the twentieth century the move away from [[figurative art|figurative painting]] to [[impressionism]] and [[abstract art|abstraction]], speeded the decline of portrait painting. Artists who continued to pursue portraiture included [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]], [[Cecile Walton]], [[Dorothy Johnstone]] and [[James Cowie (artist)|James Cowie]]. The second half of the twentieth century saw a general movement back towards figurative representation. [[Alexander Moffat]] was among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s. The artists associated with Moffat known as the "new Glasgow Boys" included [[Steven Campbell (artist)|Steven Campbell]], [[Peter Howson]], [[Ken Currie]] and [[Adrian Wisniewski]]. A parallel movement in Edinburgh, focused around the 369 Gallery in the city, included [[Caroline McNairn]], [[Robert MacLaurin]] and [[Gwen Hardie]].

The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]], which began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century. Portraits were given an important role in Renaissance society, valued as objects, and as depictions of earthly success and status.&lt;ref&gt;D. Piper,'' The Illustrated Library of Art'' (New York, NY: Portland House, 1986), {{ISBN|0-517-62336-6}}, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland this was particularly through contacts with the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the [[Northern Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The products of these connections included a fine portrait of [[William Elphinstone]] (1431–1514), Lord Chancellor, Bishop of Aberdeen and founder of the university there.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-333-56761-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;127–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Painted around 1505, it is one of the earliest representations of a named Scottish subject to survive and was probably painted by a Scots artist using Flemish techniques of oil on wood.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7486-1455-9}}, pp. 55–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Scottish monarchs, like those in England, turned to the recording of royal likenesses in [[panel painting|panel portraits]], painted in oils on wood, perhaps as a form of political expression. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions, but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; In 1502 [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] paid for delivery of portraits of the Tudor household, perhaps by the "Inglishe payntour" named "Mynours," who stayed in Scotland to paint the king and his new bride [[Margaret Tudor]] the following year.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p449&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;449.&lt;/ref&gt; "Mynours" was Maynard Wewyck, a Flemish painter who usually worked for [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;M. Belozerskaya, ''Rethinking the Renaissance, Burgundian Arts Across Europe'' (Cambridge 2002), {{ISBN|978-1-107-60544-2}}, p. 159 and J. W. Clark, "Notes on the tomb of Margaret Beaufort", ''Proceedings Cambridge Antiquarian Society'', 45 (1883), pp. 267–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Flemish painter, called "Piers",
and perhaps Peeken Bovelant, an apprentice of an Antwerp painter [[Goswin van der Weyden|Goswijn van der Weyden]], was brought to Scotland by [[Andrew Halyburton]], the trading agent in [[Middelburg]], in September 1505. No details are known of his work, except his assistance in painting costumes and heraldry for tournaments, but the king gave him a salary and accommodation, and it is likely that Piers made portraits for the court. Piers returned to Flanders from [[Inverkeithing]] in July 1508. Some references in the royal accounts call him a "Frenchman".&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1901), p. xci, 173: M. Apted &amp; S. Hannabuss, ''Painters in Scotland'' (Edinburgh, SRS &amp; Edina Press, 1978), pp. 70–72: J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh, 2007), p. 59: D. Ditchburn, ''Scotland and Europe, the medieval kingdom and its contacts with Christendom, c.1214–1545'', vol. 1 (Tuckwell, East Linton, 2001), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the [[Scotland in the early modern period|minorities and regencies]] it underwent for much of the sixteenth century. In his majority [[James V of Scotland|James V]] was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6/&gt; [[Mary Queen of Scots]] had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, with the exception of the joint portrait with her second husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where [[heraldry|heraldic display]], or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt;

Portraiture began to flourish after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] in the mid-sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were anonymously painted portraits of important individuals, including one of [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]] (1556).&lt;ref name="Tittler2008p455-6"/&gt; Artists from the Low Countries remained important. [[Hans Eworth]], who had been court painter to [[Mary I of England]], painted a number of Scottish subjects in the 1560s. His 1561 wedding portraits were miniatures commemorating the brief marriage of the earl of Bothwell and [[Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell|Jean Gordon]].&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; He also painted [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray]] in 1561 and two years later he painted a joint portrait of the young Darnley and his brother [[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox|Charles Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain: 1530 to 1790'' (Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]], [[Master of the Royal Household]], commissioned two portraits in the Netherlands in the 1570s, one of himself and one a family portrait.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the "vendetta portrait", designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity. Examples include the ''Darnley memorial portrait'', which shows the young [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] kneeling at his murdered father's tomb, and the life-size portrait of the corpse of ''The Bonnie Earl of Moray'', vividly showing the wounds received by [[James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray]] when he was killed by [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]] in 1591.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', pp. 48–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an attempt to produce a series of portraits of Scottish kings in panel portraits, probably for the [[royal entry]] of the fifteen-year-old James VI in 1579, which are Medieval in form. In James VI's personal reign, Renaissance forms of portraiture began to dominate.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6/&gt; He employed two Flemish artists, [[Arnold Bronckorst]] in the early 1580s and [[Adrian Vanson]] from around 1584 to 1602, who have left a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; However, the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local [[laird]]s became the major sources of patronage.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p193"&gt;J.

[[File:John Baptist Medina Self Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Self portrait by [[John Baptist Medina]] (c. 1698)]]
By the seventeenth century the fashion for portraiture had spread down the social order to lairds such as [[Sir Colin Campbell, 2nd Baronet|Colin Campbell of Glenorchy]] and [[John Napier|John Napier of Merchiston]].&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; [[Adam de Colone]], perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted his portrait of ''George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons'' and another of Seaton's wife ''Anne Hay with her two daughters''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1-85158-251-7}}, pp. 57–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]] of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He trained the [[Baroque]] artist [[John Michael Wright]] (1617–94), who also studied in Rome with [[Poussin]] and [[Velázquez]]. Wright painted both Scottish and English subjects,&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0-19-162433-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; including his sensitive portrait of the architect [[William Bruce (architect)|William Bruce]] (1664) and styled himself as "king's painter". His full-length painting of [[Clan Murray|Lord Mungo Murray]] in [[Highland dress]] (c. 1680) is an early example of what became a standard format of Scottish portrait. The [[Scotland under the Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period saw the emergence of [[David Scougall]] (c.1610-1680), mainly noted for his portrait of the [[Covenanter]] leader [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Archibald Campbell]]. Also important was the miniaturist [[David Paton (artist)|David Paton]] (fl. 1668–1708),&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p46&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-500-20333-4}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; who worked mainly in [[Plumbago drawing|plumbago]], but also painted portraits in [[oil paint|oil]]. Visiting artists included [[Jacob Willemszoon de Wet|Jacob de Wett]] (c. 1610–c. 1691), who was commissioned in 1684 to paint images of 110 kings for Holyroodhouse and similar work at Glamis Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Glorious Revolution in Scotland|Glorious Revolution]], Wright, a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], fell out of favour at the royal court.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p49&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish-Spanish painter [[John Baptist Medina]] (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish portrait painter of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his best known works are a group of about 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in [[Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh]]. He trained his son, also John, and [[William Aikman (painter)|William Aikman]] (1682–1731), who became the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', pp. 150–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1994p300/&gt;{{clear}}

[[File:David Hume 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The key Enlightenment figure [[David Hume]], painted by his friend [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1766)]]
John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter [[George Jamesone]]. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1994p300&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. Both worked predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included the portrait of [[George Drummond]] the [[List of Lord Provosts of Edinburgh|Lord Provost of Edinburgh]] (1756), who had been responsible for the creation of the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] in Edinburgh and the [[Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh|Royal Infirmary]], which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of ''John Campbell of the Bank'' (1749), who was chief cashier of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]], but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland dress. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p56&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84) studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. He undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], including his friend the philosopher [[David Hume]] and the visiting [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors, but also more intimate works like that of ''Queen Charlotte and her Children'' (c. 1755). His work has been seen as anticipating the [[Grand Manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading portrait painter of the second half of the century was [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823). He was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the Grand Manner tradition.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Ochterbeck, ed., ''Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition'' (London: Michelin, 5th edn., 2007), {{ISBN|1-906261-08-3}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knight in 1822 and the King's [[painter and limner]] in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3&gt;D. Campbell, ''Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History'' (Oxford: Signal Books, 2003), {{ISBN|1-902669-73-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–3.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupils included the brothers [[Alexander Robertson (artist)|William (Alexander)]] (1772–1841), [[Archibald Robertson (painter)|Archibald]] (1765–1835) and [[Andrew Robertson (miniaturist)|Andrew Robertson]] (1777–1845). William and Archibald went on to found the Columbian Academy of Painting in New York, and Andrew to be the leading Scottish [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] of his day. Also associated with Raeburn towards the end of his career were [[John Syme]] (1795–1861) and [[Colvin Smith]] (1795–1875).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 151 and 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the generation of painters that followed Raeburn, David Watson (1767–1837) trained with Reynolds in London before returning home to become the first president of the Scottish Academy in 1826.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp75-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 75–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of both Reynolds and Raeburn can be seen in his work, including ''A Girl Drawing'' (1813) and the large group portrait ''The Children of the Earl of Elgin with their Nurse'' (c. 1805).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew [[John Watson Gordon]] (1788–1864), who also studied with Raeburn. He painted portraits of leading cultural figures [[James Hogg]] and [[Carolina Nairne|Lady Nairne]] as part of a series of portraits commissioned by [[William Blackwood]].&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1785–1841) worked mainly in London, and produced the flattering painting of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the [[kilt]]. He succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge of one of the most influential British artists of the century.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9&gt;I. Chilvers, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;678–9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] (1783–1844) produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including [[Walter Scott]], before he finally moved to London in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Geddes, Andrew |volume=11 |page=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Graham-Gilbert]] (1794–1866) was born in Glasgow and worked in the city from 1834, playing an important part in the professionalisation of painting there. Other figures to pursue their careers largely in portraiture based in Glasgow included [[Daniel Macnee]] (1806–82), who only moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876.&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p163-4&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-nineteenth century portrait painting declined as an art. This was partly due to the advent of photography, which could record the human face with greater ease.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;P. Allara, ''Pictures of People: Alice Neels American Portrait Gallery'' (UPNE, 2000), {{ISBN|1-58465-036-2}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; While grander commissions were still made, the miniature in particular, which had often been in an intimate locket or brooch, was largely replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Council of Great Britain. Scottish Committee, ''British Portrait Miniatures: An Exhibition Arranged for the Period of the Edinburgh International Festival, 1965'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1968), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Octavius Hill]] (1802–70) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of [[Great Disruption]] of 1843 for a composite painted portrait, but as part of [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] he was one of the founding fathers of [[art photography]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Gernsheim, ''Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839–1960'' (Courier Dover, 1962), {{ISBN|0-486-26750-4}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting, photography also began to influence painting. From the 1840s John Watson Gordon's work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of ''Principal Lee'' (1847).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p163-4/&gt; Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, [[Robert Scott Lauder]] (1803–69), [[William Quiller Orchardson]] (1832–1910) and [[John Pettie]] (1839–93).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p163-4/&gt; [[John Zephaniah Bell]] (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp75-6/&gt; The most significant grouping in late nineteenth-century Scotland, the [[Glasgow Boys]], mainly focused on landscape. They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention. A number of artists identified with the group came to support themselves through portrait painting, including [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930) and Belfast-born [[John Lavery]] (1856–1944).&lt;ref&gt;S.

In the twentieth century the move away from [[figurative art|figurative painting]] to [[impressionism]] and [[abstract art|abstraction]], continued the decline of portrait painting.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Barzun, ''The Use and Abuse of Art'' (Princeton University Press, 1975), {{ISBN|0-691-01804-9}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the four members of the [[Scottish Colourists]] in the 1920s. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which [[post-impressionism]] reached Scotland.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575&gt;I. Chilvers, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; Of their number [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), emerged as a significant painter of still lives and single figure compositions, particularly with interior backdrops, before moving closer to abstraction.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p160&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the next significant movement, known as [[The Edinburgh School]], [[Cecile Walton]] (1891–1956) referenced classical forms, particularly in her ironic self-portrait ''Romance'' (1920), which draws on [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' and [[Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]''. Her close friend [[Dorothy Johnstone]]'s portraits, such as the young girl in ''September Sunlight'' (1916), made use of interior natural light.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p168&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[James Cowie (artist)|James Cowie]] (1886–1956), who painted a number of girls in interior settings, is similar in theme to that of Johnstone, but had a more distant and elegiac feel that can be seen in ''Falling Leaves'' (1934), which has been read as a commentary as a commentary on the transition from childhood to adolescence.&lt;!-- He also referenced the history of art in his ''Self-Portrait: the Blue Shirt'' (1945–50).{{efn|Presumably this means ''[[The Blue Boy]]''.{{cn|date=November 2015}}}}--&gt;&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p174&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of the twentieth century saw a general movement back towards figurative representation in European art.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p209&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Moffat]] (b. 1943), who concentrated on portraiture, labelled with the description of "Scottish realism", was among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;C.&lt;!--Craig--&gt; Richardson, ''Scottish Art Since 1960: Historical Reflections and Contemporary Overviews'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2011), {{ISBN|0-7546-6124-5}}, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; His work included the allegorical ''Poet's Pub'' (1980), which shows leading figures in Scottish twentieth-century intellectual life grouped around the poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]].&lt;ref name="MacDonald2000p209"/&gt; The artists associated with Moffat and the [[Glasgow School of Art]] who came to prominence in the 1980s are sometimes known as the "new Glasgow Boys", or "Glasgow pups"&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;I. Chilvers, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; and included [[Steven Campbell (artist)|Steven Campbell]] (1953–2007), [[Peter Howson]] (b. 1958), [[Ken Currie]] (b. 1960) and [[Adrian Wisniewski]] (b. 1958).

'''Post-YBAs''' refers to British artists emerging in the 2000s after the [[Young British Artists]].

Post-YBA artists include [[Tim Noble and Sue Webster]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/art/0347,levin,48745,13.html ''Village Voice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016081217/http://www.villagevoice.com/art/0347%2Clevin%2C48745%2C13.html |date=16 October 2007 }}, 17 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carey Young]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careyyoung.com/essays/kelsey.html ''artext''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820001532/http://www.careyyoung.com/essays/kelsey.html |date=20 August 2007 }}, Spring, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Payne and Nick Relph]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_42/ai_112735014 ''ArtForum''], Jan 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Thorpe (artist)|

According to [[Matthew Higgs]], [[Simon Starling]]'s winning of the [[Turner Prize]] in 2005 reflected a post-YBA sensibility which is more modestly material and formal than spectacle-driven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artnetnews/artnetnews12-6-05.asp artnet Magazine], 6 Dec 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrico David]] tapped into a post-YBA vogue for craft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/london/art/events/539974/enrico_david.html timeout.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112063810/http://www.timeout.com/london/art/events/539974/enrico_david.html |date=12 November 2007 }}, accessed 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The post-YBA generation has also been associated with [[neo-conceptual art]] with a political edge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,,375089,00.html Jonathan Jones, ''The Guardian''], 30 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ruijū Karin''''' (類聚歌林) was a Japanese ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' anthology compiled by [[Yamanoue no Okura]].

== Compilation and date ==
The ''Ruijū Karin'' was compiled by [[Yamanoue no Okura]].{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}} It was likely compiled after [[Yōrō|Yōrō 5]] (721) when Okura become a tutor to the [[crown prince of Japan|crown prince]] (later [[Emperor Shōmu]]).{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}}

== Title ==
The work's title has been translated into English as:&lt;!-- These come from a quick GBooks search of "Ruiju Karin". Most of the sources are well-regarded. Not sure about how this should be formatted in the long term; probably Japanese sources have speculated at length about the meaning and origin of the title, for which discussion we would need to explain its basic meaning, and one or more of the below published translations would be useful. --&gt;
*''The Grove of Poetry, Arranged by Topic''
*''Forest of Classified Verse''
*''Forest of Classified Verses''
*''The Grove of Poems Classified''
*''Classified Forest of Poetry''
*''Classified Forest of Verse''
&lt;!-- Do not add "grove of arranged trees" from https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=y4lZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ruiju+karin&amp;dq=ruiju+karin&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiasMyGyureAhUGxLwKHcikAVA4ChDoAQg6MAM here, as the source is clearly flawed, its author apparently not even knowing 万 doesn't mean "a thousand". Same goes for "The Forest of Choice Bamboos" from the obviously bogus "Japan Encyclopedia". --&gt;

== Status and apparent contents ==

The work divided poems into categories based on some sort of criteria{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}} and, using resources such as the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and ''[[Fudoki]]'',{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}} investigated the circumstances under which its poems were composed.{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}} As far as the ''Man'yōshū'' tells us, it apparently included poems by [[emperor of Japan|emperors]]{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}} and [[imperial family of Japan|members of the imperial family]],{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}} as well as court poems such as those commemorating imperial processions to various parts of the country (行幸従駕 ''gyōkō-jūga'').{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}} This has led to the theory that it was compiled to be presented to the crown prince.{{sfnm|1a1=Endō|1y=1994}}

It may have been modeled on the Chinese work ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Imura|1y=1998}}

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Sang Hyang dans TMnr 60052123.jpg|thumb|right|The sacred [[Balinese dance]] Sanghyang Dedari involved girls being possessed by [[hyang]]s.]]

'''''Symphony of Decay''''' is a [[Extended play|EP]] by American [[alternative rock]] band [[Third Eye Blind]]. The EP started off under the working title of '''''Black''''' as a companion EP to their [[RIAA|platinum selling]] 1999 album ''[[Blue (Third Eye Blind album)|Blue]]''. Its creation was a result of a compromise over the release method of the track "Slow Motion"; the band had wanted it on ''Blue'', while their [[record label]], [[Elektra Records]], opposed its inclusion on such a high-profile full-length album release due to its controversial lyrics. The EP would go through years of delays for a multitude of reasons, including extensive touring, prioritizing the completion of their third studio album ''[[Out of the Vein]]'', and complications arising from parting ways with Elektra in 2004. The EP itself was never collectively released, though many of the tracks were eventually released elsewhere.

==Background==
After the band's six times [[RIAA|platinum]]-selling self-titled ''[[Third Eye Blind (album)|Third Eye Blind]]'' album, the band reconvened to record a follow up album, ''[[Blue (Third Eye Blind album)|Blue]]'', in early 1999. During the ''Blue'' sessions, the band recorded a track called "Slow Motion" which had been used in their 1994 demo tape.&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=111594&amp;page=1|title=Third Eye Blind Album Details|date=6 January 2006|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], the band's [[record label]], did not approve of the song's lyrical content about a student who shoots a teacher's son, with the [[Columbine High School massacre]] having just occurred the same year.&lt;ref name="MTV1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/520169/third-eye-blind-set-sights-on-ep-for-censored-song/|title=Third Eye Blind Set Sights On EP For Censored Song|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band argued with the label for over four months over the content and its inclusion on the album.&lt;ref name="MTV1"/&gt; The final agreement between the two parties was that the song could only be on the album as an instrumental, but in return, Elektra would finance a separate [[extended play|EP]] where the song could be placed with its full controversial lyrics.&lt;ref name="ABC1"/&gt;

While the arrangement was made just prior to the release of ''Blue'', work on the EP, tentatively titled ''Black'' as a companion release to ''Blue'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-12/31/003r-123199-idx.html|title=An Unobstructed View of Third Eye Blind|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; wasn't set to begin until late 2000, upon completion of the "Red Summer Sun Tour" in support of ''Blue''.&lt;ref name="MTV2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/871374/third-eye-blind-to-record-concept-ep/|title=Third Eye Blind To Record Concept EP|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000, frontman [[Stephan Jenkins]] fell into a state of [[depression (mood)|depression]], which led him to recluse himself into a productive period of writing, resulting in over 40 new songs.&lt;ref name="MTV3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1446738/third-eye-blind-head-to-studio-may-get-help-from-fred-durst/|title=Third Eye Blind Head To Studio, May Get Help From Fred Durst|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity led the band to focus on releasing another full-length album first - what would become ''[[Out of the Vein]]'' - with intentions of releasing an EP afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71119/third-eye-blind-inspired-after-hiatus|title=Third Eye Blind Inspired After Hiatus|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Out of the Vein'' sessions, the band started referring to the EP title as ''Symphony of Decay''.&lt;ref name="mel1"/&gt; A month after the release of ''Out of the Vein'', in June 2003, Jenkins stated to [[VH1]] that the band planned on releasing the EP as soon as September of the same year.&lt;ref name="mel3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&amp;id=732|title=Melodic Net - New 3eb Ep In Sept.|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the EP was later delayed into 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&amp;id=2250 |title=Melodic Net - Third Eye Blind News,stephan Producing Vanessa And New Ep On The Way |publisher=Melodic.net |date=2004-03-14 |accessdate=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again into 2005.&lt;ref name="mel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&amp;id=3204|title=Melodic Net - Third Eye Blind Ep "Symphony Of Decay" Out Early 2005|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer [[Brad Hargreaves]], in late 2004, indicated that the EP had become tied up with difficulties with their record label, with Elektra dropping the band after the low sales of ''Out of the Vein''.&lt;ref name="mel2"/&gt;

==Concept==
The terms of the compromise resulting in the EP's conception gave the band considerable freedom in their work; it was financed by Elektra,&lt;ref name="ABC1"/&gt; but ultimately treated as an independent release, allowing the band creative control.&lt;ref name="MTV2"/&gt; The EP was envisioned as a seven&lt;ref name="MTV1"/&gt; to eight&lt;ref name="mel1"/&gt; song release where the songs would flow together and collectively have a run-time of about 50 minutes, resulting in lengthier run-times for some songs.&lt;ref name="MTV2"/&gt; Jenkins described the band's intent as wanting to "perform like a little symphony" to ultimately "make something really beautiful", while the band's manager at the time, Eric Godtland, stated that they would be "stringing together songs" to create "more of a cohesive vision that flows."&lt;ref name="MTV2"/&gt;
 
==Aftermath==
While the EP was never officially released, a number of the tracks eventually found release in various forms. The full-lyrics version of "Slow Motion" finally found a vehicle for its official release in the band's 2006 [[greatest hits]] album ''[[A Collection (Third Eye Blind album)|A Collection]]''.&lt;ref name="melGH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&amp;id=6100|title=Melodic Net - Third Eye Blind Releases Collection Of Hits And Rarities|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vocals and piano recording of "My Time in Exile" was also included on ''A Collection''.&lt;ref name="melGH"/&gt; The track "Carnival Barker", in its entirety, was released as a free download by the band in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&amp;id=6157|title=Melodic Net - New Instrumental Track With 3eb Available For Download|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a brief clip of it was included as the closing track of the band's fourth album, ''[[Ursa Major (album)|Ursa Major]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ursa-major-mw0000822715|title=Ursa Major - Third Eye Blind - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track "There's No Hurry to Eternity" was eventually released on the charity benefit [[compilation album]] ''Live from Nowhere Near You Vol. II'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-from-nowhere-near-you-vol-2-pacific-northwest-mw0002183949|title=Live From Nowhere Near You, Vol. 2: Pacific Northwest - Various Artists - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track had previously been titled as "[[Elliott Smith]]".&lt;ref name="mel2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&amp;id=2911|title=Melodic Net - Third Eye Blind Update On The "Lost" Ep And A Sideproject|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Knife in the Water", "Animal", and the full band version of "My Time in Exile" all unofficially [[internet leak|leaked onto the internet]] between 2005 and 2006. No versions of "Star Wars" or "Swimming" have ever been released or leaked, although the latter was temporarily listed as a potential track for ''Ursa Major''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&amp;id=7022|title=Melodic Net - Third Eye Blind Currently Working On Album #4|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the band would finally release an EP, the unrelated, politically-themed three track EP ''[[Red Star (EP)|Red Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2008/11/album-review-red-star-ep/|title=Album Review: Third Eye Blind – Red Star [EP]|date=27 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Continence of Scipio''''' or '''''An Episode from the Life of Publius Cornelius Scipio''''' is a long oil on canvas painting by [[Giovanni Bellini]], dating to 1507-1508 and now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.41589.html|title=Catalogue entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
It was probably commissioned in 1505 from [[Andrea Mantegna]] by cardinal [[Marco Cornaro (cardinal)|Marco Cornaro]] for the 'studiolo' or study of his brother [[Francesco Cornaro (cardinal)|Francesco]]'s palace in [[San Polo]]. This would make it a pendant to ''[[The Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome]]'', with the pair possibly intended to form part of a series of four works. However, Mantegna did not begin any of the four except ''Introduction'', the only one that Mantegna he completed before his death in 1506. He and Bellini had trained together as young men and the latter was also the former's brother in law. Bellini was himself an old man by 1506 but still took over this part of the commission and produced it in one of Mantegna's signature styles, [[grisaille]] (monochrome). [[Roberto Longhi]] has suggested that ''Sofonisba'' and ''Tuccia'' from Mantegna's ''[[Exemplary Women of Antiquity]]'' series were produced to go with ''Introduction'' and ''Continence'' - they are the same height as them but are on panel not canvas and no documents survive to support the theory.

[[File:Giovanni Bellini Continence of Scipio.jpg|thumb|left|200px|First half]]
[[File:Continence of Scipio (Bellini).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Second half]]
Francesco Cornaro was a Venetian patrician and his family was supposed to be descended from the [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]] [[gens]] of ancient Rome, hence the choice of two subjects from that gens' participation in the [[Second Punic War]]. ''Continence'' is derived from a story in [[Livy]] and [[Valerius Maximus]] about the aftermath of the capture of [[Carthage]] in 209 BC by [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]]. A virgin was personally delivered to him as a hostage, but she pleaded to be returned to her parents and [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] fiancé. He agreed on the single condition that her fiancé would work for peace between Rome and Carthage. Just left of centre Scipio sits on a throne and refuses the gold brought to him by the woman's parents as her ransom. She stands at the foot of his throne with her fiancé, who is shown with a sword and helmet. Between Scipio and the virgin is a plaque reading &lt;small&gt;TVRPIVS / IMPER / VENERE / .Q. A. / MIS AI&lt;/small&gt;. The more peripheral figures were painted by Bellini's studio and overall his and their figures show more animation than Mantegna's more rigid classicism, showing that Bellini had taken on board innovations by [[Giorgione]] but refused to be influenced by [[Dürer]].

The work reappeared on the art market in 1873 when it was sold by Sir John Charles Robinson (1824-1913) to [[Francis Cook, 1st Viscount of Monserrate|Sir Francis Cook]] (1817-1901) of Doughty House, [[Richmond-upon-Thames]]. Cook's son [[Sir Frederick Cook, 2nd Baronet|Frederick Lucas]], grandson [[Herbert Cook|Herbert Frederick]] and great-grandson [[Sir Francis Cook, 4th Baronet|Francis Ferdinand Maurice]] all inherited the painting in turn. Sir Francis Ferdinand Maurice Cook sold it in February 1948 to Gualtiero Volterra, who was buying it on behalf of count [[Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi]] of [[Florence]]. The count briefly brought it back to Italy before selling it to the [[Samuel H. Kress]] Foundation in March 1949. The Foundation finally gave it to its current owner in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mariolina Olivari, ''Giovanni Bellini'', in AA.VV., ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Firenze 2007. {{ISBN|888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Eagle with Two Heads''''' (French title '''''L'Aigle à deux têtes''''') is a French film directed by [[Jean Cocteau]] released in [[1948 in film|1948]].  It was adapted from his own play ''[[L'Aigle à deux têtes]]'' which was first staged in 1946, and it retained the principal actors from the first Paris production.

==Synopsis==
On the 10th anniversary of the assassination of the king, his reclusive widow, the Queen, arrives to spend the night at the castle of Krantz. Stanislas, a young [[anarchist]] poet who seeks to assassinate her, enters her room, wounded; he looks exactly like the dead king, and the Queen shelters him instead of handing him over to the police. She sees him as the welcome embodiment of her own death, calling him [[Azrael]] (the angel of death).  An ambiguous love develops between them, uniting them in a bid to outwit the machinations of the court politicians, represented by the Comte de Foëhn, the chief of police, and Édith de Berg, the Queen's companion.  In order to remain true to their ideals and to each other, the Queen and Stanislas have to play their parts in a bizarre private tragedy, which the world will never understand.

==Cast==
*[[Edwige Feuillère]] as  the Queen
*[[Jean Marais]] as  Stanislas
*[[Silvia Monfort]] as  Édith de Berg
*[[Jean Debucourt]] as  Félix de Willenstein
*[[Jacques Varennes]] as  Comte de Foëhn
*[[Ahmed Abdallah (actor)|Ahmed Abdallah]] as  Tony
*[[Yvonne de Bray]] as  La présidente

==Production==
[[L'Aigle à deux têtes|Cocteau's play]] was produced in Paris in 1946 and 1947, and his decision to make a prompt adaptation for the cinema allowed him to retain the principal actors who had enjoyed personal successes with their roles, especially Edwige Feuillère and Jean Marais.  Cocteau declared his intention of following the three-act structure of the play closely, citing his admiration of the methods of [[Ernst Lubitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Cocteau, in ''Combat'', 21 August 1947, quoted in [[Claude-Jean Philippe]], ''Jean Cocteau''. (Paris: Seghers, 1989) p.160: "À l'exemple de Lubitsch, que j'admire beaucoup, le film suivra la pièce de très près. Je l'ai construit autour des trois scènes principales".&lt;/ref&gt; but he opened out some of the scenes into a wider variety of locations. Filming began in October 1947 at the Château de [[Vizille]],&lt;ref&gt;René Gilson, ''Jean Cocteau cinéaste''. (Paris: Éditions des Quatre-Vents, 1988) p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; and further shots were filmed at the Studio d'Épinay on the outskirts of Paris.

[[Christian Bérard]] supervised the art direction, and the sumptuous sets and costumes (executed by [[Georges Wakhévitch]] and [[Marcel Escoffier]] respectively) evoked a royal palace in an imaginary kingdom of 19th century middle-Europe.  [[Georges Auric]] expanded the music which he had written for the stage production into a full score for the film.

==Reception==
The film was released in Paris in September 1948. Its reception among French critics was mixed. It was appreciated for the sumptuous quality of its spectacle and for the elevated performances of its actors.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Louis Chauvet, ''Le Figaro'', 26 August 1948, quoted in Claude-Jean Philippe, ''Jean Cocteau''. (Paris: Seghers, 1989) p.162: "Les personnages parlent une langue toujours belle, et mêmes leurs attitudes sont belles".&lt;/ref&gt;  Others however felt that its artificiality belonged to another age and another medium, and that Cocteau had not sufficiently emancipated his film from its theatrical origins.&lt;ref&gt;André Bazin, ''Parisien'', 29 September 1948, quoted in Claude-Jean Philippe, ''Jean Cocteau''. (Paris: Seghers, 1989) p.160: "''L'Aigle à deux têtes'' laisse indifférent comme un motif décoratif habilement inspiré du style d'une autre époque".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Néry, ''L'Écran français'', quoted in Claude-Jean Philippe, ''Jean Cocteau''. (Paris: Seghers, 1989) p.162: "Il n'a pas su (ou pas voulu) s'émanciper des disciplines théâtrales".&lt;/ref&gt;

When the film was shown in New York in 1948 and in London in 1949, the reviewers of both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' shared a similar perplexity about the film's meaning and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Bosley Crowther, "L'Aigle à deux têtes", in ''New York Times'', 30 December 1948: "It sometimes helps if a reviewer has a faint idea of what a film he is reviewing is supposed to be about... Unfortunately, Mr Cocteau neglected to make it clear... Plenty of money and taste have plainly been spent on a handsome physical production. Hapsburg {{sic}} splendor is in the sets and the costumes which Miss Feuillere fills out are lovely and flattering. But they all add up to nothing."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 10 November 1949, p.7, col.C: "The passion of Cocteau for history and for legend, his conception of illusion and reality, his preoccupations with death and doom, his romantic mysticism, so heavy and overcharged that it is difficult to remember that he is a French and not a Teutonic director - all these are indeed present in this new film, but fitfully, as it were, as inadequate exponents of the mood and the motive of the initial impulse. The play may have made things clearer...".&lt;/ref&gt; The film has in general not enjoyed the same attention as the others which Cocteau directed in the 1940s.

An '''usher''' is a person who shows people where to sit, especially at a theatre or when attending a wedding. An example of an usher is a person who is friends with the groom who directs people where to sit as they enter the church for a wedding.

==History==
The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:ostiarius|ostiarius]]'' ("porter", "doorman") through Norman French, and is a cognate of the French ''[[:fr:Huissier|huissier]]''. 

Ushers were servants or [[courtier]]s who showed or ushered visitors in and out of meetings in large houses or palaces.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], a variety of titles for courtiers in the [[Royal Household]] include the word ''usher''. In [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], from the early sixteenth century until at least the end of the nineteenth century, the term denoted an assistant to a schoolmaster or head-teacher; an under-master, assistant-master.&lt;ref name="OEDUsher"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/220658?rskey=WqlPa7&amp;result=1 |title=usher, n.|publisher=OED Online|accessdate=2013-07-25|format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such use, however, the term is now rare.&lt;ref name="OEDUsher" /&gt;

[[File:The Republic exhibition - NM Prague 14.JPG|thumb|right|Cinema ticket. The usher checks the tickets in the entrance of cinemas and theaters, directing visitors to their seat and assists people who sit in the wrong place]]
Ushers assist visitors by formally showing the way in a large building or to their appropriate seats. This may coincide with a security role.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

At weddings, friends of the groom and bride may be recruited to direct guests at the ceremony, and generally be available for assistance.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

Ushers help those in attendance at entertainment and sporting events in theatres and stadiums. Duties include checking tickets, directing people to their assigned seats, distributing programmes, answering questions and assisting people in finding restrooms and refreshments.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

According to the [[United States Department of Labor]], ushers, lobby attendants and ticket takers earn an average wage of $8.41 an hour and $17,500 a year. Approximately 102,000 are employed in this line of work. Most of these workers are employed by the motion picture and video industries, secondly they work in the performing arts and sporting events venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes393031.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other jobs also come under the name 'Usher', such as baseball field personnel. A field usher coordinates not only the baseball diamond grounds but also the stadium itself.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

Ushers are also expected to help with security and to ensure that only people with proper authority have access to backstage areas. Ushers also monitor the crowds and can summon security when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes393031.htm |title=Careers: Ushers and Ticket Takers |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Movie theater|cinema]]s and theaters, it was common for ushers to check tickets and show people to their seats to watch the film being shown. If actually during the film, when lights were dimmed, the usher would shine a [[Flashlight|torch]] to light the row of seating in question.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

'''''Waste''''' is a play by the English author [[Harley Granville Barker]].  It exists in two wholly different versions, from 1906 and 1927.  The first version was refused a licence by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] and had to be performed privately by the [[Stage Society]] in 1907; the second was finally staged in public at the [[Westminster Theatre]] in 1936.

==Plot==
The plot centres around ambitious independent politician Henry Trebell, his plans for a bill to [[disestablishment|disestablish]] the [[Church of England]] and his fall from grace and suicide after his affair with married woman Amy O'Connell, who dies after a botched [[abortion]]. The title may refer to the waste of his potential talents due to the scandal, the loss of the disestablishment bill and the termination of Amy's pregnancy.

==Dramatis personae (1927 version)==
*Gilbert Wedgecroft, Trebell's doctor
*Walter Kent, Trebell's secretary
*Amy O'Connell, Trebell's lover
*Russell Blackborough, Tory MP and financier
*Justin O'Connell, Amy's estranged Irish husband
*Lord Charles Cantilupe, Tory MP
*Henry Trebell, Independent and later Tory MP

==Production history==
Recent productions include John Barton's in 1985 for the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Barbican, with Daniel Massey as Trebell and Judi Dench as Amy, one in 1997 at the [[Old Vic]] by the [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]] Company (with [[Michael Pennington]] as Trebell, [[Anna Carteret]] as Frances and [[Peter Blythe]] as Charles Cantilupe) and a well-received one at the [[Almeida Theatre]] (directed by [[Samuel West]] and starring [[Will Keen]] as Trebell, [[Nancy Carroll (British actress)|Nancy Carroll]] as Amy and [[Phoebe Nicholls]] as Frances&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almeida.co.uk/production_details/production_details.aspx?code=72 Almeida homepage for the production]&lt;/ref&gt;). Recent North American productions include one in 1995 at the [[Shaw Festival production history#1995|Shaw Festival]] (directed by [[Neil Munro (actor)|Neil Munro]]) and one in 2000 directed by [[Bartlett Sher]]. In November 2015, the National Theatre revived the play, directed by [[Roger Michell]] and starring [[Charles Edwards (English actor)|Charles Edwards]] as Trebell and [[Olivia Williams]] as Amy, using the 1927 version of the text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/waste National Theatre homepage for the production]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oer-Weimarer Musenhof.jpg|thumb|300px|''Weimar's Courtyard of the Muses'' (1860) by Theobald Freiherr von Oer. Schiller reads in the gardens of [[Schloss Tiefurt|Tiefurt]] Castle, [[Weimar]]. Amongst the audience, seated at the far left, are Wieland and Herder, while Goethe stands before the pillar, at right.]]

'''Weimar Classicism''' ({{lang-de|Weimarer Klassik}}) was a German [[literary movement|literary]] and [[cultural movement]], whose practitioners established a new [[humanism]], from the synthesis of ideas from [[Romanticism]], [[Classicism]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

The ''Weimarer Klassik'' movement lasted thirty-three years, from 1772 until 1805, and involved intellectuals such as [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]; and then was concentrated upon Goethe and Schiller during the period 1788–1805.

== Development ==

=== Background ===
The [[Age of Enlightenment|German Enlightenment]], called "[[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]]", burgeoned in the synthesis of [[Empiricism]] and [[Rationalism]] as developed by [[Christian Thomasius]] (1655–1728) and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754). This philosophy, circulated widely in many magazines and journals, profoundly directed the subsequent expansion of [[German language|German]]-speaking and [[European culture|European]] [[culture]].

The inability of this common-sense outlook convincingly to bridge "feeling" and "thought", "body" and "mind", led to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s epochal "critical" philosophy.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} Another, though not as abstract, approach to this problem was a governing concern with the problems of aesthetics. In his ''Aesthetica'' of 1750 (vol. II; 1758)  [[Alexander Baumgarten]] (1714–62) defined "aesthetics", which he coined earlier in 1735, with its current intention as the "science" of the "lower faculties" (i.e., feeling, sensation, imagination, memory, et al.), which earlier figures of the Enlightenment had neglected&lt;!-- needs ref --&gt;. (The term, however, gave way to misunderstandings due to Baumgarten's use of the [[Latin]] in accordance with the German renditions, and consequently this has often led many to falsely undervalue his accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Nivelle, ''Les Théories esthétiques en Allemagne de Baumgarten à Kant''. Bibliothèque de la Faculté de Philosophie et Lettres de l'Université de Liège (Paris, 1955), pp. 21 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;) It was no inquiry into taste—into positive or negative appeals—nor sensations as such but rather a way of knowledge. Baumgarten's emphasis on the need for such "sensuous" knowledge was a major abetment to the "pre-Romanticism" known as ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' (1765), of which [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] were notable participants for a time.

=== Cultural and historical context ===
Following Goethe's competition with and separation from Wieland and Herder, the movement Weimar Classicism is often described to have occurred only between Goethe's first stay in Rome (1786) and the death of Schiller (1805), his close friend and collaborator, underrating especially Wieland's influence on German intellectual and poetic life. Therefore, the Weimar Classicism could also be started with the arrival of Wieland (1772) and extended beyond Schiller's death until the death of Wieland (1813) or even of Goethe himself (1832).

In Italy, Goethe aimed to rediscover himself as a writer and to become an artist, through formal training in Rome, Europe's 'school of art'. While he failed as an artist, Italy appeared to have made him a better writer.

Schiller's evolution as a writer was following a similar path to Goethe's. He had begun as a writer of wild, violent, emotion-driven plays. In the late 1780s he turned to a more classical style. In 1794, Schiller and Goethe became friends and allies in a project to establish new standards for literature and the arts in Germany.

By contrast, the contemporaneous and efflorescing literary movement of [[German Romanticism]] was in opposition to Weimar and German Classicism, especially to Schiller. It is in this way both may be best understood, even to the degree in which Goethe continuously and stringently criticized it through much of his essays, such as "On Dilettantism",&lt;ref&gt;Borchmeyer, op. cit., p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; on art and literature.&lt;!-- Elaborate this particular criticism --&gt; After Schiller's death, the continuity of these objections partly elucidates the nature of Goethe's ideas in art and how they intermingled with his scientific thinking as well,&lt;ref&gt;Vaget, ''Dilettantismus und Meisterschaft. Zum Problem des Dilettantismus bei Goethe: Praxis, Theorie, Zeitkritik'' (Munich: Winkler, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; inasmuch as it gives coherence to Goethe's work. Weimar Classicism may be seen as an attempt to reconcile—in "binary synthesis"—the vivid feeling emphasized by the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement with the clear thought emphasized by the Enlightenment, thus implying Weimar Classicism is intrinsically un-[[Platonism|Platonic]]. On this Goethe remarked:

{{Quotation|"The idea of the distinction between classical and romantic poetry [''Dichtung''&lt;ref&gt;The [[German language|German]] word has its [[English language|English]] equivalents in "poetry" and "fiction".&lt;/ref&gt;], which is now spread over the whole world, and occasions so many quarrels and divisions, came originally from Schiller and myself. I laid down the maxim of objective treatment of poetry, and would allow no other; but Schiller, who worked quite in the subjective way, deemed his own fashion the right one, and to defend himself against me, wrote the treatise upon 'Naïve and Sentimental Poetry.' He proved to me that I myself, against my will, was romantic, and that my 'Iphigenia,' through the predominance of sentiment, was by no means so classical and so much in the antique spirit as some people supposed.

"The Schlegels took up this idea, and carried it further, so that it has now been diffused over the whole world; and every one talks about classicism and romanticism—of which nobody thought fifty years ago."&lt;ref name=Eckermann&gt;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eTfyNmEqgb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Conversations+with+Eckermann,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ge1R0auvNd&amp;sig=tYMp3X69HCB2HwmxHOGnjNBgnTE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jExPTYXtNYbGlQe1xsU7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20proved%20to%20me%20that%20I%20myself%2C%20against%20my%20will%2C%20was%20romantic&amp;f=false Conversations With Eckermann (1823-1832)]''.M. Walter Dunne (1901).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Weimar movement was notable for its inclusion of female writers.  ''Die Horen'' included works by several women, including a serially published novel, ''Agnes von Lilien'', by Schiller's sister-in-law [[Caroline von Wolzogen]].  Other women published by Schiller included [[Sophie Mereau]], [[Friederike Brun]], [[Amalie von Imhoff]], [[Elisa von der Recke]], and [[Louise Brachmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, Janet Besserer, ''The Women Writers in Schiller's ''Horen'': Patrons, Petticoats, and the Promotion of Weimar Classicism'' (Newark, Delaware: University of Delaware Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1786 and Schiller's death in 1805, he and Goethe worked to recruit a network of writers, philosophers, scholars and artists to their cause. This alliance later became known as 'Weimar Classicism', and it came to form a part of the foundation of 19th-century Germany's understanding of itself as a culture and the political [[unification of Germany]].

== Aesthetic and philosophical principles ==
These are essentials used by Goethe and Schiller:&lt;!-- examples of their engagement within texts, such as "Primal Words. Orphic", may be necessary; the desultory conditions of goethe's scientific ideas with his aesthetic ones are truly grown together --&gt;

# ''Gehalt'': the inexpressible "felt-thought", or "import", which is alive in the artist and the percipient that he or she finds means to express within the aesthetic form, hence ''Gehalt'' is implicit with form. A work's ''Gehalt'' is not reducible to its ''Inhalt''.
# ''Gestalt'': the aesthetic form, in which the import of the work is stratified, that emerges from the regulation of forms (these being rhetorical, grammatical, intellectual, and so on) abstracted from the world or created by the artist, with sense relationships prevailing within the employed medium.
# ''Stoff'': Schiller and Goethe reserve this (almost solely) for the forms taken from the world or that are created. In a work of art, ''Stoff'' (designated as "''Inhalt''", or "content", when observed in this context) is to be "indifferent" ("''gleichgültig''"), that is, it should not arouse undue interest, deflecting attention from the aesthetic form. Indeed, ''Stoff'' (i.e., also the medium through which the artist creates) needs to be in such a complete state of unicity with the ''Gestalt'' of the art-symbol that it cannot be abstracted except at the cost of destroying the aesthetic relations established by the artist.{{Citation needed|reason=How do we know these are "key" terms?|date=March 2016}}

== Primary authors ==

=== Goethe and Schiller ===

Although the vociferously unrestricted, even "organic", works that were produced, such as ''Wilhelm Meister'', ''Faust'', and ''West-östlicher Divan'', where playful and turbulent ironies abound,&lt;ref&gt;Bahr, ''Die Ironie im Späwerk Goethes: "Diese sehr ernsten Scherze": Studien zum West-östlichen Divan, zu den Wanderjahren und zu Faust II'' (Berlin: Erich Schmidt Verlag, 1872).&lt;/ref&gt; may perceivably lend Weimar Classicism the double, ironic title "Weimar Romanticism",&lt;ref&gt;Borchmeyer, op. cit., p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; it must nevertheless be understood that Goethe consistently demanded this distance via irony to be imbued within a work for precipitate aesthetic affect.&lt;ref&gt;Goethe's letter to Friedrich Zelter, 25.xii.1829. Cf. "''Spanische Romanzen, übersetzt von Beauregard Pandin''" (1823).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Schiller was very prolific during this period, writing his plays ''Wallenstein'' (1799), ''Mary Stuart'' (1800), ''The Maid of Orleans'' (1801), ''The Bride of Messina'' (1803) and ''William Tell'' (1804).

'''Sir William Jackson Hooker''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KH|FRS|FRSE|FLS|DCL|LLD}} (6 July 1785 – 12 August 1865) was an English systematic [[botany|botanist]] and organiser, and botanical illustrator. He held the post of [[Regius Professor]] of Botany at [[Glasgow University]], and was Director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]. He enjoyed the friendship and support of Sir [[Joseph Banks]] for his exploring, collecting and organising work. His son, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], succeeded him to the Directorship of Kew Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Mea 1967. ''The Hookers of Kew 1785–1911.'' Joseph, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Hooker was born in [[Norwich]]. His father, Joseph Hooker of [[Exeter]], a member of the same family as the celebrated theologian [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]], devoted much of his time to the study of German literature and the cultivation of curious [[plant]]s. He was educated at [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]] and afterwards took up as a recreation the study of [[natural history]], especially [[ornithology]] and [[entomology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Self-Taught Botanists Who Saved the Kew Botanic Garden |author=Stearn, William T.  |journal=Taxon |volume=14 |issue=9 |date=December 1965 |page=294 |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) |jstor=1216740 |doi=10.2307/1216740}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently confined his attention to botany, on the recommendation of [[Sir James Edward Smith]], whom he had consulted respecting a rare [[moss]].

Hooker inherited enough money to be able to travel at his own expense. His first botanical expedition—at the suggestion of Sir [[Joseph Banks]]—was to [[Iceland]], in the summer of 1809. The specimens he collected, along with his notes and drawings, were destroyed by fire on the homeward voyage; an incident in which he nearly lost his life. His good memory, however, aided him to publish an account of the island, and of its inhabitants and flora; his ''Tour in Iceland'', 1809, was privately circulated in 1811&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Travels in the Island of Iceland, during the summer of the Year 1810'' by Sir George Steuart Mackenzie and ''Journal of a Tour in Iceland, in the Summer of 1809'' by William Jackson Hooker|journal=The Quarterly Review|volume=7|date=March 1812|pages=48–92|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b661434;view=1up;seq=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hooker, William Jackson|title=Journal of a tour in Iceland, in the summer of 1809|location=London|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Orme, and Brown|edition=2nd|year=1813|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001235821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810–1811 he made extensive preparations, and sacrifices which proved financially serious, with a view to accompany Sir [[Robert Brownrigg]] to [[Ceylon]], but political upheaval led to the project being abandoned. In 1814 he spent nine months in botanizing excursions in France, Switzerland and northern Italy, and in the following year he married Maria Dawson Turner, the eldest daughter of [[Dawson Turner]], banker, of [[Great Yarmouth]], and sister-in-law of [[Francis Palgrave]].

Settling at [[Halesworth]], [[Suffolk]], he devoted himself to the formation of his [[herbarium]], which became of worldwide renown among botanists. In 1816 the ''British Jungermanniae'', his first scientific work, was published. This was succeeded by a new edition of [[William Curtis]]'s ''[[Flora Londinensis]]'', for which he wrote the descriptions (1817–1828); by a description of the ''Plantae cryptogamicae'' of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Aimé Bonpland]]; by the ''[[Muscologia]]'', a very complete account of the [[moss]]es of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Ireland, prepared in conjunction with [[Thomas Taylor (botanist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1818);&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle = Taylor, Thomas (d.1848) |last= Boulger |first=George Simonds |authorlink=George Simonds Boulger |volume = 55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by his ''Musci exotici'' (2 vols., 1818–1820), devoted to new foreign mosses and other [[cryptogamic plants]].

In 1820 he accepted the regius professorship of botany in the [[University of Glasgow]] where he soon became popular as a lecturer; his style was both clear and ready. The following year he brought out the ''[[Flora Scotica]]'', in which the natural method of arrangement of British plants was given with the artificial. He worked with the [[Glasgow]] botanist and lithographer [[Thomas Hopkirk]] to establish the [[Royal Botanic Institution of Glasgow]] and to lay out and develop the [[Glasgow Botanic Gardens]]. In 1815, he was made a corresponding member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and, in 1833, his status was changed to that of foreign member. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1823.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker succeeded in convincing the British government that botanists should be appointed to their expeditions. While his works were in progress his herbarium received large and valuable additions from all parts of the globe, and his position as a botanist was thus vastly improved. He was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] and a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1836, and in 1841 he was appointed director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], on the resignation of [[William Townsend Aiton]].&lt;ref&gt;Kew had formerly been a royal garden; Hooker was the first Director under its new state ownership. Turrill W.B. 1959. ''The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, past and present''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direction the gardens expanded from {{convert|10|to|75|acre|ha|abbr=out}}, with an arboretum of {{convert|270|acre|km2}}, many new glass-houses were erected, and a museum of [[economic botany]] was established. He was engaged on the ''Synopsis filicum'' with [[John Gilbert Baker]] when he contracted a throat infection then epidemic at Kew. He died in 1865 and is buried at [[St. Anne's Church, Kew]].

He was succeeded at Kew Gardens by his son Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], a rare example of an outstanding man succeeded in his post by an equally outstanding son.

'''Phemba''', also known as '''[[Yombe people|Yombe]] maternity figures''', refers to sculptural objects that depict the figures of a mother and child.&lt;ref name="AfAmInstitute1980"&gt;{{cite book | title=Masterpieces of the People's Republic of the Congo: the African-American Institute, September 25, 1980-January 24, 1981 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaPuAAAAMAAJ | accessdate=28 May 2013 | year=1980 | publisher=African-American Institute  |  page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phyllis2009"&gt;{{cite book | author=Phyllis Martin | title=Catholic women of Congo-Brazzaville: mothers and sisters in troubled times | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DWqkajkbmUC&amp;pg=PA197 | accessdate=28 May 2013 | year=2009 | publisher=Indiana University Press | isbn=978-0-253-22055-4 | pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Phemba are iconic examples of [[Kingdom of Kongo#Art_of_the_Kongo_Kingdom|Kongo art]] and  according to Thompson (1981) "reflect the degree to which women are treasured in Kongo culture, not just for their fecundity, but as seers and guardians of the spirit".&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2018}} 
Kongo societies are [[matrilineal]].&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In special cases, communities honored women by commissioning stone icons depicting a mother and child to be placed on their tombs. This was also considered dangerous, as it represented an insertion of the source of life - the mother - into the world of the dead.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds|year=1981|publisher=National Gallery of Art, Washington|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kikongo]] word ''phemba'' translates to "the white",&lt;ref&gt;Herbert M. Cole, ''ICONS'' (1989), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the white earth ([[Kaolinite]]) that is a sign of fertility in the region. The name is interpreted by  [[John M. Janzen]] (1979) as denoting "'the one who gives children in-potentia.' A phemba child is a magically conceived [[nkisi]] child, a fragile emissary of the spirit world."&lt;ref name="African Religions"&gt;{{cite book|title=African religions: a symposium|year=1979|publisher=NOK Publishers|location=New York|edition=2nd printing, corr.|editor=Newell S. Booth,}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phemba statuary falls into two groups: mothers cradling or holding their babies, and mothers nursing.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;
The very different styles of phemba sculptures illustrate regional and even personal variations on the same theme.
Oral tradition holds that the phemba cult was established by a famous midwife.
