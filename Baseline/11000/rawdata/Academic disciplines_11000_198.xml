'''Airglow''' (also called '''nightglow''') is a faint emission of light by a planetary [[atmosphere]]. In the case of [[Earth's atmosphere]], this [[optical phenomenon]] causes the [[night sky]] to never be completely dark, even after the effects of [[starlight]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffused sunlight]] from the far side are removed.

==History==

[[File:Airglow in Allier (FRANCE) during the night at the 13th August of 2015.jpg|thumb|Airglow in Allier, France, on the night of 13 August 2015|220x220px]]

The airglow phenomenon was first identified in 1868 by Swedish physicist [[Anders Ångström]]. Since then, it has been studied in the laboratory, and various chemical reactions have been observed to emit electromagnetic energy as part of the process.  Scientists have identified some of those processes that would be present in Earth's atmosphere, and astronomers have verified that such emissions are present.

==Description==
[[File:Iss030e015472 Edit.jpg|thumb|[[C/2011 W3|Comet Lovejoy]] passing behind Earth's airglow on December 22, 2011]]

Airglow is caused by various processes in the upper [[atmosphere of Earth]], such as the recombination of atoms which were [[photoionization|photoionized]] by the [[Sun]] during the day, luminescence caused by [[cosmic ray]]s striking the upper atmosphere, and [[chemiluminescence]] caused mainly by [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] reacting with [[hydroxyl]] ions at heights of a few hundred kilometres. It is not noticeable during the daytime due to the [[glare (vision)|glare]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|scattering]] of [[sunlight]].

Even at the best ground-based observatories, airglow limits the [[photosensitivity]] of [[optical telescope]]s. Partly for this reason, [[space telescope]]s like [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] can observe much fainter objects than current ground-based telescopes at [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]].

Airglow at night may be bright enough for a ground observer to notice and appears generally bluish. Although airglow emission is fairly uniform across the atmosphere, it appears brightest at about 10° above the observer's [[horizon]], since the lower one looks, the greater the [[air mass (astronomy)|depth of atmosphere]] one is looking through. Very low down, however, atmospheric [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] reduces the apparent brightness of the airglow.

One airglow mechanism is when an atom of [[nitrogen]] combines with an atom of [[oxygen]] to form a molecule of [[nitric oxide]] (NO). In the process, a [[photon]] is emitted. This photon may have any of several different wavelengths characteristic of nitric oxide molecules. The free atoms are available for this process, because molecules of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are dissociated by solar energy in the upper reaches of the atmosphere and may encounter each other to form NO. Other species that can create air glow in the atmosphere are hydroxyl (OH),&lt;ref name=meinel50a&gt;

The [[sky brightness]] is typically measured in units of [[apparent magnitude]] per square [[minute and second of arc|arcsecond]] of sky.

==Calculation of the effects of airglow==
[[File:Cupola above the darkened Earth.jpg|thumb|left|The airglow above the horizon, captured from the [[International Space Station|ISS]].]]
[[File:Airglow ESO.webm|thumb|Airglow.]]
[[File:Induced Airglow (HAARP).gif|thumb|Two images of the sky over the [[HAARP]] [[Gakona]] facility using the NRL-cooled [[CCD imager]] at 557.7 nm. The field of view is approximately 38°. The left-hand image shows the background star field with the HF transmitter off. The right-hand image was taken 63 seconds later with the HF transmitter on. Structure is evident in the emission region.]]

{{see also|Apparent magnitude}}
In order to calculate the relative intensity of airglow, we need to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes of photons; this clearly depends on the spectrum of the source, but we will ignore that initially.  At visible wavelengths, we need the parameter S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(V), the power per square centimetre of aperture and per micrometre of wavelength produced by a zeroth-magnitude star, to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes — {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(V) {{=}} {{val|4.0|e=-12|u=W cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; µm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;''High Energy Astrophysics: Particles, Photons and Their Detection'' Vol 1, Malcolm S. Longair, {{ISBN|0-521-38773-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we take the example of a ''V''=28 star observed through a normal ''V'' band filter ({{nowrap|''B'' {{=}} {{val|0.2|u=µm}}}} bandpass, frequency {{nowrap|ν ≈ {{val|6|e=14|u=Hz}}}}), the number of photons we receive per square centimeter of telescope aperture per second from the source is ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;N_s = 10^{-28/2.5}\times\frac{S_0(V) \times B}{h\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

(where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]; ''hν'' is the energy of a single photon of frequency ''ν'').

At ''V'' band, the emission from airglow is {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} 22}} per square arc-second at a high-altitude observatory on a moonless night; in excellent [[Astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions, the image of a star will be about 0.7 arc-second across with an area of 0.4 square arc-second,  and so the emission from airglow over the area of the image corresponds to about {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} 23}}. This gives the number of photons from airglow, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;N_a = 10^{-23/2.5}\times\frac{S_0(V) \times B}{h\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

The signal-to-noise for an ideal ground-based observation with a telescope of area ''A'' (ignoring losses and detector noise), arising from [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] statistics, is only:

:&lt;math&gt;S/N = \sqrt{A}\times\frac{N_{s}}{\sqrt{N_{s}+N_{a}}}&lt;/math&gt;

If we assume a 10&amp;nbsp;m diameter ideal ground-based telescope and an unresolved star: every second, over a patch the size of the seeing-enlarged image of the star, 35 photons arrive from the star and 3500 from air-glow.  So, over an hour, roughly {{val|1.3|e=7}}&lt;!-- this value was 1.3e7±3500 photons, but the ±3500 makes no sense as 1.3e7 implies an uncertainty of ±5e5, which is far greater--&gt; arrive from the air-glow, and approximately {{val|1.3|e=5}} arrive from the source; so the S/N ratio is about:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1.3 \times 10^5}{\sqrt{1.3 \times 10^7}} \approx 36.&lt;/math&gt;

We can compare this with "real" answers from exposure time calculators. For an 8 m unit [[Very Large Telescope]] telescope, according to the [http://www.eso.org/observing/etc/bin/gen/form?INS.NAME=FORS1++INS.MODE=imaging FORS] exposure time calculator you need 40 hours of observing time to reach ''V'' = 28, while the 2.4 m Hubble only takes 4 hours according to the [https://archive.is/20050209215954/http://apt.stsci.edu/webetc/acs/acs_img_etc.jsp ACS] exposure time calculator. A hypothetical 8 m Hubble telescope would take about 30 minutes.

It should be clear from this calculation that reducing the view field size can make fainter objects more detectable against the airglow; unfortunately, [[adaptive optics]] techniques that reduce the diameter of the view field of an Earth-based telescope by an order of magnitude only as yet work in the infrared, where the sky is much brighter.  A space telescope isn't restricted by the view field, since they are not affected by airglow.

==Induced airglow==
[[File:Figure 7.png|thumb|[[SwissCube-1]]'s first airglow image of the Earth (shifted to green from near [[Infrared|IR]]) captured on March 3, 2011.]]

Scientific experiments have been conducted to induce airglow by directing high-power radio emissions at the Earth's [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name='agu2005'&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090726023615/http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2005GL023864.shtml HF-induced airglow at magnetic zenith: Thermal and parametric instabilities near electron gyroharmonics].

[[Naval Research Laboratory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental observation==
[[SwissCube-1]] is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] satellite operated by [[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]. The spacecraft is a single unit [[CubeSat]], which was designed to conduct research into airglow within the Earth's atmosphere and to develop technology for future spacecraft. Though SwissCube-1 is rather small (10 x 10 x 10&amp;nbsp;cm) and weighs less than 1&amp;nbsp;kg, it carries a small telescope for obtaining images of the airglow. The first [[SwissCube-1]] image came down on February 18, 2011 and was quite black with some thermal noise on it. The first airglow image came down on March 3, 2011. This image has been converted to the human optical range (green) from its near-infrared measurement. This image provides a measurement of the intensity of the airglow phenomenon in the [[near-infrared]]. The range measured is from 500 to 61400 [[photons]], with a resolution of 500 photons.&lt;ref name='EPFL_Sopace_Center_airglow'&gt;[http://swisscube.epfl.ch/ SwissCube official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation of airglow on other planets==
The [[Venus Express]] spacecraft contains an [[infrared]] sensor which has detected near-IR emissions from the upper atmosphere of [[Venus]].  The emissions come from [[nitric oxide]] (NO) and from molecular oxygen.&lt;ref name="Garcia MunozMills2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia Munoz|first1=A.|last2=Mills|first2=F.

Scientists had previously determined in laboratory testing that during NO production, [[ultraviolet]] emissions and near-IR emissions were produced.

{{Reading}}
According to the '''alphabetic principle''', [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s and combinations of letters are the [[symbol]]s used to represent the [[phoneme|speech sounds]] of a language based on systematic and predictable relationships between written letters, symbols, and spoken words. The alphabetic principle is the foundation of any alphabetic writing system (such as the [[English (language)|English]] variety of the [[Roman alphabet]]), which is one of the more common types of [[List of writing systems|writing systems]] in use today.

Alphabetic writing systems that use an (in practice) almost perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] have a single letter for each individual speech sound and a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letters that represent them. Such systems are used, for example, in the modern languages [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (arguably, an example of perfect phonemic orthography), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Such languages have a straightforward [[spelling]] system, enabling a writer to predict the spelling of a word given its [[pronunciation]] and similarly enabling a reader to predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling. Ancient languages with such almost perfectly phonemic writing systems include [[Avestan alphabet|Avestic]], [[Latin]], [[Tamil script|Tamil]], [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]], and [[Sanskrit]] ([[Devanāgarī]]— an [[abugida]]; see [[Vyakarana]]). On the other hand, [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] have a strong difference between sounds and symbols.

The alphabetic principle does not underlie [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] like [[written Chinese|Chinese]] or [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]. [[Korean Language|Korean]], along with Chinese and Japanese, is a member of the [[CJK characters|CJK group]] and shares origins for many of the symbols. [[Hangul]], the Korean writing system, is actually strongly alphabetic while it may look logographic or syllabic to outsiders.

==Latin alphabet==
{{Main|Latin alphabet}}
Most [[orthographies]] that use the [[Latin alphabet|Latin writing system]] are imperfectly phonological and diverge from that ideal to a greater or lesser extent. This is because the ancient Romans designed the alphabet specifically for Latin. In the Middle Ages, it was adapted to the Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin, as well as to the Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and some Slavic languages, and finally to most of the languages of Europe.

===English orthography===

{{Main|English orthography}}
[[English orthography]] is based on the alphabetic principle, but the acquisition of sounds and spellings from a variety of languages has made English spelling patterns confusing. Spelling patterns usually follow certain conventions but nearly every sound can be legitimately spelled with different letters or letter combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Wren, Sebastian. Exception Words, Southwest Educational Development Laboratory. Retrieved from http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011183306/http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html |date=2007-10-11 }}, September 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the letters ''ee'' almost always represent {{IPA|/i/}}, but the sound can also be represented by the letter ''y'' or the letters ''ie''.

The spelling systems for some languages, such as [[Spanish orthography|Spanish]], are relatively simple because they adhere closely to the ideal one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them. In [[English orthography|English]] the spelling system is more complex and varies considerably in the degree to which it follows the stated pattern. There are several reasons for this, including: first, the alphabet has 26 letters, but the English language has 40 sounds that must be reflected in word spellings; second, English spelling began to be standardized in the 15th century, and most spellings have not been revised to reflect the long-term changes in pronunciation that are typical for all languages; and third, English frequently adopts foreign words without changing the spelling of those words.

==Role in beginning reading==
{{See also|Phonics|Whole Language}}
Learning the connection between written letters and spoken sounds has been viewed as a critical heuristic to word identification for decades. Understanding that there is a direct relationship between letters and sounds enables an emergent reader to decode the pronunciation of an unknown written word and associate it with a known spoken word. Typically, emergent readers identify the majority of unfamiliar printed words by sounding them out. Similarly, understanding the relationship of letters and sounds is also seen as a critical heuristic for learning to spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Juel | first1 = Connie | title = Handbook of Reading Research, II | chapter = 27 Beginning Reading | volume = 2 |pages=759–788 | editor = Rebecca Barr | editor2 = Michael L.

Two contrasting philosophies exist with regard to emergent readers learning to associate letters to speech sounds in English. Proponents of [[phonics]] argue that this relationship needs to be taught explicitly and to be learned to [[automaticity]], in order to facilitate the rapid word recognition upon which comprehension depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chall |first=Jeanne S. |authorlink=Jeanne Chall |date=1996 | edition=3rd |title=Learning to read: The great debate |url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/learning-to-read-the-great-debate/oclc/8974797/editions  | page= |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers |location=Fort Worth |access-date=2010-07-01 | quote= }} '''[See [[Talk: Alphabetic principle#Chall| Talk page]]&amp;zwj;]'''&lt;/ref&gt;   
Others, including advocates of [[Whole language|whole-language]] who hold that reading should be taught [[Holistic education|holistically]], assert that children can naturally intuit the relationship between letters and sounds.

&lt;!--Deleted text: The alphabetic principle is that, in such writing systems, each [[grapheme]] (contextually) represented a [[phoneme]] at the time and place of its [[orthography|orthographic]] inception or last change. ... , where one written word may have several readings and one spoken word may have several writings.

'''Anti-intellectualism''' is hostility to and mistrust of [[intellect]], [[intellectual]]s, and [[intellectualism]] commonly expressed as deprecation of [[education]] and [[philosophy]], and the dismissal of [[art]], [[literature]], and [[science]] as impractical and even contemptible human pursuits.&lt;ref name="Literature 1980 p. 27"&gt;''A Handbook to Literature'' (1980), Fourth Edition, C. Hugh Holman, Ed. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-intellectuals present themselves and are perceived as champions of common folk—[[populists]] against political and [[academic elitism]]—and tend to see educated people as a [[status class]] detached from the concerns of most people, and feel that intellectuals dominate political discourse and control [[higher education]].&lt;ref name="Literature 1980 p. 27"/&gt;

[[Totalitarian]] governments manipulate and apply anti-intellectualism to repress [[political dissent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Book of Communism|last=Courtois|first=Stephanie|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=601}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) and the following right-wing dictatorship (1939–1975) of General [[Francisco Franco]], the [[reactionary]] repression of the [[White Terror (Spain)|White Terror]] (1936–1945) was notably anti-intellectual, with most of the 200,000 civilians killed being the Spanish [[intelligentsia]], the politically active teachers and academics, artists and writers of the deposed [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1939).&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Wars'' (2007), Third Edition, pp. 517–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Communist]] state of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979), the [[Khmer Rouge]] régime of [[Pol Pot]] condemned most of the non-Communist intelligentsia to death in the [[Khmer Rouge Killing Fields|Killing Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woroni.com.au/articles/features/trial-khmer-rogue |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422004018/http://www.woroni.com.au/articles/features/trial-khmer-rogue |archivedate=2012-04-22 |title=Trial of the Khmer Rogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideological anti-intellectualism==
[[File:Blargos1.jpg|400px|thumb|In the "Night of the Long Batons" (29 July 1966), the federal police physically purged politically-incorrect academics, who opposed the right-wing military dictatorship of [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] (1966–70) in [[Argentina]], from five faculties of the University of Buenos Aires.]]
[[File:Flag of Democratic Kampuchea.svg|thumb|right|The cultural re-organization of Cambodian society, by the dictator [[Pol Pot]], created a government which tried to re-make its society anti-intellectual in what became known as [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979), a de-industrialized, agricultural country.]]

In the 20th century, some societies have systematically removed intellectuals from power, sometimes assassinating them, to expediently end public political dissent. During the [[Cold War]] (1945–1991), the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (1948–1990) ostracized the philosopher [[Václav Havel]] as a politically-unreliable man unworthy of ordinary Czechs' trust; the post-communist [[Velvet Revolution]] (17 Nov.–29 Dec. 1989) elected Havel president for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blisty.cz/video/Slavonic/havel.html|title=Václav Havel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the anti-communist Argentine [[military dictatorship]] of Gen. [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] (1966–70) intervened at the University of Buenos Aires with the [[La Noche de los Bastones Largos|Night of the Long Batons]] to physically dislodge politically-dangerous academics from five [[faculty (university)|university faculties]]. That expulsion to exile of the academic ''intelligentsia'' became a national [[brain drain]] upon the society and economy of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~dschugurensky/assignment1/1966uba.html Police repression at the Universidad de Buenos Aires] - [[University of Toronto]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elortiba.org/blargos.html La noche de los bastones largos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514124954/http://www.elortiba.org/blargos.html |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the military repression of free speech, biochemist [[César Milstein]] said, "Our country would be put in order, as soon as all the intellectuals who were meddling in the region were expelled." In Brazil, the government banished the educator [[Paulo Freire]] for being an ignorant man, said the organizers of the current ''coup d'état.''&lt;ref name="politicalaffairs1"&gt;[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/4771/1/238 Political Affairs Magazine - Power and the Intellectuals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003056/http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/4771/1/238 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ideology|Ideologically]]-extreme dictatorships who mean to recreate a society, such as the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia]] (1975–79), pre-emptively killed potential political opponents, especially the educated middle-class and the ''intelligentsia''. To realize the [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]] of Cambodian history, Khmer Rouge [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] restructured the economy by de-industrialization, and assassinated non-communist Cambodians suspected of "involvement in free-market activities", such as the urban professionals of society (physicians, attorneys, engineers, ''et al.'') and people with political connections to foreign governments. The [[Maoism|Maoist]] doctrine of [[Pol Pot]] identified the farmers as the true [[proletariat]] of Cambodia and the true representatives of the [[working class]] entitled to hold government power, hence the anti-intellectual purges.

Anti-intellectualism is not always violent, because any social group can act anti-intellectually and discount the [[Humanism|humanist]] value to their society of [[intellect]], [[intellectualism]], and [[higher education]]. In Uruguay, the writer [[Jorge Majfud]] said that "this contempt, that arises from a power installed in the social institutions, and from the inferiority complex of its actors, is not a property of 'underdeveloped' countries. In fact, it is always the critical intellectuals, writers, or artists who head the top-ten lists of 'The Most Stupid of the Stupid' in the country."&lt;ref name="politicalaffairs1"/&gt;

==Academic anti-intellectualism==
===United States===
In ''The Campus Wars'' (1971), the philosopher [[John Searle]] said that "the two most salient traits of the radical movement are its anti-intellectualism and its hostility to the university as an institution. ... Intellectuals, by definition, are people who take ideas seriously for their own sake. Whether or not a theory is true or false is important to them, independently of any practical applications it may have. [Intellectuals] have, as Richard Hofstadter has pointed out, an attitude to ideas that is at once playful and pious. But, in the radical movement, the intellectual ideal of knowledge for its own sake is rejected. Knowledge is seen as valuable only as a basis for action, and it is not even very valuable there. Far more important than what one knows is how one feels."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (1971). [http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/2.html The Campus Wars, Chapter 2: The Students], URL retrieved 14 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Social Sciences as Sorcery'' (1972), the sociologist [[Stanislav Andreski]] advised laymen to distrust the intellectuals' [[appeals to authority]] when they make questionable claims about resolving the problems of their society: "Do not be impressed by the imprint of a famous publishing house, or the volume of an author's publications. ... Remember that the publishers want to keep the printing presses busy, and do not object to nonsense if it can be sold."&lt;ref&gt;Stanislav Andreski, ''The Social Sciences as Sorcery''. 1972, The University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science and Relativism: Some Key Controversies in the Philosophy of Science'' (1990), the epistemologist [[Larry Laudan]] said that the prevailing type of philosophy taught at university in the U.S. ([[Postmodernism]] and [[Poststructuralism]]) is anti-intellectual, because "the displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter, by the idea that everything boils down to subjective interests and perspectives is — second only to American political campaigns  — the most prominent and pernicious manifestation of anti-intellectualism in our time."&lt;ref&gt;Larry Laudan, ''Science and Relativism: Some Key Controversies in the Philosophy of Science'' (1990), University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distrust of intellectuals===
In the U.S., the American conservative&lt;ref&gt;https://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/attheintersectionoffaithandculture/2011/08/black-and-conservative-a-look-at-thomas-sowell.html&lt;/ref&gt; economist [[Thomas Sowell]] argued for distinctions between unreasonable and reasonable wariness of intellectuals in their influence upon the institutions of a society. In defining intellectuals as "people whose occupations deal primarily with ideas", they are different from people whose work is the practical application of ideas. That cause for layman mistrust lies in the intellectuals' incompetence outside their fields of expertise. Although possessed of great working knowledge in their specialist fields, when compared to other professions and occupations, the intellectuals of a society face little discouragement against speaking authoritatively beyond their field of formal expertise, and thus are unlikely to face responsibility for the social and practical consequences of their errors. Hence, a physician is judged competent by the effective treatment of the sickness of a patient, yet might face a medical [[malpractice]] lawsuit should the treatment harm the patient. In contrast, a [[tenure]]d university professor is unlikely to be judged competent or incompetent by the effectiveness of his or her intellectualism (ideas), and thus not face responsibility for the social and practical consequences of the implementation of the ideas, e.g. the [[Chicago Boys]] and the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)]].

In the book ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'' (2009), Sowell said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By encouraging, or even requiring, students to take stands where they have neither the knowledge nor the intellectual training to seriously examine complex issues, teachers promote the expression of unsubstantiated opinions, the venting of uninformed emotions, and the habit of acting on those opinions and emotions, while ignoring or dismissing opposing views, without having either the intellectual equipment or the personal experience to weigh one view against another in any serious way.&lt;ref name="Sowell2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|title=Intellectuals and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r601nMi73RQC|accessdate=16 November 2013|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465019489}}{{pages needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence,  school teachers are part of the ''intelligentsia'' who recruit children in elementary school and teach them politics—to advocate for or to advocate against a public policy—as part of community-service projects; which political experience later assists them in earning admission to university. In that manner, the intellectuals of a society intervene and participate in social arenas of which they might not possess expert knowledge, and so unduly influence the formulation and realization of [[public policy]]. In the event, teaching political advocacy in elementary school encourages students to formulate opinions "without any intellectual training or prior knowledge of those issues, making constraints against falsity few or non-existent."&lt;ref&gt;Sowell (2009), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the anti-intellectualism of the writer [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] derived from his close examination of twentieth-century history, which revealed to him that intellectuals have continually championed disastrous public policies for [[social welfare]] and [[public education]], and warned the layman public to "beware [the] intellectuals. Not merely should they be kept well away from the levers of power, they should also be objects of suspicion when they seek to offer collective advice."&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=Intellectuals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTqHpZech0YC&amp;pg=PT1|accessdate=16 November 2013|date=2009-10-13|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061871474}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, "In the Land of the Rococo Marxists" (2000), the American writer [[Tom Wolfe]] characterized the intellectual as "a person knowledgeable in one field, who speaks out only in others."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Tom. (2000). "In the Land of the Rococo Marxists", ''Harper's Monthly'', June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[File:JohnCotton.jpg|right|thumb|300px|In the book ''The Powring Out of the Seven Vials'' (1642), the Protestant minister [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]] equated education and intellectualism with atheist service to the supernatural.]]
In ''The Powring Out of the Seven Vials'' (1642), the Puritan [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]] demonized intellectual men and women by noting that "the more learned and witty you bee, the more fit to act for [[Satan]] will you bee. ... Take off the fond doting ... upon the learning of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], and the glorie of the Episcopacy, and the brave estates of the Prelates. I say bee not deceived by these pompes, empty shewes, and faire representations of goodly condition before the eyes of flesh and blood, bee not taken with the applause of these persons."&lt;ref name="Hofstadter, Richard 1962 p.46"&gt;Hofstadter, Richard ''Anti-intellectualism in American Life'' (1962), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, not every [[Puritan]] concurred with Cotton's religious contempt for [[Secularism|secular]] education, some, such as [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], founded a university.

In ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice'' (2001), the economist Thomas Sowell said that anti-intellectualism in the U.S. began in the early Colonial era, as an understandable wariness of the educated upper-classes, because the country mostly was built by people who had fled political and religious persecution by the social system of the educated upper classes. Moreover, there were few intellectuals who possessed the practical hands-on skills required to survive in the New World of North America, which absence from society lead to a deep-rooted, [[Populism|populist]] suspicion of men and women who specialize in "verbal virtuosity", rather than tangible, measurable products and services:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From its colonial beginnings, American society was a "decapitated" society—largely lacking the top-most social layers of European society. The highest elites and the titled aristocracies had little reason to risk their lives crossing the Atlantic, and then face the perils of pioneering. Most of the white population of colonial America arrived as [[indentured servant]]s and the black population as [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]. Later waves of immigrants were disproportionately [[peasant]]s and [[proletarian]]s, even when they came from Western Europe ... The rise of American society to pre-eminence, as an economic, political, and military power, was thus the triumph of the common man, and a slap across the face to the presumptions of the arrogant, whether an elite of blood or books.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas. (2001) ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice''. Simon and Schuster, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-1507-7}}, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century===
In U.S. history, the advocacy and acceptability of anti-intellectualism varied, because in the 19th century most people lived a [[rural]] life of [[manual labour]] and agricultural work, therefore, an academic education in the Græco–Roman classics, was perceived as of impractical value; the bookish man is unprofitable. Yet, in general, Americans were a [[literacy|literate]] people who read [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] for intellectual pleasure and the Christian Bible for emotional succor; thus, the ideal American Man was a literate and technically-skilled man who was successful in his [[trade]], ergo a productive member of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinovskis|first=Maris|year=1992|title=Schooling and Poor Children in 19th-Century America|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=35|pages=313–331|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764292035003008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, the ideal American was the self-made man whose knowledge derived from life-experience, not an intellectual man whose knowledge of the real world derived from books, formal education, and academic study; thus, the justified anti-intellectualism reported in ''The New Purchase, or Seven and a Half Years in the Far West'' (1843), the Rev. Bayard R. Hall, A.M., said about frontier Indiana:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We always preferred an ignorant, bad man to a talented one, and, hence, attempts were usually made to ruin the [[morality|moral]] character of a smart candidate; since, unhappily, [[Intellectual giftedness|smartness]] and wickedness were supposed to be generally coupled, and [like-wise] incompetence and goodness.&lt;ref name="Hofstadter, Richard 1962 p.46"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet, in the society of the U.S., the "real-life" redemption of the [[egghead]] intellectual was possible if he embraced the [[mores]] of mainstream society; thus, in the fiction of [[O. Henry]], a character noted that once an East Coast university graduate "gets over" his intellectual vanity—he no longer thinks himself better than other men—he makes just as good a [[cowboy]] as any other young man, despite his common-man counterpart being the slow-witted naïf of good heart, a pop culture [[stereotype]] from stage shows.

=== 20th/21st centuries ===
Political polarization in the U.S. favoured the use of anti-intellectualism by each political party (Republican and Democratic) to undermine the credibility of the other party with the [[middle class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/|title=7 Things to Know about Polarization in America|date=2014-06-12|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Anti-Intellectualism in American Life]]'' (1963) the historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] said that anti-intellectualism is a social-class response, by the middle-class "mob", against the privileges of the political élites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Life|last=Hofstadter|first=Richard|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1963|isbn=0394415353|location=United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the middle class developed political power, they exercised their belief that the ideal candidate to office was the "self-made man", not the well-educated man born to wealth. The self-made man, from the middle class,  could be trusted to act in the best interest of his fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815|last=Wood|first=Gordon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0199832463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Americans and Chinese: Passages to Differences'' (1980), Francis Hsu said that American [[egalitarianism]] is stronger in the U.S. than in Europe, e.g. in England,

&lt;blockquote&gt;English individualism developed hand in hand with legal equality. American self-reliance, on the other hand, has been inseparable from an insistence upon economic and social as well as political equality. The result is that a qualified individualism, with a qualified equality, has prevailed in England, but what has been considered the unalienable right of every American is unrestricted self-reliance and, at least ideally, unrestricted equality. The English, therefore, tend to respect class-based distinctions in birth, wealth, status, manners, and speech, while Americans resent them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Americans and Chinese: Passages to Differences|last=Hsu|first=Francis|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1980|isbn=082480757X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such social resentment characterises contemporary political discussions about the socio-political functions of mass-communication media and science; that is, scientific facts, generally accepted by educated people throughout the world, are misrepresented as opinions in the U.S., specifically about [[climate science]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/|title=Global Concern about Climate Change, Broad Support for Limiting Emissions|last=Stokes|first=Bruce|last2=Wike|first2=Richard|date=2015-11-05|website=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2017-03-01|last3=Carle|first3=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the New Jersey governor, Woodrow Wilson, described the battles of anti-intellectualism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What I fear is a government of experts. God forbid that, in a democratic country, we should resign the task and give the government over to experts. What are we for if we are to be scientifically taken care of by a small number of gentlemen who are the only men who understand the job?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction: The Tension between Science and Politics|last=Dreger|first=Jonas|publisher=Palgrave Macmillian UK|year=2014|isbn=978-1-349-47918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Miami University anthropology professor H. Sidky has argued that 21st-century anti-scientific and pseudoscientific approaches to knowledge, particularly in the United States, are rooted in a postmodernist "decades-long academic assault on science:" "Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders, policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of city councils and school boards.

==== Corporate mass media ====
The reportage of corporate mass-communications media appealed to societal anti-intellectualism by misrepresenting university life in the U.S., where the students' pursuit of book learning (intellectualism) was secondary to the after-school social life. That the [[reactionary]] ideology communicated in mass-media reportage misrepresented the liberal political activism and social protest of students as frivolous, social activities thematically unrelated to the academic curriculum, which is the purpose of attending university.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Anti-intellectualism in American Media'' (2004), Dane Clausen identified the contemporary anti-intellectualist bent of [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured consent]] that is inherent to commodified information:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The effects of mass media on attitudes toward intellect are certainly multiple and ambiguous. On the one hand, mass communications greatly expand the sheer volume of information available for public consumption. On the other hand, much of this information comes pre-interpreted for easy digestion and laden with hidden assumption, saving consumers the work of having to [[Critical thinking|interpret it]] for themselves. Commodified information naturally tends to reflect the assumptions and interests of those who produce it, and its producers are not driven entirely by a passion to promote critical reflection.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rigney|first=Daniel|year=1991|title=Three kinds of Anti-intellectualism: Rethinking Hofstadter|url=|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=61|pages=431–451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The editorial perspective of the corporate mass-media misrepresented intellectualism as a profession that is separate and apart from the jobs and occupations of regular folk. In presenting academically successful students as social failures, an undesirable social status for the average young man and young woman, corporate media established to the U.S. mainstream their opinion that the intellectualism of book-learning is a form of mental deviancy, thus, most people would shun intellectuals as friends, lest they risk social ridicule and ostracism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the popular acceptance of anti-intellectualism lead to populist rejection of the ''intelligentsia'' for resolving the problems of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claussen|first=Danes|year=|title=A Brief History of Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|url=|journal=Academe|volume=97|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the book ''Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over Brainpower in American Culture'' (2013), Aaron Lecklider indicated that the contemporary ideological dismissal of the ''intelligentsia'' derived from the corporate media's reactionary misrepresentations of intellectual men and women as lacking the common-sense of regular folk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over Brainpower in American Culture|last=Lecklider|first=Aaron|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Confirmation bias====
In the field of psychology, [[confirmation bias]] is the mental phenomenon that confirms the validity of a person's self-accepted beliefs, [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, and [[Value system|values]], to create emotional hostility (anti-intellectualism) towards and mistrust of other beliefs, ideals, and value systems to which the anti-intellectual person has not been exposed; thus, confirmation bias is a symptom of anti-intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias|title=What Is Confirmation Bias?|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[Isaac Asimov]], speaking of this, said that "There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://progresoweekly.us/cult-ignorance-u-s-anti-intellectualism-dumbing-america/|title=The cult of ignorance in the U.S.: Anti intellectualism and the 'dumbing down' of America - Progreso Weekly|date=2016-05-29|work=Progreso Weekly|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==

===Communism===
In the first decade after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Bolshevik]]s suspected the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] [[intelligentsia]] as potentially traitorous of the [[proletariat]], thus, the initial [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government comprised men and women without much formal education.  Moreover, the deposed propertied classes were termed ''[[Lishentsy]]'' ("the disenfranchised"), whose children were excluded from education; eventually, some 200 Tsarist intellectuals such as writers, philosophers, scientists, and engineers were deported to Germany on [[Philosophers' ships]] in 1922; others were deported to [[Latvia]] and to [[Turkey]] in 1923.

During the [[revolution]]ary period, the pragmatic Bolsheviks employed "bourgeois experts" to manage the economy, industry, and agriculture, and so learn from them. After the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–22), to achieve socialism, the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] (1922–91) emphasised literacy and education in service to modernising the country via an educated [[working class]] [[intelligentsia]], rather than an [[Ivory Tower]] intelligentsia. During the 1930s and the 1950s, [[Joseph Stalin]] replaced Lenin's intelligentsia with a "communist" intelligentsia, loyal to him and with a specifically Soviet world view, thereby producing the [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] theories of [[Lysenkoism]] and [[Japhetic theory]].

===Fascism===
[[File:Giovanni Gentile.png|thumb|right|Active philosopher: [[Giovanni Gentile]], intellectual father of [[Italian Fascism]].]]

The [[Actual Idealism|idealist]] philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] established the intellectual basis of [[Fascism|Fascist]] ideology with the ''autoctisi'' (self-realisation) via concrete thinking that distinguished between the good (active) intellectual and the bad (passive) intellectual:

{{quote|Fascism combats ... not intelligence, but intellectualism... which is... a sickness of the intellect... not a consequence of its abuse, because the intellect cannot be used too much... it derives from the false belief that one can segregate oneself from life.|Giovanni Gentile|addressing a Congress of Fascist Culture, Bologna, 30 March 1925}}

To counter the "passive intellectual" who used his or her intellect abstractly, and therefore was "decadent", he proposed the "concrete thinking" of the active intellectual who applied intellect as [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]—a "man of action", like Fascist [[Benito Mussolini]], versus the decadent [[Communism|Communist]] [[intellectual]] [[Antonio Gramsci]]. The passive intellectual stagnates intellect by objectifying ideas, thus establishing them as objects. Hence the [[Fascism|Fascist]] rejection of materialist [[logic]], because it relies upon ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles improperly counter-changed with ''a posteriori'' ones that are irrelevant to the matter-in-hand in deciding whether or not to act.

In the praxis of Gentile's concrete thinking criteria, such consideration of the ''a priori'' toward the properly ''a posteriori'' constitutes ''impractical'', decadent intellectualism. Moreover, this fascist philosophy occurred parallel to [[Actual Idealism]], his philosophic system; he opposed [[intellectualism]] for its being disconnected from the active intelligence that gets things done, i.e. thought is killed when its constituent parts are labelled, and thus rendered as discrete entities.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Giovanni, ''Origins and Doctrine of Fascism (with selections from other works)'', A. James Gregor, ed., pp. 22–23, 33, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Guide to Philosophy'' (2005), Ted Honderich, ed., p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to this, is the confrontation between the Spanish [[Franquism|franquist]] General, [[José Millán Astray#Confrontation with Unamuno|Millán Astray]], and the writer [[Miguel de Unamuno]] during the ''[[Dia de la Raza]]'' celebration at the [[University of Salamanca]], in 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The General exclaimed: ''¡Muera la inteligencia! ¡Viva la Muerte!'' ("Death to intelligence! Long live death!"); the Falangists applauded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==In Asia==

===China===
====Imperial China====
[[Qin Shi Huang]] (246–210 BC), the first Emperor of unified China, consolidated political thought, and power, by suppressing [[freedom of speech]] at the suggestion of Chancellor [[Li Si]], who justified such anti-intellectualism by accusing the [[intelligentsia]] of falsely praising the emperor, and of dissenting through libel. From 213 to 206 BC, it was generally thought that the works of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were incinerated, especially the ''Shi Jing'' ([[Classic of Poetry]], c. 1000 BC) and the ''Shujing'' ([[Classic of History]], c. 6th century BC). The exceptions were books by Qin historians, and books of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], an early type of [[totalitarianism]]—and the Chancellor's philosophic school (see the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars]]).
However, upon further inspection of Chinese historical annals such as the Shi Ji and the Han Shu, this was found not to be the case. The Qin Empire privately kept one copy of each of these books in the Imperial Library but it publicly ordered that the books should be banned. Those who owned copies were ordered to surrender the books to be burned; those who refused were executed.  This eventually led to the loss of most ancient works of literature and philosophy when [[Xiang Yu]] burned down the Qin palace in 208BC.

====People's Republic of China====

The [[Cultural Revolution]] was a politically violent decade (1966–76) of wide-ranging [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] by its leader Chairman [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]. After several national policy crises, Mao, to regain public prestige and control of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), on 16 May 1966, announced that the Party and Chinese society were permeated with liberal bourgeois elements who meant to restore [[capitalism]] to China, and that said people could only be removed with [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism|post–revolutionary class struggle]]. To that effect, China's youth nationally organised into [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]], hunting the liberal bourgeois elements subverting the CCP and Chinese society. The Red Guards acted nationally, purging the country, the military, urban workers, and the leaders of the CCP. The Red Guards were particularly aggressive in attacking their teachers and professors, causing most schools and universities to be shut down once the Cultural Revolution began.  Three years later, in 1969, Mao declared the Cultural Revolution ended; yet the political intrigues continued until 1976, concluding with the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]], the ''de facto'' end of the Cultural Revolution.

===Democratic Kampuchea===
When the Communist Party of Cambodia, the [[Khmer Rouge]] (1951–81), established their regime as [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979) in [[Cambodia]], their anti-intellectualism which idealised the country and demonised the cities was immediately imposed on the country in order to establish [[agrarian socialism]], thus, they emptied cities in order to purge the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] nation of every [[treason|traitor]], [[enemy of the state]], and [[intellectual]], often symbolised by eyeglasses (see the [[Killing Fields]]).

===Ottoman Empire===
[[File:April24Victims.jpg|thumbnail|Some of the Armenian intellectuals who were detained, deported, and killed in the Armenian Genocide of 1915]]
In the early stages of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, around 2,300 Armenian intellectuals were [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|deported]] from Constantinople (Istanbul) and subsequently mostly murdered by the Ottoman government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dadrian|first=Vahakn N.|authorlink=Vahakn Dadrian|title=The history of the Armenian genocide: ethnic conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57181-666-6|page=221|edition=6th rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been described by historians as a [[decapitation strike]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blinka|first=David S.|title=Re-creating Armenia: America and the memory of the Armenian genocide|date=2008|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|page=31|quote=In what scholars commonly refer to as the decapitation strike on April 24, 1915...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloxham|first1=Donald|authorlink1=Donald Bloxham|title=The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=70|quote=...the decapitation of the Armenian nation with the series of mass arrests that began on 24 April...}}&lt;/ref&gt; which intended to deprive the Armenian population of an intellectual leadership and a chance of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahаkian|first=T.

'''Biological determinism of human gender roles''' is the view that human sexuality is [[genetic determinism|controlled by an individual's genes]] or some component of their [[physiology]]. This is an aspect of [[biological determinism]], the wider view that human behaviour is determined by biological factors. Both views regard the contribution of learning and other environmental factors in a person's development as being over-stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Taylor A. | editor-first1 = Verta | editor-last2 = Rupp | editor-first2 = Leila J. | editor-last3 = Whittier | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Feminist frontiers | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o6WMkQEACAAJ | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2012 | edition = 9th | isbn = 9780078026621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Naiman | first = Joanne | title = How societies work: class, power, and change | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=diypPAAACAAJ | publisher = Fernwood Publishing | location = Halifax, Winnipeg | year = 2012 | edition = 5th | isbn = 9781552664810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of human gender roles==

===Gender assignment===
Lynda Birke's ''In Pursuit of Difference'' argues that the discipline of human biology often presents "clear-cut differences"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Birke | first = Lynda | chapter = In pursuit of difference: scientific studies of women and men | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KgcpAAAAYAAJ | title = Feminism and the biological body | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780813528236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between sexes with regards to chromosomes, genetics, and inheritance. However, while obvious physical differences between males and females exist and develop during puberty, hormonal differences are "not absolute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality | work = [[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]|publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] | location = Australia|date=3 June 2015|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a broad range of reproductive anatomy that doesn't necessarily fit the "gender definition" of male or female. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "a person may be born with mosaic genetics", differing in their chromosomal configuration.&lt;ref name="isna.org"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Home page | url = http://www.isna.org | website = isna.org | publisher = [[Intersex Society of North America]] |access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{main|Biology and sexual orientation|Neuroscience and sexual orientation}}

Though scientists are unsure as to whether [[homosexuality]] can be attributed to biological or social factors, [[LGBT]] rights activists have used the theories of biological determinism to support their cause. This has become a frequent point of dissension between [[pro-gay]] individuals and [[anti-gay]] individuals. Due to the fact that a single cause has not been determined as the cause of homosexuality, many scholars theorize that a combination of biological and social causes determine one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Abramson | first1 = Paul R. | last2 = Pinkerton | first2 = Steven D. | author-link1 = Paul R. Abramson | chapter = Introduction: Nature, nurture, and in-between | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5SUFxfft7zMC&amp;pg=PA4 | title = Sexual nature, sexual culture | page = 4 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780226001821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gay rights advocates]] believe that proving that homosexuality has a definite biological basis will prove it to be an unchangeable characteristic, thus allowing homosexuals to be protected under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brookey | first = Robert Alan | title = Bio-rhetoric, background beliefs and the biology of homosexuality | journal = [[Argumentation and Advocacy]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 171&amp;ndash;183 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00028533.2001.11951668 | date = 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/00028533.2001.11951668 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area of research that has been a valuable tool for gay rights activists has been [[Dean Hamer]]'s work studying the "[[Biology and sexual orientation#Chromosome linkage studies|gay gene]]". Another researcher who worked with Hamer in finding evidence for biological influence in male homosexuality was [[Simon LeVay]], a neuroscientist. In 1991, LeVay published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that detailed the difference in [[hypothalamic structure]]s between homosexual and heterosexual men. His findings in studying the [[INAH 3|INAH-3]] implied that "sexual orientation has a biological substrate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spanier | first = Bonnie | title = Biological determinism and homosexuality | journal = [[NWSA Journal]], special issue: Sexual Orientation | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | date = Spring 1995 | jstor = 4316378 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his research showed that there was a biological basis in sexual orientation, LeVay cautioned against people interpreting his article to say that he found that homosexuality is genetic, emphasizing that he did not "locate a gay center in the brain—[as] INAH3 is less likely to be the sole gay nucleus of the brain than part of a chain of nuclei engaged in men and women's sexual behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nimmons|first=David|title=Sex and the brain|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/sexandthebrain346/?searchterm=levay#.UpLnSGRDuqw|work=[[Discover Magazine]]|date=March 1994 | access-date =9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He merely hoped that his work would serve as a catalyst in working towards finding more evidence that homosexuality is at least partly genetic.

===Social construction===
{{main|Social construction of gender}}
{{POV check|section|date=April 2017|talk=Social construction}}

[[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]], and [[Leon Kamin]] were interested in the way that biological determinism was present in science. They wanted to figure out how much of it was true, and how much of it was socially constructed according to certain beliefs and societal norms and determined gender roles within society. In their book ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' they explore the possibilities of biological determinism. In their studies, they found some very interesting evidence that points to the fact that biological determinism in science is actually greatly affected by certain norms and tendencies within society. According to them, biological determinism is more constructed by society than by anything else. In a study that was performed on girls who were relatively "[[masculinity|masculinized]]", biological determinists [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] looked for ways to describe femininity that fit into the common definition of it, such as clothing preference or using makeup. Although these scientists believed that they were providing evidence to support their definitions of femininity within nature, they fell into the trap of labeling these girls according to Western social standards. As Lewontin points out, this experiment not only embraces the stereotypes that already existed, but it also "ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The determined patriarchy | chapterurl = https://athens.indymedia.org/media/upload/2016/09/06/Steven_Rose_Richard_Lewontin_Leon_J._Kamin-Not_In_Our_Genes__Biology_Ideology_and_Human_Nature__-Penguin_Books_Ltd_1990.pdf | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = Richard C. | last2 = Rose | first2 = Steven | last3 = Kamin | first3 = Leon J. | author-link1 = Richard Lewontin | title = Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature | pages = 132&amp;ndash;163 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 9780140226058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin realize that biological determinism is clouded and, can in fact, be shaped according to the standards and norms of the society one lives in. Therefore, they choose to take a different approach. They decide to look at numbers and statistics instead of simple social experiments which can be easily misinterpreted. When they look at the numbers and statistics of men and women over the years, they discover that the differences between men and women are no longer as pronounced as they had been in the past. All of a sudden, there are more women in the work place holding higher ranking jobs. More women are excelling in areas that used to be male dominant, such as sports. And, even biologically, women are beginning to catch up to men in height while men are beginning to catch up in life expectancy. However, these changes are mostly visible in numbers and statistics, and social differences between men and women are still easily observed. Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin argue, however, that these differences are imposed by society itself.

The [[Anne Fausto-Sterling#The Standard Model|standard model]] for the difference between sex/gender states that there is a clear-cut dichotomy between males &amp; females, with no overlap. [[Margaret W. Rossiter]]’s article “Women’s Work in Science” discusses how in the 1880s women were introduced to the science field and hired, but although employed they were still segregated from men in the science field.&lt;ref name="Rossiter"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rossiter | first = Margaret W. | title = "Women's Work" in Science, 1880-1910 | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 381&amp;ndash;398 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.2307/230118 | jstor = 230118 | date = September 1980 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/230118 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rossiter, segregation started because it was apparent that men and women worked differently and had different "talents" to offer in the field of science.&lt;ref name="Rossiter" /&gt; To add to this, women in the 1880s got paid less than the male worker in the science field. Women got paid an average of "two hundred dollars less" than their male coworkers yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jardins | first = Julie | chapter = To embrace or decline marriage and family: Annie Jump Cannon and the women of the Harvard Observatory, 1880-1940 | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HULGDNDSenYC&amp;pg=PA92 | title = The Madame Curie complex: the hidden history of women in science | page = 92 | publisher = Feminist Press at the City University of New York | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781558616134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this norm there is a historically constructed viewpoint of "average", meaning that society holds the idea that one must be either male or female, feminine or masculine. [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s article "''[[Sexing the Body|Of Gender and Genitals]]''" discusses how this standard model shapes doctors' ideas about gender and what is socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fausto-Sterling | first = Anne | author-link = Anne Fausto-Sterling | chapter = Of gender and genitals: the use and abuse of the modern intersexual | chapterurl = https://libcom.org/files/Fausto-Sterling%20-%20Sexing%20the%20Body.pdf | title = Sexing the body | pages = 44&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 9780465077144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that (according to the standard model) "Bodies in the "normal" range are culturally intelligible as males or females, but the rules for living as male or female are strict", meaning that people are culturally "trained" in believing that there is a sexual binary and anything outside of those confines is rejected.

'''Schönburg Castle''' is in the municipality of Schönburg 4.5 kilometers east of [[Naumburg]] at the heart of [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. 

[[File:Schönburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Schönburg Castle in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany]]

== Location ==
The Late Romanesque ruins of Schönburg Castle are on top of a mottled sandstone cliff by the [[Saale]] River, which is 40 metres high and declines sharply in the west. The castle was built with the local mottled [[sandstone]].

== History ==
The castle on top of the southern slopes of the Saale was erected as the most important castle in the 12th century on commission by the [[bishops]] of Naumburg. The bishops owned several castles within their territory to secure their assets. From 1158 at the latest, a free [[noble family]] that owned property around [[Naumburg]] named itself after the castle. It was first documented in 1137. Schönburg has been preserved to this day and is an example from the time of classical [[castle]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte der Schönburg, Burgenlandkreis.

''In:'' Castles and palaces in Saxony-Anhalt.|page=15-79|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=2003|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
All the walls, gates and parts of the [[Palas]] have retained their original substance from the High Middle Ages, as have parts of the interior like visible [[chimneys]] dated to 1220 and decorated windows. The [[architecture]] and decorations found here correspond to other monuments in the World Heritage nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Schönburg. Bischofsburg zu Naumburg.

== World Heritage Nomination ==
Schönburg Castle is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape “[[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]”. As a landmark the castle is an important part of the lines of sight connecting the [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9836">In 2008 [[Club de Madrid|the Club of Madrid]], the [[Bellona Foundation]] and the utility company [[Hafslund ASA]] joined forces to organize the top level climate conference in Norway called [[#CC8]] (Climate Conference 08: Technology and Finance in Climate Cooperation). In 2009 the same organizers are arranging '''CC9''' (Climate Conference 09: Green Technology and Finance – Striking a Fair Climate Deal) which will take place on 4 and 5 June at Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg, Norway. It will be followed by a climate festival for children in the adjacent park on 6 June.

== Climate Conference 09 ==

The objective of CC9 is to contribute to the conclusion of a fair climate agreement by advancing the potential of [[green technology]] and adequate funding. Investing in the development and diffusion of green technologies and renewable energy is a sustainable way to stimulate the economy and create new jobs - sustainable economic growth that can reinforce efforts to [[Climate change mitigation|combat climate change]] while respecting development needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CC9 | url=http://www.cc9.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1599 | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615080910/http://www.cc9.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1599# | archive-date=2009-06-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prestigious names to the conference ===

[[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|His Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Haakon of Norway]] will open the Conference. 

Among those who will be speaking at CC9 is [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bellona Web | url=http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/kennedyToAttendConferenceInNorway | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613074513/http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/kennedyToAttendConferenceInNorway# | archive-date=2009-06-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who has made a name for himself as a clear-headed and dynamic advocate for the environment. Kennedy founded and now chairs the [[Waterkeeper Alliance]], an organization working to improve water quality in the US and elsewhere in the world. In his work as a lawyer, Kennedy handles cases for the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]]  (NRDC), one of the largest environmental organizations in the US. The NRDC is known as a solution-oriented and competent player in the environmental field. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the first member of the [[Kennedy family]] to visit Norway.

In addition to Mr. Kennedy, many other prestigious names will be participating at CC9, including Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]], Norwegian Minister of the Environment and International Development [[Erik Solheim]] and [[Stephen O. Andersen]], director of Strategic Climate Projects in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

[[Stephen O. Andersen]] is a senior, renowned environmental expert, working for the EPA, the closest equivalent the USA has to a Ministry of the Environment. Mr. Andersen has been a key player in the work on the Montreal Protocol, an exceptionally successful international environmental treaty that negotiated the elimination of ozone-depleting gases and effectively saved the ozone layer. Andersen is the EPA's director of strategic projects, in the Climate Protection Partnerships Division.

Also from the USA comes [[Ira Magaziner]], head of the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Clinton Climate Initiative | url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/what-we-do/clinton-climate-initiative/ | accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI forms part of the William J. Clinton Foundation (founded by former US president Bill Clinton). The foundation's work includes efforts to cut the costs of climate technology (for renewable energy and energy efficiency) in large cities.

Representing the African continent are the former president of Tanzania, [[Benjamin Mkapa]], and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Niger [[Aïchatou Mindaoudou]]. Mindaoudou is a well-known figure in the field of international development, and she will be giving a speech at CC9 entitled "What is at stake for women and the planet - climate change and sustainable development in Africa. Business models for poverty alleviation and green growth".

A number of participants from Asia and Europe will also be present at the climate conference.

== Climate Conference 08 ==

Starting out on World Environment Day, the conference gathered 100 exclusively selected international representatives from politics, academia, the private sector and the environmental movement at the Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg south of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CC8 | url=http://www.cc8.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1416&amp;site=conferance | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620184329/http://www.cc8.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1416&amp;site=conferance# | archive-date=2011-06-20 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the distinguished speakers were: Ricardo Lagos, former president of Chile, UN Special Envoy on climate change and president of the Club of Madrid; Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the notable report on the economic ramifications of climate change; Göran Persson, former Prime Minister of Sweden who, together with Ricardo Lagos, co-chairs the International Socialist Commission for a Sustainable World Society  Also attending from the Club of Madrid was Jennifer Mary Shipley, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Kjell Magne Bondevik and Gro Harlem Brundtland, both former Prime Ministers of Norway. The Club of Madrid, the Bellona Foundation and Hafslund ASA set out to organize an ambitious, pro-development, creative and solutions-oriented conference which could act in a joint effort to provide input for the international negotiation process on a new climate agreement.

Negotiations for a post-2012 global climate change agreement were formally launched at the climate summit in Bali last December and are expected to be concluded in Copenhagen in 2009. With this process underway, the Club of Madrid, the Bellona Foundation and Hafslund ASA joined forces to spur ideas for a final agreement that will be both ambitious and realistic, as well as providing predictability in efforts to combat climate change.

Thorough discussions in small working groups enabled the drafting of ambitious, creative and solutions-oriented recommendations in a final statement from the conference. In order to inform the post-2012 negotiations, the aim will be to reach out to both negotiators and policy makers and industry and the business community.

At the Bali summit, it was agreed to concentrate the negotiations on mitigation, adaptation, technology and finance. The CC8 conference «Technology and Finance in Climate Cooperation» focuses specifically on what technology and finance provisions a new agreement on climate change should include.

The co-organizers are convinced that successful outcomes in these fields will be essential to enable ambitious overall emission reduction targets (the overall objective of an agreement) and solve the contradiction between, on the one hand, rich countries’ responsibility for climate change and, on the other hand, the necessity to limit emissions also of emerging economies.

=== Climate Concert ===

Saturday 7 June the marathon "Climate Concert 08" was arranged in the park surrounding the Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg. Well-known Norwegian bands were on stage. The environmental issues from the Climate Conference 08 coloured all parts of the arrangement; the food served, transportation and power supply.

The artists performing on Climate Conference 08, were [[Bertine Zetlitz]], [[Surferosa]], [[deLillos 85|deLillos'85]], [[Henning Kvitnes]], [[Kaizers Orchestra]], [[Madcon]], [[CC Cowboys]] and [[Ida Maria]].

== Background ==

Against the backdrop of an unprecedented global economic crisis, the next months will be decisive for reaching a politically viable and fair post-2012 climate agreement in Copenhagen 2009.

Few players inside negotiation circles expect developing countries to make significant moves before developed countries have clarified their positions on emission reductions, financing and diffusion of green technology.

Copenhagen must deliver on the human dimension of climate change. It is clear that the poorest, those least responsible, will be most vulnerable to climate change. Countries that have accumulated tremendous economic growth through their historic reliance on fossil fuels must assume a leadership role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Likewise, it will be critical to secure the development and diffusion of appropriate, clean technology and the access to necessary financial resources for developing countries to adopt them.

The global crisis constitutes a tremendous opportunity for governments to address the weaknesses of the existing, international financial system but, more importantly, to lay the foundations for the development of a green and sustainable economy. Investing in clean technologies can be key to this process, creating employment opportunities across the globe while addressing the challenge of climate change. In this sense, the adoption of sectoral approaches within the negotiations could, in fact, facilitate technology development and the adoption of best available technologies across regions, between developed and developing countries.

The '''Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics''' ('''CITA''') is a national [[research institute]] funded by the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]], located at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. CITA's mission is "to foster interaction within the Canadian theoretical [[Astrophysics]] community and to serve as an international center of excellence for theoretical studies in astrophysics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/reports/annrep/AnnRep01/|title = CITA Annual Report 2001|publisher = Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CITA was incorporated in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nserc.gc.ca/programs/real2000/submissions/gsc17a_e.htm|title = Reallocations Exercise: 2000-2002|publisher = National Science and Engineering Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CITA has close administrative and academic relations with the [[Canadian Institute for Advanced Research]] (CIFAR); several CITA faculty also serve as members of CIFAR.

==History==
The concept of a nationally-supported institute for theoretical astrophysics dates back to discussions within the [[Canadian Astronomical Society]] in the early 1980s. A series of committees advocated a model of a university‑based institute governed by a council of Canadian astrophysicists.  Proposals were solicited from universities across the country to host this institute, which by now had been named the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics/Institut Canadien d'astrophysique theorique (CITA/ICAT). The [[University of Toronto]] won the resulting spirited competition, and CITA ([[University of Toronto]]) was established as an institute within the School of Graduate Studies in June 1984, with staff consisting of a single professor ([[Peter G. Martin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/news/cita_professor_peter_martin_elected_to_royal_society_of_canada|title = CITA Professor Peter Martin Elected to Royal Society of Canada|publisher = Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120722053248/http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/news/cita_professor_peter_martin_elected_to_royal_society_of_canada|archivedate = 2012-07-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the Acting Director and a visiting professor from [[Queen's University]] (Richard Henriksen) and a temporary administrative assistant.  Today there are 7 faculty members two of which are [[Canada Research Chairs]], two administrative staff, a Systems Manager and technical computing staff.

At the same time, Professor [[Richard Henriksen]] worked on establishing CITA, Inc. (a separate entity from CITA the institute at the University of Toronto) as an incorporated national institute and charity governed by an elected Council of Canadian astrophysics/relativity professors to promote research in theoretical astrophysics across the country.  CITA Council is selected from CITA Inc members.  There are presently 55 members of CITA, Inc.

CITA's research activities are supported by the [[University of Toronto]], [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|NSERC]], multiple grants by the Ontario and Federal governments, as well as private sponsors including the [[Simons Foundation]] and [[CIFAR]].

==Membership==
CITA has a small number of long-term faculty members, and a larger number of short term (3- or 5-year) postdoctoral positions, as well as an active visitor program; the purpose of the relatively high influx of new researchers or visitors is to ensure that timely topics are well represented at CITA.  There are currently approximately 20 postdoctoral researchers at CITA, and 4 full-time administrative and computer staff.  Several graduate students in the [[University of Toronto]] Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics or Department of Physics work with CITA researchers throughout their graduate work, and typically ten undergraduates come to CITA to work over the summer.

In 1985, Scott D. Tremaine came to CITA as its first Director; Margaret Fukunaga was hired as the permanent Business Officer and Richard Bond arrived as the second faculty member.  [[J. Richard Bond|Richard Bond]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/nsae-wca031407.php|title = World-leading cosmologist at University of Toronto wins Canada's most prestigious science prize|publisher = EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the Director in 1996 and Norman Murray was director 2006-2016.

Since 1984, the directors of the institute have been as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13575">'''Centuriation''' (in Latin ''centuriatio'' or, more usually, ''limitatio''&lt;ref&gt;O. A. W. Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 134, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as '''Roman grid''', was a method of land measurement used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In many cases land divisions based on the survey formed a [[field system]], often referred to in modern times by the same name. According to [[O. A. W. Dilke]],&lt;ref&gt;O.A.W.Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 34, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; centuriation combined and developed features of land surveying present in Egypt, Etruria, Greek towns and Greek countryside.

Centuriation is characterised by the regular layout of a square [[grid plan|grid]] traced using [[Surveying|surveyors']] instruments. It may appear in the form of [[Roman roads|roads]], canals and agricultural plots. In some cases these plots, when formed, were allocated to [[Roman army]] veterans in a new [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], but they might also be returned to the indigenous inhabitants, as at Orange (France).&lt;ref&gt;A. Piganiol, ''Les documents cadastraux de la colonie romaine d'Orange'', XVIe supplément à ''Gallia'', Paris, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of centuriation is very important for reconstructing [[landscape history]] in many former areas of the [[Roman empire]].

==History==
The Romans began to use centuriation for the foundation, in the fourth century BCE, of new [[Roman colony|colonies]] in the ''ager Sabinus'', northeast of Rome. The development of the geometric and operational characteristics that were to become standard came with the founding of the Roman colonies in the [[Po valley]], starting with ''Ariminum'' ([[Rimini]]) in 268 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''Studi di storia romana e di diritto'', p. 415, 2001, {{ISBN|88-87114-70-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian law introduced by [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE, which included the privatisation of the ''[[ager publicus]]'', gave a great impetus to land division through centuriation.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' p. 416, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuriation was used later for [[land reclamation]] and the foundation of new colonies as well as  for the allocation of land to veterans of the many civil wars of the late Republic and early Empire, including the [[battle of Philippi]] in 42 BCE. This is mentioned by [[Virgil]], in his [[Eclogues]], when he complains explicitly about the allocation of his lands near [[Mantua]] to the soldiers who had participated in that battle.

Centuriation was widely used throughout [[Italy]] and also in some provinces. For example, careful analysis has identified, in the area between [[Rome]] and [[Salerno]], 80 different centuriation systems created at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Giacinto Libertini, ''Persistenza di luoghi e toponimi nelle terre delle antiche città di Atella e Acerrae'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==System and procedure==
Various land division systems were used, but the most common was known as the ''ager centuriatus'' system.

The surveyor first identified a central viewpoint, the ''umbilicus agri'' or ''umbilicus soli''. He then took up his position there and, looking towards the west, defined the territory with the following names:
* ''ultra'', the land he saw in front of him;
* ''citra'', the land behind him;
* ''dextera'', the land to his right;
* ''sinistra'', the land to his left.

He then traced the grid using an instrument known as a [[Groma surveying|groma]], tracing two road axes  perpendicular to each other:
* the first, generally oriented east-west, was called ''[[decumanus maximus]]'', which was traced taking as reference the place where the sun rose in order to know exactly where east was;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Anders | title=Castra et urbs romana: An Examination of the Common Features of Roman Settlements in Italy and the Empire and a System to aid in the Discovery of their Origins. | work=CAC Undergraduate Essay Contest for 2000-2001 | publisher=Classical Association of Canada | year=2001 | url=http://cac-scec.ca/concours_essais/01Bell.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the second, with a north-south orientation, was called ''[[cardo maximus]]''.

==Measurement instruments==
* [[Groma surveying|Groma]]
* [[Chorobates]] for levels
* [[Dioptra]] for levels and angles of slopes

==Orientation==
[[File:NE-PLSS.JPG|thumb|left|Example of road system in a PLSS area; [[Nebraska]] – US grid system]]
[[File:Centurisation.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Centuriation near [[Cesena]], [[Italy]], in a late nineteenth century Italian military map – Roman grid system]]
It has been suggested that the Roman centuriation system inspired [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s proposal to  create a grid of [[Survey township|townships]] for survey purposes, which ultimately led to the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]]. The similarity of the two systems is empirically obvious in certain parts of Italy, for example, where traces of centuriation have remained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1451&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Thrower points out that, unlike the later US system, ''"not all Roman centuriation displays consistent orientation"''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Joseph William Thrower, "Maps &amp; civilization: cartography in culture and society", The University of Chicago Press,  Chicago, 1972, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, for practical reasons, the orientation of the axes did not always coincide with the four cardinal points and followed instead the orographic features of the area, also taking into account the slope of the land and the flow of rainwater along the drainage channels that were traced (centuriation of [[Florentia]] ([[Florence]]). In other cases, it was based on the orientation of existing lines of communication (centuriation along the [[Via Emilia]]) or other geomorphological features.

Centuriation is typical of flat land, but centuriation systems have also been documented in hilly country.

== Centuriation of the surrounding territory ==
Sometimes the ''umbilicus agri'' was located in a city or a [[castrum]]. This central point was generally referred to as ''groma'', from the name of the instrument used by the ''[[gromatici]]'' (surveyors).

In such cases, the grid was traced by extending the urban ''cardo maximus'' and  the ''decumanus maximus'' through the gates of the city into the surrounding agricultural land.

Parallel secondary roads (''limites quintarii'') were then traced on both sides of the initial axes at intervals of 100 ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|actus]]'' (about 3.5&amp;nbsp;km). The territory was thus divided into square areas.

The road network density was then increased with other roads parallel to those already traced at a distance from each other of 20 ''actus'' (710.40 m). Each of the square areas – 20 × 20 ''actus'' – resulting from this further division was called a ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|centuria]]'' or ''century''.

This dimension of the ''centuria'' became prevalent in the period when the large areas of the Po Valley were delimited, while smaller centuries of 10&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10 ''actus'', as the name ''centuria'' suggests, had formerly been used.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' page 415, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was divided after the completion of the roads.

Each century was divided into 10 strips, lying parallel to the ''cardo'' and the ''decumanus'', with  a distance between them of 2 ''actus'' (71.04 m), thus forming 100 squares (''heredia'') of about 0.5 hectares each: 100 ''heredia'' =  1 ''centuria''.

Each ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|heredium]]'' was divided in half along the north-south axis thus creating two ''jugera'': one ''[[jugerum]]'', from ''jugum'' (yoke), measured 2523 square metres, which was the amount of land that could be ploughed in one day by a pair of oxen.

==Regions where centuriation was used==
Even today, in some parts of Italy, the landscape of the plain is determined by the outcome of Roman centuriation, with the persistence of straight elements (roads, drainage canals, property divisions) which have survived territorial development and are often basic elements of urbanisation, at least until the twentieth century, when the human pressure of urban growth and infrastructures destroyed many of the traces scattered throughout the agricultural countryside.

[[Image:Chord length definition (en).svg|right|thumb|400px|Chord of an aerofoil section.]]
[[Image:Aircraft chord.svg|right|thumb|400px|Chords on a swept-wing]]
In [[aeronautics]], a '''chord''' is the imaginary straight line joining the leading and trailing edges of an [[aerofoil]].  The ''chord length'' is the distance between the [[trailing edge]] and the point on the leading edge where the chord intersects the [[leading edge]].&lt;ref name=Clancy5.2&gt;[[L. J. Clancy]] (1975), ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.2, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="houghton&amp;carpenter"/&gt;

The point on the leading edge that is used to define the chord can be defined as either the surface point of minimum radius,&lt;ref name="houghton&amp;carpenter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Aerodynamics for Engineering Students |author1=Houghton, E. L. |author2=Carpenter, P.W. | edition=5th | year=2003 | editor=Butterworth Heinmann | isbn=0-7506-5111-3}} p.18&lt;/ref&gt; or the surface point that will yield maximum chord length{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

The [[wing]], [[horizontal stabilizer]], [[vertical stabilizer]] and [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] of an aircraft are all based on aerofoil sections, and the term ''chord'' or ''chord length'' is also used to describe their width.  The chord of a wing, stabilizer and propeller is determined by measuring the distance between leading and trailing edges in the direction of the airflow.  (If a wing has a rectangular [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]], rather than tapered or swept, then the chord is simply the width of the wing measured in the direction of airflow.)  The term ''chord'' is also applied to the width of [[Flap (aircraft)|wing flaps]], [[ailerons]] and [[rudder]] on an aircraft.

The term is also applied to aerofoils in [[gas turbine]] engines such as [[turbojet]], [[turboprop]], or [[turbofan]] engines for aircraft propulsion.

Most wings are not rectangular so they have a different '''chord''' at different positions along their [[Wingspan|span]].  To give a characteristic figure that can be compared among various wing shapes, the ''mean aerodynamic chord'', or ''MAC'', is used. The MAC is somewhat more complex to calculate, because most wings vary in '''chord''' over the span, growing narrower towards the outer tips. This means that more [[lift (force)|lift]] is generated on the wider inner portions, and the MAC moves the point to measure the chord to take this into account.

==Standard mean chord==
Standard mean chord (SMC) is defined as wing area divided by wing span:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/818173505|title=Flight dynamics principles : a linear systems approach to aircraft stability and control|last=V.|first=Cook, M.|date=2013|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780080982427|edition=3rd|location=Waltham, MA|oclc=818173505}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SMC} = \frac{S}{b},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S'' is the wing area and ''b'' is the span of the wing. Thus, the SMC is the chord of a rectangular wing with the same area and span as those of the given wing. This is a purely geometric figure and is rarely used in [[aerodynamics]].

==Mean aerodynamic chord==
Mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, I.H., and Von Doenhoff, A.E. (1959), ''Theory of Wing Sections'', Section 1.4 (page 27), Dover Publications Inc., New York, Standard Book Number 486-60586-8&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{MAC} = \frac{2}{S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\frac{b}{2}}c^2 dy,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''y'' is the coordinate along the wing span and ''c'' is the chord at the coordinate ''y''. Other terms are as for SMC.

The MAC is a two-dimensional representation of the whole wing. The pressure distribution over the entire wing can be reduced to a single lift force on and a moment around the [[aerodynamic center]] of the MAC. Therefore, not only the length but also the position of MAC is often important. In particular, the position of [[center of gravity]] (CG) of an aircraft is usually measured relative to the MAC, as the percentage of the distance from the leading edge of MAC to CG with respect to MAC itself.

Note that the figure to the right implies that the MAC occurs at a point where leading or trailing edge sweep changes. In general, this is not the case. Any shape other than a simple trapezoid requires evaluation of the above integral.

The ratio of the length (or ''span'') of a rectangular-planform wing to its chord is known as the [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], an important indicator of the [[lift-induced drag]] the wing will create.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For wings with planforms that are not rectangular, the aspect ratio is calculated as the square of the span divided by the wing planform area.) Wings with higher aspect ratios will have less induced drag than wings with lower aspect ratios. Induced drag is most significant at low airspeeds. This is why [[Glider aircraft|glider]]s have long slender wings.

==Tapered wing==
Knowing the area (S&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;), taper ratio (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) and the span (b) of the wing, the chord at any position on the span can be calculated by the formula:&lt;ref&gt;Ruggeri, M.C., (2009), ''Aerodinámica Teórica'', Apuntes de la materia, UTN-FRH, Haedo, Buenos Aires&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c(y)=\frac{2\,S_w}{(1+\lambda)b}\left[1-\frac{1-\lambda}{b}|y|\right],&lt;/math&gt;
where

&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\frac{C_{\rm Tip}}{C_{\rm Root}}&lt;/math&gt;

NOTE: This formula only works if y=0 is the port wingtip and y=b is the starboard wingtip. Typically, y=0 represents the midspan location.

Note 2: The formula as presented does not work regardless of whether one uses y = 0 -&gt; port tip or not, and the note is not consistent with the use of the absolute value of y in the formula.  The formula should read

:&lt;math&gt;c(y)=\frac{2\,S_w}{(1+\lambda)b}\left[1-\frac{1-\lambda}{b}|2 y|\right],&lt;/math&gt;

'''Clothed female, naked male''' ('''CFNM'''), or '''clothed male, naked female''', is a genre of [[erotica]] based on the real or imagined interaction of one or more [[nudity|nude]] men and one or more clothed women.  It is sometimes a [[sexual fantasy]] of women or men, depicting an  [[exhibitionist]] or physique worship scenario. CFNM situations can arise in situations where a male disrobes as part of a male [[striptease]], a medical examination, as a figure model for art students, or is forced to remove clothing as  a punitive measure. In pornography or erotic writing, CFNM depicts a power exchange where the more traditionally dominant male is objectified, debased, or humiliated by a more traditionally submissive female. As a result, CFNM fiction frequently includes the clothed female taking on the role of a [[dominatrix]] over the nude male.

The opposite of CFNM is [[clothed male, naked female]] (CMNF).

In [[classical antiquity]], the portrayal of nude male form in art (including the exposure of genitals) was considered to be more acceptable than that of the naked female form. By the renaissance, this view had reversed.&lt;ref name="Goldhill"&gt;{{cite book |title=Love, sex &amp; tragedy how the ancient world shapes our lives |author=Simon Goldhill |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-30119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Titian]]'s ''[[Perseus and Andromeda (Titian)|treatment of Perseus and Andromeda]]'' in the mid-1550s, it is Andromeda who is nude—save for the barest wisp of fabric—while Perseus is clothed in armour.

Depictions of nudity were acceptable to the 19th-century French [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] culture if the setting was clearly "classical", depicting characters in a culture where nudity was commonplace, as in ''Combat de coqs'' (1847) by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]].

'''Compressed sensing''' (also known as '''compressive sensing''', '''compressive sampling''', or '''sparse sampling''') is a [[signal processing]] technique for efficiently acquiring and reconstructing a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]], by finding solutions to [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined linear systems]]. This is based on the principle that, through optimization, the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from far fewer samples than required by the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem]]. There are two conditions under which recovery is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2009/09/cs.html CS: Compressed Genotyping, DNA Sudoku - Harnessing high throughput sequencing for multiplexed specimen analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; The first one is [[sparsity]] which requires the signal to be sparse in some domain. The second one is [[Coherence (signal processing)|incoherence]] which is applied through the isometric property which is sufficient for sparse signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donoho | first1 = David L | year = 2006 | title =  For most large underdetermined systems of linear equations the minimal 1-norm solution is also the sparsest solution| url = | journal = Communications on pure and applied mathematics | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 797–829 | doi = 10.1002/cpa.20132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainshark.com/brainshark/brainshark.net/portal/title.aspx?pid=zCdz10BfTRz0z0 M. Davenport, "The Fundamentals of Compressive Sensing", SigView, April 12, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A common goal of the engineering field of [[signal processing]] is to reconstruct a signal from a series of sampling measurements. In general, this task is impossible because there is no way to reconstruct a signal during the times that the signal is not measured. Nevertheless, with prior knowledge or assumptions about the signal, it turns out to be possible to perfectly reconstruct a signal from a series of measurements (acquiring this series of measurements is called [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]). Over time, engineers have improved their understanding of which assumptions are practical and how they can be generalized.

An early breakthrough in signal processing was the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]]. It states that if a [[Real number|real]] signal's highest frequency is less than half of the sampling rate (or less than the sampling rate, if the signal is [[Complex number|complex]]), then the signal can be reconstructed perfectly by means of [[Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula|sinc interpolation]]. The main idea is that with prior knowledge about constraints on the signal's frequencies, fewer samples are needed to reconstruct the signal.

Around 2004, [[Emmanuel Candès]], [[Justin Romberg]], [[Terence Tao]], and [[David Donoho]] proved that given knowledge about a signal's [[sparsity]], the signal may be reconstructed with even fewer samples than the sampling theorem requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/cpa.20124|url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/StableRecovery.pdf|title=Stable signal recovery from incomplete and inaccurate measurements|year=2006|last1=Candès|first1=Emmanuel J.|last2=Romberg|first2=Justin K.|last3=Tao|first3=Terence|journal=Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1207–1223|arxiv=math/0503066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Donoho&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/TIT.2006.871582|title=Compressed sensing|year=2006|last1=Donoho|first1=D.L.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1289–1306}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is the basis of compressed sensing.

==History==
Compressed sensing relies on [[Lp space|L1]] techniques, which several other scientific fields have used historically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0ZCyAOBrUtA/TTwqLEeLvdI/AAAAAAAAEXI/7S0_SnWoC0E/s1600/l1-minimization.JPG List of L1 regularization ideas] from Vivek Goyal, Alyson Fletcher, Sundeep Rangan, [http://www.math.uiuc.edu/%7Elaugesen/imaha10/goyal_talk.pdf The Optimistic Bayesian: Replica Method Analysis of Compressed Sensing]&lt;/ref&gt; In statistics, the [[least squares]] method was complemented by the [[Lp norm|&lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm]], which was introduced by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]]. Following the introduction of [[linear programming]] and [[George Dantzig|Dantzig]]'s [[simplex algorithm]], the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was used in [[computational statistics]]. In statistical theory, the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was used by [[George W. Brown (academic)|George W. Brown]] and later writers on [[median-unbiased estimator]]s. It was used by Peter J. Huber and others working on [[robust statistics]]. The &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-norm was also used in signal processing, for example, in the 1970s, when seismologists constructed images of reflective layers within the earth based on data that did not seem to satisfy the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Nyquist–Shannon criterion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1511/2009.79.276 |title = The Best Bits |year = 2009 |last1 = Hayes |first1 = Brian |journal = American Scientist |volume = 97 |issue = 4 |pages = 276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used in [[matching pursuit]] in 1993, the [[Lasso regression|LASSO estimator]] by [[Robert Tibshirani]] in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso.html |first = Robert |last = Tibshirani |title = Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso |journal = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B]] |volume = 58 |issue = 1 |pages = 267–288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[basis pursuit]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic decomposition by basis pursuit", by Scott Shaobing Chen, David L. Donoho, Michael, A. Saunders. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing&lt;/ref&gt;  There were theoretical results describing when these algorithms recovered sparse solutions, but the required type and number of measurements were sub-optimal and subsequently greatly improved by compressed sensing.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

At first glance, compressed sensing might seem to violate [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|the sampling theorem]], because compressed sensing depends on the [[Sparse matrix|sparsity]] of the signal in question and not its highest frequency. This is a misconception, because the sampling theorem guarantees perfect reconstruction given sufficient, not necessary, conditions. A sampling method fundamentally different from classical fixed-rate sampling cannot "violate" the sampling theorem. Sparse signals with high frequency components can be highly under-sampled using compressed sensing compared to classical fixed-rate sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/ExactRecovery.pdf |title = Robust Uncertainty Principles: Exact Signal Reconstruction from Highly Incomplete Fourier Information |year = 2006 |last1 = Candès |first1 = Emmanuel J. |last2 = Romberg |first2 = Justin K. |last3 = Tao |first3 = Terence |journal = IEEE Trans.

==Method==

===Underdetermined linear system===
An [[underdetermined system]] of linear equations has more unknowns than equations and generally has an infinite number of solutions. The figure below shows such an equation system &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}=D\mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; where we want to find a solution for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Underdetermined equation system.svg|mini|200px|alt=Underdetermined linear equation system|Underdetermined linear equation system]]

In order to choose a solution to such a system, one must impose extra constraints or conditions (such as smoothness) as appropriate. In compressed sensing, one adds the constraint of sparsity, allowing only solutions which have a small number of nonzero coefficients. Not all underdetermined systems of linear equations have a sparse solution. However, if there is a unique sparse solution to the underdetermined system, then the compressed sensing framework allows the recovery of that solution.

===Solution / reconstruction method===
Compressed sensing takes advantage of the redundancy in many interesting signals—they are not pure noise. In particular, many signals are [[sparse matrix|sparse]], that is, they contain many coefficients close to or equal to zero, when represented in some domain.&lt;ref&gt;Candès, E.J., &amp; Wakin, M.B., ''An Introduction To Compressive Sampling'', IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, V.21, March 2008 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4472240&amp;isnumber=4472102]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same insight used in many forms of [[lossy compression]].

Compressed sensing typically starts with taking a weighted linear combination of samples also called compressive measurements in a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] different from the basis in which the signal is known to be sparse. The results found by  [[Emmanuel Candès]], [[Justin Romberg]],  [[Terence Tao]] and  [[David Donoho]], showed that the number of these compressive measurements can be small and still contain nearly all the useful information. Therefore, the task of converting the image back into the intended domain involves solving an underdetermined [[matrix equation]] since the number of compressive measurements taken is smaller than the number of pixels in the full image. However, adding the constraint that the initial signal is sparse enables one to solve this underdetermined [[system of linear equations]].

The least-squares solution to such problems is to minimize the [[L2 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; norm]]—that is, minimize the amount of energy in the system. This is usually simple mathematically (involving only a [[matrix multiplication]] by the [[pseudo-inverse]] of the basis sampled in). However, this leads to poor results for many practical applications, for which the unknown coefficients have nonzero energy.

To enforce the sparsity constraint when solving for the underdetermined system of linear equations, one can minimize the number of nonzero components of the solution. The function counting the number of non-zero components of a vector was called the [[L0 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; "norm"]] by David Donoho{{refn|group=note|The quotation marks served two warnings.  First, the number-of-nonzeros &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt;-"norm" is not a proper [[F-space|F-norm]], because it is not continuous in its scalar argument: ''nnzs''(α''x'') is constant as α approaches zero. Unfortunately, authors now neglect the quotation marks and [[abuse of terminology|abused terminology]]—clashing with the established use of the &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; norm for the space of measurable functions (equipped with an appropriate metric) or for the [[F-space|space]] of sequences with [[F-space|F–norm]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n) \mapsto \sum_n{2^{-n} x_n/(1+x_n)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Rolewicz. ''Metric Linear Spaces''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

[[Emmanuel Candès|Candès]] et al. proved that for many problems it is probable that the [[L1 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm]] is equivalent to the [[L0 norm|&lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; norm]], in a technical sense: This equivalence result allows one to solve the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; problem, which is easier than the &lt;math&gt;L^0&lt;/math&gt; problem. Finding the candidate with the smallest &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm can be expressed relatively easily as a [[linear program]], for which efficient solution methods already exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.caltech.edu/l1magic/ L1-MAGIC is a collection of MATLAB routines]&lt;/ref&gt;  When measurements may contain a finite amount of noise, [[basis pursuit denoising]] is preferred over linear programming, since it preserves sparsity in the face of noise and can be solved faster than an exact linear program.

=== Total Variation based CS reconstruction ===

==== Motivation and Applications ====

===== Role of TV regularization =====
[[Total variation]] can be seen as a [[non-negative]] [[real number|real]]-valued [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] defined on the space of [[real number|real-valued]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s (for the case of functions of one variable) or on the space of [[integrable function]]s (for the case of functions of several variables). For signals, especially, [[total variation]] refers to the integral of the absolute [[gradient]] of the signal. In signal and image reconstruction, it is applied as [[total variation regularization]] where the underlying principle is that signals with excessive details have high total variation and that removing these details, while retaining important information such as edges, would reduce the total variation of the signal and make the signal subject closer to the original signal in the problem.

For the purpose of signal and image reconstruction, &lt;math&gt;l1&lt;/math&gt; minimization models are used. Other approaches also include the least-squares as has been discussed before in this article. These methods are extremely slow and return a not-so-perfect reconstruction of the signal. The current CS Regularization models attempt to address this problem by incorporating sparsity priors of the original image, one of which is the total variation (TV). Conventional TV approaches are designed to give piece-wise constant solutions. Some of these include (as discussed ahead) - constrained l1-minimization which uses an iterative scheme. This method, though fast, subsequently leads to over-smoothing of edges resulting in blurred image edges.&lt;ref name = "EPTV" /&gt; TV methods with iterative re-weighting have been implemented to reduce the influence of large gradient value magnitudes in the images. This has been used in [[Tomography|computed tomography]] (CT) reconstruction as a method known as edge-preserving total variation. However, as gradient magnitudes are used for estimation of relative penalty weights between the data fidelity and regularization terms, this method is not robust to noise and artifacts and accurate enough for CS image/signal reconstruction and, therefore, fails to preserve smaller structures.

Recent progress on this problem involves using an iteratively directional TV refinement for CS reconstruction.&lt;ref name = "Orientation and directional refinement" /&gt; This method would have 2 stages: the first stage would estimate and refine the initial orientation field - which is defined as a noisy point-wise initial estimate, through edge-detection, of the given image. In the second stage, the CS reconstruction model is presented by utilizing directional TV regularizer. More details about these TV-based approaches - iteratively reweighted l1 minimization, edge-preserving TV and iterative model using directional orientation field and TV- are provided below.

==== Existing approaches ====

[[File:IRLS.png|thumb|iteratively reweighted l1 minimization method for CS]]
In the CS reconstruction models using constrained &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization, larger coefficients are penalized heavily in the &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; norm. It was proposed to have a weighted formulation of &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization designed to more democratically penalize nonzero coefficients. An iterative algorithm is used for constructing the appropriate weights.&lt;ref name="Iteration"&gt;Lange, K.: Optimization, Springer Texts in Statistics. Springer, New York (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Each iteration requires solving one &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization problem by finding the local minimum of a concave penalty function that more closely resembles the &lt;math&gt;l_{0}&lt;/math&gt; norm. An additional parameter, usually to avoid any sharp transitions in the penalty function curve, is introduced into the iterative equation to ensure stability and so that a zero estimate in one iteration does not necessarily lead to a zero estimate in the next iteration. The method essentially involves using the current solution for computing the weights to be used in the next iteration.

====== Advantages and disadvantages ======
Early iterations may find inaccurate sample estimates, however this method will down-sample these at a later stage to give more weight to the smaller non-zero signal estimates. One of the disadvantages is the need for defining a valid starting point as a global minimum might not be obtained every time due to the concavity of the function. Another disadvantage is that this method tends to uniformly penalize the image gradient irrespective of the underlying image structures. This causes over-smoothing of edges, especially those of low contrast regions, subsequently leading to loss of low contrast information. The advantages of this method include: reduction of the sampling rate for sparse signals; reconstruction of the image while being robust to the removal of noise and other artifacts; and use of very few iterations. This can also help in recovering images with sparse gradients.

In the figure shown below, '''P1''' refers to the first-step of the iterative reconstruction process, of the projection matrix '''P''' of the fan-beam geometry, which is constrained by the data fidelity term. This may contain noise and artifacts as no regularization is performed. The minimization of '''P1''' is solved through the conjugate gradient least squares method. '''P2''' refers to the second step of the iterative reconstruction process wherein it utilizes the edge-preserving total variation regularization term to remove noise and artifacts, and thus improve the quality of the reconstructed image/signal. The minimization of '''P2''' is done through a simple gradient descent method. Convergence is determined by testing, after each iteration, for image positivity, by checking if &lt;math&gt;f^{k-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for the case when &lt;math&gt;f^{k-1} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (Note that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; refers to the different x-ray linear attenuation coefficients at different voxels of the patient image).

[[File:Edge preserving TV.png|thumb|Flow diagram figure for edge preserving total variation method for compressed sensing]]
This is an iterative CT reconstruction algorithm with edge-preserving TV regularization to reconstruct CT images from highly undersampled data obtained at low dose CT through low current levels (milliampere).  In order to reduce  the imaging dose, one of the approaches used is to reduce the number of x-ray projections acquired by the scanner detectors. However, this insufficient projection data which is used to reconstruct the CT image can cause streaking artifacts. Furthermore, using these insufficient projections in standard TV algorithms end up making the problem under-determined and thus leading to infinitely many possible solutions. In this method, an additional penalty weighted function is assigned to the original TV norm. This allows for easier detection of sharp discontinuities in intensity in the images and thereby adapt the weight to store the recovered edge information during the process of signal/image reconstruction. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; controls the amount of smoothing applied to the pixels at the edges to differentiate them from the non-edge pixels. The value of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is changed adaptively based on the values of the histogram of the gradient magnitude so that a certain percentage of pixels have gradient values larger than &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The edge-preserving total variation term, thus, becomes sparser and this speeds up the implementation. A two-step iteration process known as forward-backward splitting algorithm is used.&lt;ref name = "Forward-Backward"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Combettes | first1 = P | last2 = Wajs | first2 = V | year = 2005 | title = Signal recovery by proximal forward-backward splitting | url = | journal = Multiscale Model Simul | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1168–200 | doi=10.1137/050626090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimization problem is split into two sub-problems which are then solved with the conjugate gradient least squares method&lt;ref name="CGLS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hestenes | first1 = M | last2 = Stiefel | first2 = E | year = 1952 | title = Methods of conjugate gradients for solving linear systems | url = | journal = J Res Natl Bur Stand | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 409–36 | doi=10.6028/jres.049.044}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the simple gradient descent method respectively. The method is stopped when the desired convergence has been achieved or if the maximum number of iterations is reached.

===== Advantages and disadvantages =====
Some of the disadvantages of this method are the absence of smaller structures in the reconstructed image and degradation of image resolution. This edge preserving TV algorithm, however, requires fewer iterations than the conventional TV algorithm.&lt;ref name ="EPTV" /&gt; Analyzing the horizontal and vertical intensity profiles of the reconstructed images, it can be seen that there are sharp jumps at edge points and negligible, minor fluctuation at non-edge points. Thus, this method leads to low relative error and higher correlation as compared to the TV method. It also effectively suppresses and removes any form of image noise and image artifacts such as streaking.

=====Iterative model using a directional orientation field and directional total variation&lt;ref name="Orientation and directional refinement"&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6588871&lt;/ref&gt;=====
To prevent over-smoothing of edges and texture details and to obtain a reconstructed CS image which is accurate and robust to noise and artifacts, this method is used. First, an initial estimate of the noisy point-wise orientation field of the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;, is obtained. This noisy orientation field is defined so that it can be refined at a later stage to reduce the noise influences in orientation field estimation.A coarse orientation field estimation is then introduced based on structure tensor which is formulated as:&lt;ref name="Structure tensor"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brox | first1 = T. | last2 = Weickert | first2 = J. | last3 = Burgeth | first3 = B. | last4 = Mrázek | first4 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Nonlinear structure tensors | url = | journal = Image Vis.

Here, &lt;math&gt; J_\rho &lt;/math&gt; refers to the structure tensor related with the image pixel point (i,j) having standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; refers to the Gaussian kernel &lt;math&gt;(0, \rho ^2)&lt;/math&gt; with standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; refers to the manually defined parameter for the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; below which the edge detection is insensitive to noise. &lt;math&gt;\nabla I_{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; refers to the gradient of the image &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\nabla I_{\sigma} \otimes \nabla I_{\sigma})&lt;/math&gt; refers to the tensor product obtained by using this gradient.

The structure tensor obtained is convolved with a Gaussian kernel &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to improve the accuracy of the orientation estimate with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; being set to high values to account for the unknown noise levels. For every pixel (i,j) in the image, the structure tensor J is a symmetric and positive semi-definite matrix. Convolving all the pixels in the image with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, gives orthonormal eigen vectors  ω and υ of the &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; matrix. ω points in the direction of the dominant orientation having the largest contrast and υ points in the direction of the structure orientation having the smallest contrast.  The orientation field coarse initial estimation &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; = υ.  This estimate is accurate at strong edges. However, at weak edges or on regions with noise, its reliability decreases.

To overcome this drawback, a refined orientation model is defined in which the data term reduces the effect of noise and improves accuracy while the second penalty term with the L2-norm is a fidelity term which ensures accuracy of initial coarse estimation.

This orientation field is introduced into the directional total variation optimization model for CS reconstruction through the equation: &lt;math&gt;min_\Chi\lVert \nabla \Chi \bullet d \rVert _{1} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\ \lVert Y - \Phi\Chi \rVert ^2_{2}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; is the objective signal which needs to be recovered. Y is the corresponding measurement vector, d is the iterative refined orientation field and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the CS measurement matrix. This method undergoes a few iterations ultimately leading to convergence.&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the orientation field approximate estimation of the reconstructed image &lt;math&gt;X^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; from the previous iteration (in order to check for convergence and the subsequent optical performance, the previous iteration is used). For the two vector fields represented by  &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Chi \bullet d&lt;/math&gt; refers to the multiplication of respective horizontal and vertical vector elements of &lt;math&gt;\Chi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; followed by their subsequent addition. These equations are reduced to a series of convex minimization problems which are then solved with a combination of variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian (FFT-based fast solver with a closed form solution) methods.&lt;ref name = "Orientation and directional refinement" /&gt; It (Augmented Lagrangian) is considered equivalent to the split Bregman iteration which ensures convergence of this method.  The orientation field, d is defined as being equal to &lt;math&gt;(d_{h}, d_{v})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d_{h},  d_{v}&lt;/math&gt; define the horizontal and vertical estimates of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Augmented Lagrangian.png|thumb|right|Augmented Lagrangian method for orientation field and iterative directional field refinement models]]

The Augmented Lagrangian method for the orientation field,  &lt;math&gt;min_\Chi\lVert \nabla \Chi \bullet d \rVert _{1} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\ \lVert Y - \Phi\Chi \rVert ^2_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,  involves initializing &lt;math&gt;d_{h}, d_{v}, H, V&lt;/math&gt; and then finding the approximate minimizer of &lt;math&gt;L_{1}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to these variables.  The Lagrangian multipliers are then updated and the iterative process is stopped when convergence is achieved. For the iterative directional total variation refinement model, the augmented lagrangian method involves initializing &lt;math&gt;\Chi, P, Q, \lambda_{P}, \lambda_{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="TV"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldluecke | first1 = B. | last2 = Strekalovskiy | first2 = E. | last3 = Cremers | first3 = D. | last4 = Siims | first4 = P.-T. A. I. | year = 2012 | title = The natural vectorial total variation which arises from geometric measure theory | url = | journal = SIAM J. Imag Sci | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 537–563 | doi=10.1137/110823766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;H, V, P, Q&lt;/math&gt; are newly introduced variables where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla d_{h}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla d_{v}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\nabla \Chi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;P \bullet d&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{H}, \lambda_{V}, \lambda_{P}, \lambda_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrangian multipliers for &lt;math&gt;H, V, P, Q&lt;/math&gt;. For each iteration, the approximate minimizer of &lt;math&gt;L_{2}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to variables (&lt;math&gt;\Chi, P, Q&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated. And as in the field refinement model, the lagrangian multipliers are updated and the iterative process is stopped when convergence is achieved.

For the orientation field refinement model, the Lagrangian multipliers are updated in the iterative process as follows:

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{H})^k = (\lambda_{H})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{H}(H^k - \nabla (d_{h})^k)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{V})^k = (\lambda_{V})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{V}(V^k - \nabla (d_{v})^k)&lt;/math&gt;

For the iterative directional total variation refinement model, the Lagrangian multipliers are updated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{P})^k = (\lambda_{P})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{P}(P^k - \nabla (\Chi)^k)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{Q})^k = (\lambda_{Q})^{k-1} +  \gamma_{Q}(Q^k - P^{k} \bullet d)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{H}, \gamma_{V}, \gamma_{P}, \gamma_{Q}&lt;/math&gt; are positive constants.

=====Advantages and disadvantages=====

Based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) metrics and known ground-truth images for testing performance, it is concluded that iterative directional total variation has a better reconstructed performance than the non-iterative methods in preserving edge and texture areas. The orientation field refinement model plays a major role in this improvement in performance as it increases the number of directionless pixels in the flat area while enhancing the orientation field consistency in the regions with edges.

==Applications==
The field of compressive sensing is related to several topics in signal processing and computational mathematics, such as [[underdetermined system|underdetermined linear-system]]s, [[group testing]], heavy hitters, [[sparse coding]], [[multiplexing]], sparse sampling, and finite rate of innovation. Its broad scope and generality has enabled several innovative CS-enhanced approaches in signal processing and compression, solution of inverse problems, design of radiating systems, radar and through-the-wall imaging, and antenna characterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Andrea Massa |author2=Paolo Rocca |author3=Giacomo Oliveri |title = Compressive Sensing in Electromagnetics - A Review|journal = IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine|volume = 57|number = 1|year = 2015|pp = 224–238|doi = 10.1109/MAP.2015.2397092|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7046378|bibcode=2015IAPM...57..224M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imaging techniques having a strong affinity with compressive sensing include [[coded aperture]] and [[computational photography]]. Implementations of compressive sensing in hardware at different [[technology readiness level]]s is available.&lt;ref&gt;Compressive Sensing Hardware, http://sites.google.com/site/igorcarron2/compressedsensinghardware&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional CS reconstruction uses sparse signals (usually sampled at a rate less than the Nyquist sampling rate) for reconstruction through constrained &lt;math&gt;l_{1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization. One of the earliest applications of such an approach was in reflection seismology which used sparse reflected signals from band-limited data for tracking changes between sub-surface layers.&lt;ref name="Seismic sparse signals"&gt;Taylor, H.L., Banks, S.C., McCoy, J.F. "Deconvolution with the 1 norm. ''Geophysics'' 44(1), 39–52 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;  When the LASSO model came into prominence in the 1990s as a statistical method for selection of sparse models,&lt;ref name="LASSO"&gt;Tibshirani, R. "Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso. ''J. R. Stat. Soc. B'' 58(1), 267–288 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; this method was further used in computational harmonic analysis for sparse signal representation from over-complete dictionaries. Some of the other applications include incoherent sampling of radar pulses. The work by ''Boyd et al.''&lt;ref name = "Original source for IRLS" /&gt; has applied the LASSO model- for selection of sparse models- towards analog to digital converters (the current ones use a sampling rate higher than the Nyquist rate along with the quantized Shannon representation). This would involve a parallel architecture in which the polarity of the analog signal changes at a high rate followed by digitizing the integral at the end of each time-interval to obtain the converted digital signal.

===Photography===
Compressed sensing is used in a mobile phone camera sensor. The approach allows a reduction in image acquisition energy per image by as much as a factor of 15 at the cost of complex decompression algorithms; the computation may require an off-device implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Camera Chip Captures Only What It Needs|author=David Schneider|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=March 2013|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/camera-chip-makes-alreadycompressed-images|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compressed sensing addresses the issue of high scan time by enabling faster acquisition by measuring fewer Fourier coefficients. This produces a high-quality image with relatively lower scan time. Another application (also discussed ahead) is for CT reconstruction with fewer X-ray projections. Compressed sensing, in this case, removes the high spatial gradient parts - mainly, image noise and artifacts. This holds tremendous potential as one can obtain high-resolution CT images at low radiation doses (through lower current-mA settings).&lt;ref name="MRI"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = M. | last2 = Bioucas-Dias | first2 = J.M. | last3 = Nowak | first3 = R.D. | year = 2007 | title = Majorization–minimization algorithms for wavelet-based image restoration | url = | journal = IEEE Trans.

===Network tomography===
Compressed sensing has showed outstanding results in the application of [[network tomography]] to [[network management]]. [[Network delay]] estimation and [[network congestion]] detection can both be modeled as underdetermined [[System of linear equations|systems of linear equations]] where the coefficient matrix is the network routing matrix. Moreover, in the [[Internet]], network routing matrices usually satisfy the criterion for using compressed sensing.&lt;ref&gt;[Network tomography via compressed sensing|http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/funlab/Publications/2010/CS-Tomo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shortwave-infrared cameras===
Commercial shortwave-infrared cameras based upon compressed sensing are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InView web site|url=http://www.inviewcorp.com/products |website=inviewcorp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cameras have light sensitivity from 0.9&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] to 1.7&amp;nbsp;µm, which are wavelengths invisible to the human eye.

===Aperture synthesis in radio astronomy===
In the field of [[radio astronomy]], compressed sensing has been proposed for deconvolving an interferometric image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/395/3/1733|Compressed sensing imaging techniques for radio interferometry]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the [[CLEAN (algorithm)|Högbom CLEAN algorithm]] that has been in use for the deconvolution of radio images since 1974, is similar to compressed sensing's matching pursuit algorithm.

===Transmission electron microscopy===
Compressed sensing combined with a moving aperture has been used to increase the acquisition rate of images in a [[transmission electron microscopy|transmission electron microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=Andrew|last2=Kovarik|first2=Libor|last3=Abellan|first3=Patricia|last4=Yuan|first4=Xin|last5=Carin|first5=Lawrence|last6=Browning|first6=Nigel D.|title=Applying compressive sensing to TEM video: a substantial frame rate increase on any camera|journal=Advanced Structural and Chemical Imaging|date=13 August 2015|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s40679-015-0009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scanning transmission electron microscopy|scanning mode]], compressive sensing combined with random scanning of the electron beam has enabled both faster acquisition and less electron dose, which allows for imaging of electron beam sensitive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovarik|first1=L.|last2=Stevens|first2=A.|last3=Liyu|first3=A.|last4=Browning|first4=N.

[[File:Cyathium cross2 ies no letters.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''Euphorbia tridentata'', cross-section of a cyathium.]]
[[File:Stamen of euphorbia milii.jpg|thumb|In euphorbia milii-large]]
A '''cyathium''' (plural: '''cyathia''') is one of the specialised [[Pseudanthium|pseudanthia]] ("false flowers") forming the [[inflorescence]] of plants in the genus ''[[Euphorbia]]'' ([[Euphorbiaceae]]). A cyathium consists of:

* Five (rarely four) bracteoles. These are small, united [[bract]]s, which form a cup-like involucre. Their upper tips are free and in the beginning cover the opening of the involucre (like the shutter of a camera). These alternate with:
* Five (1 to 10) [[nectar gland]]s, which are sometimes fused.
* One extremely reduced female flower standing in the centre at the base of the involucre, consisting of an [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] on a short stem with [[pistil]], and surrounded by:
* Five groups (one group at the base of each bracteole) of extremely reduced male flowers, which each consist of a single [[anther]] on a stem.

The flower-like characteristics of the cyathia are underlined by brightly coloured nectar glands and often by [[petal]]-like appendages to the nectar glands, or brightly coloured, petal-like bracts positioned under the cyathia. The paired petal-like bracts of ''Euphorbia'' section ''Goniostema'' are called ''cyathophylls''. here female to male flower ratio is 1:α

The cyathia are sometimes solitary, but are usually in [[Cyme (botany)|cymes]], [[inflorescences]] of the second order, in pseudumbels, on dichotomously branched stalks or in so-called simple cymes which consist of one central and two lateral cyathia.

In one group of Madagascan species in the sub-family Euphorbia section Goniostema (''E. aueoviridiflora'', ''E. capmanambatoensis'', ''E. iharanae'', ''E. leuconeura'', ''E. neohumbertii'', ''E. viguieri'') there is a tendency for a further pseudanthium to grow from the cyme. Probably as an adaptation to pollination by [[bird]]s, the cyathia have become specialised: Most cyathia have upright cyathophylles which surround them protectively, but render the nectar glands inaccessible. To compensate, between them are naked sterile cyathia whose only job is to produce nectar.

The '''''Dashboard of Sustainability''''' is a free-of-charge, non-commercial software package configured to convey the complex relationships among economic, social, and environmental issues.
The software is designed to help developing countries achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and work towards [[sustainable development]]. The software package was developed by members of the Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators (CGSDI),&lt;ref&gt;Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators.  (2006)  ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/dashboard.asp Dashboard of Sustainability.]''; see also ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp CGSDI history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106123832/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp |date=2007-01-06 }}'' and ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp CGSDI members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224102435/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp |date=2007-02-24 }}'', all obtained Apr. 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been applied to quite a number of indicator sets, inter alia to the Millennium Development Goals indicators and the United Nations [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] indicators.

In 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability researchers Jochen Jesinghaus and Peter Hardi presented the Dashboard of Sustainability at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;IISD Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) ''[http://www.iisd.ca/2002/wssd/enbots/aug30.html ENB on the side, Aug. 30, 2002]'' obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2002 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Porto Alegre]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Devraj (TerraViva), ''[http://ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml Internet Dashboard Device for Navigating Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411090712/http://www.ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml |date=2007-04-11 }}'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included in the resources for the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] World Forum on Key Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2004), ''[http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,2340,en_21571361_31834434_33637186_1_1_1_1,00.html European Union 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability]'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the Millennium Project utilized the Dashboard of Sustainability to conclude in their [[State of the Future]] report that global prospects for improving the overall health, wealth, and sustainability of humanity are improving, but slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C.; Gordon, Theodore J.

'''Differential scanning calorimetry''', or '''DSC''', is a [[thermal analysis|thermoanalytical]] technique in which the difference in the amount of [[heat]] required to increase the [[temperature]] of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined [[heat capacity]] over the range of temperatures to be scanned.

The technique was developed by E. S. Watson and M. J. O'Neill in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3263484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced commercially at the 1963 [[Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy]]. The first [[adiabatic]] differential scanning calorimeter that could be used in biochemistry was developed by P. L. Privalov and D. R. Monaselidze in 1964 at Institute of Physics in Tbilisi, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1975|title=Molecular biology|volume=6|place=Moscow |pages=7–33 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term DSC was coined to describe this instrument, which measures energy directly and allows precise measurements of heat capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Wunderlich B |year=1990|title=Thermal Analysis|place=New York|publisher=Academic Press|pages=137–140|isbn=0-12-765605-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of DSC:
* ''Power-compensated DSC'', keeps power supply constant
* ''Heat-flux DSC'', keeps heat flux constant

==Detection of phase transitions==
The basic principle underlying this technique is that when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as [[phase transition]]s, more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] or [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]]. For example, as a solid sample [[melting|melts]] to a liquid, it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature at the same rate as the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the endothermic [[phase transition]] from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes exothermic processes (such as [[crystallization]]) less heat is required to raise the sample temperature. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning [[calorimeter]]s are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during such transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle physical changes, such as [[glass transition]]s. It is widely used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer curing.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Dean JA |title=The Analytical Chemistry Handbook|place=New York|publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.|year=1995|pages=15.1–15.5|isbn=0-07-016197-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Pungor E |title=A Practical Guide to Instrumental Analysis|publisher=Boca Raton|place=Florida|year=1995|pages=181–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Skoog DA, Holler FJ, Nieman T |title=Principles of Instrumental Analysis |edition=5th |place=New York |year=1998 |pages=805–808 |isbn=0-03-002078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DTA==
An alternative technique, which shares much in common with DSC, is [[differential thermal analysis]] (DTA). In this technique it is the heat flow to the sample and reference that remains the same rather than the temperature. When the sample and reference are heated identically, phase changes and other thermal processes cause a difference in temperature between the sample and reference. Both DSC and DTA provide similar information. DSC measures the energy required to keep both the reference and the sample at the same temperature whereas DTA measures the difference in temperature between the sample and the reference when the same amount of energy has been introduced into both.

==DSC curves==
[[Image:CalibratingDSCcurve.png|frame|Top: A schematic DSC curve of amount of energy input (y) required to maintain each temperature (x), scanned across a range of temperatures. Bottom: Normalized curves setting the initial heat capacity as the reference. Buffer-buffer baseline (dashed) and protein-buffer variance (solid).]]
[[Image:2and3stDSCcurves.png|frame|Normalized DSC curves using the baseline as the reference (left), and fractions of each conformational state (y) existing at each temperature (right), for two-state (top), and three-state (bottom) proteins. Note the minuscule broadening in the peak of the three-state protein's DSC curve, which may or may not appear statistically significant to the naked eye.]]

The result of a DSC experiment is a curve of heat flux versus temperature or versus time. There are two different conventions: exothermic reactions in the sample shown with a positive or negative peak, depending on the kind of technology used in the experiment. This curve can be used to calculate [[enthalpy|enthalpies of transitions]]. This is done by integrating the peak corresponding to a given transition. It can be shown that the enthalpy of transition can be expressed using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = K A&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy of transition, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the calorimetric constant, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area under the curve. The calorimetric constant will vary from instrument to instrument, and can be determined by analyzing a well-characterized sample with known enthalpies of transition.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

==Applications==
Differential scanning calorimetry can be used to measure a number of characteristic properties of a sample. Using this technique it is possible to observe [[melting point|fusion]] and [[crystal]]lization events as well as [[glass transition]] temperatures ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''. DSC can also be used to study [[oxidation]], as well as other chemical reactions.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = O'Neill MJ | title=The Analysis of a Temperature-Controlled Scanning Calorimeter|journal=Anal. Chem.|year=1964|volume=36|pages=1238–1245|doi=10.1021/ac60213a020|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass transition]]s may occur as the temperature of an [[amorphous]] solid is increased. These transitions appear as a step in the baseline of the recorded DSC signal. This is due to the sample undergoing a [[Kauzmann paradox|change in heat capacity]]; no formal phase change occurs.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

As the temperature increases, an amorphous solid will become less [[viscosity|viscous]]. At some point the molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This is known as the [[crystallization|crystallization temperature]] (''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''). This transition from amorphous solid to crystalline solid is an exothermic process, and results in a peak in the DSC signal. As the temperature increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine [[transition temperature]]s and [[enthalpy|enthalpies]] makes DSC a valuable tool in producing [[phase diagram]]s for various chemical systems.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

Differential scanning calorimetry can also be used  to obtain valuable thermodynamics information about proteins. The thermodynamics analysis of proteins can reveal important information about the global structure of proteins, and protein/ligand interaction. For example, many mutations lower the stability of proteins, while ligand binding usually increases protein stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schön A, Brown RK, Hutchins BM, Freire E | title = Ligand binding analysis and screening by chemical denaturation shift | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 443 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–7 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23994566 | pmc = 3809086 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2013.08.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using DSC, this stability can be measured by obtaining [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs Free Energy]] values at any given temperature. This allows researchers to compare the free energy of unfolding between ligand-free protein and protein-ligand complex, or wild type and mutant proteins. DSC can also be used in studying protein/lipid interactions, nucleotides, drug-lipid interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiu MH, Prenner EJ | title = Differential scanning calorimetry: An invaluable tool for a detailed thermodynamic characterization of macromolecules and their interactions | journal = Journal of Pharmacy &amp; Bioallied Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–59 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21430954 | pmc = 3053520 | doi = 10.4103/0975-7406.76463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In studying protein denaturation using DSC, the thermal melt should be at least to some degree reversible, as the thermodynamics calculations rely on chemical equlibreum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Examples==
The technique is widely used across a range of applications, both as a routine quality test and as a research tool. The equipment is easy to calibrate, using low melting [[indium]] at 156.5985 °C for example, and is a rapid and reliable method of thermal analysis.

===Polymers===
DSC is used widely for examining [[polymer]]ic materials to determine their thermal transitions.  The observed thermal transitions can be utilized to compare materials, although the transitions do not uniquely identify composition. The composition of unknown materials may be completed using complementary techniques such as IR spectroscopy.  [[Melting point]]s and [[glass transition temperature]]s for most [[polymer]]s are available from standard compilations, and the method can show [[polymer degradation]] by the lowering of the expected melting point, ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', for example. ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends on the [[molecular weight]] of the polymer and thermal history, so lower grades may have lower melting points than expected. The percent crystalline content of a polymer can be estimated from the crystallization/melting peaks of the DSC graph as reference heats of fusion can be found in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | vauthors = Wunderlich B | title = Macromolecular Physics | year = 1980 | volume =  3 | chapter = Chapter 8, Table VIII.6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSC can also be used to study thermal degradation of polymers using an approach such as Oxidative Onset Temperature/Time (OOT), however, the user risks contamination of the DSC cell, which can be problematic.  [[Thermogravimetric Analysis]] (TGA) may be more useful for decomposition behavior determination.  Impurities in polymers can be determined by examining thermograms for anomalous peaks, and [[plasticiser]]s can be detected at their characteristic boiling points.  In addition, examination of minor events in first heat thermal analysis data can be useful as these apparently "anomalous peaks" can in fact also be representative of process or storage thermal history of the material or polymer physical aging. Comparison of first and second heat data collected at consistent heating rates can allow the analyst to learn about both polymer processing history and material properties.

===Liquid crystals===
DSC is used in the study of [[liquid crystal]]s. As some forms of matter go from solid to liquid they go through a third state, which displays properties of both phases. This [[anisotropic]] liquid is known as a liquid crystalline or mesomorphous state. Using DSC, it is possible to observe the small energy changes that occur as matter transitions from a solid to a liquid crystal and from a liquid crystal to an [[isotropic]] liquid.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

===Oxidative stability===
Using differential scanning calorimetry to study the stability to [[oxidation]] of samples generally requires an airtight sample chamber. Usually, such tests are done isothermally (at constant temperature) by changing the atmosphere of the sample. First, the sample is brought to the desired test temperature under an inert atmosphere, usually [[nitrogen]]. Then, oxygen is added to the system. Any oxidation that occurs is observed as a deviation in the baseline. Such analysis can be used to determine the stability and optimum storage conditions for a material or compound.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

===Safety screening===
DSC makes a reasonable initial safety screening tool. In this mode the sample will be housed in a non-reactive crucible (often [[gold]] or gold-plated steel), and which will be able to withstand [[pressure]] (typically up to 100 [[bar (unit)|bar]]). The presence of an [[exothermic]] event can then be used to assess the [[chemical stability|stability]] of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2–3 °C/min, due to much heavier crucible) and unknown [[activation energy]], it is necessary to deduct about 75–100 °C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to ''suggest'' a maximal temperature for the material. A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an [[Calorimeter#Adiabatic calorimeters|adiabatic calorimeter]], but such a test may take 2–3 days from [[Ambient temperature|ambient]] at a rate of a 3 °C increment per half-hour.

===Drug analysis===
DSC is widely used in the [[pharmaceutical]] and [[polymer]] industries. For the polymer chemist, DSC is a handy tool for studying [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] processes, which allows the fine tuning of polymer properties. The [[cross-link]]ing of polymer molecules that occurs in the curing process is exothermic, resulting in a negative peak in the DSC curve that usually appears soon after the glass transition.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

In the pharmaceutical industry it is necessary to have well-characterized [[Medication|drug]] compounds in order to define processing parameters. For instance, if it is necessary to deliver a drug in the amorphous form, it is desirable to process the drug at temperatures below those at which crystallization can occur.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;

===General chemical analysis===
[[Freezing-point depression]] can be used as a '''purity analysis''' tool when analysed by differential scanning calorimetry. This is possible because the temperature range over which a mixture of compounds melts is dependent on their relative amounts. Consequently, less pure compounds will exhibit a broadened melting peak that begins at lower temperature than a pure compound.&lt;ref name=Pugnor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;

{{medref|date=July 2014}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] can be classified into two types: [[ionizing radiation]] and [[non-ionizing radiation]], based on the capability of a single [[photon]] with more than 10&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] energy to ionize oxygen or break [[chemical bond]]s. [[Ultraviolet]] and higher frequencies, such as [[X-ray]]s or [[gamma ray]]s are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see ''[[radiation]]'' and ''[[radiation poisoning]]''. By far the most common health hazard of radiation is [[sunburn]], which causes over one million new skin cancers annually.&lt;ref name=Cleaver /&gt;

==Types of hazards==

===Electrical hazards===
Very strong radiation can induce current capable of delivering an electric shock to persons or animals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It can also overload and destroy electrical equipment. The induction of currents by oscillating magnetic fields is also the way in which solar storms disrupt the operation of electrical and electronic systems, causing damage to and even the explosion of power distribution transformers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/storms.html|title=Solar Storms and You: Human Impacts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; blackouts (as occurred in [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm|1989]]), and interference with electromagnetic signals (''e.g.'' radio, TV, and telephone signals).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/podcasts/media/Blackout/Blackout_part4.htm Transcript of "Blackout: The Sun-Earth Connection", Part 4: When Solar Plasma Distorts Earth's Magnetic Field]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- I don't have time to do research to find another, more stable reference, such as from a scientific journal or textbook, but these one from NASA cover the subject with, I think, adequate authority to justify the sentence. --&gt;

===Fire hazards===
Extremely high power electromagnetic radiation can cause electric currents strong enough to create sparks (electrical arcs) when an induced voltage exceeds the [[breakdown voltage]] of the surrounding medium (''e.g.'' air at 3.0 MV/m). These sparks can then ignite flammable materials or gases, possibly leading to an explosion.

This can be a particular hazard in the vicinity of [[explosives]] or [[pyrotechnics]], since an electrical overload might ignite them. This risk is commonly referred to as Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) by the [[United States Navy]] (USN). [[United States Military Standard]] 464A (MIL-STD-464A) mandates assessment of HERO in a system, but USN document OD 30393 provides design principles and practices for controlling electromagnetic hazards to ordnance.&lt;ref name="comnavsafecen"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.public.navy.mil/comnavsafecen/Pages/acquisition/radio_frequency-radiation.aspx|title= Acquisition Safety - Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Hazards|publisher= Naval Safety Center - United States Navy|accessdate= 2014-07-30|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140808041218/http://www.public.navy.mil/comnavsafecen/Pages/acquisition/radio_frequency-radiation.aspx|archivedate= 2014-08-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the risk related to fueling is known as Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Fuel (HERF). NAVSEA OP 3565 Vol. 1 could be used to evaluate HERF, which states a maximum power density of 0.09&amp;nbsp;W/m² for frequencies under 225&amp;nbsp;MHz (i.e. 4.2 meters for a 40&amp;nbsp;W emitter).&lt;ref name="comnavsafecen" /&gt;

===Biological hazards===
{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health#Non-thermal effects}}
The best understood biological effect of electromagnetic fields is to cause [[dielectric heating]]. For example, touching or standing around an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] while a high-power [[transmitter]] is in operation can cause severe burns. These are exactly the kind of burns that would be caused inside a [[microwave oven]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

This heating effect varies with the power and the [[frequency]] of the electromagnetic energy, as well as the distance to the source. A measure of the heating effect is the [[specific absorption rate]] or SAR, which has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The [[IEEE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | title = Standard for Safety Level with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3KHz to 300GHz  | journal = IEEE Std  | volume = C95.1-2005&lt;!--Should this be appended here?:" - IEEE"--&gt;  | issue =  | pages =  | publisher = IEEE  | date = October 2005  | url = https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/C95.1-2005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many national governments have established safety limits for exposure to various frequencies of electromagnetic energy based on [[Specific absorption rate|SAR]], mainly based on [http://www.icnirp.de ICNIRP] Guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection |title=Guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields (up to 300 GHz) |journal=Health Physics |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=494–522 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9525427 |url=http://www.icnirp.de/documents/emfgdl.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113052702/http://www.icnirp.de/documents/emfgdl.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which guard against thermal damage.

There are publications which support the existence of complex biological and neurological effects of weaker ''non-thermal'' electromagnetic fields (see [[Bioelectromagnetics]]), including weak ELF magnetic fields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Delgado JM, Leal J, Monteagudo JL, Gracia MG |title=Embryological changes induced by weak, extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=533–51 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7107514 |pmc=1167891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harland JD, Liburdy RP |title=Environmental magnetic fields inhibit the antiproliferative action of tamoxifen and melatonin in a human breast cancer cell line |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=555–62 |year=1997 |pmid=9383244 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1997)18:8&lt;555::AID-BEM4&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modulated RF and microwave fields.&lt;ref name="Aalto S, Haarala C, Brück A, Sipilä H, Hämäläinen H, Rinne JO 2006 885–90"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aalto S, Haarala C, Brück A, Sipilä H, Hämäläinen H, Rinne JO |title=Mobile phone affects cerebral blood flow in humans |journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=885–90 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16495939 |doi=10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061815000599|title=Microwave frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects including depression|last=Pal|first=Martin|date=2016|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.jchemneu.2015.08.001|volume=75|journal=Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy|pages=43–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental mechanisms of the interaction between biological material and electromagnetic fields at non-thermal levels are not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Binhi|first= Vladimir N|others= Repiev, A &amp; Edelev, M (translators from Russian)|title= Magnetobiology: underlying physical problems |publisher= Academic Press|location= San Diego|year= 2002|pages= 1–16|isbn= 978-0-12-100071-4|oclc= 49700531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescent lighting==
[[Fluorescent light]] bulbs and tubes internally produce [[ultraviolet]] light. Normally this is converted to visible light by the [[phosphor]] film inside a protective coating. When the film is cracked by mishandling or faulty manufacturing then UV may escape at levels that could cause sunburn or even skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mironava|first=T. |author2=Hadjiargyrou, M. |author3=Simon, M. |author4=Rafailovich, M. H.|title=The effects of UV emission from compact fluorescent light exposure on human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro|journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology|date=20 Jul 2012|doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01192.x |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=1497–1506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=120 |issue=10 |page=a387 |last=Nicole |first=Wendee |title=Ultraviolet leaks from CFLs|date=October 2012|doi=10.1289/ehp.120-a387|pmc=3491932 |pmid=23026199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EMR effects on the human body by frequency==
[[File:For Your Own Health (13942406865) (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Warning sign next to a transmitter with high field strengths]]

While the most acute exposures to harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation are immediately realized as burns, the health effects due to chronic or occupational exposure may not manifest effects for months or years.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Extremely-low frequency===
High-power, [[extremely low frequency|extremely-low-frequency]] RF with electric field levels in the low kV/m range are known to induce perceivable currents within the human body that create an annoying tingling sensation. These currents will typically flow to ground through a body contact surface such as the feet, or arc to ground where the body is well insulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/elf_ehc/en/index.html Extremely Low Frequency Fields Environmental Health Criteria Monograph No.238], chapter 5, page 121, WHO&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shortwave===
[[Shortwave]] (1.6 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) [[diathermy]] heating of human tissue only heats tissues that are good electrical conductors, such as [[blood vessels]] and [[muscle]]. [[Adipose tissue]] (fat) receives little heating by induction fields because an electrical current is not actually going through the tissues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regearlife.com/therapeutic-heating-system-uses-shortwave-diathermy.html ReBound shortwave diathermy (SWD)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209130604/http://www.regearlife.com/therapeutic-heating-system-uses-shortwave-diathermy.html |date=2014-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio frequency fields===
{{See also|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
This designation of mobile phone signals as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) (e.g. its IARC, see below) has often been misinterpreted as indicating that of some measure of risk has been observed{{snd}} however the designation indicates only that the possibility could not be conclusively ruled out using the available data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cell phones, cancer, and children |author1=Boice JD Jr |author2=Tarone RE |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |year=2011 |volume=103 |issue=16 |pages=1211–3 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djr285 |pmid=21795667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)]] classified mobile phone radiation as [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]] "possibly carcinogenic" (''rather than'' [[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|Group 2A]] "probably carcinogenic" nor the "is carcinogenic" Group 1). That means that there "could be some risk" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.&lt;ref name="WHO_IARC_110531"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf |format= PDF|title= IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans |work=press release N° 208 |publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] concluded in 2014 that "A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/ |title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile phones - Fact sheet N°193 |publisher= World Health Organization |date=October 2014 |accessdate= 2 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euitt.upm.es/estaticos/catedra-coitt/web_salud_medioamb/Informes/informes_PDF/rf/HealthCanada/99ehd237.pdf Limits of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields in the Frequency Range from 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz], Canada Safety Code 6, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millimeter waves===
Recent technology advances in the developments of [[millimeter wave scanner]]s for [[airport security]] and [[WiGig]] for [[personal area network]]s have opened the 60&amp;nbsp;GHz and above microwave band to SAR exposure regulations.  Previously, microwave applications in these bands were for point-to-point satellite communication with minimal human exposure. Radiation levels in the millimeter wavelength represent the high microwave band or close to Infrared wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieice.org/proceedings/EMC09/pdf/22S1-1.pdf Characterization of 60GHz Millimeter-Wave Focusing Beam for Living-Body Exposure Experiments, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Masaki KOUZAI et al., 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrared===
[[Infrared]] wavelengths longer than 750&amp;nbsp;nm can produce changes in the lens of the eye. [[Glassblower's cataract]] is an example of a heat injury that damages the [[anterior lens]] capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for many hours a day.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
 
Another important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of [[arc welding]], infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does.  This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Visible light===
Moderate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the [[retina]] of the eye, or even the [[skin]]. To control the risk of injury, various specifications &amp;ndash; for example ANSI Z136 in the US, and IEC 60825 internationally &amp;ndash; define "classes" of lasers depending on their power and wavelength.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Regulations prescribe required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser safety goggles during operation (see [[laser safety]]).

As with its infrared and ultraviolet radiation dangers, welding creates an intense brightness in the visible light spectrum, which may cause temporary [[flash blindness]].  Some sources state that there is no minimum safe distance for exposure to these radiation emissions without adequate eye protection.&lt;ref name=TWI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/health-and-safety-faqs/faq-what-is-the-minimum-safe-distance-from-the-welding-arc-above-which-there-is-no-risk-of-eye-damage/ |title=What is the minimum safe distance from the welding arc above which there is no risk of eye damage? |publisher=The Welding Institute (TWI Global) |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultraviolet===
Short-term exposure to strong ultraviolet sunlight causes [[sunburn]] within hours of exposure.

Ultraviolet light, specifically [[UV-B]], has been shown to cause [[cataracts]] and there is some evidence that sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sliney DH |title=UV radiation ocular exposure dosimetry |journal=Doc Ophthalmol |volume=88 |issue=3–4 |pages=243–54 |year=1994 |pmid=7634993 |doi=10.1007/bf01203678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most UV light from the sun is filtered out by the atmosphere and consequently airline pilots often have high rates of cataracts because of the increased levels of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rafnsson | first = V |author2=Olafsdottir E |author3=Hrafnkelsson J |author4=Sasaki H |author5=Arnarsson A |author6=Jonasson F  | title = Cosmic radiation increases the risk of nuclear cataract in airline pilots: a population-based case-control study | journal = Arch Ophthalmol | volume = 123 | pages = 1102–5 | doi = 10.1001/archopht.123.8.1102 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16087845 | issue = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hypothesized that [[Ozone depletion|depletion of the ozone layer]] and a consequent increase in levels of UV light on the ground may increase future rates of cataracts.&lt;ref name="Dobson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = R.| last1 = Dobson| title = Ozone depletion will bring big rise in number of cataracts| journal = BMJ| volume = 331| issue = 7528| pages = 1292–1295| year = 2005| pmid = | pmc = 1298891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7528.1292-d }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the lens filters UV light, so once that is removed via surgery, one may be able to see UV light.&lt;ref name=Komarnitsky&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.komar.org/faq/colorado-cataract-surgery-crystalens/ultra-violet-color-glow/ |title=Case study of ultraviolet vision after IOL removal for Cataract Surgery |author=Komarnitsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 300&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Ultraviolet|actinic rays]]) can damage the [[corneal epithelium]].  This is most commonly the result of exposure to the sun at high altitude, and in areas where shorter wavelengths are readily reflected from bright surfaces, such as snow, water, and sand.  UV generated by a [[welding]] arc can similarly cause damage to the cornea, known as "arc eye" or welding flash burn, a form of [[photokeratitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/799025-overview|publisher=Medscape|title=Ultraviolet keratitis|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Focus Phrase'''" is a term traditionally used in cognitive-therapy and awareness-management discussions, and now in more general use to describe elicitor statements that evoke a desired refocusing of attention. Psychologically related terms are ''elicitor phrase'' or ''statement of intent''.

The psychological term "Focus Phrase" is now used by therapists and life coaches as a general term.

==Definition==

"Focus phrase" is defined as "a specially-constructed short sentence or phrase that states a person's inner intent to refocus his or her attention immediately in a new pre-ordained direction".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Based both on new research in [[cognitive science]] and on [[cognitive-shifting]] studies of ancient [[meditation]] techniques (see [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]), focus phrases have been used as a meditative tool and therapy aid, and are being introduced as at-work attentive boosts. They are carefully designed by professionals to almost instantly redirect the mind's attention specifically toward worthwhile sensations, thoughts, images, and other mental experiences. Focus phrases are highly effective in evoking rapid shifts in mental content, quality of awareness, sensory perception, and general inner experience. Therefore, they are considered of high value in meditative methods, and even in creativity-boost techniques.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Traditional cognitive therapy usage==

As explained by the founder of cognitive therapy, [[Aaron Beck]], our chronic thoughtflows (stream of consciousness) tend to dominate our inner experience and stimulate our behavior and emotions. If we want to change our inner experience (for instance from a negative mood to a more positive mood) we need to take charge of the thoughts we are holding in our minds, and state our intent to shift into a preferable mood or quality of consciousness. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The theory of [[cognitive therapy]] teaches that the power of the spoken word in stating one's intent is primary for manifestation of one's intent. In ancient times, the [[Creation myth]] found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] of the [[Old Testament]] relates that "God said let there be light, and there was light." Perhaps "Let there be light" was the primary focus phrase for our universe. And throughout [[anthropology]] studies, a verbal statement of intent (a blessing; a curse) was considered a decisive act in manifesting that intent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Business applications==

In corporate awareness-training, focus phrases are used not to change the outer world, but to rapidly shift inner attention, and thus alter personal experience and behavior. For instance, in order to shift rapidly from being lost in thought to present-moment alertness, the following core focus phrase drawn both from [[perceptual]] psychology and ancient [[Yoga]] meditative tradition is used: "I feel the air flowing in and out of my nose." Immediately, as often explained by spiritual teacher [[Alan Watts]] in his numerous books, the words have the psychological power to turn your attention toward the actual breathing experience - which in turn awakens your awareness to sensory experience in the present moment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Elicitor statements using this general 'focus phrase technology' for mental refocusing can be used to redirect attention toward a more positive mood ("I let go of my worries, and feel peaceful inside"), toward more creative states of mind ("I am open to receive insight into my dilemma"), toward interpersonal relating ("I accept this person just as they are"), or toward any other intent to improve one's experience and behavior.

The term Focus Phrase is recently becoming a more general-usage term found in daily communication, referring to any short sentence intended to help a person's performance or inner experience.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} There is also some negative discussion of the term. In the opposite direction, the term Focus Phrase has been studied academically as a part of a Semantics dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pdekker/Only/Statements/Bende-Farkas.txt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925030141/http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pdekker/Only/Statements/Bende-Farkas.txt |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural environment|Environment]]al flows can be broken down into instream flow, freshwater inflow, and outflow, as shown in the depiction below. Instream flow is the freshwater water flowing in rivers or streams. '''Freshwater inflow''' is the freshwater that flows into an [[estuary]]. Outflow is the flow from an estuary to the ocean. This article's focus is upon freshwater inflow.

== Estuaries ==

'''Freshwater inflow''': Freshwater flows into an [[estuary]] and mixes with the marine water of the [[estuary|estuarine ecosystem]]. The mixing of freshwater inflow and the [[seawater|marine water]] of the [[estuary|estuarine ecosystem]] occurs spatially and temporally from climatic influences including tidal action, seasonal variability and storms.&lt;ref name="Hydrological Changes and Estuarine Dynamic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montagna|first=P.A. |author2=Palmer, T. |author3=Pollack, J.|title=Hydrological Changes and Estuarine Dynamics|journal=Springerbriefs in Environmental Science|year=2013|volume=8|page=94|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-5833-3|url=https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/ecology/book/978-1-4614-5832-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing is affected by the amount of estuarine system. The [[tide]]s and the volume of the receiving estuary govern the volume of seawater. Tides are defined as the periodic rise and fall of the surface of the sea along the coast that are driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and of the sun.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to the Biology of Marine Life, Sixth Edition"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sumich|first=J.L.|title=An Introduction to the Biology of Marine Life, Sixth Edition|year=2004|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Learning|page=449|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_the_Biology_of_Marine_Li.html?id=Y8vTCze3dHgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although estuaries are influenced by the tides, they are often somewhat protected from storms and tidal action by buffers further offshore including [[barrier island]]s and [[peninsula]]s.&lt;ref name="Hydrological Changes and Estuarine Dynamic"/&gt;

The low-salinity conditions of the [[seawater|marine water]] are created when freshwater mixes with the saltwater of the estuarine system. Average [salinity] for freshwater is around 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) whereas average salinity of the ocean is 35 ppt.&lt;ref name=Estuaries&gt;{{cite web|last=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|title=Estuaries|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/estuaries/estuaries01_whatis.html|work=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salinity will not be consistent throughout a particular estuary and will be differ from one estuary to the next but its level will range from 0.5 ppt to 35 ppt.&lt;ref name="Estuaries"/&gt; In estuaries, primary producers take up [[nutrients]] such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name="Nutrient Enrichment Studies in a Coastal Plain Estuary: Phytoplankton Growth in Large-Scale, Continuous Cultures"&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Elia|first=C.F.|author1-link=Christopher D'Elia|author2=Sanders, J.G. |author3=Boynton, W.R. |title=Nutrient Enrichment Studies in a Coastal Plain Estuary: Phytoplankton Growth in Large-Scale, Continuous Cultures|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|year=1986|volume=43|issue=2|pages=397–406|doi=10.1139/f86-050|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f86-050#.Ufaeh1OBYXw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshwater inflows carry estuaries, replenishing the stock for phytoplankton use.&lt;ref name="Nutrient Enrichment Studies in a Coastal Plain Estuary: Phytoplankton Growth in Large-Scale, Continuous Cultures"/&gt; [[Sediment]]s settling out and form banks, offshore peninsulas, and barrier islands that protect the estuary from strong tidal action and currents.

[[Estuary|Estuarine ecosystems]] are fundamentally important and necessary to protect through the management of freshwater inflow because of the many [[ecosystem services]] they produce. An ecosystem service is something provided by nature that is of value to humans. Estuarine ecosystems are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet. Estuaries house such species as the blue crab, red fish, flounder, spotted seatrout, and many others for some point of the species’ life cycle. Marine habitats, such as those found in estuarine ecosystems, are valued at providing an estimated US14$ trillion worth of ecosystem goods and services annually, or 43% of the global total.&lt;ref name="The Value of the World's Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costanza |first1=R. |last2=d'Arge |first2=R. |last3=de Groot |first3=R. |last4=Farber |first4=S. |last5=Grasso |first5=M. |last6=Hannon |first6=B. |last7=Limburg |first7=K. |last8=Naeem |first8=S. |last9=O'Neill |first9=R.

This is why estuaries are important to protect and conserve.

== Global change ==

[[Global change]]s caused largely by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic influences]], or human impacts, are altering the amount of freshwater inflows to [[estuary|estuaries]].&lt;ref name=CAMEO&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparative Analysis of Marine Ecosystems Organization (CAMEO)|url=http://cameo.noaa.gov/pres_montagna.html|work=CAMEO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are diverting water from rivers and streams, decreasing the amount of flows making it to [[estuary|estuarine ecosystems]]. Since the 1960s dewatering, or removal of water from streams and rivers, has doubled and around 60% of the Earth’s runoff is captured.&lt;ref name="Ecosystems and Human Well Being: Current State and Trends"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and Human Well Being: Current State and Trends|journal=Island Press|year=2005|volume=1|page=47|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.766.aspx.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of freshwater from rivers and streams for [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] use before it reaches the coast is having a negative impact on many [[estuary|estuaries]]. Half of the world’s major cities are within 50&amp;nbsp;km of the coast, and coastal populations are 2.6 times denser than those further inland.&lt;ref name="Coastal Fluxes in the Anthropocene"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crossland|first=C.J.|title=Coastal Fluxes in the Anthropocene|year=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=978-3-540-27851-1|page=232|url=https://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/atmospheric+sciences/book/978-3-540-25450-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advances in the collection of freshwater is continually improving, further straining available freshwater resources. As the human population grows and the strain on water resources continues, the ability to effectively manage freshwater inflows into [[estuary|estuaries]] is becoming a priority worldwide.&lt;ref name="Hydrological Changes and Estuarine Dynamic"/&gt;

== Freshwater inflow management ==

Many different methodologies aimed at freshwater inflow management to maintain an [[estuary]] have been implemented throughout the world. Studies are aimed at determining the freshwater inflow amount necessary to maintain an [[estuary|estuarine ecosystem]]. One common methodology implemented in studies in several U.S. states including Texas, Florida, and California is to indirectly link estuarine resources (i.e. integrity- species composition, biomass, diversity; function- primary production, secondary production, nutrient recycling; sustainability- habitats, valued resources, ecosystem services) to freshwater inflow (i.e. quantity- timing, frequency, duration, extent; quality; tidal connections) through estuarine conditions (i.e. salinity; sediment; dissolved material; particulate material).&lt;ref name="Hydrological Changes and Estuarine Dynamic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Conceptual Model of Estuarine Freshwater Inflow Management"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alber|first=Merryl|title=A Conceptual Model of Estuarine Freshwater Inflow Management|journal=Estuaries|date=December 2002|volume=25|issue=6B|pages=1246–1261|url=http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/deltaflow/docs/exhibits/swrcb/swrcb_alber2002.pdf|doi=10.1007/bf02692222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mtata Estuary of South Africa, an Estuarine Health Index is used to compare the current state of the [[estuary]] to a predicted reference state.&lt;ref name="Estuaries and Application to the Mtata Estuary, South Africa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=J.B.|author2=Bate, C.

== Using ecosystem-based management (EBM) strategies for freshwater inflow oversight ==

Freshwater inflow management strategies require an all-encompassing approach that incorporates a large amount of data on multiple levels. This type of approach is called an ecosystem-based management strategy. [[Ecosystem-based management]] (EBM) strategies require a comprehensive approach to incorporate land, energy, and natural resource use and allocation, involving species management, natural commodities, and humans as components.&lt;ref name="Marine Ecosystem-Based Management: From Characterization to Implementation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arkema|first=K.K.|author2=Abramson, S.C. |author3=Dewsbury, B.M. |title=Marine Ecosystem-Based Management: From Characterization to Implementation|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|year=2006|volume=4|issue=10|pages=525–532|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/raimondi/labmeetingpapers/winter2007/arkema_etal.pdf|doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2006)4[525:memfct]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; EBM also incorporates data analysis of various interactions over different amounts of time and space.&lt;ref name="Master's Thesis: Stakeholder Perceptions of Ecosystem Services of Coastal Habitats"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchison|first=L.M.|title=Master's Thesis: Stakeholder Perceptions of Ecosystem Services of Coastal Habitats|year=2011|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University- Coprus Christi|location=Corpus Christi, TX|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be directed at the maintenance or enhancement of the entire riverine ecosystem, including its various aquatic and riparian biota and components from source to sea.&lt;ref name="A Global Perspective"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tharme|first=R.E.|title=A Global Perspective on Environmental Flow Assessment: Emerging Trends in the Development and Application of Environmental Flow Methodologies for Rivers|year=2003|volume=19|pages=397–441|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.736/abstract|doi=10.1002/rra.736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples of current [[ecosystem-based management]] freshwater inflow resources from Texas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4018">'''GVA Consultants''' is a Swedish marine and offshore engineering company specialising in the design of [[oil platform|offshore structures]], and [[semi-submersible]] platforms.

==History==
The experience of GVA as a marine engineering company stretches back more than 25 years. There is an even longer history of building ships of various types, semi-submersibles, jack-ups and offshore modules at the shipyard [[Götaverken|Götaverken Arendal AB]] where GVA is based.&lt;ref name="GVA History"&gt;"[http://www.gvac.se/history/GVA Official Website-About us-History]" GVA Consultants. Retrieved 7 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1970s the yard focused mainly on the offshore industry. Thus, the company designed, constructed and delivered 14 semisubmersibles from its facilities in Gothenburg. Seven units of the GVA series have also been built by yards all over the world, in different sizes and for various requirements. The units built at the yard in Gothenburg were adapted for duties such as production, drilling, diving support and accommodation/service. The deliveries included six Pacesetter type units and eight GVA designs.

The shipyard closed down in 1989 and GVA Consultants AB was established from the shipyards technical departments. GVA started out as a small company focusing on engineering services and conceptual studies. The company grew considerably during the years when larger contracts such as [[Visund]], [[troll gas field|Troll C]], [[Åsgard B]] and [[Kristin Gas Field]] were awarded to them. The company has continued to grow and has taken on even larger projects such as the [[Thunder Horse Oil Field|Thunder Horse]] and [[Atlantis Oil Field|Atlantis]] oil fields.

In 2001, [[KBR (Company)|Halliburton KBR]] (KBR), formerly Kellogg Brown &amp; Root acquired GVA Consultants AB from [[BMT Limited|British Maritime Technology Ltd]] (BMT) for an undisclosed amount."&lt;ref name="GVA Acquired"&gt;"[http://www.icis.com/Articles/2001/11/19/151472/management-in-brief.html Halliburton Buys GVA]". ICIS.com, 19 November 2001, ''Management in Brief''. Retrieved 7 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Halliburton KBR was the engineering and construction segment of [[Halliburton]], the world's largest provider of products and services to the petroleum and energy industries.

GVA Consultant's range of products and services includes: 
*Conceptual designs
*Basic designs for the GVA Series of semi-submersibles 
*Basic designs for other vessels
*Basic design for conversions or upgrades
*Consultation and project management support
*Research &amp; development

GVA is a subsidiary to KBR but operates as a fully independent company providing specialized design services.

'''Gravitational compression''' is a phenomenon in which [[gravity]], acting on the [[mass]] of an object, compresses it, reducing its size and increases the object's [[density]]. 
 
[[File:Stellar core.gif|thumb|In the [[Solar core|core]] of a star such as the [[Sun]], [[gravitational]] [[pressure]] is balanced by the outward thermal pressure from [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reactions]], temporarily halting gravitational compression.]]
At the center of a [[planet]] or [[star]], gravitational compression produces [[heat]] by the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]]. This is the mechanism that explains how [[Jupiter]] continues to [[radiation|radiate]] heat produced by its gravitational compression.&lt;ref name=SRI1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iki.rssi.ru/nineplanets/jupiter.html | title = Jupiter | publisher = Space Research Institute,Russian Academy of Sciences |accessdate = 2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common reference to gravitational compression is [[stellar evolution]]. The [[Sun]] and other [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars are produced by the initial [[gravitational collapse]] of a [[molecular cloud]]. Assuming the mass of the material is large enough, gravitational compression reduces the size of the core, increasing its [[temperature]] until [[hydrogen fusion]] can begin. This [[hydrogen]]-to-[[helium]] [[fusion reaction]] releases [[energy]] that balances the inward gravitational [[pressure]] and the star becomes stable for millions of years. No further gravitational compression occurs until the hydrogen is nearly used up, reducing the thermal pressure of the fusion reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/star_formation_010116.html | title = How a Star is Born: Clouds Lift on Missing Link  | date = 16 January 2001 | author = R.R. Britt | accessdate = 2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Sun's life, gravitational compression will turn it into a [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other end of the scale are [[Stellar evolution#Massive stars|massive stars]]. These stars burn their fuel very quickly, ending their lives as [[supernova]]e. After which further gravitational compression will produce either a [[neutron star]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the remnants.

For planets and [[natural satellite|moons]], equilibrium is reached when the [[compression (physical)|compression]] is balanced by a pressure gradient. This is due to gravity. This pressure gradient is in the opposite direction due to the strength of the material, at which point gravitational compression ceases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12622">'''Heritage conservation in Canada''' deals with actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life. Historic objects in [[Canada]] may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]], or a [[local government in Canada|municipal government]].
The [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] acts as Canada's lead advocacy organization for heritage buildings and landscapes.

==Federal level==
There are a number of heritage designations at the federal level for historic sites in Canada:
* [[National Historic Sites of Canada]] are places that have been designated by the federal [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] on the advice of the [[Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada]] (HSMBC), as being of national historic significance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/system-reseau/sec1/sites-lieux9.aspx |title=National Historic Sites of Canada System Plan - Introduction |author= |year=2000 |work= |publisher=Parks Canada |accessdate=August 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006084833/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/system-reseau/sec1/sites-lieux9.aspx |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act|Heritage Railway Stations]] are train stations owned by federally licensed railway companies recommended for protection by the HSMBC; 
* [[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act|Heritage Lighthouses]] are lighthouses deemed to be historically significant; and
* [[Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office|Federal Heritage Buildings]] are buildings owned by the federal government which are determined to be of historical and/or architectural value.

The federal government also operates related programs for the recognition of historic persons ([[Persons of National Historic Significance|National Historic Persons]]) and events ([[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)|National Historic Events]]).

==Provinces==
[[File:Provincial historic resource of Alberta plaque.JPG|thumb|This [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] indicates that the building is protected by the [[Government of Alberta]]]]
Each provincial government has distinct systems and approaches to heritage conservation.  They may delegate the authority to preserve historic buildings to municipalities, and / or have a provincial [[heritage register]].

For example, in the province of [[Alberta]], only sites owned by the provincial government and run as a functioning historic site or museum are known as [[Provincial historic sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Sites or Provincial Historic Areas]].  Buildings and sites owned by [[privately owned|private citizens and companies]] or [[Canadian federalism|other levels or branches of government]] may gain one of two levels of historic designation, "Registered Historic Resource" or "Provincial Historic Resource".&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/default.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Historic designation in Alberta is governed by the Historic Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/Documents/acts/H09.CFM Alberta Queen's Printer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The province also lists buildings deemed historically significant by municipal governments on the Alberta Register of Historic Places, which is also part of the larger [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] although this does not imply provincial or federal government status or protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/municipal.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program - Municipal Historic Resource Designation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205022849/http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/municipal.aspx |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To supplement this system, the province also run the Alberta Main Street Program  which helps to preserve historic buildings in the [[downtown]]s of [[List of communities in Alberta|smaller communities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertamainstreet.org/ The Alberta Main Street Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100324/http://albertamainstreet.org/ |date=2011-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis for the preservation system in Alberta is the Heritage Survey Program, which is a survey of 80,000 historic buildings in Alberta which lack a protected status but are documented for possible future protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/heritagesurveyprogram.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Heritage Survey Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164327/http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/heritagesurveyprogram.aspx |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], the [[Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec]] is the main heritage register, it includes both protected and unprotected properties.  The [[Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec]] is a non-profit organization created in 1995 to promote the conservation of churches and other religious heritage buildings in the province.&lt;ref name="patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/en/organisme/mission.php|title=Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec|accessdate=2009-03-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621103711/http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/en/organisme/mission.php|archivedate=2008-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipalities==
Cities, towns, counties and other [[local government in Canada]] may use [[zoning]] and other [[bylaws]] to restrict the demolition of individual historic buildings or districts.  They may maintain a municipal heritage register, such as [[Edmonton]]'s "Register of Historic Resources in Edmonton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonton.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_284_220_0_43/http%3B/CMSServer/COEWeb/infrastructure+planning+and+building/Historic+Resources/ City of Edmonton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Vancouver]] uses a traditional heritage register&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/planning/heritage/Fact8.htm Vancouver.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; and a new system called a [[density bank]], under which developers are rewarded for preserving and restoring heritage buildings by being awarded exceptions to restrictions (usually height restrictions) on other sites they own.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityhallwatch.wordpress.com/special-topics/density-bank-transfers-and-more/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montreal]], one of Canada's oldest and most historically rich cities, the [[Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal]] advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation.&lt;ref name="Conseil du patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=2981,3122714&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal|publisher=City of Montreal|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: [[Save Montreal]], co-founded by [[Michael Fish (architect)|Michael Fish]] in 1974, and [[Heritage Montreal]], founded by [[Phyllis Lambert]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Gravenor, Kristian (October 23, 2003).

== Government approach to policy ==
Two of the primary conservation tools in Canada are the [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] and the ''[[Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]]''. This document  was the result of a major collaborative effort among federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, heritage conservation professionals, heritage developers and many individual Canadians.  A pan–Canadian collaboration, it is intended to reinforce the development of a culture of conservation in Canada, which will continue to find a unique expression in each of the jurisdictions and regions of the country.  In the document, conservation approaches are broken down into three categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, and Restoration.  As published in the ''[[Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]]'', these conservation approaches are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=terms&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/nor-sta/request.aspx?page=sec2/page2b_e Standards and Guidelines - Definitions of Some Key Terms], ''Canada's Historic Places''. Retrieved 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Preservation:''' the action or process of protecting, maintaining, and/or stabilizing the existing materials, form, and integrity of a historic place or of an individual component, while protecting its heritage value. Preservation can include both short-term and interim measures to protect or stabilize the place, as well as long-term actions to retard deterioration or prevent damage so that the place can be kept serviceable through routine maintenance and minimal repair, rather than extensive replacement and new construction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Rehabilitation:''' the action or process of making possible a continuing or compatible contemporary use of a historic place or an individual component, through repair, alterations, and/ or additions, while protecting its heritage value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Restoration:''' the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic place or of an individual component, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A hilum can also be a nucleus of a starch grain; the point around which layers of starch are deposited.

The adjectival form ''hilar'' denotes the presence of such a mark, and can be used as a distinguishing characteristic of a [[seed]] or [[spore]].

'''''[[In-situ]]'' conservation''' is the on-site [[Conservation movement|conservation]] or the conservation of genetic resources in natural populations of [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]], such as [[forest genetic resources]] in natural populations of Teagan species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjfVFGM4p6wC|title=Biodiversity and Its Conservation in India|last=Negi|first=Sharad Singh|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788185182889|page=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process of protecting an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]] in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], either by protecting or restoring the habitat itself, or by defending the species from [[Predation|predators]]. It is applied to conservation of [[agricultural biodiversity]] in [[agro ecosystem]]s by farmers, especially those using unconventional farming practices.


==Methods==
About 4% of the total geographical area of the country is used for ''in situ'' conservation. The following methods are presently used for ''in situ'' conservation.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! In-situ conservation !! Number available
|-
| Biosphere reserves || 18
|-
| National parks || 104
|-
| Wild-life sanctuaries || 543
|-
| Biodiversity hotspots || 4
|-
|}

===Biosphere reserve===
Biosphere reserves cover very large areas, often more than 5000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. They are used to protect species for a long time. Currently, there are 18 Biosphere Reserves in India.

|-
! Name !! State
|-
| Nanda Devi || Uttarakhand
|-
| Nokrek || Meghalaya
|-
| Manas || Assam
|-
|Sundarban || West Bengal
|
|}

===National parks===
A national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. It is usually a small reserve covering an area of about 100 to 500 square kilometers. Within biosphere reserves, one or more national parks may also exist. Currently, there are 103 national parks in India.

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
A wildlife sanctuary is an area which is reserved for the conservation of animals only. Currently, there are 543 wild sanctuaries in India.
{| class="wikitable"

{| class="wikitable"

===Biodiversity Hotspots===
According to Conservation international, to qualify as a hotspot a region must meet two strict criteria :
 
• it must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (∆ 0.5% of the world's total) as endemics,

• it has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat.

===Gene sanctuary===
A gene sanctuary is an area where plants are conserved.
It includes both biosphere reserves as well as national parks.
India has set up its first gene sanctuary in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya for wild relatives of citrus. Efforts are also being made to set up gene sanctuaries for banana, sugarcane, rice and mango.

===Community reserves===
It is the type of protected area introduced in Wildlife Protection Amendment Act 2002 to provide legal support to community or privately owned reserves which cannot be designated as national park or wildlife sanctuary.

===Sacred groves===
They are tracts of forest set aside where all the trees and wildlife within are venerated and given total protection.

==Benefits==
One benefit of ''in situ'' conservation is that it maintains recovering populations in the environment where they have developed their distinctive properties. Another benefit is that this strategy helps ensure the ongoing processes of evolution and adaptation within their environments. As a last resort, [[ex-situ conservation]] may be used on some or all of the population, when ''in situ'' conservation is too difficult, or impossible. The species gets adjusted to the natural disasters like drought, floods, forest fires and this method is very cheap and convenient.

==Reserves==
Wildlife and livestock conservation is mostly based on nothing. This involves the protection of wildlife habitats. Also, sufficiently large reserves are maintained to enable the target species to exist in large numbers. The population size must be sufficient to enable the necessary [[genetic diversity]] to survive within the population, so that it has a good chance of continuing to [[Adaptation (biology)|adapt]] and [[evolution|evolve]] over time. This reserve size can be calculated for target species by examining the population density in naturally occurring situations. The reserves must then be protected from intrusion or destruction by man, and against other catastrophes.

==Agriculture==
In [[agriculture]], ''in situ conservation'' techniques are an effective way to improve, maintain, and use traditional or native varieties of agricultural crops. Such methodologies link the positive output of scientific research with farmers' experience and field work.

First, the accessions of a variety stored at a [[germplasm]] bank and those of the same variety multiplied by farmers are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory, under different situations and stresses. Thus, the scientific knowledge about the production characteristics of the native varieties is enhanced. Later, the best tested accessions are crossed, mixed, and multiplied under replicable situations. At last, these improved accessions are supplied to the producers. Thus, farmers are enabled to crop improved selections of their own varieties, instead of being lured to substitute their own varieties with commercial ones or to abandon their crop. This technique of conservation of agricultural biodiversity is more successful in marginal areas, where commercial varieties are not expedient, due to climate and [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] constraints. Or where the taste and cooking characteristics of traditional varieties compensate for their lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;G. Avila, L. Guzmán, M. Céspedes 2004.

'''The International Society of Military Sciences''' ('''ISMS''') is an international organization whose stated aim is to build a strong network for the creation, development, exchange and diffusion of research and knowledge about war, conflict management and peace support efforts. The ISMS was founded in October 2008. The [[Austrian National Defence Academy]], the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], the [[Danish Defence|Royal Danish Defence College]], the [[Finnish National Defence University]], the [[Koninklijke Militaire Academie|Netherlands Defence Academy]], the [[Norwegian Defence University College]], the [[Swedish National Defence College]] and the [[Baltic Defence College]] established this society with the intention to further research and academic education in military arts and sciences in the broadest sense.

==Establishing the ISMS==

In the summer of 2007 the Faculty of Military Sciences, Netherlands Defence Academy, started working on more international collaboration on an institutional level. Canada, Sweden and Austria were the first military institutes and universities which were approached for collaboration. Soon four other institutes joined in. In November 2011, the [[National Defence University of Warsaw]] and the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)]] were voted in. The Royal Military Academy of Belgium withdrew their membership before the council meeting in Oslo, May 2017.

==Letter of Intent==

The formal signing of the ''Letter of Intent'' was on October 22, 2008 in Copenhagen. That day the participating academies also decided to formally present the ISMS in November 2009 during its first annual international conference which was to be held in the [[Netherlands]]. The theme of this first conference was “''Security in 2020 in a Multi-Polar World''”.

===Letter of Intent===

1) The undersigned institutions of Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, and the Baltic Defence College (later referred to as the institutions) agree to establish a society intended to further research and academic education in military arts and sciences in the broadest sense. This association is titled International Society of Military Sciences (hereafter referred to as the Society).  
 
2) The purpose of the Society is to build a network for the creation, development, exchange and diffusion of research and knowledge about war, conflict management and peace support efforts.

3) The Society will establish an annual conference, and one or more workshops per year.  Activities include communications and publications to support a research network within topics such as: war studies; military history; military technology; command and control, leadership and basic competence; law and ethics; security and defence policy and strategy; armed forces and society; and defence economics and management. These are detailed in Annex A.

4) The representatives of the member institutions constitute the Council as the highest authority governing the Society.  The Council elects a Board governing the Society.  The purpose of the Board is to initiate and coordinate the activities of the Society.  The institution hosting the annual conference provides the secretariat for the Society for the period of one year.

5) Society members commit themselves to organise and participate in various workshops, conference or working groups, with the understanding that they will endeavour to lead at least one working group or workshop and participate in at least two others.  A tentative schedule of upcoming events is attached at Annex B.
 
6) The Society will be established for the four-year term in October 2008 upon signing of Letter of Intent by the institutions, and it is announced at the First Annual Conference. 
 
7) The first Annual Conference will be held in November 2009.  Invitations to participate in the Conference and to join the Society will be distributed widely.  The Council will consider applications for new membership by compatible organizations annually. However, participation in conferences and workshops is welcomed at any time.

==Organizational Format==
The ISMS is an institutional membership organization composed of higher military educational institutions in smaller and medium seized nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isofms.org/cms_uploads/ABon-WFeichtinger2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Membership of the ISMS is open to defence universities and colleges conducting research and teaching at the highest national level. The Charter specifically state that its members must be free to conduct research without political control and interference and they must operate in a political system with firm democratic control over the armed forces. More so, membership is by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isofms.org/cms_uploads/CHARTER%20of%20the%20ISMS%20adopted%20June%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The governing body of the ISMS is the '''Council''', which is made up by one representative of each member institution. The '''Chairmanship''' of the Council is assumed by the '''ISMS Presidency'''. The Presidency of the ISMS rotates on an annual bases between the member institutions. It is the role of the Presidency to host the '''annual ISMS conference''' and act as the ''ISMS secretariat'' for the period between the annual conferences. ISMS uses a thematic '''Working Group''' division where each working group is led by a '''Chairperson'''.

The '''Jacquard machine''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒakaʁ|lang}}) is a device fitted to a [[power loom]] that simplifies the process of manufacturing [[textiles]] with such complex patterns as [[Brocade (fabric)|brocade]], [[damask]] and [[matelassé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |title=Fabric Glossary |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170019/http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "The Age of Revolution", (London 1962; repr. 2008), p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; The loom was controlled by a "chain of cards"; a number of [[punched card]]s laced together into a continuous sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. Several such paper cards, generally white in color, can be seen in the images below. Chains, like Bouchon's earlier use of [[paper tape]], allowed sequences of any length to be constructed, not limited by the size of a card.

It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen [[Basile Bouchon]] (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and [[Jacques Vaucanson]] (1740).&lt;ref&gt;[[#RAZY|C. Razy]] p.120 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; A static display of a Jacquard loom is the centrepiece of the [[Musée des Tissus et des Arts décoratifs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museedestissus.com |title=Musée des Tissus et des Arts Décoratifs |publisher=Museedestissus.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lyon.  Live displays of a Jacquard loom are available at a few private museums around Lyon and also twice a day at La Maison des Canuts, as well as at other locations around the world.

Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving inventions as Jacquard [[shedding (loom)|shedding]] made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving. The term "Jacquard" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles, such as [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrillo Chapman|first=Lisa|title=Textile Design Engineering Within the Product Shape|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=1109003986|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaHxO8qgZFYC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=jacquard+knitting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1K8YUbyEJ4yo0AXOkoDgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jacquard%20knitting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of replaceable [[punched cards]] to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the [[history of computing hardware]].

==History==
[[File:Telaio Jacquard 1849.jpg|thumb|19th century Jacquard loom]]
In former times, if figured designs were required, this was done on a [[drawloom]]. The [[heddle]]s with warp ends to be pulled up were manually selected by a second operator (draw boy), apart from the weaver. It was slow and labour-intensive, with practical limitations on the complexity of the pattern.

The first important improvement of the draw loom took place in 1725, when [[Basile Bouchon]] introduced the principle of applying a perforated band of paper. A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, and the length of the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The Jacquard machine subsequently evolved from this.

Joseph Marie Jacquard recognized that although weaving was intricate, it was repetitive, and saw that a [[mechanism (technology)|mechanism]] could be developed for the production of sophisticated patterns just as it had been done for the production of simple patterns.

It is difficult to determine what part of the 'Jacquard' machine was designed by Jacquard himself. He may have combined the best mechanical elements of other inventors, but - at any rate - the machine he made must have differed from its predecessors in arrangement and minor working details. It was similar in most general principles to [[Vaucanson]]'s arrangement, except that he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual paste board cards and his square prism (or card 'cylinder'), which he is credited with having fully perforated on each of its four sides in lieu of [[Vaucanson]]'s perforated 'barrel'. Jacquard's machine also contained eight rows of needles and uprights as compared with [[Vaucanson]]'s double row, of which modifications enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the harness by knotted cords, which he elevated by a single trap board.

One of the chief advantages claimed for the Jacquard machine was that unlike previous damask-weaving machines, in which the figuring shed was usually drawn once for every four shots, with the new apparatus, it could be drawn on every shot, thus producing a fabric with greater definition of outline.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Fred (1912). ''Jacquard Mechanisms and Harness Mounting''. John Heywood Ltd., Technical Book Depot, Halifax, Yorks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacquard's invention had a deep influence on [[Charles Babbage]]. In that respect, he is viewed by some authors as a precursor of modern [[computing]] science.&lt;ref&gt;Essinger, James (2004). ''Jacquard's web''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280578-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation==
[[File:Jacquard 2.jpg|thumb|Jacquard 2]]
On the diagram to the right, the cards are fastened into a continuous chain(1) which passes over a square box.  At each quarter rotation a new card is presented to the Jacquard head which represents one row.  The box swings from the right to the position shown and presses against the control rods(2).  Where there is a hole the rod passes through the card and is unmoved whereas if the hole is not punched the rod is pushed to the left.  Each rod acts upon a hook(3).  When the rod is pushed in the hook moves out of position to the left, a rod that is not pushed in leaves its hook in place.  A beam(4) then rises under the hooks and those hooks in the rest location are raised; the hooks that have been displaced are not moved by the beam.  Each hook can have multiple cords(5).  The cords pass through a guide(6) and are attached to their [[heddle]](7) and a return weight(8).  The heddles raise the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] to create the [[shed (weaving)|shed]] through which the [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] carrying the [[weft]] will pass.  A loom with a 400 hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across.

The term "Jacquard loom" is somewhat inaccurate.  It is the "Jacquard head" that adapts to a great many [[dobby loom]]s that allow the weaving machine to then create the intricate patterns often seen in [[Jacquard weaving]].

Jacquard looms, although relatively common in the textile industry, are not as ubiquitous as dobby looms which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate. However, unlike jacquard looms, they are not capable of producing so many different weaves from one [[Warp (weaving)|warp]].  Modern jacquard looms are controlled by computers in place of the original punched cards, and can have thousands of hooks.

The threading of a Jacquard loom is so labor-intensive that many looms are threaded only once. Subsequent [[Warp (weaving)|warp]]s are then tied into the existing warp with the help of a knotting robot which ties each new thread on individually.  Even for a small loom with only a few thousand [[Warp (weaving)|warp ends]] the process of re-threading can take days.

==Mechanical Jacquard looms==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.cards.jpg|right|thumb|Punched cards in use in a Jacquard loom.]]
[[File:Masson Mills WTM 10 Jacquard Card Cutter 5890.JPG|thumb|A punch for Jacquard cards]]
Originally the Jacquard machines were [[machine|mechanical]], and the fabric design was stored in a series of [[punched card]]s which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards often were small and only independently controlled a relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the loom width. Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control, with fewer repeats, and hence larger designs could be woven across the loom width.

A [[factory]] must choose looms and shedding mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule the more warp control required the greater the expense. So it is not economical to purchase Jacquard machines if one can make do with a [[Dobby loom|dobby mechanism]]. As well as the capital expense, the Jacquard machines are more costly to maintain, as they are complex and require higher skilled personnel; an expensive design system is required to prepare the designs for the loom, and possibly a card-cutting machine. Weaving is more costly since Jacquard mechanisms are more likely to produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. For these reasons it is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.

==Electronic Jacquard looms==
It is recorded that in 1855 a Frenchman &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/irishlinentrade00smitgoog#page/n110/mode/2up/ The Irish Linen Trade Hand-Book and Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; adapted the Jacquard mechanism to a system by which it could be worked by electro-magnets. There was significant interest, however trials were not successful, and the development was soon lost in history.

Bonas Machine Company Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonas.co.uk/ Bonas.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; launched the first successful electronic Jacquard at ITMA,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cematex.org/ Cematex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milan]] in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and single end warp control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly and may not be required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing single end warp control are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.

[[Linen]] products associated with Jacquard weaving are linen damask napery, Jacquard apparel fabrics and damask bed linen.

Jacquard weaving of course uses all sorts of fibers and blends of fibers, and it is used in the production of fabrics for many end uses. Research is under way to develop layered and shaped items as reinforcing components for structures made from [[composite material]]s.

==Importance in computing==
The Jacquard head used replaceable [[punched cards]] to control a sequence of operations.  It is considered an important step in the [[history of computing hardware]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to change the pattern of the loom's weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of [[computer programming]] and data entry. [[Charles Babbage]] knew of Jacquard looms and planned to use cards to store programs in his [[Analytical Engine]]. In the late 19th century, [[Herman Hollerith]] took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched card tabulating machine which he used to input data for the [[1890 U.S. Census]]. A large data processing industry using punched-card technology, developed in the first half of the twentieth century{{mdash}}dominated initially by the [[International Business Machine]] corporation (IBM), with its line of [[unit record equipment]]. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by [[plugboard]]s.

Some early computers, such as the 1944 [[IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator]] (Harvard Mark I) received program instructions from a paper tape punched with holes, similar to Jacquard's string of cards. Later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory, though cards were commonly used to load the programs into memory. Punched cards remained in use in computing up until the mid 1980s.

In response to rapid changes in large landscapes/marine landscapes and uncertain environmental and social changes, conservation organizations need to overcome barriers to cooperation, build governance structures, combine ecological, biological and physical sciences with social science insights, and improve with new information. . Make a decision. The Adaptive Common Governance Framework is a social network supported by different stakeholders that uses dynamic learning to provide adaptive information. Inhibitors of adaptive co-governance include deep-rooted organizational culture, conflicting tasks/jurisdiction, and different interests among stakeholders. By providing communication, a platform for building relationships and stakeholder engagement, bridging entities can promote adaptive co-governance. This paper highlights the need for institutionalization of adaptive adaptation of social ecosystems and suggests that landscape conservation cooperatives (LCCs) establish cross-border entities within a broader framework of common governance. Rural Credit Cooperatives is a network of government and non-government protection organizations that promote the protection of rapidly changing social ecosystems by providing the structure and incentives for collaboration and shared learning.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BERKES|first=FIKRET|date=2004-06|title=Rethinking Community-Based Conservation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00077.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=621–630|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00077.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Queensland Plan.pdf|thumb|Landscape Conservation]]
Modern landscape planning and design is a work that coordinates the relationship between man and nature in the process of human development, social progress and natural evolution. Landscape planning research covers topics such as land development, land use, and environmental quality. Troll proposed the concept of “landscape ecology”. Think of the landscape as "the whole of the space and everything that the vision touches in the human living environment." Buchwald believes that the so-called landscape can be understood as a comprehensive feature of a certain space on the surface. Egler proposed the concept of total human ecosystem. Dansereau advocates the use of "human ecology" to study the impact of humans on the landscape. McHag proposed to use the entire human ecosystem as a target for landscape ecology and landscape ecological planning. The process of landscape planning is to help people living in natural systems or using the resources in the system to find the most appropriate route (McHarg, 1969). It is a plan based on ecological theory and knowledge (Sedon, 1986, Leita and Ahern, 2002).&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Landscape ecology considers the lithosphere, biosphere and wisdom circle in the human living space as an integral part of the overall human ecosystem, and studies the structural and functional relationships between the various landscape elements (relatively homogeneous ecosystems). Landscape ecology is the guiding theory of landscape ecological design. The landscape ecological design with the information society as the background is the process of human beings to actively arrange and coordinate the elements of the overall landscape (including natural and cultural). All elements of the landscape as a design variable and goal, ultimately optimize the landscape system structure and function. Landscape planning provides a comprehensive solution through close collaboration with spatial planning. Landscape planning has gradually expanded to the areas of river basin planning, regional planning, land planning, and ecological remediation and restoration. The objects directly faced by landscape planning have been extended to the land complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-12-15|title=Institutional incentives for managing the landscape: Inducing cooperation for the production of ecosystem services|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907000948|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=64|issue=2|pages=333–343|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.01.012|issn=0921-8009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape planning is a material spatial plan with the overall goal of achieving sustainable landscapes or ecosystems through land and natural resource conservation and utilization planning. Landscape ecological planning has the following basic principles: natural priority principle, overall design principle, design adaptability principle and multidisciplinary comprehensive principle. Beta Langfi pointed out that "it is not only to study parts and processes in isolation, but also to study the interaction of various parts. The organism should be considered as a whole or system. Environmental protection requires systematic thinking. Landscape planning is required for overall planning.

== Implementation ==

Maintaining biodiversity by protecting a representative and well-connected habitat network in a managed landscape requires wisely protecting, managing and restoring habitats on multiple scales. Scholars suggest that the integration of natural sciences and social sciences in the form of “two-dimensional gap analysis” is an effective tool for implementing biodiversity policies. The tool links biologically relevant “horizontal” ecological issues to “vertical” issues related to institutions and other social issues. Taking forest biodiversity as an example, it is illustrated how to combine the ecological and institutional aspects of biodiversity conservation to promote environmentally sustainable regional development. In particular, people use regional gap analysis to identify local forest types and determine habitat modeling for “green infrastructure” functional connectivity as a tool for horizontal gap analysis. For the vertical dimension, it is suggested how to assess the success of social sciences in implementing biodiversity policies in real landscapes by identifying institutional barriers when implementing policies. It is believed that this interdisciplinary approach can be applied to a range of other environments, including other terrestrial biota and aquatic ecosystems, where functional habitat connectivity, non-linear response to habitat loss, and multiple economic and social benefits occur together. In the same landscape.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-10-01|title=Systematic conservation planning products for land-use planning: Interpretation for implementation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000632070500176X|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=125|issue=4|pages=441–458|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.04.019|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Landscape conservation partners at Konza Prairie (19752031495).jpg|thumb|Landscape conservation partners at Konza Prairie]]
There is a clear need for policies and practices that integrate biodiversity issues into sectors outside the protected area, especially in view of the local authorities’ extensive decentralization of land use decisions. Therefore, people must develop systematic (target-driven) protection planning products that are both user-friendly and useful to users, and are applicable to local government officials, consultants, and elected decision makers. Through the systematic conservation planning assessment of subtropical jungle biomes in South Africa, implementation opportunities and constraints are considered from the outset to work with stakeholders to develop products (maps and guides) that can be used for local government land use planning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Assessing joint input with stakeholders, developed (i) Megaconservancy Networks, a multi-ownership large conservation corridor for biodiversity processes; (ii) protection status categories for all biodiversity characteristics (extremely endangered) , endangered, fragile, not currently vulnerable), achieving conservation goals based on existing habitats, and (iii) integrating (i) and (ii). The map was further explained to municipal decision makers through the corresponding land use guidelines for each type of conservation status. In order to raise awareness of the value of biodiversity and its services, a handbook was prepared, which also introduces new and upcoming environmental legislation. Within 18 months of producing these products, the evidence that maps and their guidelines are effectively integrated or mainstreamed into land-use planning is encouraging. However, there is still a need to increase efforts to raise awareness of the value of biodiversity and its services among many stakeholder groups. Despite this, the way people plan to implement by considering the needs and obligations of end users has produced positive results. Finally, suggestions for further improvements are proposed.

In 2010, Arctic LLC provided approximately $2 million in funding for climate-related research and data integration, and provided the same amount of support through in-kind contributions to the workforce and funding from other agencies and NGOs. One product of this initial cycle is the report "Integrating the Alaska Landscape into the Future." The project uses a climate envelope model approach to assess how future climate scenarios match the average temperature and precipitation conditions from 2000 to 2009. The results indicate that approximately 60% of Alaska may be transformed into a new climatic biome in the twenty-first century. .

In 2011, approximately $1.3 million in funding from the Arctic LCC and $1 million in leverage will support more than 20 different research and data integration projects. With the development of a long-term scientific plan, the ALCC Steering Committee makes a temporary selection of proposals based on responsiveness, feasibility, level of cooperation, response to management issues, and many other criteria for ALCC objectives. Currently, six technical working groups - permafrost, coastal processes, climate simulation, hydrology, Arctic biology and geospatial data - provide input for the development of the Arctic LCC Science Program, which will guide future project financing strategies. The draft plan will be published at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angelstam|first=Per|last2=Mikusiński|first2=Grzegorz|last3=Rönnbäck|first3=Britt-Inger|last4=Östman|first4=Anders|last5=Lazdinis|first5=Marius|last6=Roberge|first6=Jean-Michel|last7=Arnberg|first7=Wolter|last8=Olsson|first8=Jan|date=2003|title=Two-Dimensional Gap Analysis: A Tool for Efficient Conservation Planning and Biodiversity Policy Implementation|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4315436|journal=Ambio|volume=32|issue=8|pages=527–534}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Biologist speaking at the Friday morning Town Hall session, where attendees were welcome to discuss their ideas on how to further landscape conservation. (5471417121).jpg|thumb|Landscape Conservation Cooperatives Influence]]
As the area covered by natural ecosystems decreases, the protection of tropical biodiversity in agricultural landscapes becomes even more important. The Shadow Coffee Cooperative in El Salvador analyzed the impact of local livelihoods, types of cooperation and selected biophysical variables (altitude, slope, percent shade, forest distance, coffee density and coffee age) on tree biodiversity.

The tree stock of 51 samples from the coffee cooperative included 2,743 individuals from 46 families and 123 identified tree species. Some cooperatives have different species richness and diameter, and the greater the abundance, the greater the stem density; other biophysical variables have little effect on diversity. The amount of shadows in coffee plantations varies among cooperatives, especially during the rainy season. Among the species recently reported in a study of neighbouring forests and cooperatives (N = 227 species), 16% were present in two locations. Three coffee plantations account for 35% of the total number of species reported by all cooperatives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Studies have shown that the number of tree species found in coffee plantations increases with the density of shady trees contained in the system. In turn, agro-ecological management influenced by farmers' livelihood strategies and types of cooperation directly affects the composition of the shady canopy. Important factors to consider are the type of farmer organization, the cost of maintaining protected species, and the potential benefits of protecting a livelihood strategy that may be for farmers.

== Consequence ==

The field of system protection planning has matured to the extent that it can be effectively applied on the mainland. Influenced by computer science to conservation biology, it uses a quantitative geospatial approach to spatially prioritize conservation decisions (Ball et al. 2009). The basic feature is to protect ecosystems, species and processes in the network that are related to environmental change and that can adapt to environmental changes (Anderson, 2014). The LCC system is very broad in space and is well suited to applied science to achieve these outcomes: (a) the layout of core protected areas, (b) creating network connectivity to address climate change, and (c) assessing land-use vulnerability changes, ( d) combine social constraints with biodiversity and ecosystem services goals, and (e) compare options.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;
[[File:Epa Strategic Plan Fiscal Year 2014 2018.pdf|thumb|Landscape Conservation Cooperatives Consequence]]
While system protection plans require a large data set on protection goals, the LCC structure helps capture this data, saving money when partners share data and expertise. LCC Science is conducted by conservation scientists from academic institutions, private companies and NGOs. As stakeholder engagement improves the science of systems protection planning, this collective “bottom-up” approach provides modelers with a source of expertise that is critical to establishing conservation goals, setting goals and reviewing results. . . Finally, the LCC structure is exactly the same as the dissemination results, because the collaborators form a channel back to their institutions, organizations, institutions and the public. Twenty-two low-cost lines are further connected to the National Network Coordinator and Small Employee Network.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

LCC has previously implemented multi-state and non-governmental organization wildlife conservation initiatives. However, these are difficult to maintain because there are no federally-managed cooperatives to fund and organize the required spatially clear data to help prioritize regional protection spending. When rural information centers focus on the entire landscape, species and ecosystems, ecological processes, human impacts and interests, and priorities for time and space actions, they often plan (if implemented) to protect the country's biodiversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">The '''laser voltage probe (LVP)''' is a laser-based voltage and timing [[waveform]] acquisition system which is used to perform [[failure analysis]] on [[Flip chip|flip-chip]] integrated circuits. The device to be analyzed is de-encapsulated in order to expose the silicon surface. The [[Wafer (electronics)|silicon substrate]] is thinned mechanically using a back side mechanical thinning tool. The thinned device is then mounted on a movable stage and connected to an electrical stimulus source. Signal measurements are performed through the back side of the device after substrate thinning has been performed. The device being probed must be electrically stimulated using a repeating test pattern, with a trigger pulse provided to the LVP as reference. The operation of the LVP is similar to that of a sampling oscilloscope.

==Theory of operation==
The LVP instrument measures voltage waveform signals in the device diffusion regions. Device imaging is accomplished through the use of a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|laser scanning microscope]] (LSM). The LVP uses dual [[infrared]] (IR) [[laser]]s to perform both device imaging and waveform acquisition. One laser is used to acquire images or waveforms from the device, while the second laser provides a reference which may be used to subtract unwanted noise from the signal data being acquired. On an electrically active device, the instrument monitors the changes in the phase of the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] field surrounding a signal being applied to a junction.

The instrument obtains voltage waveform and timing information by monitoring the interaction of [[laser]] light with the changes in the electric field across a [[p-n junction]]. As the [[laser]] reaches the silicon surface, a certain amount of that light is reflected back. The amount of reflected [[laser]] light from the junction is sampled at various points in time. The changing [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] field at the [[P-n junction|junction]] affects the amount of laser light that is reflected back. By plotting the variations in reflected laser light versus time, it is possible to construct a timing waveform of the signal at the junction. As the test pattern continues to loop, additional measurements are acquired and averaged into the previous measurements. Over a period of time, this averaging of measurements produces a more refined waveform. The end result is a waveform that is representative of the electrical signal present at the [[P-n junction|junction]].

This is a list of notable [[8-bit]] computer [[palette (computing)|color palettes]], and graphics, which were primarily manufactured from 1975 to 1985. Although some of them use [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#Regular RGB palettes|RGB palettes]], more commonly they have 4, 16 or more color palettes that are not bit nor level combinations of [[RGB]] primaries, but fixed ROM/circuitry colors selected by the manufacturer. Due to mixed-bit architectures, the ''n''-bit distinction is not always a strict categorization. Another common mistake is that some assume that a color palette of a given computer is what it can display all at once. Resolution is also a crucial aspect when criticizing an 8-bit computer, as many offer different modes with different amounts of colors on screen, and different resolutions, with the intent of trading off resolution for color, and vice versa.

==World System Teletext==

===Level 1===
[[World System Teletext]] Level 1 (1976) uses a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#3-bit RGB|3-bit RGB]], 8-color palette. Teletext has 40×25 characters per page of which the first row is reserved for a page header. Every character cell has a background color and a text color. These attributes along with others are set through control codes which each occupy one character position. Graphics characters consisting of 2×3 cells can used following a graphics color attribute. Up to a maximum of 72×69 blocky pixels can be used on a page.

===Apple II series===
{{see also|Apple II graphics}}

The [[Apple II]] series features a 16-color [[composite video]] palette, based on the [[YIQ]] color space used by the NTSC color TV system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laboratorium.net/archive/2009/03/08/why_did_the_applie_ii_have_six_colors|title=The Laboratorium : Why Did the Apple II Have Six Colors?|work=laboratorium.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.downloads.reactivemicro.com/Public/Users/Grant_Stockley/Apple2MoreColorsBYTEJun1979.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The Apple II features "lowres" and "hires" modes.

The Apple II features "lo-res" and "hi-res" modes. The 40x48 pixel lo-res mode allowed 15 different colors plus a duplicate gray.&lt;ref&gt;http://apple-2.com/pdf/bbfront.png&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Apple graphic applications used the hi-res mode, which had 280×192 pixels (effectively 140x192 on a color monitor). The hi-res mode allowed six colors: black, white, blue, orange, green and purple.

==Atari 400/800/XL/XE==
The early [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400 and 800]] computers use a palette of 128 colours (a bit similar to the one used on the [[Atari 2600]] console, and the [[Commodore 16]] and [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]]), using 4 bits for chrominance, and 3 for luminance. Screen modes may vary from 320×192 (384x240 with [[overscan]]) to 40×24, using 2 or 4 simultaneous colours, or 80×192 (96x240 with [[overscan]]) using 16 colours. After 2 years (late 1981) the CTIA graphics chip was replaced with the GTIA chip thus increasing the palette to 256 colours ([[CTIA and GTIA]]).

The [[ANTIC]] chip in the [[Atari 8-bit family]] computers (400, 800, XL and XE models) has an instruction set to run programs (called [[display list]]) which permits many more colours on the screen at once. There are a number of possible [[Software-driven graphics modes for the Atari 8-bit computers|software-driven graphics modes]].

==Mattel Aquarius==
The [[Mattel Aquarius]] computer has only a text mode with 40×24 characters, which graphic mode is obtained from low resolution blocks, providing an 80×72 resolution. The colour attribute area is also on this 40×24 characters area, and used from a pixel group of 2×3. The colours used in the palette are fixed and 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://atariage.com/forums/uploads/monthly_07_2014/post-3819-0-00736800-1405189983.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodore==
For all the following computers of this brand, the Pb and Pr coordinates for the [[YPbPr]] [[composite video]] colors are always the [[cosine]] and the [[sine]], respectively, of angles multiple of 22.5 degrees (i.e. a quarter of 90°), as the engineerers were inspired by the [[NTSC]] '''color wheel''', a radial way to figure out the Pb and Pr coordinates of points equidistant from the center of the chroma plane, the gray. You can find the formula needed to convert [[YPbPr]] to RGB at http://www.equasys.de/colorconversion.html
Consumers in Europe (which uses PAL) considered the Commodore colours to be more "washed out" and less vivid than those provided by computers such as the Spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfonsomartone.itb.it/fztsmo.html "Spectrum vs C64" match, Italy, 1985] "The blue was simply stunning. The red made the room warm. The magenta was like an exotic icecream. The green was something like freshly rained grass. The cyan was like the ocean's water. The yellow seemed got off from a fluorescent pen. And the white was clean and soft ... The C64 screen first became black (but not too much), then became white (an exaggerated white), then orange, then something like bluish, then a vaguely magenta, then a poor water-greenish, then a bright bluish, then a faded yellow, then a weird brown, and then a light gray... well, all "pastel-like" colours"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrogamescollector.com/zx-spectrum-vs-commodore-64-the-playground-argument-settled/ ZX Spectrum vs Commodore 64 – the playground argument settled] "you will remember the playground taunts regarding washed out colours, peeks and pokes and the relative lack of software in your local [[WH Smith]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myreviewer.com/Article/142108/ZX-Spectrum-vs-Commodore-64-My-Computer-is-Better-Than-Yours ZX Spectrum vs Commodore 64] "the C64 had muddy colours...but whack up the colour saturation of your TV and most of that was alleviated"&lt;/ref&gt;

===VIC-20===

The [[Commodore VIC-20]] features a [[MOS Technology VIC]] chip which produces a 16-color [[YPbPr]] [[composite video]] palette.&lt;ref name="fpgaarcade_com-6561"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 6561 VIC chip |url=http://www.fpgaarcade.com/resources/6561.txt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401162933/http://www.fpgaarcade.com/resources/6561.txt |archivedate=2010-04-01 |df= }} 090420 fpgaarcade.com&lt;/ref&gt; The palette lacks any intermediate shade of gray, and it has only 5 levels of luminance.

The VIC-20 lacks any true graphic mode, but a 22×11 text mode with 200 definable characters of 8×16 bits each arranged as a matrix of 20×10 characters is usually used instead, giving a 3:2(NTSC)/5:3(PAL) pixel aspect ratio, 160×160 pixels, 8-color "high-res mode" or a 3:1(NTSC)/10:3(PAL) pixel aspect ratio, 80×160 pixels, 10-color "multicolor mode".

In the 8-color ''high-res mode'', every 8×8 pixels can have the background color (shared for the entire screen) or a free foreground color, both selectable among the first eight colors of the palette. In the 10-color ''multicolor mode'', a single pixel of every 4×8 block (a character cell) may have any of four colors: the background color, the auxiliary color (both shared for the entire screen and selectable among the entire palette), the same color as the overscan border (also a shared color) or a free foreground color, both selectable among the first eight colors of the palette.

===C-64===
The [[MOS Technology VIC-II]] is used in the [[Commodore 64]] (and [[Commodore 128]] in 40-column mode), and features a 16-color [[YPbPr]] [[composite video]] palette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepto.de/projects/colorvic/|title=All you ever wanted to know about the colors of the commodore 64|author=Philip 'Pepto' Timmermann|date=12 March 2001|work=pepto.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This palette is largely based on that of the VIC, but it substitutes three colors by three levels of gray, and there are more values for the luminance. When displayed over an analog NTSC composite video output, the actual resulting colors are more vivid.

The Commodore 64 has two graphic modes: Multicolor and High Resolution.

In the Multicolor 160×200, 16-color mode, every cell of 4×8, 2:1 aspect ratio pixels can have one of four colors: one shared with the entire screen, the two background and foreground colors of the corresponding text mode character, and one more color also stored in the color RAM area, all of them freely selectable among the entire palette.

In the High Resolution 320×200, 16-color mode, every cell of 8×8 pixels can have one of the two background and foreground colors of the correspondent text mode character, both freely selectable among the entire palette.

===C-16 and Plus/4===

The [[MOS Technology TED]] was used in the [[Commodore 16]] and [[Commodore Plus/4]]. It has a palette of 121 [[YPbPr]] [[composite video]] colors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canberra.edu.au/~scott/C=Hacking/C-Hacking12/gfx.html Commodore Hacking #12 : Talking to TED&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105232121/http://www.canberra.edu.au/~scott/C%3DHacking/C-Hacking12/gfx.html |date=2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of sixteen hues (including black and white) at eight luminance levels. Black is the same color at every luminance level, so there are not 128 different colors. On the Plus/4, twelve colors formed a "default" palette of sorts accessible through keyboard shortcuts;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plus4.emucamp.com/kb.php?id=500107 Color codes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025035/http://plus4.emucamp.com/kb.php?id=500107 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these colors are underlined in the table below ([[RGB]] equivalents at a saturation level of 34%).

|}

The Commodore 16 and Plus/4 have two graphic modes very similar to those of the Commodore 64: Multicolor and High Resolution.

In the Multicolor 160×200, 121-color mode, every cell of 4×8, 2:1 aspect ratio pixels can have one of four colors: two shared with the entire screen and the two background and foreground colors of the correspondent text mode character, all of them freely selectable among the entire 121-color palette (hue 0 to 15 and luminance 0 to 7 are set individually for any of them).

In the High Resolution 320×200, 121-color mode, every cell of 8×8 pixels can have one of the two background and foreground colors of the corresponding text mode character, both freely selectable among the entire 121-color palette (again setting both the hue and the luminance).

==Tandy==

===Tandy Color Computer 3===

The Tandy Color Computer 3 could display all of the modes of the Tandy Color Computer 1 and 2, except the Semigraphics modes, plus resolutions of 160, 256, 320, or 640 pixels wide by 192 to 225 lines from a palette of 64 colors. The 320 mode allowed 16 simultaneous colors, while the 640 mode allowed 4.

|}

==Thomson==
For [[Thomson SA|Thomson computers]], a popular brand in France, the most common display modes are 320×200, with 8×1 attribute cells with 2 colours. The [[Thomson TO7]] can only display the 8 "saturated" colors. The [[Thomson TO7/70]] and [[Thomson MO5]] have the 16 color palette shown below as a fixed palette (just like on C64 or MSX1). On later models, these 16 colours can be chosen from 4096 and other video modes are available, removing the block constraints but reducing either the color count or the horizontal resolution.

==BBC Micro==

BBC Micro has 8 display modes, with resolutions like 640×256 (max. 2 colours), 320×256 (max. 4 colours) and 160×256 (max. 16 logical colours). No display modes have cell attribute clashes. The palette available has only 8 physical colours, plus a further 8 flashing colours (each being one of the eight non-flashing colours alternating with its physical complement), and the display modes can have 16, 4 or 2 simultaneous colours.

==Sinclair==

===ZX Spectrum===
{{main|ZX Spectrum graphic modes}}

The [[ZX Spectrum|ZX Spectrum (and compatible)]] computers use a variation of the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#4-bit RGBI|4-bit RGBI]] palette philosophy. This results in each of the colors of the 3-bit palette to have a ''basic'' and ''bright'' variant, with the exception of black. This was accomplished by having a maximum voltage level for the bright variant, and a lower voltage level for the basic variant. Due to this, black is the same in both variants.

The ''attribute'' byte associated to every 8×8 pixel cell dedicates (from LSB to MSB): three bits for the background color; three bits for the foreground color; one bit for the ''bright'' variant for both, and one bit for the flashing effect (alternate foreground and background colors evenly in time). So the colors are not selectable as indices of a true palette (there are not color numbers 8 to 15).

The color numbers can be employed with the following statements to choose:

* BORDER ''n'', the color for the surrounding area outside the pixel graphical area.
* PAPER ''n'', the background (pixel bit value of 0) color for an 8×8 pixel cell.
* INK ''n'', the foreground (pixel bit value of 1) color for an 8×8 pixel cell.

==SAM Coupé==

The 128 colour master palette used by the [[SAM Coupé]] is produced via a unique method — it effectively contains 2 groups of 64 "RGB" colours of mildly different intensity, and ultimately derived from a 512 colour space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Graphics Hardware|url=http://www.podboy.demon.co.uk/coupe/pdfs/coupe.pdf|work=The Unofficial SAM Coupé Technical Manual (sampler edition)|publisher=Σntropy|accessdate=5 February 2013|first=Simon|last=Cooke|pages=16–20|format=PDF|year=1994|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest equivalent in more popular and well-known machines would be the Commodore-Amiga's 64-colour "Extended HalfBrite" mode (with 32 explicitly set colours using 5 bitplanes, which are displayed with full or half brightness depending on the bit setting of a 6th plane).

Two bits are used for each of Red, Green and Blue and give a similar result to a normal 6-bit RGB palette (as seen with the IBM EGA or Sega Master System); the seventh bit encodes for "brightness", which has a similar but more subtle effect to the Spectrum, increasing the output of all three channels by half the intensity of the lower bits of the main six (in this way, it does make a genuine 128 colours — rather than what would have been 127 with "two blacks" and only a 7-level greyscale). The layout of the byte that encodes each colour is complicated and appears like a Spectrum colour nybble transferred to a full byte's width, and an extra RGB bit-triplet then prefixed to it, with the MSB left unused.

==Amstrad==

===CPC series===

The [[Amstrad]] [[Amstrad CPC 464|CPC 464]]/[[Amstrad CPC 664|664]]/[[Amstrad CPC 6128|6128]] series of computers generate the available palette with [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#3-level RGB|3 levels]] (not bits) for every RGB primary. Thus, there are 27 different RGB combinations, from which 16 can be simultaneously displayed in low resolution mode, four in medium resolution mode and two in high resolution mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantrell.org.uk/david/tech/cpc/cpc-firmware/firmware.pdf "The Amstrad CPC Firmware Guide"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulations of actual images on the Amstrad's color monitor in each of the modes (160×200, 16 colors; 320×200, 4 colors and 640×200, 2 colors) follows. A cheaper green monochrome display was also available from the manufacturer; in this case, the colors are viewed as a 16-tone green scale, as shown in the last simulated image, as it interprets the overall brightness of the full colour signal, instead of only considering the green intensity as might, e.g., the Philips CM8833 line.

The number in parentheses means the primary ink number for the [[Locomotive BASIC]] PEN, PAPER and INK statements (that is, "(1)" means ink #1 defaults to this color). Inks can also have a secondary color number, meaning they flash between two colors. By default, ink #14 alternates between colors 1 and 24 (blue and bright yellow) and ink #15 alternates between colors 11 and 16 (sky blue and pink). In addition, the paper defaults to ink #0 and the pen to ink #1, meaning bright yellow text on a blue background.

==MSX systems==

===Original MSX===

The [[MSX]] compatible computers feature a [[Texas Instruments TMS9918]] chip which uses a proprietary 15-color [[YPbPr]]-encoded palette&lt;ref&gt;VDP Registers 00h-07h: Basic MSX1/MSX2 Video Registers from [http://www.work.de/nocash/portar.htm "Portar MSX Tech Doc"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130055705/http://www.work.de/nocash/portar.htm |date=2007-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus a ''transparent'' color, intended to be used by the hardware [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s and simple [[video overlay]]. When used as an ordinary background color, it is rendered using the same color as the screen border.

The MSX series has two graphic modes. The [[MSX BASIC]] Screen 3 mode is a low-resolution mode with 15 colors, in which every pixel can be any of the 15 available colors. Screen mode 2 is a high-resolution mode with 15 colors, in which every eight consecutive pixels can be one of two out of the 15 available colors.

===MSX2===
The [[MSX2]] series features a [[Yamaha V9938]] video chip, which manages a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#9-bit RGB|9-bit RGB]] palette (512 colors) and has some extended graphic modes. Although its graphical capabilities are similar, or even better than of those of [[16-bit]] [[personal computer]]s, MSX2 and MSX2+ (see below) are pure 8-bit machines.

Screen mode 6 is a 512×212-pixel mode with a 4-color palette chosen from the available 512 colors.

Screen modes 5 and 7 are high-resolution 256×212-pixel and 512×212-pixel modes, respectively, with a 16-color palette chosen from the available 512 colors. Each pixel can be any of the 16 selected colors.

Screen mode 8 is a high-resolution 256×212-pixel mode with an 8-bit color depth, giving a palette of 256 colors.&lt;ref&gt;Bits M1-M5 of VDP register 0 and 1: Video Screen modes, Screen 8 from [http://www.work.de/nocash/portar.htm "Portar MSX Tech Doc"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130055705/http://www.work.de/nocash/portar.htm |date=2007-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the MSB to LSB, there are three green bits, three red bits, and two blue bits. This mode uses half of the available colors overall, and can be considered a palette in its own right.

===MSX2+===
The [[MSX2|MSX2+]] series features a [[Yamaha V9958]] video chip which manages a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-bit RGB]] palette internally encoded in YJK (up to 19,268 different colors from the 32,768 theorically possible)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msx-plaza.eu/home.php?page=mccm/mccm72/schermen_eng|title=The MSX Plaza|work=msx-plaza.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has additional screen modes. Although its graphical capabilities are similar, or even better than of those of [[16-bit]] [[personal computer]]s, MSX2 (see above) and MSX2+ are pure 8-bit machines. YJK color encoding can be viewed as a [[lossy compression]] technique; in the RGB to YJK conversion, the average red and green levels are preserved, blue is subsampled. As a result of every four pixels sharing a chroma value, in mode 12 it is not possible to have vertical lines of a single color. This is only possible in modes 10 and 11 due to the additional 16-color direct palette. This can be used to mix 16 indexed colors with a rich colorful background, in what can be considered a primitive [[video overlay]] technique.

:{|

| style="vertical-align:top;" | [[Image:MSX2plus YJK&amp;YAE palette.png]]
|}

Screen modes 10 &amp; 11 – 12,499 YJK colours plus a 16-color palette. In this mode, the YJK technique encodes 16 levels of luminance into the four LSBs of each pixel and 64 levels of chroma, from −32 to +31, shared across every four consecutive pixels and stored in the three higher bits of the four pixels. If the fifth bit of the pixel is set, then the lower four bits of the pixel points to an index in the 16-color palette; otherwise, they specify the YJK luminance level of the pixel.

Screen mode 12 is similar to modes 10 and 11, but uses five bits to encode 32 levels of luminance for every pixel, thus it does not use an additional palette and, with YJK encoding, 19,268 different colors can be displayed simultaneously with 8-bit color depth.

==IBM PC/XT and compatible systems==
:''For the palettes of more advanced original [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM AT]], [[IBM Personal System/2|IBM PS/2]] and better [[IBM PC compatible|PC compatible]]s hardware displays, please visit [[List of 16-bit computer hardware palettes#IBM PC-AT and compatible systems|IBM PC-AT and compatible systems]] in the [[List of 16-bit computer hardware palettes]] article.''

The original [[IBM PC]] launched in 1981 features an [[Intel 8088]] [[CPU]] which was 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] technology. It was offered with a [[IBM Monochrome Display Adapter|Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA)]] or a [[Color Graphics Adapter|Color Graphics Adapter (CGA)]]. The MDA was a [[text mode]]-only display adapter, without any graphic ability beyond using the built-in [[code page 437]] character set, and employed an original IBM green [[monochrome monitor]]; only black, green and highlighted green could be seen on its screen. Then, only the CGA had true graphic modes.

Despite the fact that the original [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM XT]] had a true 16-bit architecture, it already shipped both the original MDA or CGA display adapters, so this model is enumerated here too.

===CGA===

The [[Color Graphics Adapter]] (CGA) outputs what IBM called "digital RGB"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wilton, Programmer's Guide to PC &amp; PS/2 VIDEO SYSTEMS, 1987, Microsoft Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (that is, the R, G, B (and I) signals from the graphics card to the monitor can each only have two states: on or off). CGA supports a maximum of 16 colors. However, its 320×200 graphics mode is restricted to fixed palettes containing only four colors, and the 640×200 graphic mode is only two colors. 16 colours are only available in text mode or the "tweaked text" 160×100 mode. A different set of 16 colours is available in composite mode with composite monitor.

The full standard RGBI palette is a variant of the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#4-bit RGBI|4-bit RGBI]] schema. Although the RGBI signals have only two states, the CGA color monitor decodes them as if RGB signals had four levels. Darker colors are the basic RGB 2nd level signals except for brown, which is dark yellow with the level for the green component halved (1st level). Brighter colors are made by adding a uniform intensity one level signal to every RGB signal of the dark ones reaching the 3rd level (except dark gray which reaches only the 1st level), and in this case yellow is produced as if the brown were ordinary dark yellow.

A few earlier non-IBM compatible CGA monitors lack the circuitry to decode color numbers as of four levels internally, and they cannot show brown and dark gray. The above palette is displayed in such monitors as follows:

* 2-color palette mode

In the 640×200 graphic mode (BIOS mode number 6), every pixel has only a single bit. A value of 0 is always black, while a value of 1 is the color set in the bits 0 to 3 (bit3=I, bit2=R, bit1=G, bit0=B) of the CRT Color Selector Register (in 3D9h). The foreground color can be set with a call to the function 0Bh of the BIOS's INT 10h. The default foreground color is white.

| style="color:white; background:#000;"| 0 — black
| style="color:black; background:#fff;"| 1 — [user-defined]
|}

* 4-color palette modes

In the 320×200 graphics mode, every pixel has two bits. A value of 0 is always a selectable background-plus-border color (with the same register and/or BIOS call used for the foreground color in the 640×200 graphic mode; black by default), and the three remaining values 1 to 3 are indices to one of the predefined color palette entries.
The selection of a given fixed palette is a bit complex. There are two BIOS 320×200 graphic modes. The mode number 4 has enabled the composite color burst output (CRT Mode Control Register in 3D8H has cleared the bit 2), and the mode number 5 has it disabled (bit 2 set on the register). This gives two sets of palettes, one for "digital RGB" color monitors and one for monochrome composite video monitors, but the last has its own colors when viewed in a color monitor.
The desired video mode, 4 or 5, can be set with the function 0h of the BIOS's INT 10h.
For the BIOS mode 4, two palettes can be chosen: green-red-yellow and cyan-magenta-white (that is, the former plus the blue signal). The palette is selected with bit 5 of the CRT Color Selector Register in 3D9h. A value of 1 means the cyan-magenta-white palette (known as the "palette #1" because is the default for the mode 4), and 0 is the green-red-yellow (known as the "palette #2"). It can be set with the function 0Bh, subfunction 1, of the BIOS's INT 10h.
The palette for the BIOS mode 5 is always cyan-red-white.
In every of the 4 and 5 mode palettes, a low or high intensity can be chosen with the bit 4 of the CRT Color Selector Register in 3D9h. A value of 0 means the low intensity, and 1 means the high. No BIOS call exist to switch between the two intensity modes.

===PCjr and Tandy 1000 series===
The [[IBM PCjr]], and near compatible [[Tandy 1000]] series, feature a graphic chip known as "[[Video Gate Array]]", which is able to show all 16 CGA colors simultaneously on screen in the extended low-res graphic modes. This graphic adapter is better known as '''[[Tandy Graphics Adapter]]'''. All extended PCjr/Tandy 1000 graphics modes could reassign any color index to any palette entry, for color cycling effects.

The '''Longhua Temple''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|龙|华|寺}}|t={{linktext|龍|華|寺}}|p={{linktext|Lóng|húa| Sì}}''; &lt;small&gt;[[Shanghainese]]&lt;/small&gt;:'' Lon-ngu-zy}}, literally ''"[[Lustre (mineralogy)|Lustre]] of the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Temple''") is a [[Buddhist temple]] dedicated to the [[Maitreya|Maitreya Buddha]] located in [[Shanghai]]. Although most of the present-day buildings date from later reconstructions, the temple preserves the architectural design of a [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) monastery of the [[Chinese Chán|Chan School]]. It is the largest, most authentic and complete ancient temple complex in the city of Shanghai.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

[[Image:Longhuasi1600x1200.jpg|right|thumb|Longhua Temple inner courtyard]]

==History==
[[Image:Longhua temple1.JPG|right|thumb|Newly constructed front gate of Longhua. The site of the original gates, further in front, is now marked by two standing pillars and a set of original stone lions.]]

The temple was first built in 242 AD, during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (220&amp;ndash;165). According to a legend, [[Sun Quan]], King of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]] (222&amp;ndash;280), had obtained [[Ringsel|Sharira]] relics, which are cremated remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. To house these precious relics, the king ordered the construction of 13 pagodas. Longhua Pagoda ({{zh|s=龙华塔|t=|labels=no}}), part of the Longhua temple complex, is said to have been one of them. Like the function of the pagoda, the name of the temple also has its origin in a local legend according to which a dragon once appeared on the site.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

The temple was destroyed by war towards the end of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907) and rebuilt in 977 AD, under the autonomous Kingdom of [[Wuyue]] during the [[Song dynasty|Northern Song dynasty]] period (960&amp;ndash;1127). (According to another version of the story, as contained in [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) and [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271&amp;ndash;1368) local histories, the temple was first built by the King of [[Wuyue]].) Later in the Song dynasty, in 1064, it was renamed "Kongxiang Temple" ({{zh|s=空相寺|t=|labels=no}}), but the original name "Longhua Temple" was restored in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) during the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (1573&amp;ndash;1620).

The present architectural design follows the [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) original. However, whereas the core of the present Longhua Pagoda survives from that period, most buildings in the temple proper were rebuilt during the reigns of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (1862&amp;ndash;1874) and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (1875&amp;ndash;1908) in the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911). A modern restoration of the entire temple complex was carried out in 1954.

The temple and monastery were originally surrounded by extensive gardens and orchards. Viewing of the peach blossom in the Longhua gardens was an annual attraction for people in surrounding cities.

The temple grounds have been used as a site for internment as well as for executions. Public executions were held on the site in the 19th century. In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] carried out a purge of suspected communists in Shanghai. Thousands of victims of this purge were brought to the temple grounds to be executed. They are commemorated today by the Longhua Martyrs Cemetery behind the temple. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] operated their largest civilian internment camp in the area, where [[United States|American]], [[Great Britain|British]], as well as nationals of other [[Allies of World War II|allied countries]] were held under poor conditions.

The temple's extensive gardens have since been almost entirely absorbed into the neighbouring Longhua Martyrs Cemetery and have been extensively reconstructed in a contemporary monumental style. A small traditional garden remains immediately adjacent to the temple buildings.

The layout of the temple is that of a Song dynasty monastery of the Buddhist Chan sect, known as the ''Sangharama Five-Hall Style''. Five main halls are arranged along a central north-south pointing axis. From the entrance, the buildings are:

===Maitreya Hall===
The Maitreya Hall housing a statue of [[Maitreya]] buddha and another in his manifestation as "[[Budai]]", or ''Cloth bag monk''.

===Four Heavenly Kings Hall===
The [[Four Heavenly Kings Hall]] housing statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]].

===Mahavira Hall===
The [[Mahavira Hall]] is the main hall, housing statues of the historical Buddha ([[Shakyamuni]]) and two disciples. At the back of the hall is a bas-relief carving, including a depiction of [[Guanyin]], or the Buddistava [[Avalokiteśvara]] in his female manifestation. Around the front portion are arranged the twenty Guardians of Buddhist Law, and around the back the sixteen principal [[arhat]]s. The hall also features an ancient bell cast in 1586, during the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] era of the [[Ming dynasty]].

===Three Sages Hall===
The Three Sages Hall ({{zh|s=三圣殿|t=|labels=no}}) houses statues of the [[Amitabha]] buddha, and the Buddistavas [[Avalokiteśvara]] (male form) and Mahāsthāmaprāpta.

===Abbot's Hall===
The Abbot's Hall ({{zh|s=方丈室|t=|labels=no}}) is a place for lectures and formal meetings.

===Bell tower and Drum tower===
A Bell Tower and a Drum Tower are arranged off the central axis. The Bell Tower houses a copper [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] cast in 1382, the bell is {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} tall, has a maximum diameter of {{convert|1.3|m|adj=on}}, and weighs {{convert|5000|kg|adj=on}}. The bell is used in the ''Evening Bell-Striking Ceremony'' conducted on New Year's Eve. Also situated off the main axis is a shrine to [[Ksitigarbha]] (Dizang the King Bodhissatva).

===Buddhist Texts Library===
The [[Buddhist Texts Library]] houses various versions of Buddhist [[sutra]]s and other Buddhist works, as well as ceremonial instruments, antiques, and artefacts.

Artworks in the temple include statues of the Maitreya Buddha in his [[Bodhisattva]] form and in his ''Cloth Bag Monk'' incarnation, statues of the [[Eighteen Arhats]] and 20 Guardians of Buddhist Law, as well as statues of the 500 [[arhat]]s.

===Longhua Pagoda===
[[Image:Longhuata300x400.jpg|right|thumb|Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Pagoda is best well-known of the 16 historic pagodas that still stand within the Shanghai municipality. It has an octagonal floor layout. The size of the seven storeys decreases from the bottom to the top. The pagoda consists of a hollow, tube-like brick core surrounded by a wooden staircase. On the outside, it is decorated with balconies, banisters, and upturned eaves. These outer decorations have been reconstructed in keeping with the original style.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

Although previous pagodas existed on the same site, the current brick base and body of the pagoda was built in 977 under the [[Wuyue]] kingdome (907&amp;ndash;978), with continuous renovations of its more fragile wooden components on the exterior. Because of its age, the pagoda is fragile and is not open to the public.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==Temple fair==
The Longhua Temple Fair has been held since the [[Ming dynasty]] annually on the third day of the third month of the [[Lunar Calendar]], when - according to local legend - the dragons visit the temple to help grant the people's wishes. It coincides with the blossoming of the peach trees in Longhua Park. Since its inception, the fair has been an annual event interrupted only by the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] outbreak.

==Location==
The Longhua Temple is located on the Longhua area (formerly Longhua township) of Shanghai (named after the temple). Its street address is No. 2853 Longhua Road (Longhua Lu). It is open to the public for a fee (10 [[Renminbi|RMB]]) which includes incense.{{Citation needed|reason=I didn't get any incense! (2 January 2010)|date=January 2010}}

==In popular culture==
[[J.G. Ballard]] in his World War II-era autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' describes the Japanese military use of the Longhua pagoda as a flak cannon tower.  In Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the book, the pagoda is clearly visible above the prison camp.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Mass media]] influences spatial [[perception]] through journalistic [[cartography]] and spatial [[bias]] in news coverage.

"[[Journalism]] is one of the few industries that provide the [[general public]] the most of its [[information]] about places and [[geography]],",&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier, M.,(1989). Maps with the news. Chicago: The university Chicago Press, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; mass media is one of the significant factors in shaping perception of places.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;Lewis, L., Degani, A., Hudson., (1980). The measurement and explanation of the spatial perception of Africa: a Nigerian viewpoint. [[Geografiska Annaler]], 62B, 33-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribok, M. V., (2008). Cartographic representation of mass media influence on the formation of the image of Russian regions. Vestnik Moskovskogo Universiteta, 5 (4), 41-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, mass media has been criticized for "limited [[iconography]] that constructs the newscape-generic locations that are interchangeable from story to story, and which have come to give a restrictive and distorted worldview".&lt;ref&gt;Huxford, J., (2007). The proximity paradox: Live reporting, virtual proximity and the concept of place in the news. Journalism. 8, p.670.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of geographical balance in news coverage may lead to limitations of spatial knowledge, i.e., US media focuses on a limited number of nations and regions for international news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, G., &amp; Wanta, W., (2003). International elections on the U.S. network news: An examination of factors affecting newsworthiness. Gazette,. 65, 25-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

When some news has an important geographic component, [[journalism]] concerns with a location of journalistic information.&lt;ref name="Monmonier, M. 1989"&gt;Monmonier, M., (1989). Maps with the news. Chicago: The university of Chicago press.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of maps becomes appropriate as "a map is an efficient means for showing location and describing geographic relationships".&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier, M., (1989). Maps with the news. Chicago: The university of Chicago press, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media may use maps to show an event that have spatially distributed data like election results, the distribution of [[acid rain]], radon contamination, weather forecast, traffic, or traveling routes; also describe a story of a battle, a geopolitical strategy, or an environmental threat.&lt;ref name="Monmonier, M. 1989"/&gt; Geographers criticize journalistic cartography for deficiencies and constraints of map production.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, P., (1985). The design of journalistic maps/purposes, parameters and prospects.

The cartographic journal, 36, 141-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Maps in journalism are produced by graphic artists, who lack in cartographic training.&lt;ref name="Green, D. R. 1999"/&gt; 

Geographers have explored the spatial bias in news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, A., (1991). Making the news: spatial and non-spatial biases in British parliamentary reports of the Rowntree - Mackintosh takeover. [[Geografiska Annaler]], 73B, 95-109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley, D. J., (1980). Spatial bias in Australian news reporting. [[Australian Geographer]], 14, 342-349.&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial pattern of news is created by journalistic norms, which concern is national coverage, national interest, geographic stereotypes and accessibility to news events.&lt;ref name="Brooker-Gross, S. 1983"&gt;Brooker-Gross, S., (1983). Spatial aspects of newsworthiness. [[Geografiska Annaler]], 65B, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; As mass media provides live reporting from the scenes of the news events, journalism requires spatial proximity, event proximity, and [[broadcast]] proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Huxford, J., (2007). The proximity paradox: Live reporting, virtual proximity and the concept of place in the news. Journalism. 8, 657-674.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitals, major financial centers and politically unstable places are highly geographically stereotyped and considered as newsworthy locations where important events happen often &lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooker-Gross, S. 1983"/&gt; Economic ties and [[social distance]] play also significant role in news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Bendix, J., &amp; Liebler, C.

'''Mechanics''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μηχανική}}) is that area of [[science]] concerned with the behaviour of [[physical body|physical bodies]] when subjected to [[force]]s or [[Displacement (vector)|displacements]], and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.
The scientific discipline has its origins in [[Ancient Greece]] with the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]]&lt;ref&gt;Dugas, Rene. A History of Classical Mechanics. New York, NY: Dover Publications Inc, 1988, pg 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rana, N.C., and Joag, P.S. Classical Mechanics. West Petal Nagar, New Delhi. Tata McGraw-Hill, 1991, pg 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renn, J., Damerow, P., and McLaughlin, P. Aristotle, Archimedes, Euclid, and the Origin of Mechanics: The Perspective of Historical Epistemology. Berlin: Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, 2010, pg 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;    (see [[History of classical mechanics]] and [[Timeline of classical mechanics]]). During the [[early modern period]], scientists such as [[Galileo]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] laid the foundation for what is now known as [[classical mechanics]].
It is a branch of [[Classical physics|classical physics]] that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. 
It can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on objects. The field is yet less widely understood in terms of quantum theory. 

== Classical versus quantum ==
{{Classical mechanics |branches}}
{{Quantum mechanics |background}}

Historically, [[classical mechanics]] came first and [[quantum mechanics]] is a comparatively recent development. Classical mechanics originated with [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] in [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]; Quantum Mechanics was developed in the early 20th century. Both are commonly held to constitute the most certain knowledge that exists about physical nature. 

Classical mechanics has especially often been viewed as a model for other so-called [[exact science]]s. Essential in this respect is the extensive use of [[mathematics]] in theories, as well as the decisive role played by [[experiment]] in generating and testing them.

[[Quantum]] mechanics is of a bigger  scope, as it encompasses classical mechanics as a sub-discipline which applies under certain restricted circumstances. According to the [[correspondence principle]], there is no contradiction or conflict between the two subjects, each simply pertains to specific situations. The correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by quantum theories reproduces classical physics in the limit of large [[quantum numbers]]. Quantum mechanics has superseded classical mechanics at the foundation level and is indispensable for the explanation and prediction of processes at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic level. However, for macroscopic processes classical mechanics is able to solve problems which are unmanageably difficult in quantum mechanics and hence remains useful and well used.
Modern descriptions of such behavior begin with a careful definition of such quantities as displacement (distance moved), time, velocity, acceleration, mass, and force. Until about 400 years ago, however, motion was explained from a very different point of view. For example, following the ideas of Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle, scientists reasoned that a cannonball falls down because its natural position is in the Earth; the sun, the moon, and the stars travel in circles around the earth because it is the nature of heavenly objects to travel in perfect circles.

Often cited as father to modern science, [[Galileo]] brought together the ideas of other great thinkers of his time and began to calculate motion in terms of distance traveled from some starting position and the time that it took. He showed that the speed of falling objects increases steadily during the time of their fall. This acceleration is the same for heavy objects as for light ones, provided air friction (air resistance) is discounted. The English mathematician and physicist [[Isaac Newton]] improved this analysis by defining force and mass and relating these to acceleration. For objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, Newton’s laws were superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]’s [[Special relativity|theory of relativity]]. [A sentence illustrating the computational complication of Einstein's theory of relativity.] For atomic and subatomic particles, Newton’s laws were superseded by [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. For everyday phenomena, however, Newton’s three laws of motion remain the cornerstone of dynamics, which is the study of what causes motion.

== Relativistic versus Newtonian ==

In analogy to the distinction between quantum and classical mechanics, [[Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general]] and [[Special relativity|special]] theories of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] have expanded the scope of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Galileo]]'s formulation of mechanics. The differences between relativistic and Newtonian mechanics become significant and even dominant as the velocity of a massive body approaches the [[speed of light]]. For instance, in [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], [[Newton's laws of motion]] specify that '''F''' = ''m'''''a''', whereas in [[relativistic mechanics]] and [[Lorentz transformations]], which were first discovered by [[Hendrik Lorentz]], '''F''' = &amp;gamma;''m'''''a''' (where γ is the [[Lorentz factor]], which is almost equal to 1 for low speeds).

==General relativistic versus quantum==

Relativistic corrections are also needed for quantum mechanics, although general relativity has not been integrated. The two theories remain incompatible, a hurdle which must be overcome in developing a [[theory of everything]].

==History==

{{Main|History of classical mechanics|History of quantum mechanics}}

===Antiquity===

{{Main|Aristotelian mechanics}}

The main theory of mechanics in antiquity was [[Aristotelian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vPT-JubW-7QC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of mechanics]''". René Dugas (1988). p.19. {{ISBN|0-486-65632-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later developer in this tradition is [[Hipparchus]].&lt;ref name="mechanics"&gt;"[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/01/a_tiny_taste_of_the_history_of.html A Tiny Taste of the History of Mechanics]". The University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval age===

{{Main|Theory of impetus}}
[[File:Arabic machine manuscript - Anonym - Ms. or. fol. 3306 c.jpg|thumb|small|200px|Arabic Machine Manuscript. Unknown date (at a guess: 16th to 19th centuries).]]
In the Middle Ages, Aristotle's theories were criticized and modified by a number of figures, beginning with [[John Philoponus]] in the 6th century. A central problem was that of [[projectile motion]], which was discussed by Hipparchus and Philoponus. This led to the development of the [[theory of impetus]] by 14th-century French priest [[Jean Buridan]], which developed into the modern theories of [[inertia]], [[velocity]], [[acceleration]] and [[momentum]]. This work and others was developed in 14th-century England by the [[Oxford Calculators]]  such as [[Thomas Bradwardine]], who studied and formulated various laws regarding falling bodies.

On the question of a body subject to a constant (uniform) force, the 12th-century Jewish-Arab [[Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi|Nathanel]] (Iraqi, of Baghdad) stated that constant force imparts constant acceleration, while the main properties are uniformly accelerated motion (as of falling bodies) was worked out by the 14th-century Oxford Calculators.

===Early modern age===

Two central figures in the early modern age are [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Galileo's final statement of his mechanics, particularly of falling bodies, is his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' (1638). Newton's 1687 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' provided a detailed mathematical account of mechanics, using the newly developed mathematics of [[calculus]] and providing the basis of [[Newtonian mechanics]].&lt;ref name="mechanics"/&gt;

There is some dispute over priority of various ideas: Newton's ''Principia'' is certainly the seminal work and has been tremendously influential, and the systematic mathematics therein did not and could not have been stated earlier because calculus had not been developed. However, many of the ideas, particularly as pertain to inertia (impetus) and falling bodies had been developed and stated by earlier researchers, both the then-recent Galileo and the less-known medieval predecessors. Precise credit is at times difficult or contentious because scientific language and standards of proof changed, so whether medieval statements are ''equivalent'' to modern statements or ''sufficient'' proof, or instead ''similar'' to modern statements and ''hypotheses'' is often debatable.

===Modern age===

Two main modern developments in mechanics are [[general relativity]] of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[quantum mechanics]], both developed in the 20th century based in part on earlier 19th-century ideas. The development in the modern continuum mechanics, particularly in the areas of elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics and thermodynamics of deformable media, started in the second half of the 20th century.

==Types of mechanical bodies==

The often-used term '''[[Physical body|body]]''' needs to stand for a wide assortment of objects, including particles, [[projectiles]], [[spacecraft]], [[star]]s, parts of [[mechanical engineering|machinery]], parts of [[solids]], parts of [[fluids]] ([[gases]] and [[liquids]]), etc.

Other distinctions between the various sub-disciplines of mechanics, concern the nature of the bodies being described. Particles are bodies with little (known) internal structure, treated as mathematical points in classical mechanics. Rigid bodies have size and shape, but retain a simplicity close to that of the particle, adding just a few so-called [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], such as orientation in space.

Otherwise, bodies may be semi-rigid, i.e. [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], or non-rigid, i.e. [[fluid]]. These subjects have both classical and quantum divisions of study.

For instance, the motion of a spacecraft, regarding its [[orbit]] and attitude ([[rotation]]), is described by the relativistic theory of classical mechanics, while the analogous movements of an [[atomic nucleus]] are described by quantum mechanics.

== Sub - disciplines ==

The following are two lists of various subjects that are studied in mechanics.

Note that there is also the "[[Field theory (physics)|theory of fields]]" which constitutes a separate discipline in physics, formally treated as distinct from mechanics, whether [[Classical field theory|classical fields]] or [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]]. But in actual practice, subjects belonging to mechanics and fields are closely interwoven. Thus, for instance, forces that act on particles are frequently derived from fields ([[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] or [[gravitational]]), and particles generate fields by acting as sources. In fact, in quantum mechanics, particles themselves are fields, as described theoretically by the [[wave function]].

In communication studies or media studies, '''mediatization''' is a theory that argues that the media shapes and frames the processes and discourse (conversation) of [[political communication]] as well as the society in which that communication takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Lilleker, D., 2008, Key Concepts in Political Communications. SAGE London.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this framework, an important aspect of [[modernization]] is the development of media,&lt;ref&gt;Krotz, F. (2008). Media Connectivity: Concepts, Conditions, and Consequences. In A. Hepp, F. Krotz &amp; S. Moores (Eds.), Network, Connectivity and Flow: Key concepts for Media and Cultural Studies. New York: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with a change in [[communication]] media and proceeding to subordination of the power of prevailing influential institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. (2008). The Mediatization of Religion: A Theory of the Media as Agents of Religious Change. In Northern Lights 2008. Yearbook of Film &amp; Media Studies. Bristol: Intellect Press: 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of this process, institutions and whole societies are shaped by and dependent on [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Mazzoleni, G., &amp; Schulz, W. (1999). "Mediatization" of Politics: A Challenge for Democracy? Political Communication, 16(3), 247-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Mediatization is part of a paradigmatic shift in media and communication research. Following the concept of '[[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)|mediation]]', 'mediatization' has become the proper concept for capturing how processes of communication transform society, designating large-scale relationships. The two are complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Von Joachim Preusse and Sarah Zielmann, Kent Asp introduced and lamented on the concept of mediatization, and they clarifiy that: "Mediatisation was first applied to media's impact on political communication and other effects on politics. The Swedish media researcher Kent Asp was the first to speak of the mediatisation of political life, by which he meant a process whereby 'a political system to a high degree is influenced by and adjusted to the demands of the mass media in their coverage of politics'" (2010: 336).

Asp used the term mediated politics to describe how the media have become a necessary source of information between politicians and those in authority and those they governed.  According to Asp's understanding politics are mediated when the mass media are the main or the only source of political information through which it may influence or even shape people's conceptions of political reality. Asp's theoretical assumptions that mass media may influence and mobilize current political ideas through mediatized rituals have been adopted by various communication scholars. In the tradition of Asp, the Danish media scholar [[Stig Hjarvard]] helped to develop the concept of mediatization and suggested that mediatization is a social process whereby the society is saturated and inundated by the media to the extent that the media cannot longer be thought of separated from other institutions within the society.&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. (2008). The Mediatization of Religion: A Theory of the Media as Agents of Religious Change. In Northern Lights 2008. Yearbook of Film &amp; Media Studies. Bristol: Intellect Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociocultural change ==   
The concept has evolved to focus not only on media effects but on the interrelation between the change of media communication on the one hand and sociocultural changes on the other, as part of our everyday communication practices and our communicative construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society, Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt; Mediatization research investigates the interrelation between media communicative change and sociocultural change, understood as a meta-process (a conceptual construct designating long-term processes of change).&lt;ref&gt;Couldry, N. &amp; A. Hepp. (2013). Conceptualizing Mediatization: Contexts,Traditions, Arguments. Communication Theory 23: 191-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Media do not necessarily 'cause' the transformations but they have become co-constitutive for the articulation of politics, economics, education, religion, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society, Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, television, by showcasing know-how health specialists who promote quick individual changes in lifestyle, co-constructs the notion of health together with other institutions and broader cultural shifts in perceptions of the body.

Hjarvard and Peterson summarize media's role in cultural change: "(1) When various forms of subcultures try to make use of media for their own purposes, they often become (re-)embedded into mainstream culture; (2) National cultural policies often serve as levers for increased mediatization; (3) Mediatization involves a transformation of the ways in which authority and expertise are performed and reputation is acquired and defended; and (4) Technological developments shape the media's affordances and thus the particular path of mediatization."&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. &amp; L.N. Peterson, (2013). [https://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/mediekultur/article/download/8123/6762 Mediatization and cultural change], MedieKultur, 54: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research mobilizing mediatization theories explores the ways in which media are embedded in cultural transformation. For example, "tactical" mediatization designates the response of community organizations and activists to wider technological changes. Kim Sawchuk, professor in Communication Studies at Concordia University, worked with a group of elderly who managed to retain their own agency in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Sawchuk, K. (2013). [http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/mediekultur/article/view/7313/6765 Tactical mediatization and activist ageing: pressures, push-backs, and the story of RECAA]. MedieKultur 54: 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt; For the elderly, the pressure to mediatize comes from various institutions that are transitioning to online services (government agencies, funding, banks, etc.), among other things. A tactical approach to media is one that comes from those who are subordinates within these systems. It means to implement work-arounds to make the technologies work for them. For example, in the case of the elderly group she studies, they borrowed equipment to produce video capsules explaining their mandate and the importance of this mandate for their communities, which allowed them to reach new audiences while keeping the tone and style of face-to-face communication they privilege in their day-to-day practice. Doing this, they also subverted expectations about the ability of the elderly to use new media effectively.
Another example of study is one which is focused on the media-related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, showing how media integrate and modulate their everyday practices. The analysis also demonstrates how the mediatization of these subcultural groups brings them to become part of mainstream culture, changes their rebellious and oppositional image and engages them with the global commercialization culture.&lt;ref&gt;Encheva, K., Driessens, O., &amp; Verstraeten, H. (2013). The mediatization of deviant subcultures: an analysis of the media - related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, MedieKultur, 54: 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of study mobilizing mediatization theories would be one interested in how media's omnipresence informs the ways Femen's protests may take place on public scenes, allow communication between individual bodies and a shared understanding of activist imaginary. It aims to analyse how their practices are moulded by the media and how these are staged in manners which facilitates spreadability.&lt;ref&gt;Reestorff, C. M. (2014). Mediatised affective activism: The activist imaginary and the topless body in the Femen movement,  Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 20: 4, {{doi|10.1177/1354856514541358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microalgae''' or '''microphytes''' are microscopic [[algae]], typically found in [[freshwater]] and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] systems, living in both the [[water column]] and [[sediment]].&lt;ref name=Thurman /&gt; They are unicellular species which exist individually, or in chains or groups. Depending on the species, their sizes can range from a few micrometers (µm) to a few hundred micrometers. Unlike higher plants, microalgae do not have roots, stems, or leaves. They are specially adapted to an environment dominated by viscous forces. Microalgae, capable of performing [[photosynthesis]], are important for life on earth; they produce approximately half of the atmospheric oxygen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/microscopic-algae-produce-half-the-oxygen-we-breathe/5041338|title=Microscopic algae produce half the oxygen we breathe|author=|date=25 October 2013|website=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use simultaneously the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to grow photoautotrophically. Microalgae, together with bacteria, form the base of the [[food web]] and provide energy for all the trophic levels above them. Microalgae biomass is often measured with [[Chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']] concentrations and can provide a useful index of potential production. The standing stock of microphytes is closely related to that of its predators. Without grazing pressures the standing stock of microphytes dramatically decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrush|first1=Simon|last2=Hewitt|first2=Judi|last3=Gibbs|first3=Max|last4=Lundquist|first4=caralyn|last5=Norkko|first5=Alf|title=Functional Role of Large Organisms in Intertidal Communities: Community Effects and Ecosystem Function|journal=Ecosystems|date=2006|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1029–1040|doi=10.1007/s10021-005-0068-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[biodiversity]] of microalgae is enormous and they represent an almost untapped resource. It has been estimated that about 200,000-800,000 species in many different genera exist of which about 50,000 species are described.&lt;ref name = Flanders&gt;Starckx, Senne (31 October 2012) [http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/place-sun A place in the sun - Algae is the crop of the future, according to researchers in Geel] Flanders Today, Retrieved 8 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Over 15,000 novel compounds originating from algal biomass have been chemically determined.&lt;ref name=Cardozo2007 /&gt; Most of these microalgae species produce unique products like [[carotenoid]]s, [[antioxidant]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, [[enzyme]]s, [[polymer]]s, [[peptide]]s, [[toxin]]s and [[sterol]]s.

The chemical composition of microalgae is not an intrinsic constant factor but varies over a wide range, both depending on species and on cultivation conditions. Some microalgae have the capacity to acclimate to changes in environmental conditions by altering their chemical composition in response to environmental variability. A particularly dramatic example is their ability to replace phospholipids with
non-phosphorus membrane lipids in P-depleted environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonachela|first1=Juan|last2=Raghib|first2=Michael|last3=Levin|first3=Simon|title=Dynamic model of flexible phytoplankton nutrient uptake|journal=PNAS|date=Feb 21, 2012|volume=108|issue=51|pages=20633–20638|doi=10.1073/pnas.1118012108|pmid=22143781|pmc=3251133}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to accumulate the desired products in microalgae to a large extent by changing environmental factors, like temperature, illumination, pH, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supply, salt and nutrients. Microphytes also produce chemical signals which contribute to prey selection, defense, and avoidance. These chemical signals affect large scale tropic structures such as algal blooms but propagate by simple diffusion and laminar advective flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolfe|first1=Gordon|title=The chemical Defense Ecology o Marine Unicelular Plankton: Constraints, Mechanisms, and Impacts|journal=Biology Bulletins|date=2000|volume=198|issue=2|pages=225–244|doi=10.2307/1542526|pmid=10786943|jstor=1542526|citeseerx=10.1.1.317.7878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EnvCond /&gt; Microalgae such as microphytes constitute the basic foodstuff for numerous aquaculture species, especially [[bivalvia|filtering bivalves]]. Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic microbes can also form symbiotic relationships with host organisms.

They provide them with vitamins and polyunsaturated fatty acids, necessary for the growth of the bivalves which are unable to synthesize it themselves.&lt;ref name=microalgaeifremer /&gt;

In addition, because the cells grow in aqueous suspension, they have more efficient access to water, [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and other nutrients. Microalgae play a major role in nutrient cycling and fixing inorganic carbon into organic molecules.

While [[fish oil]] has become famous for its [[omega-3 fatty acid]] content, fish don't actually produce omega-3s, instead accumulating their omega-3 reserves by consuming microalgae. These omega-3 fatty acids can be obtained in the human diet directly from the microalgae that produce them.

==Aquaculture==
{{Main article|Culture of microalgae in hatcheries}}

A range of microalgae species are produced in hatcheries and are used in a variety of ways for commercial purposes. 

Studies have estimated the main factors in the success of a microalgae hatchery system to be;
:the dimensions of the container/bioreactor where microalgae is cultured, 
:exposure to light/[[irradiation]], and 
:concentration of cells within the reactor.&lt;ref name=Tredici1992 /&gt;

'''Museum education''' is a specialized field devoted to developing and strengthening  the education role of non-formal education spaces and institutions such as museums. Its main objective is to engage visitors in learning experiences to enhance their curiosity and interest on their objects and collections. [[File:Dallas Museum of Art 06.jpg|thumb|Educational exhibition on "Materials &amp; Meanings" at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].]]

In a seminal report called ''Excellence and Equity''&lt;ref name="aam1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=Excellence and Equity|year=1992|publisher=American Association of Museums|isbn=978-0-931201-14-1|url=http://iweb.aam-us.org/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=I277}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992 by the American Association of Museums (now the [http://aam-us.org/about-us American Alliance of Museums]), the educational role of museums was identified as the core to museums' service to the public. According to the report, "...the public dimensions of museums leads them to perform the public service of education—a term that in its broadest sense includes exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation and dialogue". As museum education has developed as a field of study and interest in its own right, efforts have been made to record its history and to establish a research agenda to strengthen its position as a discipline in the wider work of museums.

== History ==

=== Non-formal education ===

In his first report as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture during [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration, in 1968, [[Philip H. Coombs]] emphasized the increment of the educative needs of the world’s population after World War II. In it, he mentions the diversity of non-formal education activities that constitute, or should constitute an important complement to formal education to the total educational efforts of any country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2001). «La necesidad de planificación y evaluación educativas en la educación no formal. Algunas propuestas». ''Educació i Cultura'': 14, 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; To Coombs, non-formal education had the potential to satisfy the learning demands of both, individuals and collectivities, because unlike formal and traditional education, which is rigid with its contents and programs, it is flexible and, when planning and designing educational activities, it takes into consideration local variations of culture, economy and society, which counteracts the tendency of developing countries to just imitate education models of developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2011 [2004]). «1». ''Pedagogía museística. Nuevas perspectivas y tendencias actuales''. Ariel. p. 15. {{ISBN|978-84-344-6974-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a work written by Coombs in conjunction with M. Ahmed, non-formal education is defined as "...any organized educational activity outside the established formal system—whether operating separately or as an important feature of some broader activity—that is intended to serve identifiable learning clienteles and learning objective".&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Phillips H. and H. Ahmed. ''New Paths To Learning: For Rural Children and Youth'' (en inglés). New York, N.Y.: International Council for Educational Development Publications. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, Coombs and Ahmed add the idea that non-formal education is any systematic educative activity, organized outside from the official framework to facilitate educative experiences for all people, regardless of age, genre, nationality, social, economic or health situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout his career, Coombs encouraged and impulsed the professional development of people responsible of non-formal education, which will be determining to the development and professionalization of the educative areas in institutions devoted to non-formal education.

=== Beginnings in art museums of the United States ===

At the turn of the twentieth century, art museums were very new institutions to the average visitor, who was seen wandering with no clear direction through the galleries, and with no clear idea on how to appreciate and study the exhibitions. In 1906, architect J. Randolph Coolidge Jr. was appointed the temporary director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He experimented with a guiding system in the galleries, to help visitors orient themselves throughout their walk across the exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Rika and, Elliot Kai-Kee (2011). «2». ''Teaching in the Art Museum. Interpretation as Experience''(en inglés). J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-058-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in the June bulletin of the museum that same year, features one of the first uses of the term docent and the description of its functions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It has been proposed to the Trustees to consider the permanent appointment of one or more persons of intelligence and education who could act as intermediaries between Curators and the many who would be glad to avail themselves of trained instruction in our galleries. Through these docents, as it has been proposed to call them, the heads of departments could instruct many more persons than it would be possible for them to accompany through the galleries; and illustrated lectures upon the collections prepared in the departments might be regularly given by these specially qualified aids both in the Museum and in the class rooms of neighboring schools and colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-4423283/4423283_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The Educational Work of the Museum.

[[File:Saint Petersburg Conservatory.jpg|thumb|260px|Graduates of the [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] include [[Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Sergey Prokofiev]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], and [[George Balanchine]].]]
A '''music school''' is an educational [[institution]] specialized in the study, training, and research of music. Such an institution can also be known as a '''school of music''', '''music academy''', '''music faculty''', '''college of music''', '''music department''' (of a larger institution), '''conservatory''' or '''conservatoire'''. Instruction consists of training in the performance of [[musical instruments]], singing, [[musical composition]], conducting,  [[musicianship]], as well as academic and research fields such as [[musicology]], [[music history]] and [[music theory]].

[[Music instruction]] can be provided within the compulsory general education system, or within specialized children's music schools such as the [[Purcell School]]. Elementary-school children can access music instruction also in after-school institutions such as music academies or music schools. In Venezuela [[El Sistema]] of youth orchestras provides free after-school instrumental instruction through music schools called ''núcleos''.
The term “music school” can also be applied to institutions of higher education under names such as ''school of music'', such as the [[Jacobs School of Music]] of Indiana University; ''music academy'', like the [[Sibelius Academy]] or the [[Royal Academy of Music]], London; ''music faculty'' as the Don Wright Faculty of Music of the [[University of Western Ontario]]; ''college of music'', characterized by the [[Royal College of Music]]  and the [[Berklee College of Music]]; ''music department'', like the Department of Music at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; or the term ''conservatory'', exemplified by the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. In other parts of Europe, the equivalents of ''higher school of music'' or ''university of music'' may be used, such as the [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln]] (Cologne University of Music).

==History==
[[File:NotreDameDeParis.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Based around the Notre Dame Cathedral, the [[Notre Dame School]] was an important centre of polyphonic music.]]
Although music and music education may have been in existence for thousands of years, the earliest history is speculative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&amp;printsec=frontcover The origins of music Nils Lennart Wallin, Steven Brown, Björn Merker] {{ISBN|0-262-73143-6}} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Even when history starts to be recorded, music is mentioned more frequently than music education. Within the biblical tradition, Hebrew litany was accompanied with rich music, but the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch was silent on the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. However, by [[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 10, Alfred Sendrey suggests that we find “a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.” This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel]] was the patriarch of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html Lee Krähenbühl: A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[schola cantorum (papal choir)]] in Rome may be the first recorded music school in history, when [[Gregory the Great]] (540–604) made permanent an existing guild dating from the 4th century (''schola'' originally referred more to a guild rather than school). The school consisted of monks, secular clergy, and boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sistine_Choir Original ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Sistine Choir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232840/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sistine_Choir |date=25 July 2011 }} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wells Cathedral School]], England founded as a Cathedral School in 909 a.d. to educate choristers, continues today to educate choristers and teaches instrumentalists. However the school appears to have been refounded at least once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellscathedralschool.org/wells/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=170&amp;Itemid=181&amp;ed=1 Wells Cathedral School] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Martial school]], 10th to 12th century, was an important school of composition at the [[Abbey of Saint Martial]], [[Limoges]]. It is known for the composition of [[trope (music)|trope]]s, [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s, and early [[organum]]. In this respect, it was an important precursor to the [[Notre Dame School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TMdf1SioFk4C&amp;pg=PA748&amp;lpg=PA748&amp;dq=Saint+Martial+school+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1HwZru3T3e&amp;sig=OyZMEyDOXAnc-fTxwfjhFKfO-T4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1E7YTLGkMZOKhQfMwP32Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Saint%20Martial%20school%20music&amp;f=false Harvard Dictionary of Music: St Martial school] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Notre Dame school (late 12th and early 13th century) which was the earliest repertory of [[polyphonic]] (multipart) music to gain international prestige and circulation. The school was a group of composers and singers working under the patronage of the great Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|420777|Notre Dame School}}. retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  First records on [[Escolania de Montserrat]], boys' choir linked to a music school, back to 1307 and still continues the musical education.

The [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] (National Academy of St Cecilia) is one of the oldest musical institutions in the world, based in Italy.
It is based at the Auditorium [[Parco della Musica]] in [[Rome]], and was founded by the papal bull, Ratione congruit, issued by Sixtus V in 1585, which invoked two saints prominent in Western musical history: Gregory the Great, for whom the Gregorian chant is named, and Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music.
It was founded as a "congregation" or "confraternity" – a religious guild, so to speak – and over the centuries, has grown from a forum for local musicians and composers to an internationally acclaimed academy active in music scholarship (with 100 prominent music scholars forming the body of the Accademia) to music education (in its role as a conservatory) to performance (with an active choir and symphony orchestra).

The term ''conservatory'' has its origin in 16th-century [[Renaissance]] Italy, where orphanages (''[[wikt:conservatorio|conservatori]]'') were attached to hospitals. The orphans (''conservati'' ‘saved’) were given a musical education there, and the term gradually applied to music schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|133512|Conservatory}}. Retrieved 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|conservatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hospitals-conservatories were among the first secular institutions equipped for practical training in music. By the 18th century, Italian conservatories were already playing a major role in the training of artists and composers.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1979"&gt;''[[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of [[Naples]], a ''conservatorio'' was strictly a secular place for teaching and learning specializing in music education. There were already four [[conservatories in Naples]] active in the 17th and 18th century: 
* ''I poveri di Gesù Cristo'' (‘The Paupers of Jesus Christ’), founded in 1599 by Marcello Fossataro, already included in their official record a ''magister musicæ'' and ''magister [[lyre|lyræ]]'' in 1633; 
* ''Santa Maria di Loreto'', where the composer [[Giovan Battista Pergolesi]] (1710–1736) studied; 
* ''La pietà dei turchini'' was founded in 1583 and the earliest findings suggest musical activity around the year 1615;
* ''Sant'Onofrio a porta Capuana'', where the composer [[Giovanni Paisiello]] (1740–1816) studied and then taught, started teaching music in the mid-1600 and in the following decades will give more priority to the [[opera buffa]];
* plus one only for girls called ''dell'Annunziata''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Della Corte, G. M. Gatti, ''Dizionario di musica'', Paravia, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is in these very institutions that the so-called [[Neapolitan School|''Scuola Musicale Napoletana'']] was developed, thanks to the work of musicians and educators like [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] (1660–1725) and [[Francesco Durante]] (1684–1755), who was also Pergolesi’s and Paisiello’s teacher.

It was the example set in Naples, where admission was by competitive examination and tuition was free, that was then copied, with modifications, in many European cities, including Paris (1795), Bologna (1804), Milan (1807), Florence and Prague (1811), Warsaw and Vienna (1821), London (1822), the Hague (1826), and Liege (1827). The second half of the 19th century saw the network expanding to the Americas, Rio de Janeiro (1847), Boston (1853), Baltimore and Chicago (1868), Havana (1885), and Buenos Aires (1893). Establishments for advanced training in music were organized in the 1940s in several Asian and African countries, including Iraq, Lebanon, and Kenya.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1979"/&gt;

To this extent, projects like [[El Sistema]] are more in line with the tradition set in Italy (where tuition at conservatories remains still free) than in an English-speaking country, where students have a very selective access to [[bursaries]] (see the [[Royal Academy of Music]] or the [[Royal College of Music]] in the UK).

==Primary and secondary education==

===Specialist music schools===
[[Image:Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere (Hauptansicht).jpg|thumb|260px|Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere is a specialist music school in Germany]]
Specialist music schools exist in many countries and whose purpose is to identify, and assist, children with exceptional potential, to benefit from world-class specialist training as part of a broad and balanced education, which will enable them, if they choose, to proceed towards self-sustaining careers in music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.areteacademy.org/ Arete Music Academy] retrieved Aug 29th 2018&lt;/ref&gt; These schools may be formally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landesmusikgymnasium.de/ Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik "Carl Maria von Weber] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or informally attached to a conservatory.  Entry is typically between the ages of ages 8 and 18 and admission is through competitive audition.
Schools may be public or independent; where schools are independent, pupils may be in receipt of governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/questions.shtml English Aided Pupil Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226141532/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/questions.shtml |date=26 December 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or private scholarships. Typically as students progress through the school the time spent on music increases and on academic subjects decrease. These schools usually teach only instrumentalists but may also include choristers.

Some schools (like conservatories) are broader and may cover the [[performing arts]]: music, drama, dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laguardiahs.org/home.html Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710011008/http://laguardiahs.org/home.html |date=10 July 2012 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music schools within schools===
Many music schools are located within existing schools. The pattern is quite diverse and may include:

Specialist music units in Scotland, where students are drawn from an area wider than the host schools catchment. Students will receive specialist music tuition within the music school but are fully integrated within the host school for other lessons. Entry to the specialist music unit or school is by competitive audition, which also effectively gives entry to the host school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicplockton.org/ Sgoil Chiùil na Gàidhealtachd] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public or independent schools contain ''music departments'', some of which achieve high standards. These are sometimes referred to as Music schools. ''Music Colleges'' in England are schools that get additional private and governmental money to specialise in music. Entry is to the host school and musical ability is not an admission requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guildfordcounty.co.uk/music Guildford County School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904033911/http://www.guildfordcounty.co.uk/music |date=4 September 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Schools which perform highly may specialise in an additional area for example sports or technology.
[[Image:Royal College of Music - April 2007.jpg|thumb|260px|300 children attend the [[Royal College of Music]]'s Junior Department]]
Music schools also frequently operate from church facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web |URL=https://angelesacademyofmusic.com/ |title= |publisher=Angeles academy of music.com |accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-college divisions===
Many conservatories or other tertiary-level institutions have pre-college divisions or junior departments for children of school age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmnyc.edu/precollege/ Manhattan School of  Music Pre-college Division] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the curriculum includes individual lesson(s), orchestra, [[chamber music]], [[music theory|theory]], [[musicianship]], [[Musical composition|composition]] and [[music technology]]. Classes are usually held on a Saturday and children attend normal schools during the week.

===Music schools outwith the general education system===
Non-governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikschule-froehlich.de/index.php/ Musik Fröhlich] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or private&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.yamaha.com/sp/music_education/music_school/ Yamaha Music Schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231210029/http://uk.yamaha.com/sp/music_education/music_school/ |date=31 December 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; schools of music offer music education outside the general education system for students aged 4 to 20+ years. In general, students attend these schools weekend or evening. These schools are typically provided by individuals, charitable or commercial organizations.

==Tertiary education==

===Conservatory===

[[File:JacobsSchoolofMusic.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Jacobs School of Music]], part of [[Indiana University]], has more than 1,600 students]]
A conservatory of music may also be known in English as ''conservatoire'' (chiefly in England&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|conservatoire}} ‘The French form of the word [...] is even sometimes assumed as the name of musical schools in England. In the U.S. the anglicized form ''conservatory'' is used.’&lt;/ref&gt;), ''conservatorium'' (in Australia&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition'': ‘''conservatorium'': (Austral.) the usual term for conservatoire’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster’s ''Third Unabridged Dictionary'': ‘Origin of ''conservatorium'': German ''Konservatorium''’&lt;/ref&gt;), ''academy'' or ''college''. Some schools or conservatories are exclusively focused on music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ram.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx Royal Academy of Music] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Others have a wider focus, for example covering music, drama and dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/ Juilliard] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatories are suitable for students who wish to develop their performance, conducting, or composition to a professional standard. Typically, they offer a high percentage of practical training combined with academic study and professional development  for those considering a career in the creative arts. Individual teaching is the strength of most components.

Students have the opportunity to perform, conduct or have their music played on a regular basis, both informally and in public.
This may be solo or as part of an orchestra, ensemble or band. Typically, conservatories focus on Western classical music. However, some schools focus on traditional instruments for example [[Chinese instrument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccmusic.edu.cn/ywwz/index.htm China Conservatory] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Others may have departments for [[traditional music]] which includes both traditional and classical instruments, for example [[bagpipes]] alongside the [[fiddle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsamd.ac.uk/undergraduate/sm/ Royal Scottish Academy for Music and Drama] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120915045605/http://www.rsamd.ac.uk/undergraduate/sm/ |date=15 September 2012 }} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, students can focus on [[jazz]], [[world music]] or pop music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahk.nl/en/conservatorium Conservatorium van Amsterdam] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The time required to complete music degrees is generally not much different from degrees in other fields, i.e. 3–4 years for a [[Bachelor of Music]] degree, 1–2 years for a [[Master of Music]] degree, and 3–5 years for a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] or [[Doctor of Music]] Degree. A PhD degree can be gained for areas such as [[musicology]], [[music theory]], [[music composition]], [[music education]], or [[music therapy]].  Some schools may offer a non-academic degree that is solely performance based, such as the (United States) A.D. or Artist Diploma; this may be offered at the undergraduate and/or graduate level.

===University schools of music===

[[File:The Kohl Building.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] shares its campus with [[Oberlin College]].]]
University music departments originally placed more emphasis on academic study of music, rather than performance. However, today, the division may not be so rigid, with many often placing greater emphasis on performance now than they did in the past. The specific balance of vocational training and academic study varies from one institution to another, and from one country to another.
Some countries separately define their institutions between university status and [[vocational university]] status, whilst other countries do not define such a rigid division. In addition to offering degrees similar to those offered at conservatories, some universities offer non-professional music-related degrees such as a Bachelor of Arts in Music or a Bachelor of Arts in Music Education. A number of previously independent conservatories have become affiliated to universities

==Campus==

===Bogota Branch===
The [[University City of Bogotá]] ({{lang-es|Ciudad Universitaria de Bogotá}}), also known as the White City ({{lang-es|Ciudad Blanca}}), is the flagship University campus.  It is located in the [[Teusaquillo]] locality, northwest of the historical center.  It is also the largest campus in Colombia, with an extension of {{convert|1200000|m2|acre|abbr=on}} and a constructed area of {{convert|308541|m2|acre|abbr=on}}, making it an ample campus with several green areas, open spaces, and pedestrian paths.  Among its buildings there are 17 which have been declared national monuments and, as a whole, it is a representation of the last 60 years of [[architecture]] in Colombia.

[[Image:PlazaCheoSantanderUNAL.JPG|thumb|right|Central square, Bogota's campus]]The campus was designed by German educationalist [[Fritz Karsen]] and architect [[Leopold Rother]], both refugees from Nazi Germany. The construction began in 1935, under the government of [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]]. It is organized as an ellipse, divided into five parts, each containing one of the academic divisions and its respective dependencies. From an aerial view, a shape of an owl can be seen, emblematic of a deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge. The buildings were constructed as prismatic blocks, and painted white, in order to give an austere and clean look.

Some landmarks in the campus are the [[León de Greiff]] Auditorium, and the ''Francisco de Paula Santander'' Plaza, also known unofficially as the "Central Plaza" or the "Ché Plaza", in honor of [[Che Guevara|Ernesto ''el Ché'' Guevara]].  The campus has its own [[Alfonso López Pumarejo Stadium|stadium]], where sometimes matches for the [[Colombian Professional Football]] are held.

===Medellín Branch===
{{Main|National University of Colombia at Medellín}}
The [[National University of Colombia at Medellín|National University of Colombia, Medellín]] has two campuses, the Central Campus and Campus Robledo, where 10,447 students study. This site provides approximately 29% of the seats for new students at National. Also this site has 555 faculty professors, of which 38% are doctors, 44% are master's, 8% were specialists and 10% are Professionals. This site offers 26 undergraduate and 73 graduate courses: 15 PhDs, 28 Masters, and 29 specializations. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Its history has given Medellín a peculiar character, since it was formed as most of their universities from the classical degrees of [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Arts]] and [[Sciences]]. The site grew out of engineering programs, which is why today, the Medellín has the highest number of engineering programs (17) among the campuses of the National University of Colombia and Colombia in general. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Central Campus: Located northwest of downtown, between Cerro Ecoparque the Flyer and the Medellín River. It is since 1938 the headquarters of the National University of Colombia in Medellin when the School of Tropical Agriculture (now the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences) joined the University. The Central Campus has an area of 272,982 m², the heart of Rio has an area of 31,758 m² and a portion of Cerro El Flying is around 269,257 m². Several learning centers can be found in at the campus including the Entomological Museum which was founded in 1937, the Museum of Mycology founded in 1987, the Herbarium "Gabriel Gutierrez," the wood collection, the Central Library "Efe Gomez" as an attractive artistic and architectural highlights, the Totem Mythic created by Master Pedro Nel Gomez, Block 41 declared a National Cultural, designed by Engineer Jesús Montoya Mejía which began in 1931, the Block 11 Master designed by Pedro Nel Gómez. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Campus Robledo Robledo, also called core or more colloquially as the School of Mines, is located northwest of the city of Medellin, Robledo neighborhood is composed of three fields separated by Kr 80, which presents a difficult high traffic pedestrian connection between the properties that make up the physical structure of the School of Mines, and Ingeominas, recently integrated into the University. It has an area of 100,978.69 m². In 1886, the School of Mines was created and it was incorporated with the University in 1936, which is called today as the National School of Mines with approximately 3,500 students. It highlights the Museum of Geosciences, Maximum classroom buildings (block M5) and M3 block designed by Master Pedro Nel Gomez School of Mines in 1936. Declared National Monument in 1994 thanks to its architecture and its murals by the same Pedro Nel Gómez. The University in Medellin has 5 faculties of the schools offer 25 careers, nearly half of them are engineering at the School of Mines, also has three museums and other services. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''near-infrared (NIR) window''' (also known as optical window or therapeutic window) defines the range of [[wavelength|wavelengths]] from 650 to 1350 nanometre (nm) where [[light]] has its maximum depth of penetration in [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].&lt;ref name="SmithMancini2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Mancini|first2=Michael C.|last3=Nie|first3=Shuming|title=Bioimaging: Second window for in vivo imaging|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=4|issue=11|year=2009|pages=710–711|issn=1748-3387|doi=10.1038/nnano.2009.326|pmc=2862008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the NIR window, scattering is the most dominant light-tissue interaction, and therefore the propagating light becomes diffused rapidly. Since scattering increases the distance travelled by [[photon|photons]] within tissue, the probability of photon absorption also increases. Because scattering has weak dependence on wavelength, the NIR window is primarily limited by the light absorption of blood at short wavelengths and water at long wavelengths. The technique using this window is called [[near-infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]]. Medical imaging techniques such as [[fluorescence image-guided surgery]] often make use of the NIR window to detect deep structures.

==Absorption properties of tissue components==
The absorption [[coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;\mu_{a}&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the probability of photon absorption in tissue per unit path length.&lt;ref&gt;LV. Wang and HI. Wu, Biomedical Optics. Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-74304-0}}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Different tissue components have different &lt;math&gt;\mu_a&lt;/math&gt; values. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\mu_a&lt;/math&gt; is a function of wavelength. Below are discussed the absorption properties of the most important [[chromophores]] in tissue. The [[molar extinction coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \,&lt;/math&gt;) is another parameter that is used to describe photon absorption in tissue. By multiplying &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \,&lt;/math&gt; by the molar concentration and by ln(10), one can convert &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mu_a \,&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Fig 1 - The molar extinction coefficient of HbO2 and Hb.png|thumb|right|alt='''Figure 1:''' The molar extinction coefficients of HbO2 and Hb .|'''Figure 1:''' The molar extinction coefficients of HbO2 and Hb.&lt;ref&gt;Molar extinction coefficients of oxy and deoxyhemoglobin compiled by Scott Prahl. URL: http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/hemoglobin.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

===Blood===
Blood consists of two different types of [[hemoglobin]]: oxyhemoglobin (&lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt;) is bound to oxygen, while deoxyhemoglobin (&lt;math&gt;Hb&lt;/math&gt;) is unbound to oxygen. These two different types of hemoglobin exhibit different absorption [[spectrum|spectra]] that are normally represented in terms of molar extinction coefficients, as shown in Figure 1. The molar extinction coefficient of Hb has its highest absorption peak at 420&amp;nbsp;nm and a second peak at 580&amp;nbsp;nm. Its spectrum then gradually decreases as light wavelength increases. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;HbO2&lt;/math&gt; shows its highest absorption peak at 410&amp;nbsp;nm, and two secondary peaks at 550&amp;nbsp;nm and 600&amp;nbsp;nm. As light wavelengths passes 600&amp;nbsp;nm, &lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt; absorption decays much faster than Hb absorption. The points where the molar extinction coefficient spectra of &lt;math&gt;Hb&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt; intersect are called [[isosbestic points]]. 

By using two different wavelengths, it is possible to calculate the concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (&lt;math&gt;C_{HbO2}&lt;/math&gt;) and deoxyhemoglobin (&lt;math&gt;C_{Hb}&lt;/math&gt;) as shown in the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(\lambda_1) = \ln(10)\varepsilon_{HbO2}(\lambda_1)C_{HbO2}+\ln(10)\varepsilon_{Hb}(\lambda_1)C_{Hb} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(\lambda_2) = \ln(10)\varepsilon_{HbO2}(\lambda_2)C_{HbO2}+\ln(10)\varepsilon_{Hb}(\lambda_2)C_{Hb} \,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Fig 2 - The absorption spectrum of water.png|thumb|200 px| right|alt='''Figure 2:''' The absorption spectrum of water .|'''Figure 2:''' The absorption spectrum of water.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Hale, and M. R. Querry, Optical constants of water in the 200 nm to 200 µm wavelength region, Appl. Opt., 12, 555-563, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

Here, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; are the two wavelengths; &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{HbO2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{Hb}&lt;/math&gt; are the molar extinction coefficients of &lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Hb&lt;/math&gt;, respectively; &lt;math&gt;C_{HbO2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{Hb}&lt;/math&gt; are the molar concentrations of &lt;math&gt;HbO_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Hb&lt;/math&gt; in tissue, respectively.
Oxygen saturation (&lt;math&gt;SO_2&lt;/math&gt;) can then be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;SO_2=\frac {C_{HbO2}} {C_{HbO2}+C_{Hb}}&lt;/math&gt;

Although water is nearly transparent in the range of visible light, it becomes absorbing over the near-infrared region. Water is a critical component since its concentration is high in human tissue. The absorption spectrum of water in the range from 250 to 1000&amp;nbsp;nm is shown in Figure 2. Although absorption is rather low in this spectral range, it still contributes to the overall attenuation of tissue.

URL: http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/melanin/extcoeff.html.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

Other tissue components with less significant contributions to the total absorption spectrum of tissue are melanin and fat.

Sterenborg, A. Pifferi, A. Torricelli, and R. Cubeddu, OSA Annual BIOMED Topical Meeting, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

===Melanin===
Melanin is a chromophore that exists in the human epidermal layer of skin responsible for protection from harmful UV radiation. When melanocytes are stimulated by solar radiation, melanin is produced.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vo-Dinh, Biomedical Photonics Handbook. Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8493-1116-0}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Melanin is one of the major absorbers of light in some biological tissue (although its contribution is smaller than other components). There are two types of melanin: eumelanin which is black-brown and pheomelanin which is red-yellow.&lt;ref&gt;George Zonios and Aikaterini Dimou, Ioannis Bassukas, Dimitrios Galaris, and Argyrios Ysolakidis and Efthimios Kaxiras, J. Biomed. Opt., Vol.13, 014017, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The molar extinction coefficient spectra corresponding to both types are shown in Figure 3. 

===Fat===
Fat is one of the major components in tissue that can comprise 10-40% of tissue. Although not many mammalian fat spectra are available, Figure 4 shows an example extracted from pig fat.&lt;ref&gt;R.L.P. van Veen, H.J.C.M. Sterenborg, A. Pifferi, A. Torricelli, and R. Cubeddu, OSA Annual BIOMED Topical Meeting, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques, C. Newman, D. Levy, and A. von Eschenbach. Univ. of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Scattering properties of tissue components==
Optical scattering occurs due to mismatches in refractive index of the different tissue components, ranging from cell membranes to whole cells. Cell nuclei and mitochondria are the most important scatterers.&lt;ref&gt;LV. Wang and HI. Wu, Biomedical Optics. Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-74304-0}}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Their dimensions range from 100&amp;nbsp;nm to 6 μm, and thus fall within the NIR window. Most of these organelles fall in the [[Mie regime]], and exhibit highly anisotropic forward-directed scattering.&lt;ref&gt;T. Vo-Dinh, Biomedical Photonics Handbook. Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8493-1116-0}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Light scattering in biological tissue is denoted by the scattering coefficient (&lt;math&gt;\mu_s&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined as the probability of photon scattering in tissue per unit path length.&lt;ref&gt;LV. Wang and HI. Wu, Biomedical Optics. Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-74304-0}}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 5 shows a plot of the scattering spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;S. Jacques, C. Newman, D. Levy, and A. von Eschenbach. Univ. of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective attenuation coefficient==
Attenuation of light in deep biological tissue depends on the effective attenuation coefficient (&lt;math&gt;\mu_{eff}&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\text{eff}}=\sqrt{3\mu_a(\mu_a+\mu'_s)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu'_s&lt;/math&gt; is the transport scattering coefficient defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mu'_\text{s}=\mu_s (1-g) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the anisotropy of biological tissue, which has a representative value of 0.9. Figure 5 shows a plot of transport scattering coefficient spectrum in breast tissue, which has a wavelength dependence of &lt;math&gt;\lambda \,^{-0.7}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = SS&gt;S. Srinivasan, B. Pogue, S. Jiang, H. Dehghani, C. Kogel, S. Soho, J. Gibson, T. Tosteson, S. Poplack, and K. Paulsen, K D 2003, Proc Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100 12349 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The effective attenuation coefficient is the dominant factor for determining light attenuation at depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; ≫ 1/ &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\text{eff}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Estimation of the NIR window in tissue==
The NIR window can be computed based on the absorption coefficient spectrum or the effective attenuation coefficient spectrum. A possible criterion for selecting the NIR window is given by the FWHM of the inverse of these spectra as shown in Figure 7. 

In addition to the total concentration of hemoglobin, the oxygen saturation will define the concentration of oxy and deoxyhemoglobin in tissue and so the total absorption spectrum. Depending on the type of tissue, we can consider different situations. Below, the total concentration of hemoglobin is assumed to be 2.3 mM.

 }}

===Absorption spectrum for arteries===
In this case &lt;math&gt;SaO_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 98% (arterial oxygen saturation). Then oxyhemoglobin will be dominant in the total absorption (black) and the effective attenuation (magenta) coefficient spectra, as shown in Figure 6 (a).

===Absorption spectrum for veins===
In this case &lt;math&gt;SvO_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 60% (venous oxygen saturation). Then oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin will have similar contributions to the total absorption (black) and the effective attenuation (magenta) coefficient spectra, as shown in Figure 6 (b).

===Absorption spectrum for breast tissue===
To define &lt;math&gt;StO_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; (tissue oxygen saturation) (or &lt;math&gt;TSI \,&lt;/math&gt; (tissue saturation index)), it is necessary to define a distribution of arteries and veins in tissue. an arterial-venous blood volume ratio of 20%/80% can be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;S.

The total absorption (black) and the effective attenuation (magenta) coefficient spectra for breast tissue is shown in Figure 6 (c). In addition, the effective penetration depth is plotted in Figure 7.

'''Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-''co''-3-hydroxyvalerate)''', commonly known as '''PHBV''', is a [[polyhydroxyalkanoate]]-type polymer. It is [[biodegradable]], [[nontoxic]], [[biocompatible]] plastic produced naturally by [[bacteria]] and a good alternative for many non-biodegradable [[synthetic polymers]]. It is a [[thermoplastic]] linear aliphatic [[polyester]].  It is obtained by the [[copolymerization]] of [[3-hydroxybutanoic acid]] and [[3-hydroxypentanoic acid]]. PHBV is used in speciality packaging, orthopedic devices and in controlled release of drugs. PHBV undergoes bacterial degradation in the environment.

== History ==
PHBV was first manufactured in 1983 by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI). It is commercialized under the trade name '''Biopol'''. ICI ([[Zeneca]]) sold it to [[Monsanto]] in 1996. This was then obtained by [[Metabolix]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="VasileZaikov2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cornelia Vasile|author2=Gennady Zaikov|title=Environmentally Degradable Materials Based on Multicomponent Polymeric Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LPkghmXr47YC&amp;pg=PA228|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=31 December 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16410-9|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudnik2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewa Rudnik|title=Compostable Polymer Materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrQwn8XzKlEC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=3 January 2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045371-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Biomer L''' is the trade name of PHBV from Biomer.

== Synthesis ==
PHBV is synthesized by bacteria as storage compounds under growth limiting conditions.&lt;ref name="Chiellini2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emo Chiellini|title=Biorelated Polymers: Sustainable Polymer Science and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=375oq7kjGOQC&amp;pg=PA147|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=31 October 2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46652-6|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be produced from glucose and [[propionate]] by the recombinant ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains.&lt;ref name="VasileZaikov2009" /&gt; Many other bacteria like ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' and ''[[Ralstonia eutropha]]'' are also capable of producing it.

It can also be synthesized from [[genetically engineered]] plants.&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Srikanth Pilla|title=Handbook of Bioplastics and Biocomposites Engineering Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMh827DUbGgC&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=20 July 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-62607-8|pages=373–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHBV is a [[copolymer]] of [[3-hydroxybutanoic acid]] and [[3-hydroxypentanoic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Chemistry XII Part II | publisher=NCERT | pages=435 | url=http://ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/textbook/textbook.htm?lech2=6-7 | chapter=Polymers}}&lt;/ref&gt; PHBV may also be synthesized from [[butyrolactone]] and [[valerolactone]] in the presence of oligomeric [[aluminoxane]] as [[catalyst]].&lt;ref name="biodeg"/&gt;

== Structure ==
The monomers, 3-hydroxybutanoic acid and 3-hydroxypentanoic acid, are joined by [[ester bond]]s; the back bone of the polymer is made up of carbon and oxygen atoms.
The property of the PHBV depends upon the ratio of these two [[monomer]]s in it. 
3-hydroxybutanoic acid provides stiffness while 3-hydroxypentanoic acid promotes flexibility. Thus PHBV can be made to resemble either [[polypropylene]] or [[polyethylene]] by changing the ratio of monomers.&lt;ref name="Barbucci2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rolando Barbucci|title=Integrated Biomaterials Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfQKjggEMyUC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=31 October 2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46678-6|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increase in the ratio of 3-hydroxybutanoic acid to 3-hydroxypentanoic acid results in an increase in melting point, water [[permeation|permeability]], [[glass transition temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) and tensile strength. However impact resistance is reduced.&lt;ref name="Rudnik2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biodeg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biodeg.net/bioplastic.html | title=Bioplastics - Biodegradable polyesters (PLA, PHA, PCL ...) | work=biodeg.net | accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
PHBV is a thermoplastic polymer. It is brittle, has low elongation at break and low impact resistance.&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"/&gt;

== Uses ==
PHBV find its applications in controlled release of drugs, medical implants and repairs, [[Luxury and specialty packaging|specialty packaging]], orthopedic devices and manufacturing bottles for consumer goods. It is also biodegradable which can be used as an alternative to non biodegradable plastics&lt;ref name="Kaplan1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kaplan|title=Biopolymers from Renewable Resources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mM73CrwADx0C&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=7 July 1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-63567-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degradation ==
When disposed, PHBV degrades into carbon dioxide and water. PHBV undergo bacterial degradation. PHBV, just like fats to human, is an energy source to microorganisms. Enzymes produced by them degrade it and are consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/89/3/839.full.pdf | title=Materials derived from biomass/biodegradable materials | accessdate=July 11, 2012 | author=William D. Luzier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHBV has a low [[thermal stability]] and the [[bond cleavage|cleavage]] occurs at the ester bond by [[&amp;beta; elimination]] reaction.&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"/&gt;

[[Hydrolytic]] degradation occurs only slowly making it usable in medical applications.

== Drawbacks ==
PHBV, being biodegradable, biocompatible and renewable, is a good alternative for synthetic nonbiodegradable polymers made from petroleum. But it has the following drawbacks,&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"/&gt;
* Expensive
* Low thermal stability
* Brittle
* Primitive mechanical properties
* Processing difficulty

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6796">{{for|formal and natural language features to indicate quantity|Quantifier (logic)|Quantifier (linguistics)}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[empirical science]], '''quantification''' (or '''quantitation''') is the act of [[counting]] and [[measuring]] that maps human sense [[observation]]s and [[experience]]s into [[quantity|quantities]]. Quantification in this sense is fundamental to the [[scientific method]].

==Natural science==
Some measure of the undisputed general importance of quantification in the [[natural science]]s can be gleaned from the following comments:

* "these are mere facts, but they are quantitative facts and the basis of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[James McKeen Cattell|Cattell, James McKeen]]; and [[Livingston Farrand|Farrand, Livingston]] (1896) "Physical and mental measurements of the students of Columbia University", ''The Psychological Review'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;6 (1896), pp.&amp;nbsp;618-648; p.&amp;nbsp;648 quoted in ''[http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/jcattell.shtml James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944) Psychologist, Publisher, and Editor.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* It seems to be held as universally true that "the foundation of quantification is measurement."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Stanley Wilks|Wilks, Samuel Stanley]] (1961) "Some Aspects of Quantification in Science", ''Isis'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;52, No.&amp;nbsp;2 (1961), pp.&amp;nbsp;135-142; p.&amp;nbsp;135&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is little doubt that "quantification provided a basis for the objectivity of science."&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Sungook (2004) "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/305/5690/1569 History of Science: Building Circuits of Trust]", ''Science'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;305, No.&amp;nbsp;5690 (10 September 2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;1569-1570&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ancient times, "musicians and artists ... rejected quantification, but merchants, by definition, quantified their affairs, in order to survive, made them visible on parchment and paper."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred W. Crosby|Crosby, Alfred W.]] (1996) ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification and Western Society'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any reasonable "comparison between Aristotle and Galileo shows clearly that there can be no unique lawfulness discovered without detailed quantification."&lt;ref&gt;Langs, Robert J. (1987) "[http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=cps.023.0555a Psychoanalysis as an Aristotelian Science—Pathways to Copernicus and a Modern-Day Approach]", ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;23 &lt;!-- one vol. per year --&gt;(1987), pp.&amp;nbsp;555-576&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even today, "universities use imperfect instruments called '[[exams]]' to indirectly quantify something they call knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Lynch, Aaron]] (1999) "[http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/1999/vol3/lynch_a.html Misleading Mix of Religion and Science,]" ''Journal of Memetics: Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;!-- because there are only two issues, and there is Gatherer, Derek G. (1999) "Reply to Commentaries", ''Journal of Memetics: Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission, Vol.&amp;nbsp;3 [No.&amp;nbsp;2] (1999) http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/1999/vol3/gatherer_reply.html --&gt; (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

This meaning of quantification comes under the heading of [[Pragmatism|pragmatics]].{{clarify|date=October 2017}}

In some instances in the natural sciences a seemingly intangible concept may be quantified by creating a scale—for example, a [[pain scale]] in medical research, or a discomfort scale at the intersection of [[meteorology]] and [[human physiology]] such as the [[heat index]] measuring the combined perceived effect of heat and [[humidity]], or the [[wind chill factor]] measuring the combined perceived effects of cold and wind.

==Social sciences==
{{See also|Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior|Quantitative psychological research}}

In the [[social sciences]], quantification is an integral part of [[economics]] and [[psychology]]. Both disciplines gather data – economics by [[empirical observation]] and psychology by [[experimentation]] – and both use [[statistics|statistical techniques]] such as [[regression analysis]] to draw conclusions from it.

In some instances a seemingly intangible property may be quantified by asking subjects to rate something on a [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]—for example, a [[Happiness economics#Methodology|happiness scale]] or a [[Self-Perceived Quality of Life Scale|quality of life scale]]—or by the construction of a scale by the researcher, as with the [[index of economic freedom]]. In other cases, an unobservable variable may be quantified by replacing it with a [[proxy (statistics)|proxy variable]] with which it is highly correlated—for example, per capita [[gross domestic product]] is often used as a proxy for [[standard of living]] or [[quality of life]].

Frequently in the use of regression, the presence or absence of a trait is quantified by employing a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]], which takes on the value 1 in the presence of the trait or the value 0 in the absence of the trait.

[[Quantitative linguistics]] is an area of [[linguistics]] that relies on quantification. For example,&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Joan; Perkins, Revere; and Pagliuca, William. (1994) ''The Evolution of Grammar'', Univ. of Chicago Press: ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; indices of [[grammaticalization]] of [[morpheme]]s, such as [[phonology|phonological]] shortness, dependence on surroundings, and fusion with the verb, have been developed and found to be significantly correlated across languages with stage of evolution of function of the morpheme.

==Hard versus soft science==
The ease of quantification is one of the features used to distinguish [[hard and soft science]]s from each other. Scientists often consider hard sciences to be more scientific or rigorous, but this is disputed by social scientists who maintain that appropriate rigor includes the qualitative evaluation of the broader contexts of qualitative data. In some [[social sciences]] such as [[sociology]], quantitative data are difficult to obtain, either because laboratory conditions are not present or because the issues involved are conceptual but not directly quantifiable. Thus in these cases [[qualitative methods]] are preferred. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A '''radioimmunoassay''' ('''RIA''') is an [[immunoassay]] that uses [[radioactive tracer|radiolabeled]] molecules in a stepwise formation of [[immune complex]]es. An RIA is a very sensitive [[in vitro]] assay technique used to measure concentrations of substances, usually measuring [[antigen]] concentrations (for example, [[hormone]] levels in [[blood]]) by use of [[antibody|antibodies]]. 

Although the RIA technique is extremely [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] and extremely [[Specificity (tests)|specific]], requiring specialized equipment, it remains among the least expensive methods to perform such measurements. It requires special precautions and licensing, since radioactive substances are used.

In contrast, an [[immunoradiometric assay]] (IRMA) is an immunoassay that uses radiolabeled molecules but in an immediate rather than stepwise way. 

A [[radioallergosorbent test]] (RAST) is an example of radioimmunoassay. It is used to detect the causative [[allergen]] for an [[allergy]].

==Method==
Classically, to perform a radioimmunoassay, a known quantity of an [[antigen]] is made [[radioactivity|radioactive]], frequently by labeling it with gamma-radioactive [[isotopes of iodine]], such as [[Iodine-125|125-I]], attached to [[tyrosine]]. This radiolabeled antigen is then mixed with a known amount of [[antibodies|antibody]] for that antigen, and as a result, the two specifically bind to one another. Then, a sample of [[Blood serum|serum]] from a patient containing an unknown quantity of that same antigen is added. This causes the unlabeled (or "cold") antigen from the serum to compete with the radiolabeled antigen ("hot") for antibody binding sites. As the [[concentration]] of "cold" antigen is increased, more of it binds to the antibody, displacing the radiolabeled variant, and reducing the ratio of antibody-bound radiolabeled antigen to free radiolabeled antigen. The bound antigens are then separated from the unbound ones, and the radioactivity of the free(unbound) antigen remaining in the [supernatant] is measured using a [[gamma counter]].

This method can be used for any biological molecule in principle and is not restricted to serum antigens, nor is it required to use the indirect method of measuring the free antigen instead of directly measuring the captured antigen.  For example, if it is undesirable or not possible to radiolabel the antigen or target molecule of interest, a RIA can be done if two different antibodies that recognize the target are available and the target is large enough (e.g., a protein) to present multiple [[epitope]]s to the antibodies.  One antibody would be radiolabeled as above while the other would remain unmodified.  The RIA would begin with the "cold" unlabeled antibody being allowed to interact and bind to the target molecule in solution. Preferably, this unlabeled antibody is immobilized in some way, such as coupled to an [[agarose]] bead, coated to a surface, etc.  Next, the "hot" radiolabeled antibody is allowed to interact with the first antibody-target molecule complex.  After extensive washing, the direct amount of  radioactive antibody bound is measured and the amount of target molecule quantified by comparing it to a reference amount assayed at the same time.  This method is similar in principle to the non-radioactive sandwich [[ELISA]] method.

==History==

This method was developed by [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]], [[Roger Guillemin]], and [[Andrew Schally]] at the Veterans Administration Hospital in the Bronx, New York.  This revolutionary development earned Dr. Yalow the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1977, the second woman ever to win it.  In her acceptance speech, Dr. Yalow said, "The world cannot afford the loss of the talents of half its people if we are to solve the many problems which beset us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vare|first1=Ethlie Ann|last2=Ptacek|first2=Greg|title=Patently female : from AZT to TV dinners : stories of women inventors and their breakthrough ideas|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0471023345|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''scheduling''' is the method by which work specified by some means is assigned to resources that complete the work.  The work may be virtual computation elements such as [[thread (computer science)|threads]], [[process (computing)|processes]] or data [[flow (computer networking)|flows]], which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as [[central processing unit|processors]], [[telecommunications link|network links]] or [[expansion card]]s.

A scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity.  Schedulers are often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target [[quality of service]].  Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the [[execution model]] of a computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have [[computer multitasking]] with a single [[central processing unit]] (CPU).

A scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals, for example: 
&lt;!-- throughput --&gt;
maximizing ''[[throughput]]'' (the total amount of work completed per time unit); 
&lt;!-- wait time --&gt;
minimizing  ''[[Computer performance#Response time|wait time]]'' 
(time from work becoming enabled until the first point it begins execution on resources); 
&lt;!-- response_time/latency for batch systems --&gt;
minimizing ''[[latency (engineering)|latency]]'' or ''[[Response time (technology)|response time]]'' (time from work becoming enabled until it is finished in case of batch activity,&lt;ref name="liu1973"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;!-- fairness --&gt;
or maximizing ''fairness'' (equal CPU time to each process, or more generally appropriate times according to the priority and workload of each process).  In practice, these goals often conflict (e.g. throughput versus latency), thus a scheduler will implement a suitable compromise.  Preference is measured by any one of the concerns mentioned above, depending upon the user's needs and objectives.

In [[real-time computing|real-time]] environments, such as [[embedded system]]s for [[automatic control]] in industry (for example [[robotics]]), the scheduler also must ensure that processes can meet [[time limit|deadlines]]; this is crucial for keeping the system stable. Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote devices across a network and [[device Management|managed]] through an administrative back end.

=={{Anchor|SCHEDULER}}Types of operating system schedulers==
{{See also|Network scheduler|I/O scheduling|Job scheduler}}

The scheduler is an operating system module that selects the next jobs to be admitted into the system and the next process to run. Operating systems may feature up to three distinct scheduler types: a ''long-term scheduler'' (also known as an admission scheduler or high-level scheduler), a ''mid-term or medium-term scheduler'', and a ''short-term scheduler''. The names suggest the relative frequency with which their functions are performed.

==={{Anchor|PROCESS}}Process scheduler===
The process scheduler is a part of the operating system that decides which process runs at a certain point in time. It usually has the ability to pause a running process, move it to the back of the running queue and start a new process; such a scheduler is known as ''[[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] scheduler'', otherwise it is a ''[[Nonpreemptive multitasking|cooperative]] scheduler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{Anchor|LONG-TERM}}Long-term scheduling====
The ''long-term scheduler'', or ''admission scheduler'', decides which jobs or processes are to be admitted to the ready queue (in main memory); that is, when an attempt is made to execute a program, its admission to the set of currently executing processes is either authorized or delayed by the long-term scheduler. Thus, this scheduler dictates what processes are to run on a system, and the degree of concurrency to be supported at any one time{{snd}} whether many or few processes are to be executed concurrently, and how the split between I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive processes is to be handled. The long-term scheduler is responsible for controlling the degree of multiprogramming.

In general, most processes can be described as either [[I/O-bound]] or [[CPU-bound]]. An I/O-bound process is one that spends more of its time doing I/O than it spends doing computations. A CPU-bound process, in contrast, generates I/O requests infrequently, using more of its time doing computations. It is important that a long-term scheduler selects a good process mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes. If all processes are I/O-bound, the ready queue will almost always be empty, and the short-term scheduler will have little to do. On the other hand, if all processes are CPU-bound, the I/O waiting queue will almost always be empty, devices will go unused, and again the system will be unbalanced. The system with the best performance will thus have a combination of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes. In modern operating systems, this is used to make sure that real-time processes get enough CPU time to finish their tasks.&lt;ref name="galvin"&gt;{{cite book
| authors = [[Abraham Silberschatz]], Peter Baer Galvin and Greg Gagne

| volume = 9

| publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.
| isbn= 978-1-118-06333-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term scheduling is also important in large-scale systems such as [[batch processing]] systems, [[computer cluster]]s, [[supercomputer]]s, and [[render farm]]s. For example, in [[concurrent computing|concurrent systems]], [[coscheduling]] of interacting processes is often required to prevent them from blocking due to waiting on each other. In these cases, special-purpose [[job scheduler]] software is typically used to assist these functions, in addition to any underlying admission scheduling support in the operating system.

===={{Anchor|MEDIUM-TERM}}Medium-term scheduling====
The ''medium-term scheduler'' temporarily removes processes from main memory and places them in secondary memory (such as a [[hard disk drive]]) or vice versa, which is commonly referred to as "swapping out" or "swapping in" (also incorrectly as "[[paging]] out" or "paging in").  The medium-term scheduler may decide to swap out a process which has not been active for some time, or a process which has a low priority, or a process which is [[page fault]]ing frequently, or a process which is taking up a large amount of memory in order to free up main memory for other processes, swapping the process back in later when more memory is available, or when the process has been unblocked and is no longer waiting for a resource.  [Stallings, 396]  [Stallings, 370]

In many systems today (those that support mapping virtual address space to secondary storage other than the swap file), the medium-term scheduler may actually perform the role of the long-term scheduler, by treating binaries as "swapped out processes" upon their execution.  In this way, when a segment of the binary is required it can be swapped in on demand, or "lazy loaded".  [Stallings, 394]

===={{Anchor|SHORT-TERM}}Short-term scheduling====
The ''short-term scheduler'' (also known as the ''CPU scheduler'') decides which of the ready, in-memory processes is to be executed (allocated a CPU) after a clock [[interrupt]], an I/O interrupt, an operating [[system call]] or another form of [[Signal programming|signal]].  Thus the short-term scheduler makes scheduling decisions much more frequently than the long-term or mid-term schedulers{{snd}}a scheduling decision will at a minimum have to be made after every time slice, and these are very short.  This scheduler can be [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]], implying that it is capable of forcibly removing processes from a CPU when it decides to allocate that CPU to another process, or non-preemptive (also known as "voluntary" or "co-operative"), in which case the scheduler is unable to "force" processes off the CPU.

A preemptive scheduler relies upon a [[programmable interval timer]] which invokes an [[interrupt handler]] that runs in [[kernel mode]] and implements the scheduling function.

===={{Anchor|DISPATCH-LATENCY}}Dispatcher====
Another component that is involved in the CPU-scheduling function is the dispatcher, which is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler. It receives control in kernel mode as the result of an interrupt or system call. The functions of a dispatcher involve the following:

* [[Context switch]]es, in which the dispatcher saves the [[State (computer science)|state]] (also known as [[Context (computing)|context]]) of the [[Process (computing)|process]] or [[Thread (computing)|thread]] that was previously running; the dispatcher then loads the initial or previously saved state of the new process.
* Switching to user mode.
* Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program indicated by its new state.

The dispatcher should be as fast as possible, since it is invoked during every process switch. During the context switches, the processor is virtually idle for a fraction of time, thus unnecessary context switches should be avoided. The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another is known as the ''dispatch latency''.&lt;ref name="galvin" /&gt;{{rp|155}}

==Scheduling disciplines==
Scheduling disciplines are algorithms used for distributing resources among parties which simultaneously and asynchronously request them. Scheduling disciplines are used in [[router (computing)|router]]s (to handle packet traffic) as well as in [[operating system]]s (to share [[CPU time]] among both [[thread (computer science)|threads]] and [[process (computing)|processes]]), disk drives ([[I/O scheduling]]), printers ([[print spooler]]), most embedded systems, etc.

The main purposes of scheduling algorithms are to minimize [[resource starvation]] and to ensure fairness amongst the parties utilizing the resources. Scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the outstanding requests is to be allocated resources. There are many different scheduling algorithms. In this section, we introduce several of them.

In [[packet-switched]] [[computer networks]] and other [[statistical multiplexing]], the notion of a '''scheduling algorithm''' is used as an alternative to [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|first-come first-served]] queuing of data packets.

The simplest best-effort scheduling algorithms are [[round-robin scheduling|round-robin]], [[fair queuing]] (a [[max-min fair]] scheduling algorithm), [[proportionally fair]] scheduling and [[maximum throughput scheduling|maximum throughput]]. If differentiated or guaranteed [[quality of service]] is offered, as opposed to best-effort communication, [[weighted fair queuing]] may be utilized.

In advanced packet radio wireless networks such as [[HSDPA]] (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) [[3.5G]] cellular system, '''channel-dependent scheduling''' may be used to take advantage of [[channel state information]]. If the channel conditions are favourable, the [[throughput]] and [[system spectral efficiency]] may be increased. In even more advanced systems such as [[LTE Advanced|LTE]], the scheduling is combined by channel-dependent packet-by-packet [[dynamic channel allocation]], or by assigning [[OFDMA]] multi-carriers or other [[frequency-domain equalization]] components to the users that best can utilize them.&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Guowang Miao]]|author2=Jens Zander|author3=Ki Won Sung|author4=Ben Slimane|title=Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=1107143217|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First come, first served===
{{Main article|FIFO (computing and electronics)}}

[[File:Thread pool.svg|thumb|400px|A sample [[thread pool]] (green boxes) with a queue (FIFO) of waiting tasks (blue) and a queue of completed tasks (yellow)]]

''First in, first out'' ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]]), also known as ''first come, first served'' (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm. FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue. This is commonly used for a '''{{visible anchor|task queue}}''', for example as illustrated in this section.

* Since context switches only occur upon process termination, and no reorganization of the process queue is required, scheduling overhead is minimal.
* Throughput can be low, because long processes can be holding CPU, waiting the short processes for a long time (known as convoy effect).
* No starvation, because each process gets chance to be executed after a definite time.
* [[Turnaround time]], waiting time and response time depends on the order of their arrival and can be high for the same reasons above.
* No prioritization occurs, thus this system has trouble meeting process deadlines.
* The lack of prioritization means that as long as every process eventually completes, there is no starvation. In an environment where some processes might not complete, there can be starvation.
* It is based on queuing.

===Priority scheduling===
{{Main article|Earliest deadline first scheduling}}
{{See also|Deadline-monotonic scheduling|}}
Earliest deadline first (EDF) or ''least time to go'' is a dynamic scheduling algorithm used in real-time operating systems to place processes in a priority queue. Whenever a scheduling event occurs (a task finishes, new task is released, etc.), the queue will be searched for the process closest to its deadline, which will be the next to be scheduled for execution.

===Shortest remaining time first ===
{{Main article|Shortest remaining time}}

Similar to [[shortest job first]] (SJF). With this strategy the scheduler arranges processes with the least estimated processing time remaining to be next in the queue. This requires advanced knowledge or estimations about the time required for a process to complete.

* If a shorter process arrives during another process' execution, the currently running process is interrupted (known as preemption), dividing that process into two separate computing blocks. This creates excess overhead through additional context switching. The scheduler must also place each incoming process into a specific place in the queue, creating additional overhead.
* This algorithm is designed for maximum throughput in most scenarios.
* Waiting time and response time increase as the process's computational requirements increase. Since turnaround time is based on waiting time plus processing time, longer processes are significantly affected by this. Overall waiting time is smaller than FIFO, however since no process has to wait for the termination of the longest process.
* No particular attention is given to deadlines, the programmer can only attempt to make processes with deadlines as short as possible.
* Starvation is possible, especially in a busy system with many small processes being run.
* To use this policy we should have at least two processes of different priority

===Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling===
{{Main article|Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling}}

The operating system assigns a fixed priority rank to every process, and the scheduler arranges the processes in the ready queue in order of their priority.  Lower-priority processes get interrupted by incoming higher-priority processes.
* Overhead is not minimal, nor is it significant.
* FPPS has no particular advantage in terms of throughput over FIFO scheduling.
* If the number of rankings is limited, it can be characterized as a collection of FIFO queues, one for each priority ranking.  Processes in lower-priority queues are selected only when all of the higher-priority queues are empty.
* Waiting time and response time depend on the priority of the process.  Higher-priority processes have smaller waiting and response times.
* Deadlines can be met by giving processes with deadlines a higher priority.
* Starvation of lower-priority processes is possible with large numbers of high-priority processes queuing for CPU time.

===Round-robin scheduling===
{{Main article|Round-robin scheduling}}

The scheduler assigns a fixed time unit per process, and cycles through them. If process completes within that time-slice it gets terminated otherwise it is rescheduled after giving a chance to all other processes.

* RR scheduling involves extensive overhead, especially with a small time unit.
* Balanced throughput between FCFS/ FIFO and SJF/SRTF, shorter jobs are completed faster than in FIFO and longer processes are completed faster than in SJF.
* Good average response time, waiting time is dependent on number of processes, and not average process length.
* Because of high waiting times, deadlines are rarely met in a pure RR system.
* Starvation can never occur, since no priority is given. Order of time unit allocation is based upon process arrival time, similar to FIFO.
* If Time-Slice is large it becomes FCFS /FIFO or if it is short then it becomes SJF/SRTF.

===Multilevel queue scheduling===
{{Main article|Multilevel queue}}

This is used for situations in which processes are easily divided into different groups. For example, a common division is made between foreground (interactive) processes and background (batch) processes. These two types of processes have different response-time requirements and so may have different scheduling needs. It is very useful for shared memory problems.

===Work-conserving schedulers===
{{Main article|Work-conserving scheduler}}

A [[work-conserving scheduler]] is a scheduler that always tries to keep the scheduled resources busy, if there are submitted jobs ready to be scheduled. In contrast, a non-work conserving scheduler is a scheduler that, in some cases, may leave the scheduled resources idle despite the presence of jobs ready to be scheduled.

===Scheduling optimization problems===
There are several scheduling problems in which the goal is to decide which job goes to which station at what time, such that the total [[makespan]] is minimized:
* [[Job shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} identical stations. Each job should be executed on a single machine. This is usually regarded as an online problem.
* [[Open-shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} different stations. Each job should spend some time at each station, in a free order.
* [[Flow shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} different stations. Each job should spend some time at each station, in a pre-determined order.

===Manual scheduling===
A very common method in embedded systems is to schedule jobs manually. This can for example be done in a time-multiplexed fashion. Sometimes the kernel is divided in three or more parts: Manual scheduling, preemptive and interrupt level. Exact methods for scheduling jobs are often proprietary.

* No resource starvation problems
* Very high predictability; allows implementation of hard real-time systems
* Almost no overhead
* May not be optimal for all applications
* Effectiveness is completely dependent on the implementation

===Choosing a scheduling algorithm===
When designing an operating system, a programmer must consider which scheduling algorithm will perform best for the use the system is going to see. There is no universal “best” scheduling algorithm, and many operating systems use extended or combinations of the scheduling algorithms above.

For example, [[Windows NT]]/XP/Vista uses a [[multilevel feedback queue]], a combination of fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, round-robin, and first in, first out algorithms. In this system, threads can dynamically increase or decrease in priority depending on if it has been serviced already, or if it has been waiting extensively. Every priority level is represented by its own queue, with [[round-robin scheduling]] among the high-priority threads and [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] among the lower-priority ones. In this sense, response time is short for most threads, and short but critical system threads get completed very quickly. Since threads can only use one time unit of the round-robin in the highest-priority queue, starvation can be a problem for longer high-priority threads.

==Operating system process scheduler implementations==
The algorithm used may be as simple as [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] in which each process is given equal time (for instance 1&amp;nbsp;ms, usually between 1&amp;nbsp;ms and 100&amp;nbsp;ms) in a cycling list. So, process A executes for 1&amp;nbsp;ms, then process B, then process C, then back to process A.

More advanced algorithms take into account process priority, or the importance of the process.  This allows some processes to use more time than other processes. The kernel always uses whatever resources it needs to ensure proper functioning of the system, and so can be said to have infinite priority. In [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]](symmetric multiprocessing) systems, [[processor affinity]] is considered to increase overall system performance, even if it may cause a process itself to run more slowly.  This generally improves performance by reducing [[cache thrashing]].

===OS/360 and successors===
IBM [[OS/360 and successors|OS/360]] was available with three different schedulers.  The differences were such that the variants were often considered three different operating systems:

* The ''Single Sequential Scheduler'' option, also known as the ''Primary Control Program (PCP)'' provided sequential execution of a single stream of jobs.
* The ''Multiple Sequential Scheduler'' option, known as ''Multiprogramming with a Fixed Number of Tasks (MFT)'' provided execution of multiple concurrent jobs.  Execution was governed by a priority which had a default for each stream or could be requested separately for each job.  MFT version II added subtasks (threads), which executed at a priority based on that of the parent job.  Each job stream defined the maximum amount of memory which could be used by any job in that stream.
* The ''Multiple Priority Schedulers'' option, or ''Multiprogramming with a Variable Number of Tasks (MVT)'', featured subtasks from the start; each job requested the priority and memory it required before execution.

Later virtual storage versions of MVS added a ''[[Workload Manager]]'' feature to the scheduler, which schedules processor resources according to an elaborate scheme defined by the installation.

===Windows===
Very early [[MS-DOS]] and Microsoft Windows systems were non-multitasking, and as such did not feature a scheduler. [[Windows 3.1x]] used a non-preemptive scheduler, meaning that it did not interrupt programs. It relied on the program to end or tell the OS that it didn't need the processor so that it could move on to another process. This is usually called cooperative multitasking. Windows 95 introduced a rudimentary preemptive scheduler; however, for legacy support opted to let 16 bit applications run without preemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.jgcampbell.com/caos/html/node13.html |date=* |title=Early Windows }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows NT]]-based operating systems use a multilevel feedback queue. 32 priority levels are defined, 0 through to 31, with priorities 0 through 15 being "normal" priorities and priorities 16 through 31 being soft real-time priorities, requiring privileges to assign. 0 is reserved for the Operating System. Users can select 5 of these priorities to assign to a running application from the Task Manager application, or through thread management APIs. The kernel may change the priority level of a thread depending on its I/O and CPU usage and whether it is interactive (i.e. accepts and responds to input from humans), raising the priority of interactive and I/O bounded processes and lowering that of CPU bound processes, to increase the responsiveness of interactive applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tale of Two Schedulers Windows NT and Windows CE |url=http://sriramk.com/schedulers.html |author=Sriram Krishnan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722015555/http://sriramk.com/schedulers.html |archivedate=July 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheduler was modified in [[Windows Vista]] to use the [[Time Stamp Counter|cycle counter register]] of modern processors to keep track of exactly how many CPU cycles a thread has executed, rather than just using an interval-timer interrupt routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc162494.aspx |title=Windows Administration: Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part 1 |website=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vista also uses a priority scheduler for the I/O queue so that disk defragmenters and other such programs do not interfere with foreground operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080219174631/http://blog.gabefrost.com/?p=25 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic Mac OS and macOS===
Mac OS 9 uses cooperative scheduling for threads, where one process controls multiple cooperative threads, and also provides preemptive scheduling for multiprocessing tasks. The kernel schedules multiprocessing tasks using a preemptive scheduling algorithm. All Process Manager processes run within a special multiprocessing task, called the "blue task". Those processes are scheduled cooperatively, using a [[round-robin scheduling]] algorithm; a process yields control of the processor to another process by explicitly calling a {{req|blocking function}} such as &lt;code&gt;WaitNextEvent&lt;/code&gt;. Each process has its own copy of the [[Thread Manager]] that schedules that process's threads cooperatively; a thread yields control of the processor to another thread by calling &lt;code&gt;YieldToAnyThread&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;YieldToThread&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=appletn2028&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2028.html |title=Technical Notes |website=Developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

macOS uses a multilevel feedback queue, with four priority bands for threads{{snd}}normal, system high priority, kernel mode only, and real-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/scheduler/scheduler.html |title=Guides and Sample Code |website=Developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threads are scheduled preemptively; macOS also supports cooperatively scheduled threads in its implementation of the Thread Manager in [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]].&lt;ref name=appletn2028/&gt;

===AIX===
In AIX Version 4 there are three possible values for thread scheduling policy:

* First In, First Out: Once a thread with this policy is scheduled, it runs to completion unless it is blocked, it voluntarily yields control of the CPU, or a higher-priority thread becomes dispatchable. Only fixed-priority threads can have a FIFO scheduling policy.
* Round Robin: This is similar to the AIX Version 3 scheduler round-robin scheme based on 10ms time slices. When a RR thread has control at the end of the time slice, it moves to the tail of the queue of dispatchable threads of its priority. Only fixed-priority threads can have a Round Robin scheduling policy.
* OTHER: This policy is defined by POSIX1003.4a as implementation-defined. In AIX Version 4, this policy is defined to be equivalent to RR, except that it applies to threads with non-fixed priority. The recalculation of the running thread's priority value at each clock interrupt means that a thread may lose control because its priority value has risen above that of another dispatchable thread. This is the AIX Version 3 behavior.

Threads are primarily of interest for applications that currently consist of several asynchronous processes. These applications might impose a lighter load on the system if converted to a multithreaded structure.

AIX 5 implements the following scheduling policies: FIFO, round robin, and a fair round robin. The FIFO policy has three different implementations: FIFO, FIFO2, and FIFO3. The round robin policy is named SCHED_RR in AIX, and the fair round robin is called SCHED_OTHER.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aix5_cpu/index.html#N100F6]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094049/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aix5_cpu/index.html |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linux===
[[File:Simplified Structure of the Linux Kernel.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A highly simplified structure of the Linux kernel, which includes process schedulers, I/O schedulers, and [[Linux kernel packet scheduler|packet schedulers]] ]]

====Linux 2.4====
In [[Linux]] 2.4, an [[O(n) scheduler]] with a [[multilevel feedback queue]] with priority levels ranging from 0 to 140 was used; 0&amp;ndash;99 are reserved for real-time tasks and 100&amp;ndash;140 are considered [[nice (Unix)|nice]] task levels. For real-time tasks, the time quantum for switching processes was approximately 200&amp;nbsp;ms, and for nice tasks approximately 10 ms.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The scheduler ran through the [[run queue]] of all ready processes, letting the highest priority processes go first and run through their time slices, after which they will be placed in an expired queue. When the active queue is empty the expired queue will become the active queue and vice versa.

However, some enterprise [[Linux distributions]] such as [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] replaced this scheduler with a backport of the [[O(1) scheduler]] (which was maintained by [[Alan Cox]] in his Linux 2.4-ac Kernel series) to the Linux 2.4 kernel used by the distribution.

====Linux 2.6.0 to Linux 2.6.22====
In versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.22, the kernel used an [[O(1) scheduler]] developed by [[Ingo Molnar]] and many other kernel developers during the Linux 2.5 development. For many kernel in time frame, [[Con Kolivas]] developed patch sets which improved interactivity with this scheduler or even replaced it with his own schedulers.

====Since Linux 2.6.23====
Con Kolivas's work, most significantly his implementation of "[[Fair-share scheduling|fair scheduling]]" named "Rotating Staircase Deadline", inspired Ingo Molnár to develop the [[Completely Fair Scheduler]] as a replacement for the earlier [[O(1) scheduler]], crediting Kolivas in his announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list

       | date=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CFS is the first implementation of a fair queuing [[process scheduler]] widely used in a general-purpose operating system.&lt;ref name="dwrr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://happyli.org/tongli/papers/dwrr.pdf|format=PDF|title=Efficient and Scalable Multiprocessor Fair Scheduling Using Distributed Weighted Round-Robin|author1=Tong Li|author2=Dan Baumberger|author3=Scott Hahn|website=Happyli.org|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Completely Fair Scheduler]] (CFS) uses a well-studied, classic scheduling algorithm called [[fair queuing]] originally invented for [[packet network]]s. Fair queuing had been previously applied to CPU scheduling under the name [[stride scheduling]].  The fair queuing CFS scheduler has a scheduling complexity of O([[Logarithm|log]] N), where N is the number of tasks in the [[run queue|runqueue]]. Choosing a task can be done in constant time, but reinserting a task after it has run requires O(log N) operations, because the [[run queue]] is implemented as a [[red-black tree]].

The [[Brain Fuck Scheduler]] (BFS), also created by Con Kolivas, is an alternative to the CFS.

===FreeBSD===
[[FreeBSD]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–255. 0–63 are reserved for interrupts, 64–127 for the top half of the kernel, 128–159 for real-time user threads, 160–223 for time-shared user threads, and 224–255 for idle user threads. Also, like Linux, it uses the active queue setup, but it also has an idle queue.&lt;ref name="opensolaris-queue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison of Solaris, Linux, and FreeBSD Kernels |url=http://cn.opensolaris.org/files/solaris_linux_bsd_cmp.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124435/http://cn.opensolaris.org/files/solaris_linux_bsd_cmp.pdf |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetBSD===
[[NetBSD]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–223. 0–63 are reserved for time-shared threads (default, SCHED_OTHER policy), 64–95 for user threads which entered [[kernel space]], 96-128 for kernel threads, 128–191 for user real-time threads (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies), and 192–223 for [[Interrupt|software interrupts]].

===Solaris===
[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging between 0 and 169. Priorities 0&amp;ndash;59 are reserved for time-shared threads, 60&amp;ndash;99 for system threads, 100&amp;ndash;159 for real-time threads, and 160&amp;ndash;169 for low priority interrupts. Unlike Linux,&lt;ref name="opensolaris-queue"/&gt; when a process is done using its time quantum, it is given a new priority and put back in the queue. Solaris&amp;nbsp;9 introduced two new scheduling classes, namely fixed priority class and fair share class. The threads with fixed priority have the same priority range as that of the time-sharing class, but their priorities are not dynamically adjusted. The fair scheduling class uses CPU ''shares'' to prioritize threads for scheduling decisions. CPU shares indicate the entitlement to CPU resources. They are allocated to a set of processes, which are collectively known as a project.&lt;ref name="galvin"/&gt;

&lt;!--Hidden because it sounds ridiculous to most people except maybe lawyers, who can rephrase this legalese better to say that sexual assault is of course an offense in all countries despite being defined differently in different countries and at different times: In legal terms, sexual assault is a [[statutory]] offense in various jurisdictions, including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Ireland]], and [[Scotland]]. The legal definition of the crime of sexual assault is determined by each [[jurisdiction]]. Specific legal jurisdictions and research often use highly technical or detailed definitions of the term.--&gt;

== Definition ==
Generally, sexual assault is defined as unwanted sexual contact. The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] defines sexual assault as "unwanted sexual contact that stops short of rape or attempted rape. This includes sexual touching and fondling."&lt;ref name="RAINN" /&gt;

The National Center for Victims of Crime states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |title=The National Center for Victims of Crime – Library/Document Viewer |publisher=Ncvc.org |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720051156/http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Sexual assault takes many forms including attacks such as rape or attempted rape, as well as any unwanted sexual contact or threats. Usually a sexual assault occurs when someone touches any part of another person's body in a sexual way, even through clothes, without that person's consent.}}

In the [[United States]], the definition of sexual assault varies widely among the individual states. However, in most states sexual assault occurs when there is lack of consent from one of the individuals involved. Consent must take place between two adults who are not incapacitated and can change during any time during the sexual act.

*children are too young to recognize their victimization or put it into words
*they were threatened or bribed by the abuser

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Main|Domestic violence}}
Domestic violence is a crime of power and intimidation. It is strongly correlated with sexual assault. Not only can domestic abuse be emotional, physical, psychological and financial, but it can be sexual. Some of the signs of sexual abuse are similar to those of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=womensaidfederationofengland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220022&amp;item |title=Sexual Violence |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123718/http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220022&amp;item |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elderly sexual assault ===
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elderly sexual assault is [[victimization]] of persons over the age of 60, most of whom suffer from decreased functionality, frailty and weakness, and therefore are reliant on caretakers. Only 30 percent of people age 65 or older who are victimized report the assault to the police. The most common assailants are caretakers, adult children, spouses and fellow facility residents.
Signs that an elder is being assaulted include increased vaginal tearing, bleeding, bruising, infection, pelvic injury, soft tissue or bone injury. Also, an altered mood might be an indication of sexual assault. These symptoms include extreme agitation, post-traumatic stress disorder, withdrawal, panic attacks, STDs, exacerbation of existing illness, sleep disturbances and longer recovery times.&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

=== Groping ===
{{Main|Groping}}
The term ''groping'' is used to define the touching or fondling of another person in a sexual way without the person's consent. Groping may occur under or over clothing.

=== Rape ===
{{Main|Rape}}

Outside of law, the term rape, "an [[assault]] by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with another person without that person's [[consent]]", is often used interchangeably with sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Victimology: Theories and Applications"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roberts, Albert R. |author2=Ann Wolbert Bergess |author3=CHERYL REGEHR |title=Victimology: Theories and Applications |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2009 |page=228 |isbn=978-0-7637-7210-9 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erFiYbLL9McC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=definition+of+rape&amp;q=definition%20of%20rape |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Violence against women"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.2004.022756 |title=Violence against women |year=2005 |last1=Krantz |first1=G. |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=818–21 |pmid=16166351 |last2=Garcia-Moreno |first2=C |pmc=1732916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although closely related, the two terms are technically distinct in most jurisdictions.

=== Sexual harassment ===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature. It may also be defined as the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paludi | first = Michele Antoinette | authorlink = |author2=Barickman, | title = Academic and Workplace Sexual Harassment | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 1991 | location = | pages = 2–5 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7914-0829-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination which violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The legal and social definition of what constitutes sexual harassment differ widely by culture. Sexual harassment includes a wide range of behaviors from seemingly mild transgressions to serious forms of abuse. Some forms of sexual harassment overlap with sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Dziech et al. 1990, Boland 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC): "Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=18 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711064654/https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|archivedate=11 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2002-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*79% of victims are women, 21% are men
** 51% are harassed by a supervisor
** Business, Trade, Banking, and Finance are the biggest industries where sexual harassment occurs
** 12% received threats of termination if they did not comply with their requests
* 26,000 people in the armed forces were assaulted in 2012&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** 302 of the 2,558 cases pursued by victims were prosecuted
** 38% of the cases were committed by someone of a higher rank
* Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
** [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. It generally applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including federal, state, and local governments. Title VII also applies to private and public colleges and universities, employment agencies, and labor organizations.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** "It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer … to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Mass sexual assault ===
{{further|Mass sexual assault}}
Mass sexual assault takes place in public places and in crowds. It involves large groups of men surrounding and assaulting a woman, groping, manual penetration, and [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]], but usually stopping short of penile rape.

== Emotional effects ==
Aside from physical traumas, rape and other sexual assault often result in long-term emotional effects, particularly in child victims. These can include:
[[denial]], [[learned helplessness]], [[genophobia]], [[anger]], [[self-blame]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], [[nightmare]]s, [[fear]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], [[mood disorder|moodswings]], [[numbness]], [[promiscuity]], [[loneliness]], [[social anxiety]], difficulty trusting oneself or others, difficulty concentrating. Being the victim of sexual assault may lead to the development of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[addiction]], [[major depressive disorder]] or other [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]].
Family and friends experience emotional scarring including a strong desire for [[revenge]], a desire to "fix' the problem and/or move on, and a rationalization that "it wasn't that bad".&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

== Physical effects ==
While sexual assault, including rape, can result in physical trauma, many people who experience sexual assault will not suffer any physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, Heterogeneity of existing research relating to sexual violence, sexual assault and rape precludes meta-analysis of injury data. Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine. (2013), 20(5):447–459&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rape myths]] suggest that the stereotypical victim of sexual violence is a bruised and battered young woman. The central issue in many cases of rape or other sexual assault is whether or not both parties consented to the sexual activity or whether or not both parties had the capacity to do so. Thus, physical force resulting in visible physical injury is not always seen. This stereotype can be damaging because people who have experienced sexual assault but have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, The relationship of victim injury to the progression of sexual crimes through the criminal justice system, Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine 2012:19(6):309-311&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who experienced rape or physical violence by a partner were more likely than people who had not experienced this violence to report frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty sleeping, activity limitation, poor physical health, and poor mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Dupain Mandi, Developing and Implementing a Sexual Assault Violence Prevention and Awareness Campaign at a State-Supported Regional University. American Journal of Health Studies. 29. 4. (2014). 264. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic effects ==
Due to rape or sexual assault, or the threat of, there are many resulting impacts on income and commerce at the macro level. Each sexual assault (excluding child abuse) costs $5,100 in tangible losses (lost productivity, medical and mental health care, police/fire services, and property damage) plus $81,400 in lost quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|title=Victim Costs and Consequences: A New Look|last=Miller, Cohen, &amp; Weirsema|first=|date=1996|website=|publisher=National Institute of Justice|access-date=September 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515043800/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has been addressed in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In his dissenting opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[U.S. v. Morrison]]'', Justice Souter explained that 75% of women never go to the movies alone at night and nearly 50% will not ride public transportation out of fear of rape or sexual assault. It also stated that less than 1% of victims collect damages and 50% of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma. The court ruled in ''U.S. v. Morrison'' that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] because it did not have a direct impact on commerce. The [[Commerce Clause]] of Article I Section VII of the [[U.S. Constitution]] gives authority and jurisdiction to the Federal government in matters of interstate commerce. As a result, the victim was unable to sue her attacker in Federal Court.

Sexual assault also has adverse economic effects for survivors on the micro level. For instance, survivors of sexual assault often require time off from work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|title=Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Rape Victimization: Findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey|last=Tjaden &amp; Thoennes|first=|date=2006|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs|access-date=2016-09-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916062148/http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and face increased rates of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Christina A.|last2=Resnick|first2=Heidi S.|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=Dean G.|last4=Best|first4=Connie L.|last5=Saunders|first5=Benjamin E.|title=The socioeconomic impact of interpersonal violence on women|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=67|issue=3|pages=362–366|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.67.3.362|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of rape by an intimate partner lose an average of $69 per day due to unpaid time off from work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrisler|first=Joan C.|last2=Ferguson|first2=Sheila|date=2006-11-01|title=Violence against Women as a Public Health Issue|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1087|issue=1|pages=235–249|doi=10.1196/annals.1385.009|pmid=17189508|issn=1749-6632|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual assault is also associated with numerous negative employment consequences, including unpaid time off, diminished work performance, job loss, and inability to work, all of which can lead to lower earnings for survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loya|first=Rebecca M.|date=2015-10-01|title=Rape as an Economic Crime The Impact of Sexual Violence on Survivors' Employment and Economic Well-Being|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=30|issue=16|pages=2793–2813|doi=10.1177/0886260514554291|issn=0886-2605|pmid=25381269|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118035347/http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|archivedate=18 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[emergency room]], emergency [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth| year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has also been proposed as a psychiatric treatment for victims of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Posmontier B, Dovydaitis T, Lipman K.

== Post-assault mistreatment of victims ==

{{Main|Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims}}

After the assault, victims may become the target of [[slut-shaming]] to [[cyberbullying]]. In addition, their credibility may be challenged. During criminal proceedings, [[publication ban]]s and [[rape shield laws]] may operate to protect victims from excessive public scrutiny. Negative social responses to victims’ disclosures of sexual assault have the potential to lead to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] symptoms. [[Social isolation]], following a sexual assault, can result in the victim experiencing a decrease in their [[self-esteem]] and likelihood of rejecting unwanted sexual advances in the future.&lt;ref&gt; Relyea, M., &amp; Ullman, S.

Several research based rape prevention programs have been tested and verified through scientific studies. The rape prevention programs that have the strongest empirical data in the research literature include the following:

The Men's and Women's Programs, also known as the One in Four programs, were written by John Foubert.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Foubert |first=John |title=The Men's and Women's Programs: Ending Rape Through Peer Education |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-88105-0}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is focused on increasing empathy toward rape survivors and motivating people to intervene as bystanders in sexual assault situations. Published data shows that high-risk persons who saw the Men's and Women's Program committed 40% fewer acts of sexually coercive behavior than those who didn’t. They also committed acts of sexual coercion that were 8 times less severe than a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1866 |title=Behavior Differences Seven Months Later: Effects of a Rape Prevention Program |year=2008 |last1=Foubert |first1=John D. |last2=Newberry |first2=Johnathan T |last3=Tatum |first3=Jerry |journal=Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice |volume=44 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research also shows that people who saw the Men's and Women's Program reported more efficacy in intervening and greater willingness to help as a bystander after seeing the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1077801211409728 |title=The Men's Program: Does It Impact College Men's Self-Reported Bystander Efficacy and Willingness to Intervene? |year=2011 |last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling |first1=J. |last2=Foubert |first2=J.

Bringing in the Bystander was written by Victoria Banyard. Its focus is on who bystanders are, when they have helped, and how to intervene as a bystander in risky situations. The program includes a brief empathy induction component and a pledge to intervene in the future. Several studies show strong evidence of favorable outcomes including increased bystander efficacy, increased willingness to intervene as a bystander, and decreased rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Moynihan &amp; Plante, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Plante &amp; Moynihan, 2004{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Ward, Cohn, Plante, Moorhead, &amp; Walsh, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MVP: Mentors in Violence Prevention was written by Jackson Katz. This program focuses on discussing a male bystander who didn't intervene when woman was in danger. An emphasis is placed on encouraging men to be active bystanders rather than standing by when they notice abuse. The bulk of the presentation is on processing hypothetical scenarios. Outcomes reported in research literature include lower levels of sexism and increased belief that participants could prevent violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;Cissner, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot program was written by Dorothy Edwards. This program includes both motivational speeches and peer education focused on bystander intervention. Outcomes show that program participation is associated with reductions in rape myth acceptance and increased bystander intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, Cook-Craig, Williams, Fisher, Clear, Garcia &amp; Hegge, 2011{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Edmonton, Canada, initiated a public education campaign aimed at potential perpetrators. Posters in bar bathrooms and public transit centers reminded men that "It's not sex when she's wasted" and "It's not sex when he changes his mind". The campaign was so effective that it spread to other cities. "The number of reported sexual assaults fell by 10 per cent last year in Vancouver, after the ads were featured around the city. It was the first time in several years that there was a drop in sexual assault activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|title=Edmonton Sexual Assault Awareness Campaign: 'Don't Be That Guy' So Effective City Relaunches With New Posters (PHOTOS)|website=Huffingtonpost.ca|date=December 2012|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902053213/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|archivedate=2 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden introduced in September 2014 a nationwide campaign against sexual assault entitled "It's on us". The campaign includes tips against sexual assault, as well as broad scale of private and public pledges to change to provoke a cultural shift, with a focus on student activism, to achieve awareness and prevention nationwide. UC Berkeley, NCAA and Viacom have publicly announced their partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbott|first1=Katy|title=White House announces college-campus sexual assault awareness campaign|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921151622/http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|archivedate=21 September 2014|df=dmy-all|date=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Justice's National Crime Victimization Survey states that on average there are 237,868 victims (age 12 or older) of sexual assault and rape each year.

*38% of rapists are a friend or acquaintance
*28% are an intimate
*7% are a relative&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''College'''
{{main|Campus sexual assault}}

In the United States, several studies since 1987 have indicated that one in four college women have experienced rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime. These studies are based on anonymous surveys of college women, not reports to the police, and the results are disputed.&lt;ref name="leaderu1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209074942/http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, nearly two thirds of students reported knowing victims of rape and over half reported knowing perpetrators of sexual assault. One in ten reported knowing a victim of rape when alcohol was not involved and 22.6% reported knowing a victim of alcohol-facilitated rape.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E. Knowing a sexual assault victim or perpetrator: A stratified random sample of undergraduates at one university. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2014; 29: 394-416&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary ''The Hunting Ground'', the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses is brought to attention. The schools poor judicial systems are scrutinized for not helping the victims and trying to keep these issues from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c42646ae-b960-4c12-bf53-6795dad55875%40sessionmgr107&amp;vid=14&amp;hid=107 | title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] professor Jason Lindo and his colleagues analyzed over two decades worth of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] data, noting that reports of rape increased 15-57% around the times of major [[American Football]] games at [[NCAA Division I|Division 1]] schools while attempting to find a link between campus rape and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|title=The disturbing truth about college football and rape|first=Danielle|last=Paquette|publisher=The Washington Post|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825194112/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|archivedate=25 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 report from the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] titled "The Sexual Victimization of College Women" reports that 3.1% of undergraduates survived rape or attempted rape during a 6–7 month academic year with an additional 10.1% surviving rape prior to college and an additional 10.9% surviving attempted rape prior to college. With no overlap between these groups, these percentages add to 24.1%, or "One in Four".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Cullen &amp; Turner, 2006{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski published a study in 1987 where they interviewed approximately 6,000 college students on 32 college campuses nationwide. They asked several questions covering a wide range of behaviors. From this study 15% of college women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of rape. An additional 12% of women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of attempted rape, thus the statistic One in Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.55.2.162 |title=The scope of rape: Incidence and prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization in a national sample of higher education students |year=1987 |last1=Koss |first1=Mary P. |last2=Gidycz |first2=Christine A. |last3=Wisniewski |first3=Nadine |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=162–70 |pmid=3494755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point of contention lies in the leading nature of the questions in the study conducted by Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski. Koss herself later admitted that the question that had garnered the largest "rape" result was flawed and ultimately rendered the study invalid. Most prominently the problem was that many respondents who had answered yes to several questions had their responses treated as having been raped. The issue being that these same respondents did not feel they had been victimized and never sought redress for grievances. The resultant change shows a prevalence of only 1 in 22 college women having been raped or attempted to be raped during their time at college.&lt;ref name="leaderu1" /&gt;

In 1995, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] replicated part of this study, however they examined rape only, and did not look at attempted rape. They used a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years. The first-stage sampling frame contained 2,919 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|title=Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance: National College Health Risk Behavior Survey -- United States, 1995|work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=14 November 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619204741/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07448489709595589 |title=Results from the 1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey |year=1997 |last1=Douglas |first1=Kathy A. |last2=Collins |first2=Janet L. |last3=Warren |first3=Charles |last4=Kann |first4=Laura |last5=Gold |first5=Robert |last6=Clayton |first6=Sonia |last7=Ross |first7=James G. |last8=Kolbe |first8=Lloyd J. |journal=Journal of American College Health |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=55–66 |pmid=9276349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies concerning the annual incidence of rape, some studies conclude an occurrence of 5%. The National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence found that in the 2013–2014 academic year, 4.6% of girls ages 14 – 17 experienced sexual assault or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkelhor|first1=David|title=Prevalence of Childhood Exposure to Violence, Crime, and Abuse: Results From the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=169|issue=8|pages=746–54|date=Jun 2015|url=http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2344705|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000045/http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2344705|archivedate=15 July 2015|df=dmy-all|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0676|pmid=26121291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, Mohler-Kuo, Dowdall, Koss &amp; Weschler (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15000502 |year=2004 |last1=Mohler-Kuo |first1=M |last2=Dowdall |first2=GW |last3=Koss |first3=MP |last4=Wechsler |first4=H |title=Correlates of rape while intoxicated in a national sample of college women |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol |doi=10.15288/jsa.2004.65.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in a study of approximately 25,000 college women nationwide that 4.7% experienced rape or attempted rape during a single academic year. This study did not measure lifetime incidence of rape or attempted rape. Similarly, Kilpatrick, Resnick, Ruggiero, Conoscenti, &amp; McCauley (2007) found in a study of 2,000 college women nationwide that 5.2% experienced rape every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dean |last1=Kilpatrick |first2=Heidi |last2=Resnick |first3=Kenneth |last3=Ruggiero |first4=Lauren M. |last4=Conoscenti |first5=Jenna |last5=McCauley |title=Drug Facilitated, Incapacitated, and Forcible Rape: A National Study |url=http://www.nsvrc.org/publications/reports/drug-facilitated-incapacitated-and-forcible-rape-national-study |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004356/http://www.nsvrc.org/publications/reports/drug-facilitated-incapacitated-and-forcible-rape-national-study |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all |access-date=22 November 2013 }}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By jurisdiction ==

=== Australia ===

Within Australia, the term sexual assault is used to describe a variation of sexual offences. This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence.

In the State of New South Wales, sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s 61I of the [[Crimes Act 1900]]. The term "sexual assault" is equivalent to "rape" in ordinary parlance, while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed "indecent assault".

To be liable for punishment under the [[Crimes Act 1900]], an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s 61H(1) while having one of the states of knowledge of non-consent defined under s 61HA(3). But note that s 61HA(3) is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting.&lt;ref&gt;See Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 61 HA (3)&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 61H(1) Crimes Act 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years under s 61J of the Crimes Act.

In the state of Victoria, rape is punishable under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1958, with a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1958 (VIC)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of South Australia, rape is punishable under s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) with a maximum term of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of Western Australia, sexual penetration is punishable under s 325 the Criminal Code Act 1913 with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Territory, offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s 192 of the Criminal Code Act 1983 and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Queensland, rape and sexual assault are punishable under s 349, Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1899 (QLD)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tasmania, rape is punishable under s 185 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 with a maximum punishment of 21 years under s389 of the Criminal Code Act 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code 1924 (TAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian Capital Territory, sexual assault is punishable under Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum punishment of 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in 85% of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2005). Personal Safety Survey. Canberra: ABS&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to low reporting rates, treatment of victims and distrust of the criminal justice system, difficulty in obtaining evidence and the belief in sexual assault myths.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2005). The law and sexual offences against adults in Australia (Issues No. 4). Melbourne: Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once a person is charged, the public prosecutor will decide whether the case will proceed to trial based on whether there is sufficient evidence and whether a case is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lievore, D. (2005). Prosecutorial decisions in adult sexual assault cases. Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice, 291, January. Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology&lt;/ref&gt; Once the matter has reached trial, the matter will generally be heard in the District Court. This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences (serious offences), as opposed to summary offences (minor offences). Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court, but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal.

Once the matter is being heard, the prosecution must provide evidence which proves “beyond reasonable doubt” that the offence was committed by the defendant. The standard of proof is vital in checking the power of the State.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306040553/https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |archivedate=6 March 2017 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While as previously stated that each jurisdiction (State and Territory) has its own sexual offence legislation, there are many common elements to any criminal offence that advise on how the offence is defined and what must be proven by the prosecution in order to find the defendant guilty.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"/&gt; These elements are known as Actus Reus which comprises the physical element (see Ryan v Regina [1967])&lt;ref&gt;Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mens Rea which comprises the mental element (see He Kaw Teh (1985)).&lt;ref&gt;He Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable sexual assault cases which have resulted in convictions are Regina v Bilal Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297,16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and Regina v Mohommed Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohommed Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 298, 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which were highly visible in New South Wales within the media the 2000s. These cases were closely watched by the media and led to legislative changes such as the passing of the Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;/ref&gt; which dramatically increased the sentences for ‘gang rapists’ by creating a new category of crime known as Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company. Changes were also made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW&lt;/ref&gt; This change is known as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;/ref&gt; which expands the category of offences in respect of which a Local Court may receive and consider Victim Impact Statements to include some indictable offences which are usually dealt with summarily.

=== Canada ===
Sexual assault is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person's consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as "''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''".

Section 265 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] defines the offences of [[assault]] and sexual assault.

Section 271 criminalizes "Sexual assault", section 272 criminalizes "Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm" and section 273 criminalizes "[[Aggravated sexual assault]]".

==== Consent ====
The absence of consent defines the crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) outlines certain circumstances where "no consent" is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) ''does not limit'' the circumstances where "no consent" is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes ''some'' circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). "No consent" to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109205822/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can't consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author=Mike Blanchfield |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612140715/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Meaning of “consent”''

''273.1'' (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), “consent” means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, ''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''.

''Where no consent obtained''

(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where
(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;
(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;
(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or
(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

''Subsection (2) not limiting''

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.

*''Section 265(3)''

''Consent''

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of
(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(c) fraud; or
(d) the exercise of authority.

In accordance with 265 (4) an accused may use the defence that he or she believed that the complainant consented, but such a defence may be used only when "a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief"; furthermore according to section 273.2(b) the accused must show that he or she took reasonable steps in order to ascertain the complainant's consent, also 273.2(a) states that if the accused's belief steams from self-induced intoxication, or recklessness or wilful blindness than such belief is not a defence.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code" /&gt;

*''265 (4)''
''Accused’s belief as to consent''

(4) Where an accused alleges that he or she believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused’s belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

*''Where belief in consent not a defence''

273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where
(a) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s

(i) self-induced intoxication, or

(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or
(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.

=== Germany ===
Before 1997, the definition of rape was: "''Whoever compels a woman to have extramarital intercourse with him, or with a third person, by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb, shall be punished by not less than two years’ imprisonment''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|title=Kunarac, Vukovic and Kovac - Judgement - Part IV|website=Icty.org|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312233318/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Section 177'''
:'''Sexual assault by use of force or threats; rape'''

#Whosoever coerces another person
##by force;
##by threat of imminent danger to life or limb; or
##by exploiting a situation in which the victim is unprotected and at the mercy of the offender,
#:to suffer sexual acts by the offender or a third person on their own person or to engage actively in sexual activity with the offender or a third person, shall be liable to imprisonment of not less than one year.
#In especially serious cases the penalty shall be imprisonment of not less than two years. An especially serious case typically occurs if
##the offender performs sexual intercourse with the victim or performs similar sexual acts with the victim, or allows them to be performed on himself by the victim, especially if they degrade the victim or if they entail penetration of the body (rape); or
##the offence is committed jointly by more than one person.

Subsections (3), (4) and (5) provide additional stipulations on sentencing depending on aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

Section 178 provides that "''If the offender through sexual assault or rape (section 177) causes the death of the victim at least by gross negligence the penalty shall be imprisonment for life or not less than ten years''."

=== Republic of Ireland ===
As in many other jurisdictions, the term sexual assault is generally used to describe non-penetrative sexual offences. Section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981 states that a man has committed rape if he has sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it. Under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act of 1990, rape means a sexual assault that includes penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. The maximum penalty for rape in Ireland is imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;National SATU Guidelines Development Group.

=== South Africa ===
The [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act]] created the offence of sexual assault, replacing a common-law offence of [[indecent assault]]. "Sexual assault" is defined as the unlawful and intentional sexual violation of another person without their consent. The Act's definition of "sexual violation" incorporates a number of sexual acts, including any genital contact that does not amount to penetration as well as any contact with the mouth designed to cause sexual arousal. Non-consensual acts that involve actual penetration are rape rather than sexual assault.

Unlawfully and intentionally inspiring the belief in another person that they will be sexually violated also amounts to sexual assault. The Act also created the offences of "compelled sexual assault", when a person forces a second person to commit an act of sexual violation with a third person; and "compelled self-sexual assault", when a person forces another person to masturbate or commit various other sexual acts on theirself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! &amp;#124; South African Government |website=Info.gov.za |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2016-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081854/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Consent =====
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/74 Section 74] of the Sexual Offenses Act explains that "a person consents if he agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice".

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75 Section 75] clarifies what consent means

75 Evidential presumptions about consent

(1)If in proceedings for an offence to which this section applies it is proved—
(a)that the defendant did the relevant act,
(b)that any of the circumstances specified in subsection (2) existed, and
(c)that the defendant knew that those circumstances existed, the complainant is to be taken not to have consented to the relevant act unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he consented, and the defendant is to be taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant consented unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it.

(2)The circumstances are that—
(a)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be used against him;
(b)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, causing the complainant to fear that violence was being used, or that immediate violence would be used, against another person;
(c)the complainant was, and the defendant was not, unlawfully detained at the time of the relevant act;
(d)the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;

A '''slow movement''' is a form in a multi-[[Movement (music)|movement]] musical piece. Generally, the second movement of a piece will be written as a slow movement, although composers occasionally write other movements as a slow movement as well. The tempo of a slow movement can vary from largo to andante. It is usually in the [[dominant key|dominant]], [[subdominant]], [[parallel key|parallel]], or [[relative key|relative]] key of the musical work's main key.

== Overview ==
The general layout of a four-movement piece is as follows:

# A fast movement, written in [[sonata form]]
# A slow movement
# A [[minuet]] or [[scherzo]]
# A faster movement, usually a [[rondo]]

However, composers sometimes remove, add or re-arrange movements, such as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, which begins with the slow movement. When a piece has additional movements, they may also be written as a slow movement.

== Form ==
A slow movement is usually written in one of three forms: [[Ternary form|compound or "large" ternary]], sonata form without development, and [[Variation (music)|theme and variations]].

=== Large ternary ===
Large ternary is the most common form used for a slow movement. It consists of three parts, labeled ABA. The first and third part are almost identical, whereas the middle part is contrasting.
If the starting key is a major key, the middle part is typically written in a minor key; if the starting key is a minor key, the middle part is typically written in a major key. The keys do not have to have the same tonic. If the middle part is written in a major key, it is often labeled Maggiore. If it is written in a minor key, then it is labeled Minore.
The final part is always a return of the first part, but frequently has additional ornaments and small phrases added on.

=== Sonata form without development ===
Sonata form without development is a variant of sonata form where the development is omitted, leaving only the exposition and recapitulation.  This form is also known as [[Sonatina]] form.  As written above, in Sonatina form, there is no development section, but rather a dominant-seventh chord between the exposition and the recapitulation that prepares for the recapitulation and the tonic key.  One example of the piece in sonata form without development is the second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 17, "The Tempest".

=== Theme and variations ===
Theme and [[Variations (music)|variations]] form starts with a theme, followed by multiple variations. This theme is usually eight to thirty-two bars in length, and may be constructed as a musical sentence,  period, or small ternary. Each variation is a recurrence of the theme with melodic, harmonic, rhythmic and ornamental changes.

Theme and variations sometimes contain one "minore" variation. This variation will have a contrasting tonality, and may be different in form from the theme.

Theme and variations may also have a coda to finalize the piece. It may bring back the original theme with few or no changes, in order to create symmetry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16080">The  Story Factory is a not-for-profit organisation designed to help indigenous and disadvantaged children aged between 7 and 17 years develop their writing and storytelling skills. The programs run by the Story Factory aim to help young people, particularly those most at risk of losing confidence and then losing interest in schooling. The Story Factory conducts programs at it two creative writing centres, as short and long term residencies at primary and secondary schools, and as one off visits.

The Story Factory began in 2012 as the Sydney Story Factory in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]], in inner city [[Sydney]]. The organisation changed its name to The Story Factory at the opening of their second site in [[Parramatta|Paramatta]] to the west of Sydney in October 2018.

[[file:SF redfern workshop.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Redfern Creative Writing Centre]]&lt;br&gt;

== Beginnings ==
In 2010 the co-founders of the Story Factory, Catherine Keenan and Tim Dick, heard [[Dave Eggers]] give a [[TED (conference)|TED talk]] about [[826 Valencia]] and were inspired to set up something similar in Sydney. They  flew to San Francisco and visited 826 Valencia to learn as much as they could about its model. Unlike 826 Valencia, The Story Factory does not provide homework help, but focuses on Creative writing.&lt;ref name=medibank&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medibank.com.au/livebetter/be-magazine/wellbeing/sydney-story-factory-2/|title=Sydney Story Factory {{!}} Live Better|work=Live Better|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dusseldorp.org.au/partner/sydney-story-factory-3/#|title=Sydney Story Factory - Dusseldorp Forum|work=Dusseldorp Forum|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a not-for-profit organisation that relies on volunteers and donations for support it took approximately 18 months to get the first site of The Story Factory operational. The initial volunteers meeting drew a crowd of 200 people.&lt;ref name=medibank/&gt;

Since it opened in 2012 approximately 16,000 students have participated in the programs.&lt;ref name=abcopening&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-20/story-factory-creative-writing-program-expands-to-parramatta/10393478|title='They've got stories in their head': Creative writing program expands to western Sydney|date=2018-10-20|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 they had 1050 active volunteer writing tutors and see approximately 800 children per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyfactory.org.au/|title=Home|website=Sydney Story Factory|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy and Operation ==
The Story Factory focuses on creative writing rather than the homework help provided in the original [[826 Valencia]] program. This philosophy is based on discussion with local teachers who said that there is much less space for creativity in the Australian curriculum now.&lt;ref name=medibank/&gt;

The [[University of Sydney]] conducted an evaluation of the student involvement in the Story Factory from 2014 to 2016. The study was looking at the development of writing skills, self-confidence, engagement in learning and enthusiasm for creative writing. The study used case study methodology and also pre- and post-program surveys. A total of 88 students were surveyed and from these 10 were the subject of detailed case studies. The evaluation showed that students felt positive about the program and believed it helped with school work. It showed the students gained empowerment and grew in self-knowledge and self-awareness. Students who participated in several workshops grew their creative writing skills often to a higher level than would be expected of their grade or stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aare.edu.au/publications-database.php/9509/creativity-and-creative-writing-the-sydney-story-factory-experience|title=Creativity and creative writing: The sydney story factory experience  ·  Australian Association for Research in Education - article abstract|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aare.edu.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315687593_Sydney_Story_Factory_Workshop_Program_Evaluation_Summary|title=(PDF) Sydney Story Factory: Workshop Program Evaluation Summary|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching Writing in Today's Classrooms: Looking Back to Look Forward|last=Ewing|first=R|last2=Manuel|first2=J|last3=Mortimer|first3=A|date=2015|publisher=Norwood, South Australia:Australian Literacy Educators' Association|year=|isbn=978-0-977-5468-5-5|editor-last=Turbill|editor-first=Jan|location=|pages=107-122|chapter=Chapter 8: Imaginative children's literature, educational drama and creative writing|editor-last2=Barton|editor-first2=Georgina|editor-last3=Brock|editor-first3=Cynthia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An evaluation of the in-schools residency programs run by the factory found a "notable shift in writing confidence and enjoyment" in all five schools involved and this was particularly strong among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/552da8bae4b07cc792521ef3/t/5aa72b6d53450af0dcfacd2b/1520905074968/Mid-way+report+Crown+Residency+Program+Feb+2018+%281%29.pdf|title=Evaluation of Creative Writing In-School Residency Programs; 2017 Primary School Mid-point findings|last=Wilson|first=Pete|last2=Fisher|first2=Natalie|publisher=NSF Consulting|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Former board member of The Story Factory, Professor Robyn Ewing,  believes that "education is possibly the most critical factor in alleviating disadvantage, and the Story Factory strives to change the lives of young people, especially those from marginalised backgrounds, through creative writing and storytelling."&lt;ref name="SydUni"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/09/26/story-factory-tells-a-strong-tale.html|title=Story Factory tells a strong tale|website=The University of Sydney|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Story Factory is supported by a variety of people.

A '''subvariety''' (Latin: '''''subvarietas''''') in [[botanical nomenclature]] is a [[taxonomic rank]]. They are rarely used to classify organisms.

==Plant taxonomy==
Subvariety is ranked: 
*below that of [[Variety (biology)|variety]] (''varietas'')
*above that of [[Form (botany)|form]] (''forma'').

Subvariety is an [[infraspecific taxon]]. 
===Name===
Its name consists of three parts: 
#a genus name (genera)
#a specific epithet (species)
#an infraspecific epithet  (subvariety)

To indicate the subvariety rank, the abbreviation '''"subvar."''' is put before the infraspecific epithet.

{{short description|set of 17 global development goals defined by the United Nations for the year 2030}}
[[File:UN SDG Logo.png|thumb|The Sustainable Development Goals are a UN Initiative.|269x269px]]{{redirect|SDG}}

'''Sustainable Development Goals''' ('''SDGs''') (or '''Global Goals for Sustainable Development''', the '''17 Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;, the '''Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''the Goals"'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;) are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The SDGs are part of Resolution 70/1 of the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt;: "Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development." That has been shortened to "'''2030 Agenda'''."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|website=United Nations – Sustainable Development knowledge platform|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are broad and interdependent, yet each has a separate list of targets to achieve. Achieving all 169 targets would signal accomplishing all 17 goals. The SDGs cover social and economic development issues including [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[global warming]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 54 of [[ the United Nations]] [[UNGA|General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/70/1 of 25 September 2015 contains the goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN-led process involved its 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|Member States]] and global [[civil society]]. The resolution is a broad intergovernmental agreement that acts as the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]. The SDGs build on the principles agreed upon in Resolution A/RES/66/288, entitled "The Future We Want".&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templatelab.com/rio-20-summit-the-future-we-want/ |title=United Nations Official Document |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a non-binding document released as a result of [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20 Conference]] held in 2012.&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"/&gt;

Implementation as of 2016 is described as "Localizing the SDGs" to highlight the role of local institutions and local actors.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Regional efforts included agreements like the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]]&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;. Some remain pessimistic about the potential for achieving the SDGs, especially because of estimates of the cost of achieving all 17.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  However, progress had been reported by 2018. For example, fewer African children under the age of 5 are suffering from [[Stunted growth|stunting]] and wasting. However, the same study concluded that it is unlikely there will be an end to [[malnutrition]] by 2030.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;   {{TOC limit|3}}

In 1972, governments met in Stockholm, Sweden, for the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], to consider the rights of the family to a healthy and productive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Sustainable Development in the United Nations |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618171731/http://www.uncsd2012.org/history.html |website=Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=UN |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=20-22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the United Nations created the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]] (later known as the Brundtland Commission), which defined sustainable development as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm|title=Our Common Future, Chapter 2: Towards Sustainable Development - A/42/427 Annex, Chapter 2 - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Development|first=World Commission on Environment and|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the first [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) or Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, where the first agenda for Environment and Development, also known as Agenda 21, was developed and adopted.

In 2012, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]], was held as a 20-year follow up to UNCED. Colombia proposed the idea of the SDGs at a preparation event for Rio+20 held in Indonesia in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deliver2030.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-short-history-of-the-SDGs-Paula-Caballero.pdf|title=A Short History of the SDGs|last=Caballero|first=Paula|date=April 29, 2016|website=Deliver 2030|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118221940/http://deliver2030.org/wp%2Dcontent/uploads/2016/04/A%2Dshort%2Dhistory%2Dof%2Dthe%2DSDGs%2DPaula%2DCaballero.pdf|archive-date=2017-11-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, this idea was picked up by the [[United Nations Department of Public Information]] 64th NGO Conference in Bonn, Germany. The outcome document proposed 17 sustainable development goals and associated targets. In the run-up to Rio+20 there was much discussion about the idea of the SDGs. At the Rio+20 Conference, a resolution known as "The Future We Want" was reached by member states.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/futurewewant.html|title=Future We Want – Outcome document .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication, energy, water and sanitation, health, and human settlement.

The Rio+20 outcome document mentioned that “at the outset, the OWG [Open Working Group] will decide on its methods of work, including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society, the scientific community and the United Nations system in its work, in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience”.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In January 2013, the 30-member UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs. The Open Working Group (OWG) was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly, September 2013 – September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/ga11339.doc.htm |title=New Open Working Group to Propose Sustainable Development Goals for Action by General Assembly’s Sixty-eighth Session &amp;#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases |website=Un.org |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2014, the OWG forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly. After 13 sessions, the OWG submitted their proposal of 17 SDGs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the General Assembly in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgsproposal|title=Home .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2014, the UN General Assembly accepted the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]]'s Synthesis Report, which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 SDG process would be based on the OWG proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/700&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] from 2007 to 2016, has stated that: "We don’t have plan B because there is no planet B!."&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/11/secretary-generals-remarks-to-the-press-at-cop22/|title=Secretary-General’s remarks to the press at COP22|date=15 November 2016|website=UN|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}} This thought has guided the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] was a process from 2012 to 2015 led by the [[United Nations]] to define the future global development framework that would succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The SDGs were developed to succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which ended in 2015. The gaps and shortcomings of MDG Goal 8 (To develop a global partnership for development) led to identifying a problematic "donor-recipient" relationship.&lt;ref name="post-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/untaskteam_undf/report2.shtml|title=Report of the UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|author=UN Task Team on the Post 2015 Agenda|year=March 2013|publisher=United Nations|page=1|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the new SDGs favor collective action by all countries.&lt;ref name="post-2015"/&gt;

=== Ratification ===
Negotiations on the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] began in January 2015 and ended in August 2015. The negotiations ran in parallel to United Nations negotiations on Financing for Development, which determined the financial means of implementing the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]; those negotiations resulted in adoption of the [[Addis Ababa Action Agenda]] in July 2015. A final document was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015 in New York City, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2015/09/24/undp-welcomes-adoption-of-sustainable-development-goals-by-world-leaders.html|title=World leaders adopt Sustainable Development Goals|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development".&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/breakdown-of-un-sustainable-development-goals.html?_r=0|title=Breakdown of U.N. Sustainable Development Goals|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agenda has 92 paragraphs. Paragraph 51 outlines the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the associated 169 targets.

[[File:B-1356@PEK (20180411153702).jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 787]] of [[XiamenAir]] in Sustainable Development Goals [[livery]] in 2018]]
Implementation of the SDGs started worldwide in 2016. This process can also be called "Localizing the SDGs". All over the planet, individual people, universities, governments and institutions and organizations of all kinds work on several goals at the same time.&lt;ref name="globalcitizen.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702204256/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |archive-date=2 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In each country, governments must translate the goals into national legislation, develop a plan of action, establish budgets and at the same time be open to and actively search for partners. Poor countries need the support of rich countries and coordination at the international level is crucial.&lt;ref name=D+C&gt;{{cite news |title=Global governance for SDGs|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/peer-pressure-can-contribute-achieving-sdgs-more-needed|author=Belay Begashaw|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=16 April 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent campaign "Project Everyone" has met some resistance.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://africaplatform.org/news/why-this-is-sustainable-development-not-global-goals/|title=Why this is Sustainable Development Not Global Goals – Africa Platform|website=Africaplatform.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several sections of civil society and governments felt the SDGs ignored "[[sustainability]]" even though it was the most important aspect of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicywatch.org/blog/2015/09/25/public-sdgs-or-private-ggs/|title=Public SDGs or Private GGs? – Global Policy Watch|website=Globalpolicywatch.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study in the journal ''Nature'' found that while "nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight... much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target—to end malnutrition by 2030."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osgood-Zimmerman|first=Aaron|last2=Millear|first2=Anoushka I.|last3=Stubbs|first3=Rebecca W.|last4=Shields|first4=Chloe|last5=Pickering|first5=Brandon V.|last6=Earl|first6=Lucas|last7=Graetz|first7=Nicholas|last8=Kinyoki|first8=Damaris K.|last9=Ray|first9=Sarah E.|date=2018|title=Mapping child growth failure in Africa between 2000 and 2015|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25760|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=555|issue=7694|pages=41–47|doi=10.1038/nature25760|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two books produced one by each of the co-chairs of the negotiations to help people to understand the Sustainable Development Goals and where they came from: "Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals: A transformational agenda for an insecure world" written by Ambassador David Donoghue, Felix Dodds and Jimena Leiva as well as "Transforming Multilateral Diplomacy: The Inside Story of the Sustainable Development Goals" by Macharia Kamau, David O'Connor and Pamela Chasek. 

===Europe and Russia===
Baltic nations, via the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]], have created the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbss.org/sustainable-prosperous-region/egsd-baltic-2030-2/|title=Sustainable Development - Baltic 2030 - cbss.org|work=cbss.org|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] has observed that UK and [[European Union]] [[pension fund|pension investors]] have been at the forefront of ESG-driven asset allocation at home and abroad and [[early adopter]]s of “SDG-centric” investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Government of India]] established the [[NITI Aayog]] to attain the sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name=indgoal1&gt;[http://www.looppng.com/business/businesses-india-keen-govt-delegation-71103 Business in India keen: delegation] Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 Haryana became the first state in India to have its annual budget focused on the attainment of SDG with a 3-year action plan and a 7-year strategy plan to implement sustainable development goals when [[Captain Abhimanyu]], Finance Minister of [[Government of Haryana]], unveiled a {{INRConvert|1151980|m|currency_formatting=c|lk=on|to=USD EUR|year=2018}} annual 2018-19 budget.&lt;ref name=ungoal1&gt;[Haryana Budget 2018 Presented by Captain Abhimanyu: Highlights Haryana Budget 2018 Presented by Captain Abhimanyu: Highlights], India.com, 9 Mar 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public engagement ==
[[File:SDG-pyramid.jpg|thumb|A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid.]]
UN agencies which are part of the [[United Nations Development Group]] decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience. This campaign, "Project Everyone," had the support of corporate institutions and other international organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-everyone.org/|title=Project Everyone|website=Project-everyone.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the text drafted by diplomats at the UN level, a team of communication specialists developed icons for every goal.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals&lt;/ref&gt; They also shortened the title "The 17 Sustainable Development Goals" to "[[Global Goals]]/17#GlobalGoals," then ran workshops and conferences to communicate the Global Goals to a global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenewdivision.world/global-goals-branding|title=the-new-division|website=the-new-division|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.good.is/slideshows/designing-the-global-goals-for-everyone|title=How This Great Design Is Bringing World Change to the Masses|date=2015-09-24|work=GOOD Magazine|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalfestivalofideas.org/|title=Global Festival of Action – Global Festival of Action|website=globalfestivalofideas.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early concern was that 17 goals would be too much for people to grasp and that therefore the SDGs would fail to get a wider recognition.{{When|date=November 2018}} That without wider recognition the necessary momentum to achieve them by 2030 would not be archived. Concerned with this, British film-maker [[Richard Curtis]] started the organization in 2015 called Project Everyone with the aim to bring the goals to everyone on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.project-everyone.org/ Project Everyone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/making-the-sdgs-famous-and-popular/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09382406&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis approached Swedish designer [[sv:Jakob Trollbäck]] who rebranded them as The Global Goals and created the 17 iconic visuals with clear short names as well as a logotype for the whole initiative. The communication system is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalgoals.org/resources&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Jakob Trollbäck and his company The New Division  went on to extend the communication system to also include the 169 targets that describe how the goals can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewdivision.world&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Le Temps Presse festival ===
The annual "Le Temps Presse" festival in [[Paris]] utilizes cinema to sensitize the public, especially young people, to the Sustainable Development Goals. The origin of the festival was in 2010 when eight directors produced a film titled "8," which included eight short films, each featuring one of the Millennium Development Goals. After 2.5 million viewers saw "8" on YouTube, the festival was created. It now showcases young directors whose work promotes social, environmental and human commitment. The festival now focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letempspresse.org/fr/le-festival/|title=Le Temps Presse|last=|first=|date=15 November 2017|website=Le Temps Presse|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==17 goals==
There are 169 targets for the 17 goals. Each target has between 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. In total, there are 304 indicators that will measure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/6754Technical%20report%20of%20the%20UNSC%20Bureau%20%28final%29.pdf|title=Technical report by the Bureau of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) on the process of the development of an indicator framework for the goals and targets of the post-2015 development agenda – working draft|date=March 2015|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has been asked to provide easy to understand lists of targets and facts and figures for each of the 17 SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/L.85&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations General Assembly Draft outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda|website=UN|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17 goals listed below as sub-headings use the 2-to-4 word phrases that identify each goal.

[[File:Sustainable Development Goals chart.svg|thumb|787x787px|A diagram listing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals|center]]

=== Goal 1: No poverty ===

==== "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-1-no-poverty.html|title=Goal 1: No poverty|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Extreme poverty]] has been cut by more than half since 1990. Still, more than 1 in 5 people live on less than the target figure of US$1.25 per day. That target may not be adequate for human [[subsistence]], however. Some suggest it may be necessary to raise the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] figure to as high as $5 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/global-poverty-climate-change-sdgs/|title=The Problem with Saving the World {{!}} Jacobin|website=www.jacobinmag.com|access-date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is more than the lack of income or resources. People live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare, security, and education. They also experience hunger, social [[discrimination]], and exclusion from decision-making processes.

Children make up the majority – more than half – of those living in extreme poverty. In 2013, an estimated 385 million children lived on less than US$1.90 per day. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide. On average, 97 percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards SDG Goal 1, and 63 percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women face potentially life-threatening risks from early [[pregnancy]] and frequent pregnancies. This can result in lost hope for an education and for a better income.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Poverty affects age groups differently, with the most devastating effects experienced by children. It affects their education, health, nutrition, and security, impacting emotional and spiritual development.

Achieving Goal 1 is hampered by growing inequality, increasingly [[Fragile state|fragile statehood]], and the impacts of [[Global warming|climate change]].&lt;ref name="D+C/E+Z"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/eradicate-extreme-poverty-ultra-poor-need-be-reached|title=Programmes for the poorest of the poor|author=Jörn Geisselmann|date=29 April 2017|work=D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 2: Zero hunger ===
==== "[[Hunger#Global initiatives to end hunger|End hunger]], achieve [[food security]] and improved nutrition, and promote [[sustainable agriculture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-2-zero-hunger.html|title=Goal 2: Zero hunger|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Goal 2 states that by 2030 we should end hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This would be accomplished by doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (especially women and indigenous peoples), by ensuring sustainable food production systems, and by progressively improving land and soil quality. Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40% of the global population. It is the largest source of income for poor rural households. Women make up about 43% of the agricultural labor force in [[Developing country|developing countries]], and over 50% in parts of Asia and Africa. However, women own only 20% of the land.

Other targets deal with maintaining genetic diversity of seeds, increasing access to land, preventing trade restriction and distortions in world agricultural markets to limit extreme food price volatility, eliminating waste with help from the International Food Waste Coalition, and ending malnutrition and undernutrition of children.

Globally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. Undernutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide,&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributes to nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five – 3.1 million children per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/130565-1.pdf|title=From Promise to Impact: Ending malnutrition by 2030|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic malnutrition, which affects an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children's brain and physical development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, only 26 of 202 UN member countries are on track to meet the SDG target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) of 2013 stated that the emphasis of the SDGs should not be on ending poverty by 2030, but on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition by 2025.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"&gt;Fan, Shenggen and Polman, Paul. 2014. [http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/128045 An ambitious development goal: Ending hunger and undernutrition by 2025]. In 2013 Global food policy report. Eds. Marble, Andrew and Fritschel, Heidi. Chapter 2. Pp 15-28. Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in China, Vietnam, Brazil, and Thailand. Three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture-led; 2) social protection- and nutrition- intervention-led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"/&gt;

=== Goal 3: Good health and well-being for people ===
==== "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-3-good-health-and-well-being.html|title=Goal 3: Good health and well-being|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with [[Child mortality|child]] and [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]]. Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births).&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Newborns account for a growing number of these deaths, and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under-5 mortality due to a number of factors.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; SDG Goal 3 aims to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. But if current trends continue, more than 60 countries will miss the SDG neonatal mortality target for 2030. About half of these countries would not reach the target even by 2050. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; 

Goal 3 also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/meetings/2015/un-sustainable-development-summit/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; In 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data for girls of greatest concern – those aged between 10-14 - is currently unavailable. Key strategies for meeting SDG Goal 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Similarly, progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and on reducing [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]].  From 2000-2016, new HIV infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 15-19.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; However, current trends mean that 1 out of 4 countries still won't meet the SDG target to end AIDS among children under 5, and 3 out of 4 will not meet the target to end AIDS among adolescents.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;  Additionally, only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need, and the need for [[family planning]] is increasing exponentially as the population grows. While needs are being addressed gradually, more than 225 million women have an unmet need for [[Birth control|contraception]].

Goal 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential medicines and vaccines.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under 5 and to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and water-borne diseases, for example.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; 2016 rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine (DTP3) and the first dose of the measles vaccine (MCV1) reached 86 percent and 85 percent, respectively. Yet about 20 million children did not receive DTP3 and about 21 million did not receive MCV1. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Around 2 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress in order to reach SDG targets for immunization.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Attention to health and well-being also includes targets related to the prevention and treatment of [[substance abuse]], deaths and injuries from [[Traffic collision|traffic accidents]] and from hazardous chemicals and air, [[Water pollution|water]] and soil pollution and contamination.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

=== Goal 4: Quality education ===
==== "Ensure [[inclusion (education)|inclusive]] and [[educational equity|equitable]] quality education and promote [[lifelong learning]] opportunities for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-4-quality-education.html|title=Goali 4: Quality education|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Major progress has been made in access to education, specifically at the [[primary school]] level, for both boys and girls. Still, at least 22 million children in 43 countries will miss out on pre-primary education unless the rate of progress doubles.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school. 103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills, and more than 60 percent of those are women.  In one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Target 1 of Goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.

Additionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards SDG Goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data on learning outcomes and pre-primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; This makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind.

=== Goal 5: Gender equality ===


==== "Achieve [[gender equality]] and [[empowerment|empower]] all women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-5-gender-equality.html|title=Goal 5: Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
According to the UN, "gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will nurture sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. A record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions as of 2014. However, another 52 had not taken this step. In many nations, gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms. Even though SDG5 is a stand-alone goal, other SDGs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men. Issues unique to women and girls include traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, such as female genital mutilation.

[[Child marriage]] has declined over the past decades, yet there is no region that is currently on track to eliminate the practice and reach SDG targets by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; If current trends continue, between 2017 and 2030, 150 million girls will be married before they turn 18.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world, most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the SDG Goal 5 target to eliminate child marriage by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Achieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=5 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targets call for an end to gender discrimination and for empowering women and girls through technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 05. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls – Indicators and a Monitoring Framework|url=http://indicators.report/goals/goal-5/|website=indicators.report|publisher=indicators.report|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have advocated for "listening to girls". The assertion is that the SDGs can deliver transformative change for girls only if girls are consulted. Their priorities and needs must be taken into account. Girls should be viewed not as beneficiaries of change, but as agents of change. Engaging women and girls in the implementation of the SDGs is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leach|first1=Anna|title=21 ways the SDGs can have the best impact on girls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/02/21-ways-the-sdgs-can-have-the-best-impact-on-girls|accessdate=5 August 2017|work=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has insisted on the transformational role [[Gender diversity|gender-diverse]] that boards can play in that regard, predicting that 2018 could be a pivotal year, as “more than ever before, many UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG5, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation ===

[[File:Pit latrines in Zambia (3233256285).jpg|thumb|Unimproved sanitation example: [[pit latrine]] without slab in [[Lusaka]], Zambia]]

==== "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 6}}

The [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]] (SDG6) has eight targets and 11 indicators that will be used to monitor progress toward the targets. Most are to be achieved by the year 2030. One is targeted for 2020.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"/&gt; Worldwide, 6 out of 10 people lack safely managed sanitation services, and 3 out of 10 lack safely managed water services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption is critical to successful education and successful employment. Therefore, toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure. "Equitable sanitation" calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented.

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the users.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"/&gt; This will require cooperation between governments, civil society, and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko, Tan, Tay Keong, Flynn, Patricia M.|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017, two-thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for SDG indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; From those that were available, the Joint Monitoring Programme ([[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]]) found that 4.5 billion people currently do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; If we are to meet SDG targets for sanitation by 2030, nearly one-third of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation including Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) has made it its mission to achieve SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419043556/http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|archive-date=2015-04-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116185906/http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|archive-date=2017-11-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SuSanA's position is that the SDGs are highly interdependent. Therefore, the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance Knowledge Hub|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117064658/http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|archive-date=2017-11-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy ===
==== "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] and modern energy for all."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-7-affordable-and-clean-energy.html|title=Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Targets for 2030 include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and more investment in clean energy infrastructure. Plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]], [[Small Island Developing States|small islands]] and land-locked [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

As of 2017, only 57 percent of the global population relies primarily on clean fuels and technology, falling short of the 95 percent target.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth ===
==== "Promote sustained, inclusive and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic growth]], full and productive employment and [[decent work]] for all."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-8-decent-work-and-economic-growth.html|title=Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment weren’t prioritized enough. Being prioritized as number 8 and number 9 respectively was considered a rather "mediocre ranking and defies common sense''"''&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"/&gt;

For the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. Implementing the Global Jobs Pact of the [[International Labour Organization]] is also mentioned.

By 2030, the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs. Strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

=== Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure ===
==== "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster [[innovation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 9: Industry, innovation, infrastructure|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-9-industry-innovation-and-infrastructure.html|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Resilience (engineering and construction)|Urban resilience}}
Manufacturing is a major source of employment. In 2016, the least developed countries had less "manufacturing value added per capita". The figure for Europe and North America amounted to US$4,621, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg9|title=Progress of Goal 9 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturing of high products contributes 80 percent to total manufacturing output in industrialized economies but barely 10 percent in the least developed countries.

Mobile-cellular signal coverage has improved a great deal. In previously "unconnected" areas of the globe, 85 percent of people now live in covered areas. Planet-wide, 95 percent of the population is covered.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

=== Goal 10: Reducing inequalities ===
==== "Reduce income [[social inequality|inequality]] within and among countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities.html|title=Goal 10: Reduced inequalities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
One target is to reduce the cost of exporting goods from least developed countries. "Duty-free treatment" has expanded. As of 2015, 65 percent of products coming from the least developed countries were duty-free, as compared to 41 percent in 2005.

The target of 3 percent was established as the cost that international migrant workers would pay to send money home (known as [[Remittance|remittances]]). However, post offices and money transfer companies currently charge 6 percent of the amount remitted. Worse, commercial banks charge 11 percent. Prepaid cards and mobile money companies charge 2 to 4 percent, but those services were not widely available as of 2017 in typical "remittance corridors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg10|title=Progress of Goal 10 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 Nov 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goal Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-11-sustainable-cities-and-communities.html|title=Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The target for 2030 is to ensure access to safe and [[affordable housing]]. The indicator named to measure progress toward this target is the proportion of urban population living in [[Slum|slums]] or [[Shanty town|informal settlements]]. Between 2000 and 2014, the proportion fell from 39 percent to 30 percent. However, the absolute number of people living in slums went from 792 million in 2000 to an estimated 880 million in 2014. Movement from rural to urban areas has accelerated as the population has grown and better housing alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11|title=Sustainable Development Goal 11|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production ===
==== "Ensure [[sustainable consumption]] and production patterns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html|title=Goal 12: Responsible consumption, production|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Sustainable products}}
The targets of Goal 12 include using [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] production methods and reducing the amount of waste. By 2030, national [[recycling]] rates should increase, as measured in tons of material recycled. Further, companies should adopt sustainable practices and publish sustainability reports.

Target 12.1 calls for the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg12|title=Goal 12 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework, adopted by member states at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]], is a global commitment to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production in developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rio20.un.org/sites/rio20.un.org/files/a-conf.216-5_english.pdf|title=A/CONF.216/5: A 10-Year Framework of Programmes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to generate the collective impact necessary for such a shift, programs such as the [[One Planet Network]] have formed different implementation methods to help achieve Goal 12.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/platform-sustainable-development-goal-12 Retrieved October 15 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 13: Climate action ===
==== "Take urgent action to combat [[Global warming|climate change]] and its impacts by regulating [[emission of greenhouse gases|emissions]] and promoting developments in [[renewable energy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html|title=Goal 13: Climate action|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The UN discussions and negotiations identified the links between the post-2015 SDG process and the [[Financing for Development]] process that concluded in Addis Ababa in July 2015 and the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 21]] Climate Change conference in Paris in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/events/2015/december/COP21-paris-climate-conference.html|title=Paris Climate Change Conference: COP21|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in Paris in 2015 could enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Impact-of-climate-on-SDGs-technical-report-CDKN.pdf|title=The impact of climate change on the achievement of the post-2015 sustainable development goals|last2=Greño, P|date=May 2015|publisher=CDKN &amp; HR Wallingford|last3=Houlden, V|display-authors=et al.|last1=Ansuategi, A|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the SDGs are met. Further, economic development and climate change are inextricably linked, particularly around [[poverty]], [[gender equality]], and energy. The UN encourages the [[public sector]] to take initiative in this effort to minimize [[environmental impact|negative impacts on the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/no9.pdf&amp;embedded=true|title=Sustainable Development Innovation Briefs, Issue 9|last=|first=|date=March 2010|work=|access-date=12 September 2016|via=UN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial [[China–United States relations|Sino-American]] convergence that developed in 2015-2016, notably at the UN [[COP21]] summit (Paris) and ensuing [[G20]] conference (Hangzhou).&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth|title=Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth?|date=October 2016|work=Analyse Financière|first1=M.

As one of the regions most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the Asia-Pacific region needs more [[public-private partnership]]s (PPPs) to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GCEOA Chairman Underscores the Value of Big Data for the SDGS |url=http://www.globalceoalliance.org/news-and-events/gceoa-chairman-underscores-the-value-of-big-data-for-the-sdgs/ |website=Global CEO Alliance (GCEOA) |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Press release |date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 14: Life below water ===
==== "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html|title=Goal 14: Life below water|website=UNDP|access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Ocean]]s cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface. They are essential for making the planet livable. [[Rainwater]], [[drinking water]] and climate are all regulated by [[ocean temperature]]s and [[ocean current|currents]]. Over 3 billion people depend on marine life for their livelihood. Oceans absorb 30 percent of all [[carbon dioxide]] produced by humans.&lt;ref name="UNDP2017"&gt;UNDP2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The oceans contain more than 200,000 identified species, and there might be thousands of species that are yet to be discovered. Oceans are the world's largest sources of protein. However, there has been a 26 percent increase in [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] since the [[industrial revolution]]. A full 30 percent of [[marine habitat]]s have been destroyed, and 30 percent of the world's [[fish stocks]] are [[overfishing|over-exploited]].&lt;ref name="UNDP2017"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Marine pollution]] has reached shocking levels; each minute, 15 tons of plastic are released into the oceans.&lt;ref name="WWF2017"&gt;WWF2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} 20 percent of all [[Coral reef|coral reefs]] have been destroyed irreversibly, and another 24 percent are in immediate risk of collapse.&lt;ref name="UN2016"&gt;UN2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Approximately 1 million sea birds, 100 000 marine mammals, and an unknown number of fish are harmed or die annually due to marine pollution caused by humans.

Individuals can help the oceans by reducing their [[energy consumption]] and their use of plastics. Nations can also take action. In Norway, for instance, citizens, working through a web page called finn.no, can earn money for picking up plastic on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tesdal Galtung |first1=Anders |last2=Rolfsnes |first2=May-Helen |title=Finn.no kjøper sekker med havplast |url=https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/finn.no-kjoper-sekker-med-havplast-1.13599585 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=NRK |date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, including Kenya, have [[Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags|banned the use of plastic bags]] for retail purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya plastic bag ban comes into force after years of delays |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41069853 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving the oceans contributes to [[poverty reduction]], as it gives low-income families a source of income and healthy food. Keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism, as stated in Goal 8, and reduce poverty by providing more employment.&lt;ref name="UN2016"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification, protecting marine and [[coastal ecosystem]]s, and [[fishing regulation|regulating fishing]]. The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fsustainabledevelopment%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2F14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf&amp;embedded=true&amp;chrome=false&amp;dov=1 [[chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg|link=]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 15: Life on land ===
==== "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, sustainably manage forests, combat [[desertification]], and halt and reverse [[land degradation]] and halt [[biodiversity]] loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land.html|title=Goal 15: Life on land|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
This goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest, desert, and mountain eco-systems, as a percentage of total land mass. Achieving a "land degradation-neutral world" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood. Goal 15 calls for more attention to preventing invasion of [[introduced species]] and more protection of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

The Mountain Green Cover Index monitors progress toward target 15.4, which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems. The index is named as the indicator for target 15.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/mountain-partnership/our-work/advocacy/2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development/mountain-green-cover-index/en/|title=Mountain Partnership: working together for mountain peoples and environment|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Mountain Partnership|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Red Index (Red List Index or RLI) will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg15|title=Sustainable Development Goal 12|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development UN|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal extinction is a growing problem.

=== Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions ===
==== "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide [[right to fair trial|access to justice]] for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-16-peace-justice-and-strong-institutions.html|title=Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Reducing [[violent crime]], [[sex trafficking]], [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], and [[child abuse]] are clear global goals. The International Community values [[peace]] and [[justice]] and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. By 2017, the UN could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. More women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also [[violence against women]]). In 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. Sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased.

One target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. However, reliance on the indicator of "crimes reported" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sdg16report.org/|title=SDG16 Data Initiative 2017 Global Report|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=SDG16 Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723064355/http://sdg16report.org/|archive-date=2017-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

SDG 16 also targets universal legal identity and [[Birth certificate|birth registration]], ensuring the right to a name and nationality, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. With more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals ===
==== "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for [[sustainable development]].“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-17-partnerships-for-the-goals.html|title=Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Increasing [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]] is seen as vital to achieving each of the 16 previous goals. Goal 17 is included to assure that countries and organizations cooperate instead of compete. Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships to share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial support is seen as critical to overall success of the SDGs. [[Public–private partnership|Public-private partnerships]] that involve civil societies are specifically mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg17|title=Sustainable Development Goal 17|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cross-cutting issues ==
[[File:Sustainable Development Goals (Lima, Peru) 1.jpg|thumb|240px|Young people holding SDG banners in Lima, Peru.]]

=== Women and gender equality ===
There is widespread consensus that progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized holistically – by policy makers as well as private sector executives and board members. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=6th World Pensions Forum held at the Queen’s House: ESG and Asset Ownership|url=https://amnt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/6th-World-Pensions-Forum2017.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= Revue Analyse Financière|publisher=Revue Analyse Financière|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statements from diverse sources, such as the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), [[UN Women]] and the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] have noted that investments in women and girls have positive impacts on economies. National and global development investments often exceed their initial scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/POST-2015%20Gender.pdf|title=Gender equality and women’s rights in the post-2015 agenda: A foundation for sustainable development|format=PDF|website=Oecd.org|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and sustainable development ===
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

Education for sustainable development (ESD) is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education. UNESCO promotes the [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as a complementary approach.&lt;ref&gt;Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning objectives UNESCO, 2015 &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it is important to emphasize ESD’s importance for all the other 16 SDGs. With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs. This would enable individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf|title=Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100209-0|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education, gender and technology ===
{{Main|Massive open online course}}

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free open education offered through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs was to open up quality [[Higher education|Higher Education]] to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 ("Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, MOOCs also contribute to Goal 5, in that they are gender neutral and can give women and girls improved access to education.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== SDG-driven investment ===
[[Stewardship|Capital stewardship]] is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda: 
: "No longer [[absentee landlord]]s', [[pension fund]] trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain, Benelux and America: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups [...] to shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment"&lt;ref name="Revue Analyse Financiere"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

==Criticisms==

=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development. Finally, the MDGs used a  sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Whilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Competing goals ===

{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}
First, some of the SDGs might be contradictory. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] (as opposed to qualitative economic development and the goal of better distribution of the economic product) might undermine [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].

Second, the goal of achieving sustainable human population and lifestyle levels, and the scientific issues of matching ecosystems (and the Earth as a whole) to the number of human beings that they can sustainably support at a certain life-style level, seem neglected and largely unarticulated. Human population levels and reproductive rates are independent variables in trying to reach the SDGs and in aiming at an overall sustainable Earth/Human Community, they need to be scientifically recognized as such.

Third, in addition to population and lifestyle issues, three sectors need to come together in order to achieve sustainable development. These are the economic, socio-political, and environmental sectors in their broadest sense.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiid.in/2016/08/sustainable-development-goals-2016-2030-easier-stated-achieved/|title=Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030: Easier Stated Than Achieved – JIID|date=2016-08-21|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the promotion of [[multidisciplinary]] and transdisciplinary research across different sectors, which can be difficult, particularly when major governments fail to support it.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;. 

Fourth, the issues of demilitarization, disarmament, and conversion to peace-based economies also seem neglected, along with the issues of corruption, drugs, robotization of jobs, the need for global citizenship education, the lack of reliable UN and SDG financing, and the current disempowering inability of citizens to participate directly in the global-level decision-making and priority-setting process and to thereby feel the collective togetherness needed for the success of the SDG effort.

=== Too many goals ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals.

On the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals were justified because the agenda they address is all encompassing.

=== High cost of achieving the SDGs ===
''The Economist'' estimated that alleviating poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about US$2–3 trillion per year for the next 15 years which they called "pure fantasy".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Estimates for providing clean water and sanitation for the whole population of all continents have been as high as US$200 billion.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The World Bank cautions that estimates need to be made country by country, and reevaluated frequently over time.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/847191468000296045/pdf/103172-PUB-Box394556B-PUBLIC-EPI-K8632-ADD-SERIES.pdf|title=The Costs of Meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal Targets on Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene|last=Hutton|first=Guy|date=15 November 2017|website=Documents/World Bank|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses to criticisms ===
Other views are more positive. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

The Rockefeller Foundation asserts that "The key to financing and achieving the SDGs lies in mobilizing a greater share of the $200+ trillion in annual private capital investment flows toward development efforts, and philanthropy has a critical role to play in catalyzing this shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/new-role-foundations-financing-global-goals/|title=A New Role for Foundations in Financing the Global Goals|last=Madsbjerg|first=Saadia|date=19 September 2017|website=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale funders participating in a Rockefeller Foundation-hosted design thinking workshop (June 2017: Scaling Solutions) were realistic.  They concluded that while there is a moral imperative to achieve the SDGs, failure is inevitable if there aren't drastic changes to how we go about financing large scale change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sphaera.world/billions-to-trillions/|title=From Billions to Trillions: Mobilising the Missing Trillions to Solve the Sustainable Development Goals|last=Burgess|first=Cameron|date=March 2018|website=sphaera.world|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theophilus (Gottlieb) Siegfried Bayer'''(1694–1738), was a [[Germans|German]] [[Classics|classical scholar]] with specialization in [[Sinology]].&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;

==Personal details==

Bayer was a native of [[Königsberg]], [[East Prussia]]. His father Johann Friedrich was from the German Protestant minority in Hungary, but had moved to East Prussia where he worked as a painter.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.12 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youthful T. S. Bayer was an excellent student at the [[University of Königsberg]], studying Latin, Greek and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.13 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of the [[Königsberg Cathedral]] from 1721 to 1726,&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt; and also worked as a librarian at the [[Königsberg Public Library]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

==Bayer collection==
He had a library of more than 200 manuscripts, Chinese and other [[Orient]]al books, including:
* [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Palm-leaf manuscript]]s
* Oriental history and [[philology]]-related notes
* Correspondence with [[Jesuits]] in [[Beijing|Peking]].

After his death in [[Saint Petersburg]] his widow handed over his books and papers to the Academy authorities, receiving the rest of her husband's pay due that year.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.209 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library was later sold to a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]] in [[London]], Heinrich Walter Gerdes.  William Hunter later purchased the collection from Gerdes' widow.  It finally reached the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1807 with a brief stay in [[London]] with Dr Matthew Baillie, Hunter's nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/specialcollections/collectionsa-z/bayercollection/ |title= Bayer Collection |work= gla.ac.uk |publisher= University of Glasgow|accessdate= January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/manuscripts/search/detaila.cfm?AID=2523.0 |title= GB 0247 MS Hunter B - Collection |work= special.lib.gla.ac.uk |publisher= University of Glasgow|accessdate= January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vasculum face sup.jpg|thumb|Vasculum]]
A '''vasculum''' or a '''botanical box''' is a stiff container used by [[botanist]]s to keep field [[Sample (material)|sample]]s viable for transportation. The main purpose of the vasculum is to transport plants without crushing them and by maintaining a cool, humid [[Environment (systems)|environment]].

==Construction==
Vascula are cylinders typically made from [[Tinning|tinned]] and sometimes lacquered iron, though wooden examples are known. The box was carried horizontally on a strap so that plant [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]]s lie flat and lined with moistened cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://garance.voyageuse.free.fr/botanique/dep_bota3.htm |title=L'herbier, un outil pour le botaniste |trans-title=The herbarium, a tool for the botanist |language=French |publisher=La Garance voyageuse |quote=with image }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, British and American vascula were somewhat flat and [[suitcase|valise]]-like with a single room, while continental examples were more cylindrical and often longer, sometimes with two separate compartments.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=H. G.|title=Origin of the Vasculum|journal=Proceedings of the Botanical Society of the British Isles|date=1958|volume=3|pages=41–43|url=http://www.watsonia.org.uk/html/proceedings_3.html#p41.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the interior is through one (sometimes two) large lids in the side, allowing plants to be put in and taken out without bending or distorting them unnecessarily. This is particularly important with [[wildflowers]], which are often fragile.

Some early 20th century specimen are made from sheet aluminium rather than tin, but otherwise follow the 19th century pattern. The exterior is usually left rough, or lacquered green.

==History==
The roots of the vasculum is lost in time, but may have evolved from the 17th century tin candle-box of similar construction. [[Linnaeus]] called it a ''vasculum dilletanum'', from [[Latin]] ''vasculum'' - small container and ''dilletanum'', referring to [[Johann Jacob Dillenius|J.J. Dillenius]], Linnaeus' friend and colleague at [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Oxford Botanic Garden]]. With rise of botany as a scientific field the mid 18th century, the vasculum became an indispensable part of the botanist's equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=D.E.|title=Some further Light on the History of the Vasculum|journal=Proceedings of the Botanical Society of the British Isles|date=1965|volume=6|pages=105–109|url=http://www.watsonia.org.uk/html/proceedings_6.html#p105.pdf|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the screw-down plant press, the vasculum was popularized in Britain by naturalist [[William Withering]] around 1770.&lt;ref name=Mygatt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=J.E.|first1=Mygatt|title=A Case for Collecting|journal=Iowa Native Plant Society Newsletter|date=2001|volume=7|page=3|url=http://www.msb.unm.edu/herbarium/documents/vasculum.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortened term "vasculum" appear to have become the common name applied to them around 1830.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; Being a hallmark of field botany, the vascula were in common use until [[World War II]] . With post-war emphasis on [[systematics]] rather than [[alpha taxonomy]] and new species often collected in far-away places, field botany and the vascula with it went into decline.

Aluminium vascula are still made and in use, though [[Zipper storage bag|zipper bags]] and clear plastic folders are today cheaper and more common in use.&lt;ref name=Mygatt/&gt;

The newsletter of the Society of Herbarium Curators is named "The Vasculum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vasculum|url=http://www.herbariumcurators.org/newsletter/|publisher=Society of Herbarium Curators|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Witching Culture: Folklore and Neo-Paganism in America''''' is a [[folkloristics|folkloric]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in the United States. It was written by the American anthropologist and folklorist [[Sabina Magliocco]] of [[California State University, Northridge]] and first published in 2004 by the [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]. It was released as a part of a series of academic books titled 'Contemporary Ethnography', edited by the anthropologists [[Kirin Narayan]] of the [[University of Wisconsin]] and Paul Stoller of [[West Chester University]].

Magliocco became interested in studying the American Pagan movement in the mid-1990s, following the culmination of her fieldwork research in a Sicilian village. From 1995 through to 1997, she began studying the Pagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, joining a Wiccan group, the Coven Trismegiston, which was led by the high priest [[Don Frew]] and high priestess Anna Korn. Becoming involved with the faith, Magliocco noted that she no longer remained an objective outsider, but became an active participant after experiencing [[altered states of consciousness]] during several Pagan rituals. In 2002 she published her first book on the subject, ''Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work'', which was followed by the more general ''Witching Culture'' two years later.

''Witching Culture'' provides an anthropological study of the Wiccan and wider Pagan community in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on the role that [[folklore]] has within the movement; in this it looks both at how Pagans have adopted pre-existing folklore and how unique Pagan folklore actually develops within the community. It deals with the influence of folkloristic on the early development of Wicca, in particular the influence of figures like [[Sir James Frazer]], [[Charles Leland]] and [[Margaret Murray]].

The reviews published in specialist academic journals were predominantly positive, with [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] and [[Jacqueline Simpson]] being particularly praiseworthy, although some reviewers opined that Magliocco's openly Pagan beliefs had some negative repercussions for the study.

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===
Contemporary Paganism, or Neo-Paganism, is a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]] influenced by the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s that was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book that helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 then saw the publication of ''[[Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia]]'', authored by the anthropologist Lynne Hume.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Next came the work of the American sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] with her ''[[A Community of Witches|A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt; Then there was Jone Salomonsen's study of the Reclaiming tradition in San Francisco, ''[[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sal02|Salomonsen 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magliocco and her research===

Magliocco became interested in Paganism in the mid-1990s, intending to explore "the confluence of ritual, festival, gender and politics &amp;ndash; the subject of my earlier research in Italy &amp;ndash; in a new context". Initially she was interested in Paganism as a "folk revival, in issues surrounding the use of folklore from academic sources, cultural appropriation, and the construction of authenticity in the invention of rituals" rather than in any actual spiritual capacity.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1995, Magliocco attended the first Pantheacon conference, a meeting of practicing Pagans and academics held at a hotel in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California. It was at the conference that she took part in a ritual led by members of the [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wiccan]] tradition, later characterizing it as "my first powerfully affecting ritual experience in a Neo-Pagan context".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="My decision was not motivated only by expedience. I was aesthetically pleased and genuinely moved by some of the rituals I attended, and as a result of these experiences, I changed in significant ways. Because I decided to remain open and vulnerable during rituals, I gained access to imaginative experiences I had banished from my consciousness since reaching adulthood. These were crucial in helping me understand the essence of the culture I was studying; had I ''not'' had them, I would have failed to grasp the importance of religious ecstasy in the Neo-Pagan experience."|source=—Sabina Magliocco, on why she became a Pagan, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Magliocco had initially intended to conduct a long-term period of fieldwork among a single Pagan group, with a focus on understanding their "dynamics of ritual creation", but ultimately was unable to do this; from 1994 through to 1997, she held a series of temporary academic appointments at universities across the United States, preventing her from staying in one area for any lengthy period of time and studying any one particular group there.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt; However, from 1995 through to 1997, she was living in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California, where she immersed herself in the one of "the country's oldest and most active Neo-Pagan communities", that of the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt; Here, she befriended Holly Tannen, a folklorist and ballad performer who was well known and respected among the Pagan community of northern California. It was through Trennan that she was introduced to many other members of the Pagan community, including to a local Gardnerian Wiccan coven.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 10"/&gt;

In 1996, she moved into a "small rental house" in the Berkeley Flats along a line of houses that were nicknamed "Witch Row" (a fact that she was unaware of at the time), and it was here that she befriended further members of the Pagan community; her neighbors were elders in the Fellowship of the Spiral Path, while another neighboring house was the home of Judy Foster, a founding member of the [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Several streets away lived [[Don Frew]] and Anna Korn, the high priest and high priestess of a Gardnerian group known as the Coven Trismegiston.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 11"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding that she wanted to actively participate in the religions she was studying, Magliocco was initiated into the Coven Trismegiston, and went on to begin training in the Reclaiming tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 she published her first academic study of American Paganism, ''Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work''. ''Witching Culture'' was published in the "Contemporary Ethnography" series of books, edited by the anthropologists Kirin Narayan of the [[University of Wisconsin]] and Paul Stoller of [[West Chester University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ConEth|University of Pennsylvania Press]]. undated.&lt;/ref&gt; Magliocco dedicated the book to the memory of Andrew Vázsonyi (1906&amp;ndash;1986),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. unnumbered opening page.&lt;/ref&gt; a Hungarian folklorist and novelist who had worked for two decades at the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Döm86|Dömötör 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her introduction, "The Ethnography of Magic and the Magic of Ethnography", Magliocco discusses how she first became involved with the Pagan movement, and includes extracts from the field notes that she made at the time. Going on to lay out the objectives of the book, Magliocco discusses the [[history of Wicca]], and the influence that early anthropologists like [[Edward Taylor]] and [[James Frazer]] had on it as a burgeoning movement. Proceeding to discuss the pre-existing academic studies of the Pagan movement, she explains her own approach to the subject and how it differs from those of her predecessors, in particular focusing on her own spiritual experiences and altered states of consciousness that she experienced while taking part in Pagan ritual and her insider-outsider perspective on the Pagan movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part I: Roots and Branches===
Chapter one, "The Study of Folklore and the Reclamation of Paganism", offers a historical introduction to Contemporary Paganism, looking at its roots in the Classical World of Greece and Rome, and then the successive influences of [[Neoplatonism]], Renaissance magic, the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. Magliocco then looks at the influence that 18th and 19th century folkloristics and anthropology had on the Romanticists and then Pagan movement, in particular the work of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Sir James Frazer]]. Proceeding to look at this relationship, she highlights the work of [[Charles Leland]], [[Margaret Murray]] and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who drew from folklore in their own books, all of which heavily influenced modern Paganism. Magliocco argues that Contemporary Paganism can be viewed as a "folk tradition" on two levels; firstly, because it continues to work with and propagate the spiritual traditions of [[western esotericism]], and secondly, because it acts as a form of "resistance culture" in opposition to dominant trends in western culture. Finally, she borrows the concept of "textual poachers" from the French sociologist [[Michel de Certeau]], arguing that the Pagan community fit this model well, collating elements from a wide variety of sources and composing them into something new, in this case a religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 23&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter two, "Boundaries and Borders: Imagining Community", opens with a discussion of how Pagans distinguish themselves from one another and from the wider society around them, before delving into the idea that folklore is vital to Pagan "group formation". Magliocco goes on to describe the Pagan community, with a particular emphasis on those in the United States, dealing with such subjects as ethnicity, education, gender and sexual orientation. Moving on to look at how Pagans forge their own identities, she highlights factors such as costume and use of language, and whether such Pagan coding is explicit, complicit or implicit. Magliocco discusses the various different Pagan traditions, and the community division between those who call themselves "witches" and those who do not. She then rounds off the chapter with a discussion of the anthropological fieldwork that she undertook among the San Francisco Bay Area Pagan community between 1995 and 2000, the Coven Trismegiston that she worked with, and the local [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]], [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming]] and [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn|NROOGD]] traditions that she encountered there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 57&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: Religions of Experience===
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
The third chapter, "Making Magic: Training the Imagination", begins with Magliocco's assertion that the unifying feature of the Pagan movement is the ritual experiences that its practitioners undertake. Devoting the rest of the chapter to an examination of how Pagans "conceive of and practice magic", she argues that they do not do so in order to escape [[rationality]], but rather they adopt a belief in magic in order to reclaim "traditional ways of knowing that privilege the imagination". Noting that within Paganism, artists are viewed as magicians, she suggests that magic should itself viewed as an art, with both having the goal of bringing about emotional reactions and changes of consciousness. Exploring the various different definitions of "magic" developed within anthropology, Magliocco notes that most contemporary North Americans equate "magic" with superstition and irrational behavior. She then looks at Pagan understandings of magic, highlighting that Pagans typically try to rationalize magic, viewing it as an energy force in an interconnected universe, one that must obey natural laws, rather than as some un-explainable "[[supernatural]]" force. Moving on, Magliocco discusses the Pagan concept of a sacred universe, looking at the veneration of the natural world and the [[Wheel of the Year|celebration of seasonal Sabbats]], and the relevance that that has for Pagan magical beliefs. Exploring Pagan ethics surrounding the practice of magic, in particular the [[Wiccan Rede]] and the [[Law of Threefold Return]], Magliocco also studies the manner in which Pagans have re-adopted vernacular magic as a part of their religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 95&amp;ndash;121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part III: Beyond Experience: Religion and Identity===

==Arguments==

===Insider/outsider dichotomy===
{{Quote box

|title     =
|quote     = "My absorption into the Neo-Pagan community and my subjective spiritual experiences during fieldwork beg the question that always bedevils ethnologists: to what extent did my participation in the culture cause me to "go native", to adopt the beliefs, attitudes, and worldviews of the people I studied? Am I an insider or an outsider, and how can I be "objective" about a culture if I have adopted an emic, or insider's perspective?"
|salign    = right
|source    = Sabina Magliocco, 2004.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In undertaking her fieldwork, Magliocco discussed whether she took an "outsider" perspective, thereby being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] about those whom she was researching, or whether she had adopted an "insider" perspective, thereby being [[subjectivity|subjective]] in her views of Pagans and Paganism.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt; She claimed that the question as to whether she was an insider or outsider researcher was akin to a question that she had been posed as a child; being an [[Italian American]], Magliocco had often been asked whether she was Italian or American, to which she would respond that she was both.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt; As she noted:

:My answer to readers who want to know whether I am "really" an insider or an outsider to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both &amp;ndash; that how I look at things depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological ''and'' Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is ''not'' about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, and being able to shift easily from one to the other.&lt;ref name="Magliocco 15"/&gt;

In this position, Magliocco was in agreement with Jone Salomonsen, the feminist theologian and ethnographer who had performed fieldwork among the Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco in order to gain research for her book ''[[Enchanted Feminism]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name="Magliocco 16"&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Salomonsen had called this mixed insider/outsider approach the "method of compassion" and wrote that it "does not refer to a wholesale positive embracement, nor to passionate criticisms and arguing, but to something in between... Engagement is more than participation, and something other than pretending. To allow oneself to become engaged is to take the ritual seriously. It is [being] willing to let the trance induction take you into trance, to be willing to be emotionally moved as is intended by certain ritual elements, and [to] go with what happens."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sal02|Salomonsen 2002]]. pp. 4, 9, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altered states of consciousness===
Magliocco also saw herself as an insider because she allowed herself to experience the [[altered states of consciousness]] that contemporary Pagan rituals are reported to induce. As she stated, "I take an experiential approach to the extraordinary experiences" that occur in ritual, and that the "essence of this approach is twofold". The first part of this involved the "conscious, willing, and full participation in ritual experiences intended to induce alternate states of consciousness, and the interpretation of visions and dreams" as different ways of interpreting life. The second part of this "mandates that I consider informants' experiences seriously" when they discuss altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magliocco highlighted the work of the anthropologists David Young and Jean-Guy Goulet in their ''Being Changed: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experience'' (1994), who had argued that spiritual experiences were relatively common among anthropologists, but that most of those working in the discipline fail to speak publicly about their experiences because of a fear of "ridicule and ostracism" by their peers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#You94|Young and Goulet 1994]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to highlight the work of other anthropologists who have discussed their own spiritual experiences that occurred while taking part in rituals in the midst of their fieldwork,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]]. pp. 13&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Bruce Grindal's experience among the [[Sisala]] in Ghana,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri83|Grindal 1983]]. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Lee's experience with Malay spirit possession rites,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee87|Lee 1987]]. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edith Turner's experience in a [[Ndembu]] healing ritual.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tur94|Turner 1994]]. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

This highly personal lead-in story and the author's subsequent reflections in the Introduction provide readers with a clear sense of the perspective from which she approaches her topic. Magliocco makes effective use of this narrative structure—evocative personal story followed by academic reflection—throughout her book. I found her initial discussion of how contemporary ethnography has struggled to renegotiate the boundary between engagement and distance fascinating."

}}

Reviewing ''Witching Culture'' in ''[[The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies]]'', the American religious studies scholar [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] described the work as "the best survey to date" of modern Paganism, "particularly if the focus of one's interest is North American Paganism". In his opinion, ''Witching Culture'' "breaks important new ground in Pagan Studies. In fact, I anticipate that in the near future it will come to be regarded as a groundbreaking book—one to which all future studies of Paganism will refer." He went on to describe it as "my first choice for a textbook in any university class with a significant component on contemporary Paganism" and felt that "Almost every chapter contains either new insights or original analyses that extend prior discussions to a new depth."&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005"/&gt; Lewis noted that although he didn't have "any real criticism" of the book, he wished that it had discussed the role of solitary practitioners and teenage Wiccans, two significant sectors of the Pagan community whom Magliocco only mentioned in passing, and the infighting among the Wiccan community, which Magliocco hadn't even mentioned. Ultimately, Lewis remarked that "I can heartily recommend this book as a 'must read' for anyone in this field, whether academic observers or reflective participants."&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005"/&gt;

In her review for the ''Folklore'' journal, the English folklorist [[Jacqueline Simpson]] described ''Witching Culture'' as offering a "fascinating analysis" of how U.S. Pagans have "adopted and adapted elements of European folk practice to fit the Gardnerian framework of their rituals and spells". Ultimately, she characterised the work as being "a very informative and well-researched study, and a most interesting read".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sim05|Simpson 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; Roman I. Shiyan of the [[University of Alberta]] reviewed ''Witching Culture'' in the journal ''Ethnologies'', stating that the work was "lucid evidence of the growing popularity of neo-pagan topics in North America and the academic world in particular" and that Magliocco "raises several important theoretical issues" regarding the topic. In conclusion, he felt that the book "takes us deep into a largely obscure and often misunderstood culture, which offers a very different perspective of the world and the place of humans in it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shi05|Shiyan 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Journal of American Folklore'', the sociologist [[Gary Alan Fine]] published a review of Magliocco's work in which he described it as "a richly textured ethnography, as fine a participant-observation account of an American scene as folklore has been gifted with since [[Leslie Prosterman]]'s ''Ordinary Life, Festival Days''". Believing that Magliocco's analysis had revealed Paganism to be the most "politically progressive and postmodern" religion in existence "despite [its] considerable borrowings of traditional themes", Fine felt that ''Witching Culture'' was "an effective and affectionate guide in mapping the development of Neo-Paganism in America and the multiple &amp;ndash; and occasionally conflicting &amp;ndash; strains from which it draws". He did however note that in his opinion the author had failed to "stand sufficiently back from the movement to gain the analytic purchase that comes from skepticism. Granted, all religions appear gawky in their adolescence, but sometimes disciplinary agnosticism permits us to discount desired but undeserved self-presentations. While no researcher should scorn the belief system of a group that she encounters, neither is it necessary to nuzzle. This attachment may cause Magliocco to downplay sexuality, drug use, and posturing in the community. These seekers often appear in her telling to be, frankly, rather puritanical." He went on to remark that a "more distanced view would emphasize the struggles over political correctness that challenge the movement as it staggers toward a consensual theology", in particular its controversial cultural borrowings from Native American cultures. Ultimately however, he felt that as an "account of the folkloric practices of a burgeoning social scene", ''Witching Culture'' warrants "high praise".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fin05|Fine 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review, published in the ''History of Religions'' journal, Stefanie von Schnurbein of the Nordeuropa-Institut, [[Humboldt-Universität]], Berlin, wrote that Magliocco dealt with "a sadly understudied issue" in her study, but that "To the disappointment of a reader who expects a theoretically advanced discussion of these relations [between religious culture and academic thinking], the historical argument and material do not go far beyond [[Ronald Hutton]]'s in-depth study of the history of modern pagan witchcraft, ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]''." Continuing with her review, Von Schnurbein opines that Magliocco manages to create a "vivid impression of, and informed insights into, the different facets and contradictions of a contemporary religious movement", one that "allows for well-informed critiques of the problem of rooting spirituality in ethnic or cultural heritage and of the problem of cultural exploitation through borrowing". Nonetheless, she notes that because Magliocco herself is a practicing Pagan, it "limits to a certain degree the author's ability to scrutinize further some of the problems intrinsic to the reception and resignification of ideologically questionable concepts and theories". She also notes that in Magliocco's work, "art, creativity, and imagination are depicted as exclusively positive forces that are rooted in experience and are responsible for the potential of resistance to be found in neopagan ritual and religion". In Von Schnurbein's opinion, "The next step of critical investigation would be to analyze this concept of art as a construction as well."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Von08|Von Schnurbein 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from the Pagan community===
Writing on ''The Cauldron'' website, a practicing Pagan using the pseudonym of "Pitch" described the work as "thoughtful, insightful, fruitful, grounded, and, maybe, provocative" as well as being a "Must Have, Double Bag!" book that "all of us should be proud to add to our libraries".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pit|Pitch. undated.]]&lt;/ref&gt;
