[[File:Galaxies-AGN-Inner-Structure.svg|lang=en|thumb|upright=0.97|Inner structure of a galaxy with an active galactic nucleus]]
An '''active galactic nucleus''' ('''AGN''') is a compact region at the center of a [[galaxy]] that has a much higher than normal [[luminosity]] over at least some portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by [[star]]s. Such excess non-stellar emission has been observed in the [[radio waves|radio]], [[microwave]], [[infrared]], [[visible spectrum|optical]], [[ultra-violet]], [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] wavebands. A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an "active galaxy". The radiation from an AGN is believed to result from the [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of matter by a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of its host galaxy.

Active galactic nuclei are the most luminous persistent sources of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the universe, and as such can be used as a means of discovering distant objects; their evolution as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on [[cosmology|models of the cosmos]].

The observed characteristics of an AGN depend on several properties such as the mass of the central black hole, the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole, the orientation of the [[accretion disk]], the degree of [[Extinction (astronomy)|obscuration]] of the nucleus by [[Cosmic dust|dust]], and presence or absence of [[Astrophysical jet|jets]].

Numerous subclasses of AGN have been defined based on their observed characteristics; the most powerful AGN are classified as [[quasar]]s. A [[blazar]] is an AGN with a jet pointed toward the Earth, in which radiation from the jet is enhanced by [[relativistic beaming]].

==History==
Early photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of AGN emission, although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the AGN phenomenon. Some early observations included the first spectroscopic detection of [[Spectral line|emission lines]] from the nuclei of [[Messier 77|NGC 1068]] and [[Messier 81]] by Edward Fath (published in 1909),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fath|first1=E. A.|title=The spectra of some spiral nebulae and globular star clusters|journal=Lick Observatory Bulletin|date=1909|volume=5|page=71|doi=10.5479/ADS/bib/1909LicOB.5.71F|bibcode=1909LicOB...5...71F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the discovery of the [[Astrophysical jet|jet]] in [[Messier 87]] by [[Heber Curtis]] (published in 1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=H. D.|title=Descriptions of 762 Nebulae and Clusters Photographed with the Crossley Reflector|journal=Publications of Lick Observatory|date=1918|volume=13|page=9|bibcode=1918PLicO..13....9C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including [[Vesto Slipher]], [[Milton Humason]], and [[Nicholas Mayall]] noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slipher|first1=V.|title=The spectrum and velocity of the nebula N.G.C. 1068 (M 77)|journal=Lowell Observatory Bulletin|date=1917|volume=3|page=59|bibcode=1917LowOB...3...59S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humason|first1=M.

Active galaxies such as these are known as [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]] in honor of Seyfert's pioneering work.

The development of [[radio astronomy]] was a major catalyst to understanding AGN. Some of the earliest detected radio sources are nearby active [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]  such as [[Messier 87]] and [[Centaurus A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolton|first1=J. G.|last2=Stanley|first2=G. J.|last3=Slee|first3=O. B.|title=Positions of Three Discrete Sources of Galactic Radio-Frequency Radiation|journal=Nature|date=1949|volume=164|issue=4159|page=101|doi=10.1038/164101b0|accessdate=|bibcode=1949Natur.164..101B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another radio source, [[Cygnus A]], was identified by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Rudolph Minkowski]] as a tidally distorted galaxy with an unusual [[Spectral line|emission-line]] spectrum, having a [[recessional velocity]] of 16,700 kilometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baade|first1=W.|last2=Minkowski|first2=R.|title=Identification of the Radio Sources in Cassiopeia, Cygnus A, and Puppis A.|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1954|volume=119|page=206|doi=10.1086/145812|bibcode=1954ApJ...119..206B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources|3C radio survey]] led to further progress in discovery of new radio sources as well as identifying the [[Visible light|visible-light]] sources associated with the radio emission. In photographic images, some of these objects were nearly point-like or quasi-stellar in appearance, and were classified as [[Quasar|quasi-stellar radio sources]] (later abbreviated as "quasars").

A major breakthrough was the measurement of the [[redshift]] of the quasar [[3C 273]] by [[Maarten Schmidt]], published in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=M.|title=3C 273 : A Star-Like Object with Large Red-Shift|journal=Nature|date=1963|volume=197|issue=4872|page=1040|doi=10.1038/1971040a0|accessdate=|bibcode=1963Natur.197.1040S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schmidt noted that if this object was [[Extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] (outside the [[Milky Way]], at a cosmological distance) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified. Shortly afterward, optical spectra were used to measured the redshifts of a growing number of quasars including [[3C 48]], even more distant at redshift 0.37.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenstein|first1=J. L.|last2=Matthews|first2=T. A.|title=Red-Shift of the Unusual Radio Source: 3C 48|journal=Nature|date=1963|volume=197|issue=4872|page=1041|doi=10.1038/1971041a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v197/n4872/abs/1971041a0.html|accessdate=22 March 2017|bibcode = 1963Natur.197.1041G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous luminosities of these quasars as well as their unusual spectral properties indicated that their power source could not be ordinary stars. Accretion of gas onto a [[supermassive black hole]] was suggested as the source of quasars' power in papers by [[Edwin Salpeter]] and [[Yakov Zel'Dovich]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=G. A.|title=A Brief History of Active Galactic Nuclei|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=1999|volume=111|issue=760|page=661|doi=10.1086/316378|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/316378|accessdate=22 March 2017|bibcode=1999PASP..111..661S|arxiv = astro-ph/9903401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 [[Donald Lynden-Bell]] proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of "dead" quasars, and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby Seyfert galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynden-Bell|first1=Donald|title=Galactic Nuclei as Collapsed Old Quasars|journal=Nature|date=1969|volume=223|page=690|doi=10.1038/223690a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v223/n5207/abs/223690a0.html|accessdate=22 March 2017|bibcode=1969Natur.223..690L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s and 1970s, early [[X-ray astronomy]] observations demonstrated that Seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of X-ray emission, which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks.

Today, AGN are a major topic of astrophysical research, both [[Observational astronomy|observational]] and [[Theoretical astrophysics|theoretical]].  AGN research encompasses observational surveys to find AGN over broad ranges of luminosity and redshift, examination of the cosmic evolution and growth of black holes, studies of the physics of black hole accretion and the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]] from AGN, examination of the properties of jets and outflows of matter from AGN, and the impact of black hole accretion and quasar activity on [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy evolution]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; AGN are both compact and persistently extremely luminous. Accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation, and a massive black hole has a high [[Eddington luminosity]], and as a result, it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity. Supermassive black holes are now believed to exist in the centres of most if not all massive galaxies since the mass of the black hole correlates well with the [[velocity dispersion]] of the galactic bulge (the [[M-sigma relation]]) or with bulge luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Accretion disc===
In the standard model of AGN, cold material close to a black hole forms an [[accretion disc]]. Dissipative processes in the accretion disc transport matter inwards and angular momentum outwards, while causing the accretion disc to heat up. The expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband; in addition, a [[corona]] of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can [[Compton scattering|inverse-Compton scatter]] [[photon]]s up to X-ray energies. The radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular [[emission line]]s. A large fraction of the AGN's radiation may be obscured by [[interstellar gas]] and [[interstellar dust|dust]] close to the accretion disc, but (in a steady-state situation) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband, most likely the infrared.

===Relativistic jets===
{{Main|Relativistic jet}}

[[File:M87 jet.jpg|right|thumb| 200px| Image taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] of a 5000-[[light-year]]-long jet ejected from the active [[Messier 87|galaxy M87]]. The blue [[synchrotron radiation]] contrasts with the yellow starlight from the host galaxy.]]

Some accretion discs produce jets of twin, highly [[collimated]], and fast outflows that emerge in opposite directions from close to the disc. The direction of the jet ejection is determined either by the angular momentum axis of the accretion disc or the spin axis of the black hole. The jet production mechanism and indeed the jet composition on very small scales are not understood at present due to the resolution of astronomical instruments being too low. The jets have their most obvious observational effects in the radio waveband, where [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] can be used to study the synchrotron radiation they emit at resolutions of sub-[[parsec]] scales. However, they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the [[synchrotron]] and the [[Compton scattering|inverse-Compton scattering]] process, and so AGN jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation.

===Radiatively inefficient AGN===
There exists a class of 'radiatively inefficient' solutions to the equations that govern accretion. The most widely known of these is the [[Advection Dominated Accretion Flow]] (ADAF),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In this type of accretion, which is important for accretion rates well below the [[Eddington limit]], the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole. Radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong AGN-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters, where otherwise we might expect high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Particle acceleration==
AGN are a candidate source of high and ultra-high energy [[cosmic rays]] ''(see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]])''.

==Observational characteristics==
There is no single observational signature of an AGN. The list below covers some of the features that have allowed systems to be identified as AGN.

* Nuclear optical continuum emission. This is visible whenever there is a direct view of the accretion disc. Jets can also contribute to this component of the AGN emission. The optical emission has a roughly power-law dependence on wavelength.
* Nuclear infra-red emission. This is visible whenever the accretion disc and its environment are obscured by gas and dust close to the nucleus and then re-emitted ('reprocessing'). As it is thermal emission, it can be distinguished from any jet or disc-related emission.
* Broad optical emission lines. These come from cold material close to the central black hole. The lines are broad because the emitting material is revolving around the black hole with high speeds causing a range of Doppler shifts of the emitted photons.
* Narrow optical emission lines. These come from more distant cold material, and so are narrower than the broad lines.
* Radio continuum emission. This is always due to a jet. It shows a spectrum characteristic of synchrotron radiation.
* X-ray continuum emission. This can arise both from a jet and from the hot corona of the accretion disc via a scattering process: in both cases it shows a power-law spectrum. In some radio-quiet AGN there is an excess of soft X-ray emission in addition to the power-law component. The origin of the soft X-rays is not clear at present.
* X-ray line emission. This is a result of illumination of cold heavy elements by the X-ray continuum that causes [[fluorescence]] of X-ray emission lines, the best-known of which is the iron feature around 6.4 [[keV]]. This line may be narrow or broad: [[Broad iron K line|relativistically broadened iron lines]] can be used to study the dynamics of the accretion disc very close to the nucleus and therefore the nature of the central black hole.

==Types of active galaxy==
It is convenient to divide AGN into two classes, conventionally called radio-quiet and radio-loud. Radio-loud objects have emission contributions from both the jet(s) and the lobes that the jets inflate. These emission contributions dominate the luminosity of the AGN at radio wavelengths and possibly at some or all other wavelengths. Radio-quiet objects are simpler since jet and any jet-related emission can be neglected at all wavelengths.

AGN terminology is often confusing, since the distinctions between different types of AGN sometimes reflect historical differences in how the objects were discovered or initially classified, rather than real physical differences.

===Radio-quiet AGN===             
* [[Low-ionization nuclear emission-line region]]s (LINERs). As the name suggests, these systems show only weak nuclear emission-line regions, and no other signatures of AGN emission. It is debatable{{By whom|date=May 2015}} whether all such systems are true AGN (powered by accretion on to a supermassive black hole). If they are, they constitute the lowest-luminosity class of radio-quiet AGN. Some may be radio-quiet analogues of the low-excitation radio galaxies (see below).
* [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]]. Seyferts were the earliest distinct class of AGN to be identified. They show optical range nuclear continuum emission, narrow and occasionally broad emission lines, occasionally strong nuclear X-ray emission and sometimes a weak small-scale radio jet. Originally they were divided into two types known as Seyfert 1 and 2: Seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while Seyfert 2s do not, and Seyfert 1s are more likely to show strong low-energy X-ray emission. Various forms of elaboration on this scheme exist: for example, Seyfert 1s with relatively narrow broad lines are sometimes referred to as narrow-line Seyfert 1s. The host galaxies of Seyferts are usually spiral or irregular galaxies.
* Radio-quiet [[quasar]]s/QSOs. These are essentially more luminous versions of Seyfert 1s: the distinction is arbitrary and is usually expressed in terms of a limiting optical magnitude. Quasars were originally 'quasi-stellar' in optical images as they had optical luminosities that were greater than that of their host galaxy. They always show strong optical continuum emission, X-ray continuum emission, and broad and narrow optical emission lines. Some astronomers use the term QSO (Quasi-Stellar Object) for this class of AGN, reserving 'quasar' for radio-loud objects, while others talk about radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. The host galaxies of quasars can be spirals, irregulars or ellipticals. There is a correlation between the quasar's luminosity and the mass of its host galaxy, in that the most luminous quasars inhabit the most massive galaxies (ellipticals).
* 'Quasar 2s'. By analogy with Seyfert 2s, these are objects with quasar-like luminosities but without strong optical nuclear continuum emission or broad line emission. They are scarce in surveys, though a number of possible candidate quasar 2s have been identified.

===Radio-loud AGN===
See main article [[Radio galaxy]] for a discussion of the large-scale behaviour of the jets. Here, only the active nuclei are discussed.

* Radio-loud quasars behave exactly like radio-quiet quasars with the addition of emission from a jet. Thus they show strong optical continuum emission, broad and narrow emission lines, and strong X-ray emission, together with nuclear and often extended radio emission.
* “[[Blazar]]s” ([[BL Lac object]]s and [[OVV quasar]]s) classes are distinguished by rapidly variable, polarized optical, radio and X-ray emission. BL Lac objects show no optical emission lines, broad or narrow, so that their redshifts can only be determined from features in the spectra of their host galaxies. The emission-line features may be intrinsically absent or simply swamped by the additional variable component. In the latter case, emission lines may become visible when the variable component is at a low level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Unification of AGN species==

Unified models propose that different observational classes of AGN are a single type of physical object observed under different conditions. The currently favoured unified models are 'orientation-based unified models' meaning that they propose that the apparent differences between different types of objects arise simply because of their different orientations to the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Radio-quiet unification===
At low luminosities, the objects to be unified are Seyfert galaxies. The unification models propose that in Seyfert 1s the observer has a direct view of the active nucleus. In Seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum, broad-line region or (soft) X-ray emission. The key insight of orientation-dependent accretion models is that the two types of object can be the same if only certain angles to the line of sight are observed. The standard picture is of a [[torus]] of obscuring material surrounding the accretion disc. It must be large enough to obscure the broad-line region but not large enough to obscure the narrow-line region, which is seen in both classes of object. Seyfert 2s are seen through the torus. Outside the torus there is material that can scatter some of the nuclear emission into our line of sight, allowing us to see some optical and X-ray continuum and, in some cases, broad emission lines—which are strongly polarized, showing that they have been scattered and proving that some Seyfert 2s really do contain hidden Seyfert 1s. Infrared observations of the nuclei of Seyfert 2s also support this picture.

At higher luminosities, quasars take the place of Seyfert 1s, but, as already mentioned, the corresponding 'quasar 2s' are elusive at present. If they do not have the scattering component of Seyfert 2s they would be hard to detect except through their luminous narrow-line and hard X-ray emission.

===Radio-loud unification===
Historically, work on radio-loud unification has concentrated on high-luminosity radio-loud quasars. These can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies in a manner directly analogous to the Seyfert 1/2 unification (but without the complication of much in the way of a reflection component: narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected X-ray component, although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission). The large-scale radio structures of these objects provide compelling evidence that the orientation-based unified models really are true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Criticism of the radio-quiet unification===
In the recent literature on AGN, being subject to an intense debate, an increasing set of observations appear to be in conflict with some of the key predictions of the Unified Model, e.g. that each Seyfert 2 has an obscured Seyfert 1 nucleus (a hidden broad-line region).

Therefore, one cannot know whether the gas in all Seyfert 2 galaxies is ionized due to photoionization from a single, non-stellar continuum source in the center or due to shock-ionization from e.g. intense, nuclear starbursts. Spectropolarimetric studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While it still might be valid that an obscured Seyfert 1 can appear as a Seyfert 2, not all Seyfert 2s must host an obscured Seyfert 1. Understanding whether it is the same engine driving all Seyfert 2s, the connection to radio-loud AGN, the mechanisms of the variability of some AGN that vary between the two types at very short time scales, and the connection of the AGN type to small- and large-scale environment remain important issues to incorporate into any unified model of active galactic nuclei.

==Cosmological uses and evolution==
For a long time, active galaxies held all the records for the highest-[[redshift]] objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum, because of their high luminosity. They still have a role to play in studies of the early universe, but it is now recognised that an AGN gives a highly biased picture of the "typical" high-redshift galaxy.

Most luminous classes of AGN (radio-loud and radio-quiet) seem to have been much more numerous in the early universe. This suggests  that massive black holes formed early on and that the conditions for the formation of luminous AGN were more common in the early universe, such as a much higher availability of cold gas near the centre of galaxies than at present. It also implies that many objects that were once luminous quasars are now much less luminous, or entirely quiescent. The evolution of the low-luminosity AGN population is much less well understood due to the difficulty of observing these objects at high redshifts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7418">'''Anxiety of Influence''' is a type of [[literary criticism]] established by [[Harold Bloom]] in 1973, in his book, ''[[The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry]]''. It refers to the psychological struggle of aspiring authors to overcome the anxiety posed by the influence of their literary antecedents.

== Theory ==

The theory of anxiety of influence is a theory applied principally to early nineteenth century romantic poetry. Its author, Harold Bloom, maintains that the theory has general applicability to the study of literary tradition, ranging from Homer and the Bible to [[Thomas Pynchon]] and [[Anne Carson]] in the 20th and 21st century. It is based primarily on Bloom's belief that there is no such thing as an original poem, that every new composition is simply a misreading or misinterpretation of an earlier poem and that influence is unavoidable and inescapable; all writers inevitably, to some degree, adopt, manipulate or alter and assimilate certain aspects of the content or subject matter, literary style or form from their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrams &amp; Harpham|2009|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate his point, Bloom quotes Oscar Wilde, noting that:

"Influence is simply transference of personality, a mode of giving away what is most precious to one's self, and its exercise produces a sense, and, it may be, a reality of loss. Every disciple takes away something from his master."&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to universally-held beliefs that the literary influence of precursors can provide a purely benevolent, inspirational platform for young, aspiring writers; Bloom deems that this influence provides entirely the opposite effect.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom}}{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that it proves detrimental; that this influence instills in young writers a type of unease, apprehension or anxiety as they psychologically struggle against past literary forebears to create something definitive and original and achieve literary recognition and success. Bloom equates this struggle to the Freudian family drama; particularly to the Oedipal complex and relationship of son to father, where the emerging writer is cast as the 'son' in a battle against the 'father'; a literary precursor.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; Bloom claims that this forces poets or authors into a type of 'creative misprision'; where they must distort the works of their literary masters in an attempt to create something revolutionary and innovative.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; The authors who triumph over this struggle are deemed 'strong', with some even receiving acclaim to the extent where the contemporary has the potential to transcend time, with some literary predecessors being read in terms of their contemporary successor. In contrast, writers who cannot prevail over this anxiety of influence are deemed 'weak', with their works regarded as markedly derivative and reminiscent of the works of earlier literary masters. Some great poets in which Bloom draws upon, who have overcome this anxiety of influence include Wordsworth, Shelley and Wallace Stevens.

== Effects on literature ==
In order to determine the effects of this theory on literature, Bloom has established the six "revisionary ratios", which are occasionally based on the model of Freud's defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-8"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ratios show the developmental stages of anxiety of influence in relation to the ways a poet or author misreads and deforms the work of a literary precursor in the composition of a literary text.&lt;ref name="Geddes"&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Clinamen'' – Bloom defines this as "poetic misreading or misprision proper".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author makes a swerve away from a precursor, alluding to the proposition that the original work was only precise and accurate up until a particular end; at which point, the successive author makes the corrective motion.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;  
* ''Tessera'' – Bloom defines this as "completion and antithesis".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author elaborates upon a precursor's work, maintaining the precursor's terms and ideas but constituting them in another sense, with the implication that the predecessor failed to take the argument far enough in the first instance&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Kenosis'' – Bloom defines this as a "breaking device similar to the defence mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author seeks a state of discontinuity, in the act of isolating themself from the influence of the precursor&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Daemonization'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement towards a personalised Counter-Sublime, in reaction to the precursor's Sublime".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author manipulates an apparent power of a precursor that they believe is superior to the precursor in an effort to dismiss the originality of the predecessor's work and perpetuate the greatness of their own.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Askesis'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement of self-purgation which intends the attainment of a state of solitude".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; In this process, the author diminishes both his own and his precursor's achievements, purging themself of all remnants of influence, with a rationale for independent, individual success and achievement.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Apophrades'' – Bloom defines this as the "return of the dead".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; The author is encumbered by his previous state of solitude and holds his work open for inspection with that of his predecessors&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; Geddes 1999). Instead of proving detrimental to the author, this instead has the effect of the successor overpowering the predecessor, with the predecessor's work being read in terms of the successor's work.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1322">An '''appeal to advantage''' is a [[rhetoric]]al device in which the speaker encourages his or her audience to perform some action by representing that action as being in the audience's best interest.

An appeal to advantage can also be a request from someone in a position of power to someone who is in a socially [[subordinate]] position; the request is specifically for the subordinate to perform an act contrary to the subordinate's wishes, such that the subordinate is forced to commit the act in order to satisfy a more significant need.  The appeal is specifically most expedient or advantageous to the person in power, but is also presented as forwarding the subordinate's interests in some significant way.

== Examples ==
* A client offers a government official a big amount of money, provided the official facilitates or gives a favorable decision on some transactions in which the client has some interest.
* A rich man offers to pay the hospital bills for a beautiful young girl's sick mother, provided that the girl chooses to become his mistress.
* A religious political leader offers a person a job, provided that the person joins his religion and accepts his beliefs.

A '''bottle crate''' or '''beverage crate''' is a [[Shipping container|container]] used for transport of [[Bottle|beverage containers]]. In the present day they are usually made of [[plastic]], but before the widespread use of plastic they tended to be made of wood or metal.

Beverage crates began to be made of [[HDPE]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=RL&gt;{{cite book|title=Retailing Logistics &amp;amp; Fresh Food Packaging|author1=Kerstin Gustafsson |author2=Gunilla Jonson |author3=Leigh Sparks |author4=David Smith |pages=79–80|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|date=2006|isbn=9780749446451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such crates can be long-lasting. In the 1980s in Sweden, a take-back campaign was organized, when 25-bottle crates were replaced by the more ergonomic 20-bottle crates.  Some of the crates returned for recycling had been in use since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=RL/&gt;

Because manufacturers avoid lead-based and cadmium-based pigmentations, in response to legislation and public opinion, they have had to resort to other methods of colouring HDPE crates. In Japan, since the early 1970s, HDPE bottle crates have been pigmented with a variety of [[perylene]], [[quinacridone]], [[azo compound|azo]] condensation, and [[Isoindoline]] pigments.  Japanese manufacturers have modified these in order to control [[nucleation|nucleating]] behaviour, and have improved weathering performance and impact-resistance properties by making the light-stabilisization systems more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|booktitle=Addcon '96: Worldwide Additives and Polymer Modifiers Conference, May 21–22 1996, Brussels|publisher=Rapra Technology Limited|title=Problems and Progress in Colouration Without Cadmium and Lead-Basd Pigments|author=Roger C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2710">'''Brinkler Classification''' is the [[library classification]] system  of [[Bartol Brinkler]] described in his article "The Geographical Approach to Materials in the Library of Congress Subject Headings".&lt;ref&gt;Brinkler, Bartol. The geographical approach to materials in the Library of Congress subject headings: report of a study project. s.l.: s.n., 1960. [Accession No: {{OCLC|3853830}}].&lt;/ref&gt; The geographical aspect of a subject may be conveyed through three types of headings labeled A, B, and C. Heading A uses a primary topical description with geographical subdivisions (e.g. Art—Paris).  Type B uses a place-name for the main heading with a topical subdivision (e.g. Paris—Description). C headings use a geographical description of a phrase (e.g. Paris Literature).  

Brinkler explores what type of heading is more useful to a [[patron]], and he finds that it depends on the level of familiarity a patron has with a topic and what approach they take when searching for resources on their topic. Ideally readers will either be looking for everything on a particular topic, or everything regarding a particular place. Bartol Brinkler investigates a system of classification that will best serve these two ideal types of patrons.  He finds working with Type A headings will best assist a patron who is more topic oriented, while using Type B headings is preferable for those who are primarily interested in one place. 

However this is problematic in practice. One possibility is to assign Type A and Type B headings to every resource, but the cataloguing cost would be high.  A system that aids readers regardless of their approach to a topic involves using cross-references (e.g. Canada—Botany, See Botany—Canada).  Admitting that see and see also references would require more work on the part of librarians, Bartol Brinkler notes that librarians must keep in mind "...readers do not have the same knowledge [of classification] and do need all the help they can get..."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

'''Chinese wall''' is a business term describing an information barrier within an organization that was erected to prevent exchanges or [[Organizational communication|communication]] that could lead to [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. For example, a Chinese wall may be erected to separate and isolate people who make investments from those who are privy to confidential information that could improperly influence the investment decisions. Firms are generally required by law to safeguard [[insider trading|insider information]] and ensure that improper trading does not occur.&lt;ref name=frier&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frier|first1=Sarah|title=Goldman Sachs Turns to Digital Surveillance to Catch Rogue Bankers|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-09/banks-invest-in-software-to-spot-rogue-behavior|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=9 October 2014|access-date=2014-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020000204/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-09/banks-invest-in-software-to-spot-rogue-behavior|archive-date=2014-10-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections to the term==

There have been disputes about the use of the term for some decades, particularly in the legal and banking sectors. The term can be seen both as culturally insensitive, and an inappropriate reflection on [[Great Wall of China|Chinese culture and trade]], which is now extensively integrated into the global market.
In ''[[KPMG|Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co.]] v. Superior Court'' (1988), Presiding Justice Harry W. Low, a [[Chinese American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hon. Harry W. Low (Ret.)|url=http://www.jamsadr.com/low/|website=[[JAMS (alternative dispute resolution)]]|accessdate=17 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021130023/http://www.jamsadr.com/low/|archive-date=2014-10-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a [[concurring opinion]] specifically in order "to express my profound objection to the use of this phrase in this context". He called the term a "piece of legal flotsam which should be emphatically abandoned", and suggested "ethics wall" as a more suitable alternative. He maintained that the "continued use of the term would be insensitive to the ethnic identity of the many persons of Chinese descent".&lt;ref name=Justia&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/200/272.html ''Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. v.

==Usage in specific industries==

===Finance===
A Chinese wall is most commonly employed in [[investment bank]]s, between the corporate-advisory area and the brokering department in order to separate those giving corporate advice on takeovers from those advising clients about buying shares.&lt;ref name=frier/&gt; The "wall" is thrown up to prevent leaks of corporate inside information, which could influence the advice given to clients making investments, and allow staff to take advantage of facts that are not yet known to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chinesewall.asp "Chinese Wall Definition"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026052936/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chinesewall.asp |date=2009-10-26 }}, Investopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|location = London|title = Equity finance banker: 'Don't underestimate the Japanese banks|first = Joris|last = Luyendijk|date = 3 February 2012|accessdate = 7 February 2012|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/feb/03/voices-of-finance-japanese-director-equity-finance|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130802014934/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/feb/03/voices-of-finance-japanese-director-equity-finance|archive-date = 2013-08-02|dead-url = no|df = }} see Australian case {{cite AustLII|FCA|963|2007|litigants=ASIC v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "already over the wall" is used by [[equity research]] personnel to refer to rank-and-file personnel who operate without the Chinese wall at all times. Examples include members of the Chinese wall department, most compliance personnel, attorneys and certain NYSE-licensed analysts. The term "over the wall" is used when an employee who is not normally privy to wall-guarded information somehow obtains sensitive information. Breaches considered semi-accidental were typically not met with punitive action during the heyday of the "[[Dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" era. These and other instances involving conflicts of interest were rampant during this era. A major scandal was exposed when it was discovered that research analysts were encouraged to blatantly publish dishonest positive analyses on companies in which they, or related parties, owned shares, or on companies that depended on the investment banking departments of the same research firms. The U.S. government has since passed laws strengthening the Chinese wall such as Title&amp;nbsp;V of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in order to prevent such conflicts of interest.

Chinese walls are also used in the [[corporate finance]] departments of the "[[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]]" and other large accountancy and financial services firms. They are designed to insulate sensitive documentation from the wider firm in order to prevent conflicts.

===Journalism===
The term is used in [[journalism]] to describe the separation between the editorial and [[advertising]] arms. The Chinese wall is regarded as breached for "[[advertorial]]" projects.

===Insurance===
The term is used in property and casualty insurance to describe the separation of claim handling where both parties to a claim (e.g. an airport and an airline) have insurance policies with the same insurer. The claim handling process needs to be segregated within the organisation to avoid a conflict of interest.

This also occurs when there is an unidentified or uninsured motorist involved in an auto collision. In this case, two loss adjusters will take on the claim - one representing the insured party and another representing the uninsured or unidentified motorist. While they both represent the same policy, they both must investigate and negotiate to determine fault and what if anything is covered under the policy. In this case, a Chinese wall is erected between the two adjusters.

===Law===
Chinese walls are used in [[law firm]]s when one part of the firm representing a party on a deal or [[litigation]] is separated from another part of the firm with contrary interests or with confidential information from an [[adverse party]]. Under [[United Kingdom|UK]] law, a firm may represent competing parties in a suit, but only in strictly defined situations and when individual fee earners do not act for both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Solicitors Regulation Authority |title=Rule 3: Conflict of interests |url=http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/code-of-conduct/rule3.page |work=SRA guidelines rule 3 |access-date=2011-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224013837/http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/code-of-conduct/rule3.page |archive-date=2011-02-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the use of "Chinese Walls" is no longer permitted except within very narrow exceptions. The [[American Bar Association]] [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] (2004) state: "While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the prohibited lawyer and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McMullan |first=James M. |url=http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/solo_lawyer_conflicts_ethics_client.html |title=How to Avoid Conflicts |publisher=Americanbar.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620023909/http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/solo_lawyer_conflicts_ethics_client.html |archive-date=2015-06-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ABA rules are only advisory, most [[U.S. state]]s have adopted them or have even stricter regulations in place.

===Computer science===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Clean room design]] --&gt;
In [[computer science]], the concept of a Chinese wall is used by both the operating system for [[computer security]] and the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|US judicial system]] for protection against copyright infringement. In computer security it concerns the software stability of the [[operating system]].  The same concept is involved in an important business matter concerning the ''licensing'' of each of a computer's many software and hardware components.

Any hardware component that requires direct software interaction will have a license for itself and a license for its software "driver" running in the operating system. [[Reverse engineering]] software is a part of computer science that can involve writing a [[driver (software)|driver]] for a piece of hardware in order to enable it to work in an operating system unsupported by the manufacturer of the hardware, or to add functionality or increase the performance of its operations (not provided by the manufacturer) in the supported operating system, or to restore the usage of a piece of computer hardware for which the driver has disappeared altogether. A reverse engineered driver offers access to development, by persons outside the company that manufactured it, of the general hardware usage.

====Reverse engineering====
There is a case-law mechanism called "[[clean room design]]" that is employed to avoid copyright infringement when [[reverse engineering]] a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] driver.

It involves two separate engineering groups separated by a Chinese wall. One group works with the hardware to reverse engineer what must be the original algorithms and only documents their findings. The other group writes the code, based only on that documentation.  Once the new code begins to function with tests on the hardware, it is able to be refined and developed over time.

This method insulates the new code from the old code, so that the reverse engineering is less likely to be considered by a jury as a [[derived work]].&lt;ref name="cleanroom"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/65532/Reverse_Engineering?pageNumber=1 |title=Reverse-Engineering |first=Mathew |last=Schwartz |date=2001-11-12 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |work=Computerworld |quote=To protect against charges of having simply (and illegally) copied IBM's BIOS, Phoenix reverse-engineered it using what's called a 'clean room,' or 'Chinese wall,' approach. First, a team of engineers studied the IBM BIOS—about 8KB of code—and described everything it did as completely as possible without using or referencing any actual code. Then Phoenix brought in a second team of programmers who had no prior knowledge of the IBM BIOS and had never seen its code. Working only from the first team's functional specifications, the second team wrote a new BIOS that operated as specified. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624214340/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/65532/Reverse_Engineering?pageNumber=1 |archive-date=2013-06-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hoviblog.blogspot.de/2008/10/clean-room-defeats-software.html |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2013-05-23 |first=Sean |last=Hogle |title=Clean Room Defeats Software Infringement Claim in U.S. Federal Court |quote=[...] dirty room reverse engineering should be done in conjunction with clean room development by using two physically and electronically isolated teams where one team does dirty room reverse engineering and the other does clean room development.

The dirty room engineers then use that request to create additional functional specifications or tests. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021145804/http://hoviblog.blogspot.de/2008/10/clean-room-defeats-software.html |archive-date=2014-10-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computer security====
The basic model used to provide both [[data privacy|privacy]] and [[data integrity|integrity]] for data is the "Chinese Wall Model" or the "[[Brewer and Nash Model]]". It is a [[computer security model|security model]] where read/write access to files is governed by membership of data in conflict-of-interest classes and datasets.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the phrase is the [[Great Wall of China]].&lt;ref name="Garner2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bryan A. Garner]]|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA152|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514236-5|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in the [[United States]] following the [[stock market]] [[crash of 1929]], when the U.S. government legislated information separation between [[investment bank]]ers and [[brokerage firm]]s, in order to limit the conflict of interest between objective company analysis and the desire for successful [[initial public offering]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Investopedia|title=The Chinese Wall Protects Against Conflicts Of Interest|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/090501.asp#axzz1mIc41gWQ|accessdate=13 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119154613/http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/090501.asp#axzz1mIc41gWQ|archive-date=2012-01-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than prohibiting one company from engaging in both businesses, the government permitted the implementation of Chinese wall procedures.

A leading note on the subject published in 1980 in the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'' titled "The Chinese Wall Defense to Law-Firm Disqualification" perpetuated the use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chinese Wall Defense to Law-Firm Disqualification" (1980) 128 ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]''. 677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;

The '''coefficient of performance''' or '''COP''' (sometimes '''CP''' or '''CoP''') of a [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle| heat pump, refrigerator or air conditioning system]] is a ratio of useful heating or cooling provided to work required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tetech.com/temodules/graphs/instructions.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124080037/http://www.tetech.com/temodules/graphs/instructions.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://us.grundfos.com/service-support/encyclopedia-search/cop-coefficient-ofperformance.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher COPs equate to lower operating costs.  The COP usually exceeds 1, especially in heat pumps, because, instead of just converting work to heat (which, if 100% efficient, would be a COP_hp of 1), it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required.  For complete systems, COP calculations should include energy consumption of all power consuming auxiliaries. COP is highly dependent on operating conditions, especially absolute temperature and relative temperature between sink and system, and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tetech.com/temodules/graphs/HP-199-1.4-0.8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107132318/http://www.tetech.com/temodules/graphs/HP-199-1.4-0.8.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equation ==
The equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm COP} = \frac{ Q}{ W}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; Q \ &lt;/math&gt; is the useful [[heat]] supplied or removed by the considered system.
* &lt;math&gt;W \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mechanical work|work]] required by the considered system.

The COP for heating and cooling are thus different, because the heat reservoir of interest is different. When one is interested in how well a machine cools, the COP is the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir to input work. However, for heating, the COP is the ratio  of the heat removed from the cold reservoir plus the input work to the input work:
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm heating}=\frac{| Q_{H}|}{ W}=\frac{| Q_{C}| +  W}{ W}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm cooling}=\frac{| Q_{C}|}{ W}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;  Q_{C} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the heat removed from the cold reservoir.
*&lt;math&gt;  Q_{H} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the heat supplied to the hot reservoir.

==Derivation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
According to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], in a reversible system we can show that &lt;math&gt;Q_{H}=Q_{C}+W &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W=Q_{H}-Q_{C}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q_{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the heat transferred to the hot reservoir and &lt;math&gt;Q_{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the heat collected from the cold reservoir.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, by substituting for W,&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm heating}=\frac{Q_{H}}{Q_{H}-Q_{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

For a heat pump operating at maximum theoretical efficiency (i.e. Carnot efficiency), it can be shown that 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{Q_{H}}{T_{H}}=\frac{Q_{C}}{T_{C}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_{C}=\frac{Q_{H}T_{C}}{T_{H}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T_{H} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{C}&lt;/math&gt; are the temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs respectively.
'''Note:''' these equations must '''use an absolute temperature scale''', for example, '''K'''elvin or '''R'''ankine.

At maximum theoretical efficiency, &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm heating}=\frac{T_{H}}{T_{H}-T_{C}} &lt;/math&gt;
which is equal to the reciprocal of the ideal efficiency for a heat engine, because a heat pump is a heat engine operating in reverse.  Similarly, &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm COP}_{\rm cooling}=\frac{Q_{C}}{Q_{H}-Q_{C}} =\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}-T_{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the COP of a heat pump depends on its duty. The heat rejected to the hot sink is greater than the heat absorbed from the cold source, so the heating COP is 1 greater than the cooling COP.

&lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm heating}&lt;/math&gt; applies to heat pumps and &lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm cooling}&lt;/math&gt; applies to air conditioners or refrigerators. For heat engines, see [[Thermodynamic efficiency|Efficiency]]. Values for actual systems will always be less than these theoretical maximums. In Europe, the standard tests for ground source heat pump units use 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95&amp;nbsp;°F) for &lt;math&gt;{T_{H}}&lt;/math&gt; and 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) for &lt;math&gt;{T_{C}}&lt;/math&gt;. According to the above formula, the maximum achievable COP would be 7.8.  Test results of the best systems are around 4.5. When measuring installed units over a whole season and accounting for the energy needed to pump water through the piping systems, seasonal COP's are around 3.5 or less. This indicates room for improvement.
&lt;ref&gt;Borgnakke, C., &amp; Sonntag, R. (2013). The Second Law of Thermodynamics. In Fundamentals of Thermodynamics (8th ed., pp. 244-245). Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Air source air conditioners efficiency is derivated from "dry bulb" air temperature  used 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) for &lt;math&gt;{T_{H}}&lt;/math&gt; and 7&amp;nbsp;°C (44.6&amp;nbsp;°F) for &lt;math&gt;{T_{C}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;According to European Union COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 626/2011 ANNEX VII Table 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improving COP==
As the formula shows, the COP of a heat pump system can be improved by reducing the temperature gap &lt;math&gt;T_{hot} &lt;/math&gt; minus &lt;math&gt;T_{cold}&lt;/math&gt; at which the system works. For a heating system this would mean two things: 1) reducing the output temperature to around {{convert|30|C|F}} which requires piped floor, wall or ceiling heating, or oversized water to air heaters and 2) increasing the input temperature (e.g. by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank &lt;ref&gt;Thermal banks and Thermal Energy Storage, http://www.icax.co.uk/ThermalBanks.html&lt;/ref&gt; ). Accurately determining [[thermal conductivity]] will allow for much more precise ground loop &lt;ref&gt;Soil Thermal Conductivity Survey, http://www.carbonzeroco.com/field-services/soil-thermal-conductivity-testing/&lt;/ref&gt; or borehole sizing,&lt;ref&gt;Vertical Borehole Sizing, http://www.carbonzeroco.com/ground-source-heat-pumps/ground-source-heating-cooling/&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system.  For an air cooler, COP could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air, and by reducing temperature drop on output side through increasing air flow. For both systems, also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps (and ventilators) by decreasing the speed of fluid which in turn lower the Re number and hence the turbulence (and noise) and the head loss (see [[hydraulic head]]). The heat pump itself can be improved by increasing the size of the internal heat exchangers which in turn increase the [[Heat pump#Efficiency|efficiency]] (and the cost) relative to the power of the compressor, and also by reducing the system's internal temperature gap over the compressor. Obviously, this latter measure makes such heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures which means that a separate machine is needed for producing hot tap water.

==Example==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012|comment=Note that the footnotes aren't refs}}

A [[geothermal heat pump]] operating at a &lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm heating}&lt;/math&gt; of 3.5 provides 3.5 units of heat for each unit of energy consumed (i.e. 1&amp;nbsp;kWh consumed would provide 3.5&amp;nbsp;kWh of output heat). The output heat comes from both the heat source and 1&amp;nbsp;kWh of input energy, so the heat-source is cooled by 2.5&amp;nbsp;kWh, not 3.5&amp;nbsp;kWh.

A heat pump with &lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm heating}&lt;/math&gt; of 3.5, such as in the example above, could be less expensive to use than even the most efficient gas furnace except in areas where the electricity cost per unit is higher than 3.5 times the cost of natural gas (e.g. [[Connecticut]] or [[New York City]]).

A heat pump cooler operating at a &lt;math&gt;{\rm COP}_{\rm cooling}&lt;/math&gt; of 2.0 removes 2 units of heat for each unit of energy consumed (e.g. an [[air conditioner]] consuming 1&amp;nbsp;kWh would remove 2&amp;nbsp;kWh of heat from a building's air).

Given the same energy source and operating conditions, a higher COP heat pump will consume less purchased energy than one with a lower COP. The overall environmental impact of a heating or air conditioning installation depends on the source of energy used as well as the COP of the equipment. The operating cost to the consumer depends on the cost of energy as well as the COP or efficiency of the unit. Some areas provide two or more sources of energy, for example, natural gas and electricity. A high COP of a heat pump may not entirely overcome a relatively high cost for electricity compared with the same heating value from natural gas.

For example, the 2009 US average price per therm ({{convert|100,000|BTU|kWh}}) of electricity was $3.38 while the average price per therm of natural gas was $1.16.&lt;ref&gt;Based on average prices of 11.55 cents per kWh for electricity [http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table5_3.html] and $13.68 per {{convert|1000|ft3|m3}} for natural gas [http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3010us3a.htm], and conversion factors of 29.308 kWh per therm and {{convert|97.2763|ft3|m3}} per therm [http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/science/energy_calculator.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Using these prices, a heat pump with a COP of 3.5 in moderate climate would cost $0.97&lt;ref&gt;$3.38/3.5~$0.97&lt;/ref&gt; to provide one therm of heat, while a high efficiency gas furnace with 95% efficiency would cost $1.22&lt;ref&gt;$1.16/.95~$1.22&lt;/ref&gt; to provide one therm of heat. With these average prices, the heat pump costs 20% less&lt;ref&gt;($1.16-$0.95)/$1.16~20%&lt;/ref&gt; to provide the same amount of heat. At 0&amp;nbsp;°F (-18&amp;nbsp;°C) COP is much lower. Then, the same system costs as much to operate as an efficient gas heater. The yearly savings will depend on the actual cost of electricity and natural gas, which can both vary widely.

==Conditions of use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
While the COP is partly a measure of the efficiency of a heat pump, it is also a measure of the conditions under which it is operating: the COP of a given heat pump will rise as the input temperature increases or the output temperature decreases because it is linked to a warm temperature distribution system like [[underfloor heating]].

== Seasonal efficiency ==
A realistic indication of energy efficiency over an entire year can be achieved by using Seasonal COP or Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCOP) for heat. [[Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER)]] is mostly used for air conditioning. SCOP is a new methodology that gives a better indication of expected real-life performance, using COP can be considered using the "old" scale. Seasonal efficiency gives an indication on how efficient a heat pump operates over an entire cooling or heating season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daikin.co.uk/binaries/Seer%20fact%20sheet%20stg2_tcm511-261046.pdf?quoteId= |title=A new era of Seasonal Efficiency has begun |publisher=Daikin |date= |website=Daikin.co.uk |access-date=31 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731084805/http://www.daikin.co.uk/binaries/Seer%20fact%20sheet%20stg2_tcm511-261046.pdf?quoteId= |archive-date=31 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparison diagram''' or '''comparative diagram''' is a general type of [[diagram]], in which a comparison is made between two or more objects, phenomena or groups of data.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Commission Resources, Inc (2002). ''Tools for Performance Measurement in Health Care: A Quick Reference Guide.'' p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison diagram or can offer qualitative and/or quantitative information. This type of diagram can also be called '''comparison chart''' or '''comparison chart.''' The diagram itself is sometimes referred to as a [[cluster diagram]].

== Overview ==
A comparison diagram is a general type of diagram, meaning a class of specific diagrams and charts, in which a comparison is made between two or more objects, phenomena or groups of data. They are a tool for [[visual comparison]].

When it comes to comparing data, five basic types of comparison can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Fill, Hans-Georg. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=tXHA1J-ankYC&amp;pg=PA62 Survey of Existing Visualisation Approaches]." in ''Visualisation for Semantic Information Systems.'' Gabler, 2009. 39-159.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comparison of components, for example the pieces of [[pie chart]]
* Item comparison, for example the bars in a [[bar chart]]  
* Time-series comparison, for example the bars in a [[histogram]] or the curve of a [[line chart]]
* Frequency distribution comparison, for example the distribution in a histogram or line chart
* Correlation comparison, for example in a specific [[dot diagram]]

Comparison diagrams can be used in [[research]] projects, to give an overview of existing possibilities and to [[Data validation|validate]] models.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Karl E. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JD900719/pdf Summarizing multiple aspects of model performance in a single diagram]." ''Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres'' (1984–2012) 106.D7 (2001): 7183-7192.  &lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in [[decision making]] in presenting alternatives for further selection. And it can be used in [[education]] to show the variety in a specific population.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Groessen Karte von Europa, 1785.jpg|thumb|Map with the sizes of European countries by [[August Friedrich Wilhelm Crome|August Crome]], 1785.]]
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Ideen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen nebst einem Naturgemälde der Tropenländer - 000012142.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Ideas for a geography of plants, together with a nature paintings of the tropics,''  1805.]] 
Comparison charts originate from the late 18th century and early 19th century. One of its roots are the 18th century [[nautical chart]], which could offer a comparison of shore or coastal profiles. These were made popular by the English cartographer and a publisher of maps [[William Faden]] (1749–1836).&lt;ref name="JAW 2009"&gt; Wolter, J. A., “[http://www.davidrumsey.com/blog/2009/9/5/heights-of-mountains-lengths-of-rivers The Heights of Mountains and the Lengths of Rivers]”. at davidrumsey.com/blog, 2009/9/5&lt;/ref&gt;

Another root of comparison diagrams are the earliest [[thematic map]]s. Late 18th century [[August Friedrich Wilhelm Crome]] published one of the first economic thematic map.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friendly, Michael]], and Daniel J. Denis. "[http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization]." ''Seeing Science: Today American Association for the Advancement of Science'' (2008). p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Anson, [[:nl:Ferdinand Jan Ormeling sr.|F. J. Ormeling]], International Cartographic Association (1993). ''Basic cartography for students and technicians.'' Vol. 1. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; His "Groessen Karte von Europa" from 1785 compared the sizes of all then existing European countries. This work inspired later scientist, such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;David N. Livingstone,Charles W. J. Withers. ''Geography and Enlightenment.'' 2010. p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas A. Rupke (2000), ''Medical History: Supplement.'' Nr. 20, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Dupin]] in France.&lt;ref name="GP 2007"&gt;[[Palsky, Gilles]]. "[http://belgeo.revues.org/11893?lang=en Connections and Exchanges in European Thematic Cartography. The case of XIXth century choropleth maps]." ''Formatting Europe. Mapping a continent.'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in their works. In France in 1872 [[Charles Louis de Fourcroy]] presented a similar diagram, which he named "Table Poléométrique" (Poleometric Table).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Palsky]] (1996): ''Des Chiffres et des Cartes,'' p.51-52; Translated by Daniel J. Denis. "[http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/fourcroy.html Des Cartes Generates Aux Cartes Spectates]" at ''euclid.psych.yorku.ca,'' April 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 19th century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] was one of the first to picture various cross sections of mountains, including for example the "limit of perpetual snows at different latitudes," or the different kinds of vegetation on different heights.&lt;ref&gt;Debarbieux, Bernard. "[http://cybergeo.revues.org/25488?lang=en The various figures of Mountains in Humboldt’s Science and Rhetoric]." Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this work was published in the 1914 "Atlas géographique et physique des régions équinoxiales du nouveau continent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b20000745 Illustrations de Voyage de Humboldt et Bonpland, première partie]. in ''Relation historique. Atlas géographique et physique du nouveau continent.'' at gallica.bnf.fr. Accessed 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1805 Von Humboldt had published a map (see image), entitled "Ideen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen nebst einem Naturgemälde der Tropenländer" (Ideas for a geography of plants, together with a nature paintings of the tropics) in which he made a comparison of the different types of plans in the tropics, and the heights on which they grew.

=== First comparative charts ===
[[File:1817 Thomson Map of the Comparative Heights of the World's Great Mountains - Geographicus - ComparativeMountains-thomson-1817.jpg|thumb|Thomson's Map of the Comparative Heights of the World's Great Mountains, 1817]]
In the 1810s the first formal comparative mountains charts emerged. Early examples are:
* Charles Smith's ''Comparative View of the Heights of the Principal Mountains &amp;c. In The World,'' published in London in 1816&lt;ref name="JAW 2009"/&gt;
* [[John Thomson (cartographer)|John Thomson]]'s ''A Comparative View of the Heights of the Principal Mountains and other Elevations in the World.'' published in the 1817 edition of Thomson's ''New General Atlas.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geographicus.com/blog/rare-and-antique-maps/the-evolution-of-the-comparative-mountains-and-rivers-chart-in-the-19th-century/ The Evolution of the Comparative Mountains and Rivers Chart in the 19th Century] at ''geographicus.com''. Accessed Nov. 4, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1826 Finley Comparative Map of the Principle Rivers of the World - Geographicus - Rivers-finley-1827.jpg|thumb|Finley's ''Comparative Map of the Principle Rivers of the World,'' 1826.]]
Another popular subject became the comparative views of the lengths of the principal rivers in one country or from all over the world. In 1822 [[William Home Lizars]] presented a map, entitled "Comparative View of the Lengths of the Principal Rivers of Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1822_-_William_Home_Lizars_-_Comparative_View_of_the_Lengths_of_the_Principal_Rivers_of_Scotland.jpg "Comparative View of the Lengths of the Principal Rivers of Scotland."] by William Home Lizars, 1822.&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1826 
Anthony Finley (1790–1840) published a "Comparative Map of the Principle Rivers of the World." 

Other types of comparison charts would soon appear. For example, the "Comprehensive atlas: geographical, historical &amp; commercial," published by [[William D. Ticknor]] in 1835 contained a series of different comparison diagrams and charts on:&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Thomas Gamaliel.'' [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24189772M/Comprehensive_atlas Comprehensive A Comprehensive Atlas: Geographical, Historical, &amp; Commercial]. JH Wilkins &amp; RB Carter., 1835.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Size of Continents, Oceans, Islands
* Heights of Mountains 
* Lengths of Rivers 
* Size of animal 
* Size of planets 
* Heights of monuments 
* Height of edifices
* Different countries
Other popular themes in 19th century comparison diagrams were the sizes of lakes, the lengths of waterfalls, and the sizes of Islands.

One of the first maps to compare the lengths of rivers was the "Map of the Principal Rivers Throughout the World. Comparative Lengths of the Principal Rivers throughout the World." by the political economist [[Henry Charles Carey]] and [[Isaac Lea]] published their 1822 "A Complete Historical, Chronological, and Geographical American Atlas."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~774~70048:Principal-Rivers-Throughout-The-Wor here]&lt;/ref&gt; In this maps the lengths of the rivers, were presented in a [[bar chart]] with horizontal bars. In 1826 the same data was presented in a bar chart with vertical bars, entitled "Table of the comparative lengths of the principal Rivers throughout the World" (see image).  

=== 20th century ===
In his ''Graphic methods for presenting facts.'' [[Willard C. Brinton]] was one of the first to theorize about the existence and role or comparison in [[statistical graphics]]. He stipulated that "the graphic method lends itself admirably to use in making comparisons. It is surprising how much clearer even simple comparisons of only two or three items will appear when their numerical value is put in graphic form rather than in figures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Brinton, Willard Cope]]. ''Graphic methods for presenting facts.'' Engineering magazine company, 1917. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Brinton showed over a dozen different types of diagrams, which could make simple comparison, and devoted another chapter on comparisons over time.

== Types of comparison diagrams ==
There are different types of comparison diagrams called comparison diagram/chart in theory and practice, such as
* [[Table (information)|Table]], data visualized in a tabular form
* Matrix based models, for example the [[balanced scorecard]]
* Quantitative charts such as [[line chart]], [[bar chart]], [[pie chart]], [[radar chart]], [[bubble chart]], [[scatter diagram]] etc. 
* Scale comparison diagram
* Comparison map or comparative map.

The "'''Cool S'''", also known as '''Superman S''', '''Stüssy S''', '''Super S''', '''Pointy S'''&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web |title=That 'S' Thing Everyone Drew in School, WHAT IS IT? |url=https://www.vice.com/en_se/article/that-s-thing-everyone-drew-in-school-what-is-it |website=Vice |date=23 July 2016 |accessdate=29 January 2017 |first=Julian |last=Morgans |quote=people have been drawing this S long before Stussy was established}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Graffiti S'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drawingnow.com/drawings/100332/how-to-make-one-graffiti-s/|title=how to make one graffiti S|website=DrawingNow DrawingNow|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as many other names, is a [[graffiti]] signature of [[popular culture]] that is typically [[doodle]]d on children's notebooks or graffitied on walls.

==Shape==
[[File:"Cool S" Drawing Instructions.svg|thumb|right|A guide to drawing the "Cool S"]]

The Cool S consists of 14 line segments, forming a stylized, pointed [[S (letter)|S]]-shape. The tails of the S appear to link underneath so that it loops around on itself in the same way as the [[infinity symbol]] does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Local Investigates: The Mysterious S Symbol |url=https://nyulocal.com/local-investigates-the-mysterious-s-symbol-9254626b8225#.9jqdl0p67 |website=NYU Local |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cool S has no [[reflection symmetry]], but has 2-fold [[rotational symmetry]] and [[tessellation|tessellates]] with squares. As illustrated, a common way to draw the shape begins with two sets of three parallel, vertical lines, one above the other.

==Origin==
The origin of the Cool S is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Neelson |first1=Caleb |title=Solve the Mystery of the Pointy S |url=http://www.printmag.com/imprint/solve-the-mystery-of-the-pointy-s/ |website=Print Magazine |accessdate=29 January 2017 |date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Superman S' comes from a belief that it was a symbol for [[Superman]], whose costume features a stylised S in a diamond shape, but that shape is quite different. Similarly, the name 'Stussy S' is from a theory that it might be a symbol of the American surfwear company [[Stüssy]].&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

'''Democracy and Desire''' (also ''Democracia y Deseo'') is an evolutionary exhibition project by artist [[Per Hüttner]] that develops as it travels. It has been shown in various public and private venues in [[Europe]] since November 2006. The project takes its inspiration from [[Zen Buddhist]] [[Koan]]s by pairing the incompatible words democracy and desire. The project investigates how the intellectual freedom of the mind is connected to, [[:wikt:inhibition|inhibited]] by [[social order]] and how the human body can both support and undermine the search for mental and [[social liberty]] through social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner, "The Pain of Realising a Dream", p. 43, Reflejos culturales de Europa en España, The Embassy of Germany in Madrid, Madrid, 2007 {{ISBN|92-79-03260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project uses different forms of interactions with the public to change as it travels, drawing on Hüttner's previous experiences with exhibitions like [[I am a Curator]].&lt;ref name="Introdictionary"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preparatory research for the project, the artist was collaborating with a group of young creators called ''The Mob'' working within the framework of visual art research network [[Vision Forum (art organisation)|Vision Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforum.eu/index.html Official Vision Forum website]&lt;/ref&gt; They set up an interactive website to collect material from the public and a wide variety of audiences. The website has since been closed, but much of the material that was gathered, is available in the catalogue that was published in conjunction with the second incarnation of the exhibition project.

==The First Public Incarnation==
On November 23, 2006 the first version of ''Democracy and Desire'' opened to the public at the gallery ''[[Vacio 9]]''&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/instInfo/inst/4946/lang/1 Vacio 9 on Artfacts.net]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The exhibition consisted solely of photographic work by Hüttner. But throughout the run of the exhibition, ''The Mob'' organized various public events that were open for audience participation; a night of performances with local and international artists like [[Julio Jara]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/artistInfo/artist/91400/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Arean]], [[Nuria Mora]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuriamora.com/home_eng.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anita Wernström]], [[Jean-François Robardet]] and [[Marie Husson]]; video screenings with [[video art]] from around the globe and various semi-private training programs particularly related to [[gender]] issues.

The photographic work, that was also the point of departure for the public events, was clearly inspired by the life and work by [[Francisco Goya]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/painting/spanish-painting/goya-and-18th-century-painting/&lt;/ref&gt; both in expression and in content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artreview.com/profiles/blog/show?id=1474022%3ABlogPost%3A3003 Interview with Hüttner in Art Review]&lt;/ref&gt; Hüttner used the contradictory relationship between political powers and private desires that can be seen in many of the great master's paintings and created images that investigated the relationship between us as individual human beings and the interacting systems that surrounds us.&lt;ref&gt;Pleins Phares, Fabienne Fulcheri, Musée National Collection Schlumpf, Mulhouse, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-7541-0250-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a text dedicated to the exhibition it is stated&lt;ref&gt;''Slashseconds'' issue 001/004, [[London]], [[UK]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;" Some images in the series depict the traces of great [[Despotism|despots’]] megalomania or locations where books have been burned and innocent people have been killed. All the same, these places have witnessed marriages being consumed and great loves being born. Democracy and Desire acknowledges that the system is not the same as the people who perpetuate it. It asks to what degree our lives change when the political system changes and who are the people responsible for these changes? More importantly, however, it asks to what degree the system changes when the people within it change? When you grow as a human being, what does that mean for the powers in your [[town]], [[city]] or [[country]]?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The quote shows how clearly the artist is influenced by [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze’s]] assemblage theory and its impact on [[social ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity]], [[Manuel DeLanda]], (Continuum, New York, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-8264-8170-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between individuals and social structure in the public space in Hüttner's earlier work became the impetus for Democracy and Desire. French writer [[Laurent Devèze]] has written about the 2006 exhibition ''Repetitive Time'' and the constant re-negotiation between the two becomes evident.:&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: ''Repetitive Time'', 2006, 116 pages including 30 colour plates, texts by Lena Boëthius, Laurent Devèze, Claire Canning and Stéphanie Nava, language: English, design by Henrik Gistvall. Published by ''Göteborgs Konstmuseum''. {{ISBN|91-631-7127-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Little by little, by stopping us running around even for a short moment in time, we are forced to think about the past. Or rather to reflect on the whole paradigm of a memorial: an object built in a space specifically to remind us of something that happened at a moment in time. It is this that gives your [Hüttner's] altars such a strange intensity. They hold no indication to help us understand what they represent. Was a man killed here? Did something strange or extravagant take place here, something interesting enough to be remembered? The question is pertinent because, in our old cities overburdened with history, it is very likely that any and every point could be marked: here, a man died; here, a traffic accident occurred; here, a divorce was maybe agreed or a marriage proposal was accepted or some secret love affair was begun. It is a vertiginous thought: every point in the spaces that surround us has to be remembered; they are all worthy of it. There is not a single inch in the urban landscape that, if looked at through the prism of the past, should not be remembered. Which means that we could easily be surrounded by innumerable memorials, since everywhere we turn, something happened, something essential to someone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This goes hand in hand with [[Manuel DeLanda|Manuel DeLanda's]] definition of the [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The ontological status of any assemblage, inorganic, organic or social, is that of a unique singular, historically [[contingent]], individual. Although the term 'individual' has come to refer to individual persons, in its ontological sense it cannot be limited to that limit scale of reality. Much as biological species are not general categories of which [[animal]] and [[plant]] organisms are members, but larger-scale individual entities of which organisms are component parts, so larger social assemblages should be given the ontological status of individual entities: individual networks and coalitions; individual organizations and governments; individual cities and nation states. This ontological [[manœuevre]] allows us to assert that all these individual entities have an objective existence independently of our minds (or of our concepts of them) without any commitment to essences or reified generalities.&lt;ref&gt;[[A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity]], [[Manuel DeLanda]], (Continuum, New York, 2006) p. 40, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-8170-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2007 the second version of ''Democracy and Desire'' opened at the ''[[Romanian Cultural Institute]]''&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.icr.ro/vechiulicr/filiale/evenimente_a.php?cod_filiala=28&amp;cod=419 RKIS website (Swedish only)]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and included public talks and discussions. For the exhibition the artist had created a series of drawings that were specially made to accompany each photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/worksonpaper/worksonpaper_8.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; The work on paper underlined the search for personal freedom of the mind in spite of social conventions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/worksonpaper/worksonpaper_9.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; by focusing on how [[imagination]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/worksonpaper/worksonpaper_10.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[creativity]] can liberate [[Human|human beings]]. The work is greatly influenced by Soviet/Russian literary critic [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“What is the character of these ornaments? They impressed the connoisseurs by the extremely fanciful, free and playful treatment of [[plant]], [[animal]] and [[human]] forms. These forms seemed interwoven as if given birth to each other. The borderlines that divide the kingdoms of nature in the normal world were boldly infringed. Neither was there the usual static presentation of reality. There was no longer the movement of finished forms, vegetable or animal, in a finished and stable world; instead the inner movement of being itself was expressed in the passing of one form into the other, in the ever incompleted character of being. This ornamental interplay revealed an extreme lightness and freedom of artistic fantasy, a gay, almost laughing, libertinage.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Rabelais and his World]], p. 32, 1984, [[Indiana University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The drawings presupposes a kind of timeless [[Carnival]] where the social roles were turned upside down. The work and also suggests, just like Bakhtin writes that the whole paradigm of [[temporality]] needs to be reformulated for humans to achieve freedom. But the images also connected back to Goya's work. Human violence was introduced as possible and darker form of liberator and thus raising issues of the relationship between victim and perpetrator. The artist writes in the catalogue&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: ''Democracy and Desire'', 2007, 158 pages (A3) including 10 colour fold out pages. Languages: English, Swedish, Spanish and Romanian. Design by ''Åbäke''. Published by ''Vacio 9'' and ''The Romanian Cultural Institute''. {{ISBN|978-91-633-0548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;" We cannot continue to ignore the presence of our violent drives. Culture, conscience, and rationality cannot suppress the violence that is inscribed into our genes. Marlon Brando’s rendering of [[Colonel Kurtz]] in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/&lt;/ref&gt; virtually incorporates all these principles or at least what can happen in an extreme situation when they have been repressed for too long. The final section of the film, which you might describe as a contemporary filmic paraphrase on Goya’s ''[[Disasters of War]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://goya.unizar.es/InfoGoya/Work/Desastres.html&lt;/ref&gt; is an incredibly forceful investigation to humanity’s relationship to violence. Kurtz is a violent madman and is on the one hand so appealing and on the other incredibly repulsive. His acceptance of his violent drives approaches or embraces insanity. He asks Willard, the man who will shortly kill him, 'Have you ever considered any real freedoms, freedoms from the opinion of others, even the opinions of yourself?' Those are crucial words from one ruthless warrior to another – but even more so for the artist. If the artist is not liberated from his or her inhibitions, it is also impossible for the audience to live a moment of freedom, since the humanness of the artist is veiled by doubts."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner invited a group of young Swedish artists to create performances, film screenings and discussions to go along with the installation. After two months of preparations, the group declined the offer and opted to create a parallel exhibition at with the same title at [[Museet för Glömska]]&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.museetforglomska.se  Museet för Glömska website (Swedish only)]&lt;/ref&gt; (The museum of Forgetting) in the neighbouring town of [[Norrköping]].  The exhibition's [[curator]], [[Giorgiana Zachia]] responded by arranging a series of discussions at the gallery that included the artist and fellow curator [[Niclas Östlind]].

==Another Format of Democracy and Desire==
[[File:Per.huttner.Installation.freidrichsafen.jpg|thumb|right|''Membrane - Democracy and Desire'', 2008&lt;br&gt;Wall-painting and photography, installation view, Nothing to declare, 4th. Oberschwaben Contemporary Art Triennial, Friedrichshafen, Germany.]]

For ''Nothing to declare, 4th. [[Oberschwaben]] Contemporary Art Triennial''&lt;ref&gt;http://media.region-fn.de/triennale/web-content/11_Kuenstlerseiten/Huettner_Per.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Friedrichshafen]] in [[Germany]], English Curator [[Barnaby Drabble]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drabblesachs.org/notebook/D62E0F63-4372-4444-A828-62D4B3283EBA.html&lt;/ref&gt; asked the artist to develop the themes from ''Democracy and Desire’s'' second incarnation. The artist responded to this invitation by creating an installation using photos from the project along with new drawings. The photographs dialogue with the large mural drawings, further underlined the contradictions between the private and public realities depicted. They filtered out the individual's alienation to its own surroundings and the cultural clashes that we are faced with in contemporary life. The [[curator]] writes&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby Drabble, ''Nothing to Declare'', Verlag für Moderne Kunst Nürneberg, {{ISBN|978-3-940748-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;" In many of the works the artist appears to stage his own ‘otherness’ proposing the modern city and the thinking behind [[modernism]], as the backdrop against which this [[theatre]] of [[Social alienation|alienation]] is being played out."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In keeping with the conceptual foundation for the project,&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner, "The Pain of Realising a Dream", p. 41, Reflejos culturales de Europa en España, The Embassy of Germany in Madrid, Madrid, 2007 {{ISBN|92-79-03260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he created drawings that worked like contemporary, western [[shanshui]] paintings underlining the artist's interest in issues of alienation and inclusion. Trees drawn in the ink of modern, urban [[graffiti]] were metamorphosing into [[aeroplane]]s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/installation/8.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; and then back into a wooden ladders in a stand-still [[morphing]] of traditional [[eastern art]]. The trees, connected to the mountains, paths and rivers depicted in the photographs. The clear references to traditional Chinese painting &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/installation/6.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt; underlines the fact that Hüttner's focus never strays far from the human mind and how philosophy shapes the formulation of our reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perhuttner.com/pic/installation/7.html See example]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2008-09 Presentation==

[[File:per.huttner.Installation.abecita.jpg|thumb|right|''Some other Histories of Democracy and Desire'', 2008&lt;br&gt;Wall-painting and vinyl lettering, installation view at Abecita Konstmuseum.]]

[[File:per.huttner.Installation.abecita2.jpg|thumb|right|''Some other Histories of Democracy and Desire'', 2008&lt;br&gt;Wall-painting and vinyl lettering, installation view at Abecita Konstmuseum.]]

The relationship to Zen koans was developed in the third version of the project at ''[[Abecita Konstmuseum]]'' in [[Borås]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=28160&amp;int_modo=1&lt;/ref&gt; Here Hüttner returned to taking inspiration from contemporary ideas in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. He did so in a very free and creative way, just like he had done in his work from the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Elias Arnér and Per Hüttner,” Tom Sandqvist, Siksi, January 1993, Helsinki, Finland&lt;/ref&gt; By mixing theories from contemporary science with reflections on the life quality of our [[existence]], he delved deeper into paradox and the possibility to develop sense from the absurd. Hüttner imagined alternative pasts and through that alternative futures for democracy and desire in a [[mural painting]]. Poetic texts were connected to a band of monchrome colour fields that went around the circumference of the [[museum]].&lt;ref name="Realism p 2009"&gt;(Anti)Realism p.57-58, D'Ailleurs (Mobile), Mumero 1, Ecole Regional des Beaux Arts De Besançon, November 2009, {{ISBN|978-2-9518588-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from the short texts include:  "The Democracy of Orgasm Act is enforced (Europe and Asia 2058-2122 AD)" and "A few hunters and gatherers discuss why their alpha male is such an idiot (Europe 8314 BC)." The visual impression of the work was very scientific and rational. But the content was filled with absurd and paradoxical suggestions related to potential future and past events related to democracy and desire respectively. The mural dialogued with the drawings and photographs and raised questions about time and temporality's role in paradoxes.

==Love in the Age of Postponed Democracy/Behavior Workshop for Idiots==
[[File:Love.in the.age.jpg|thumb|right|Installation view from Kunsthalle Luzern showing the second version of ''Some other Histories of Democracy and Desire'', 2009&lt;br&gt;Wall-painting and vinyl lettering.]]
[[File:Idiot.workshop.dyd.low.jpg|thumb|right| Mari Brellochs, Kunstfabrik Flutgraben, Berlin; Fatos Üstek, curator, critic, London; ; Yane Calovski, Press-to-exit, Skopje and Hristina Ivanoska, Press-to-exit, Skopje during the Democracy and Desire performance during the Behavior Workshop for Idiots, Luzern; Switzerland May 2009]]

In May and June 2009 Lillian Fellman, director of Kunsthalle Luzern &lt;ref&gt;http://kunsthalleluzern.ch&lt;/ref&gt; organized “Behavior Workshop for Idiots” and the exhibition “Love in the Age of Postponed Democracy”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.likeyou.com/en/node/12308
&lt;/ref&gt; For the latter Hüttner showed a new version of “Some Other Histories of Democracy and Desire”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kunsthalleluzern.ch/downloads/Love_Pressetext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the texts had been both developed and translated into German. The approach to Zen Koans in this form was much less austere. The content was pushed towards a more blatant idiocy, humour and with a further shift to the carnivalesque and holding back the mysterious and nonsensical approach of the Buddhists. The contrast between the cool appearance of the installation and absurd content of the texts shows that the artist takes a more positive and proactive approach to the issues at hand. He moves further in the research to see how contemporary science and its outlook on temporality can be used to inspire life and art.&lt;ref name="Realism p 2009"/&gt;

The artists and curators: Fatos Ustek,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nowiswere.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Hristina Ivanoska,&lt;ref name="presstoexit.org.mk"&gt;http://www.presstoexit.org.mk/&lt;/ref&gt; Yane Calovski,&lt;ref name="presstoexit.org.mk"/&gt;  Mari Brellochs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kunstfabrik.org/archives.html&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Heta,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stacion.org/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sixten Kai Nielsen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wooloo.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Rosengaard]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wooloo.org&lt;/ref&gt; participated in the workshop which dealt with many of the issues treated in the previous incarnations of Democracy and Desire. Hüttner also arranged a collaborative performance with the other participants. They were each given a copy of the catalogue of the exhibition and were asked to find alternative ways to read the catalogue while traversing the town and then climbing a mountain. Each participant found a different way to approach the task. Mari Brellochs for instance cut the entire catalogue into heart-shaped messages and gave them to people and left them in strategically chosen places in nature.

==La Caméra horloge, 2012==
Within the framework of the Nordic festival [[Les Boréales]] in [[Normandy]] in France, Per Hüttner showed a new incarnation of the project at [[Le Radar]] in [[Bayeux]].&lt;ref&gt;Les Boréales un festival du nord 2012, p.29, Le Centre régional des Lettres de Basse-Normandie, Caen, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition brought together a large number of the original photographs with more recent video work thus moving the focus to [[temporality]] like the title suggests (The Timekeeping Camera). In the press release the curator underlines that the core questions of Democracy and Desire remain and yet find that they are reformulated with more focus on time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.le-radar.fr/programmation/expositions-passeesThe Gallery's official Website (French only)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"While destabilizing the eye, the artist opens for other interpretations when he compares the title of the exhibition to a [[Koan]], a deliberately confusing formula for the enlightenment of [[Zen]] monks. The observer is invited to take on a challenge, to move beyond appearances to reach a deeper awareness of the world by means of exploring the photographs on display. Per Hüttner voluntarily invites the visitor to update his or her subjectivity by discovering the conditions of any perception of reality. Time and space become measurement standards that allow the personal to aid to appreciate the beauty of the changing the world around them. Yet his photographs reveal the fleetingness and infinite in [[paradox]]. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]], feelings and [[reason]] coexist, but not without friction. Indeed his photographs raise questions of enigmatic and spiritual nature while at the same time investigating scientific concepts such as [[space-time continuum]] and [[quantum physics]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publication==

A catalogue with the title ''Per Hüttner: Democracy and Desire'' designed by international design group ''Åbäke''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myspace.com/abakespace&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2007. It uses the special typeface developed by [[Thomas Moore]] for his ''[[Utopia]]'' on the cover as well in the pages of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: ''Democracy and Desire'', 2007, 158 pages (A3) including 10 colour fold out pages. Languages: English, Swedish, Spanish and Romanian. Design by ''Åbäke''. Published by ''Vacio 9'' and ''The Rumanian Cultural Institute''. {{ISBN|978-91-633-0548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. Which was developed from a collaboration with [[Dent-de-Leone]] and [[Aurélien Froment]] where the entire 1516 [[novel]] is set in the typeface developed by Moore &lt;ref&gt;http://abake.fr/_/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Utopiainutopia.png&lt;/ref&gt; and thus virtually impossible to read.&lt;ref&gt;http://dentdeleone.co.nz/books/utopia-utopia?page=3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dimanche.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dimanche'', 1960]]
'''''Dimanche''''' (''Sunday''), also known as '''''Dimanche - Le Journal d'un Seul Jour''''' (''Sunday - The Newspaper for Only One Day'') is an [[artist's book]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]]. Taking the form of a 4-page Sunday [[broadsheet]], the piece was published on Sunday 27 November 1960 and sold on newsstands throughout [[Paris]] for one day only, as well as being handed out at a press conference held by Klein at the Galerie Rive Droite at 11.00am on the same day.

An early example of [[conceptual art]], it is most famous for being the first time that the photo-montage commonly known as ''The Leap Into The Void'' was published.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Dimanche combines appropriation, performance, actionism, conceptual art, and photo-montage all in one, and hints at this range of art movements just then coming into existence. It takes the form of a one-day newspaper, designed as an alternative to the regular Sunday paper, and includes texts and visual works by Klein, including his manifesto, "Theatre du Vide" (Theater of the Void). The photograph, captioned "Un homme dans l'espace" (A man in open space) depicts the artist leaping from his dealer's second-story window into the void. It inspired numerous artists to explore their bodies as a medium for art.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/84870/dimanche Artsconnected.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The festival of avant-garde art==
[[Image:Klein-newsstand.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A parisian news stand selling ''Dimanche'', November 27, 1960]]
The work was part of the second ''Festival d’Art d’Avant-Garde'' (''Festival of Avant-garde Art'') at the Palais des Expositions, Porte de Versailles, Paris. Taking the form of a parody of the French newspaper 'Journal du Dimanche', the Sunday edition of [[France Soir]], the book presents Klein’s ideas about the ''Théâtre du Vide'' (''Theatre of the Void'') and was the first time the famous photo ''Un Homme Dans L’Espace-Le Peintre de l’Espace se Jette Dans le Vide!'' (''Man In Space! The Painter of Space Throws Himself into The Void!'') was published.

According to Klein, the intention was to declare the entire 24-hour period an international theatrical happening, 'a holiday, a veritable spectacle of the void, at the culminating point of my theories.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Dimanche&lt;/ref&gt;' Merging art and life seamlessly, Klein's theatre would encapsulate each spectator's life as they lived it on that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coskunfineart.com/biography.asp?artistID=35 Yves Klein (1928 - 1962 - Biographical information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand copies were printed and distributed to news stands throughout Paris, with the help of Klein's friends. The artwork cost 0.35 [[French franc#The new franc|Francs]] and sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book itself==

===The ''Leap into the Void''===
The most famous section of the book was the photographic collage, published with the caption 'The painter of space throws himself into the void! &lt;ref&gt;French; 'Le peintre de l'espace se jette dans le vide'&lt;/ref&gt;' but usually known as the ''Leap Into The Void''. This photomontage, taken by [[Harry Shunk]], was montaged from a number of photos. The leap itself took place at 3 Rue Gentil Bernard, Fontenay-Aux_Roses, in October 1960, using about a dozen [[Judoka]]s from a Judo School opposite, holding a large tarpaulin to land on.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p220&lt;/ref&gt; Klein himself was a 4th Dan Judo Master. Shunk then montaged a shot of the empty street onto the photo. In fact there were 3 versions of this photo produced; one with Klein’s 2CV was never used; the one with a train and a cyclist was used for Dimanche; the third with an empty street and without the train was requested by Klein himself the next day to be used in the forthcoming catalogue for his retrospective at [[Krefeld]]. This strategy of employing two versions of the same montage, effectively bringing attention to the deception was typical of Klein's artistic strategy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am the painter of Space. I am not an abstract painter but, on the contrary, a figurative and realist painter. Let's be honest, in order to paint space, I must put myself on the spot, in space itself." Yves Klein, quoted underneath the photo 'Man In Space' on the front cover of Dimanche&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p217&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Theatre of the Void''===
As well as declarations of intent, the book contains a series of theatre pieces, ''Théâtre du Vide'' (''Theatre of the Void'') that prefigure various [[Fluxus|Fluxus scores]] of a kind that would later come to be known as [[happenings]].
Pieces contained within the book include;

''Sleep''; The setting is a bedroom. The scene opens with a man asleep in a big bed. The actor must really be sleeping. Each performance lasts about 10 minutes and in silence. There is to be applause at the end.

''Inversion''; For one performance, any play will be presented upside down. All the actors will have their feet on the ceiling and their heads hanging down. This will be possible by trickery. All the furniture will also be on the ceiling, which will really be the floor. A chandelier will therefore levitate in space.

''The Five Rooms''; In order to promote the feeling and matter without the intermediary of energy,  spectators pass through 5 rooms, their feet bound by ball and chain. 9 monochrome blue paintings of the same format are in the first room; the second room is empty and entirely white; nine monogold paintings of the same format are in the third room; the fourth room is empty and dark, almost black; 9 monopink paintings of the same format are in the fifth room.

''From Dizziness to Prestige''; Having practiced levitation and attempted a kind of purifying sublimation by which he would free himself from the exasperation of the ego, and having created or proposed various aerostatic sculptures that were free from the enslavement of pedestals, Klein presents himself on stage stretched out in space a few meters above the ground for 5 or 10 minutes. The performance takes place without commentary.

These pieces hover between the possible and the imaginary, establishing that the pieces aren’t meant to exist literally, but in the mind of the reader. This prefigures many of the concerns of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name="weitemeier"&gt;Klein By Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contained a b/w reproduction of an [[International Klein Blue]] monochrome painting, and some sketches of [[Judo]] manoeuvres.

Whilst some of the pieces relate to earlier writings and statements by Klein, most were written in a hectic four-day period immediately prior to publication, in a bar with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Kantz&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Joseph Kosuth]] hailed him as the father of conceptual art; the [[fluxus]] movement, happenings, performances, and body art, each in its own way, was structurally related to [Klein's] work. What these streams had in common was an incentive to discover a mode of creativity that transcended national frontiers, to define its aesthetic criteria, and to disseminate the results. In this process, Klein figured in the classical role of emissary, heralding a new culture to come- invisible to the eye, yet universally present nonetheless." Hannah Weitemeier &lt;ref name="weitemeier"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Ecosystem Services Valuation: Earth Economics is best known for their expertise in natural capital valuation. The Ecosystem Valuation Toolkit (EVT), an expanding and searchable database of ecosystem service values, serves as the foundation for these analyses. 
* Benefit-Cost Analysis: Earth Economics’ benefit-cost analysis framework expands traditional cost-benefit equations to include ecosystem services and other factors including health, recreation, and effects on culture and community. 
* Industry Analysis: Earth Economics works with businesses and economic development agencies to reduce risk, improve the efficiency of operations, reduce [[carbon footprint]], and expand job opportunities. 
* Finance &amp; Investment Strategies: Earth Economics works with organizations to develop innovative approaches and practical financing strategies to preserve, enhance, or restore natural capital assets, including [[conservation lands]], [[green infrastructure]], working forests and farms, and [[green building]]s.

==History==

Originally known as the Asia-Pacific Environmental Exchange (APEX), the organization was founded as a project of [[The Tides Center]]. The initial co-founders were David Batker, Jim Puckett, [[Annie Leonard]], Joshua Farley, Joshua Reyneveld, and Isabel De La Torre. Earth Economics evolved into an autonomous organization and received IRS [[501(c)3]] tax exempt, public charity status in March 2006.

From 2006 until 2016, co-founder David Batker acted as Earth Economics' Executive Director and Chief Economist. In 2016, Batker moved to a joint President and Chief Economist position. Batker's research and advocacy focuses on the value that natural systems have in providing food, water, flood risk reduction, climate stabilization, and other benefits. His work has been used to establish the value of watersheds and new funding mechanisms for maintaining natural capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/study-puts-price-on-puget-sound/|title=Study puts price on Puget Sound|date=2008-07-25|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Economics has a track record of working alongside NGOs, businesses, and governmental organizations to inform investment and shift local and international policy in ways that account for the benefits of ecosystem services. Since 2013, Earth Economics has been working to incorporate ecosystem services in federal benefit-cost analysis and accounting practices.

'''Ecoleasing''' is a system in which goods (mainly from the [[Cradle-to-cradle design|technical cycle]], i.e. appliances, ...) are rented to a client for a certain period of time after which he returns the goods so the company that made it can recycle the materials.

==Terminology==
The term ecoleasing has been used by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their book Cradle_to_Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things.&lt;ref&gt;Term found in Dutch version of the book&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to distinct itself from regular [[Lease|leasing]] in that:

* the operation is similar to regular [[Purchasing|purchasing of goods]], so not requiring a contract to be made up as with leasing
* it is done with appliances and other products used for the household, rather than with land or very expensive products (cars, ...)
* the period of time the product is rented would be about the same as the lifespan of the product, so it can only be rented once before it is taken back by the company to recover the materials (and to create another product with it)

==Examples==
Ecoleasing can for instance be done with TV's. Instead of the consumer purchasing the TV, by ecoleasing it, he is entitled to say 10 000 service hours. After this, he can send the TV back to the company.

==Advantages==
* Since materials are reclaimed, fewer or no materials end up in landfills, or require other forms of waste disposal. As such, it is quite environmental.
* Materials are recovered by which the company can make new products, so the material costs for this new product are much lower for the company.
* Since new products can be made at a lower expense, the sale price of these products can also be comparatively lower than similar products made by the competition (if they use a system of purchasing the goods)

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary ethics''' is a field of inquiry that explores how evolutionary theory might bear on our understanding of [[ethics]] or [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;William Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology." ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Available online at: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-biology/.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of issues investigated by evolutionary ethics is quite broad. Supporters of evolutionary ethics have claimed that it has important implications in the fields of [[descriptive ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[metaethics]].

Descriptive evolutionary ethics consists of biological approaches to morality based on the alleged role of [[evolution]] in shaping human [[psychology]] and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]], [[sociobiology]], or [[ethology]], and seek to explain certain human moral behaviors, capacities, and tendencies in evolutionary terms. For example, the nearly universal belief that incest is morally wrong might be explained as an evolutionary adaptation that furthered human survival.

Normative (or prescriptive) evolutionary ethics, by contrast, seeks not to explain moral behavior, but to justify or debunk certain normative ethical theories or claims. For instance, some proponents of normative evolutionary ethics have argued that evolutionary theory undermines certain widely held views of humans' moral superiority over other animals.

Evolutionary metaethics asks how evolutionary theory bears on theories of ethical discourse, the question of whether objective moral values exist, and the possibility of objective moral knowledge. For example, some evolutionary ethicists have appealed to evolutionary theory to defend various forms of moral anti-realism (the claim, roughly, that objective moral facts do not exist) and moral skepticism.

==History==
The first notable attempt to explore links between evolution and ethics was made by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871). In Chapters IV and V of that work Darwin set out to explain the origin of human morality in order to show that there was no absolute gap between man and animals. Darwin sought to show how a refined moral sense, or conscience, could have developed through a natural evolutionary process that began with social instincts rooted in our nature as social animals.

Not long after the publication of Darwin's ''The Descent of Man'', evolutionary ethics took a very different—and far more dubious—turn in the form of [[Social Darwinism]]. Leading Social Darwinists such as [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]] sought to apply the lessons of biological evolution to social and political life. Just as in nature, they claimed, progress occurs through a ruthless process of competitive struggle and "survival of the fittest," so human progress will occur only if government allows unrestricted business competition and makes no effort to protect the "weak" or "unfit" by means of social welfare laws.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bassham, ''The Philosophy Book: From the Vedas to the New Atheists, 250 Milestones in the History of Philosophy''. New York: Sterling, 2015, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]] roundly criticized such attempts to draw ethical and political lessons from Darwinism, and by the early decades of the twentieth century Social Darwinism was widely viewed as discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'', rev. ed. Boston: Beacon Press, 1955, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival of evolutionary ethics owes much to E. O. Wilson's 1975 book, ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''. In that work, Wilson argues that there is a genetic basis for a wide variety of human and nonhuman social behaviors. In recent decades, evolutionary ethics has become a lively topic of debate in both scientific and philosophical circles.

==Descriptive evolutionary ethics==
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
The most widely accepted form of evolutionary ethics is descriptive evolutionary ethics. Descriptive evolutionary ethics seeks to explain various kinds of moral phenomena wholly or partly in genetic terms. Ethical topics addressed include altruistic behaviors, an innate sense of fairness, a capacity for normative guidance, feelings of kindness or love, self-sacrifice, incest-avoidance, parental care, in-group loyalty, monogamy, feelings related to competitiveness and [[Retributive justice|retribution]], moral "cheating," and [[hypocrisy]].

A key issue in evolutionary psychology has been how altruistic feelings and behaviors could have evolved, in both humans and nonhumans, when the process of natural selection is based on the multiplication over time only of those genes that adapt better to changes in the environment of the species. Theories addressing this have included [[kin selection]], [[group selection]], and [[reciprocal altruism]] (both direct and indirect, and on a society-wide scale). Descriptive evolutionary ethicists have also debated whether various types of moral phenomena should be seen as adaptations which have evolved because of their direct adaptive benefits, or spin-offs that evolved as side-effects of adaptive behaviors.

==Normative evolutionary ethics==
Normative evolutionary ethics is the most controversial branch of evolutionary ethics. Normative evolutionary ethics aims at defining which acts are right or wrong, and which things are good or bad, in evolutionary terms. It is not merely ''describing'', but it is ''prescribing'' goals, values and obligations. [[Social Darwinism]], discussed above, is the most historically influential version of normative evolutionary ethics. As philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] famously argued, many early versions of normative evolutionary ethics seemed to commit a logical mistake that Moore dubbed the ''naturalistic fallacy''. This was the mistake of defining a normative property, such as goodness, in terms of some non-normative, naturalistic property, such as pleasure or survival.

More sophisticated forms of normative evolutionary ethics need not commit either the naturalistic fallacy or the is-ought fallacy. But all varieties of normative evolutionary ethics face the difficult challenge of explaining how evolutionary facts can have normative authority for rational agents. "Regardless of why one has a given trait, the question for a rational agent is always: is it right for me to exercise it, or should I instead renounce and resist it as far as I am able?"&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology," Section 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary metaethics ==
Evolutionary theory may not be able to tell us what is morally right or wrong, but it might be able to illuminate our use of moral language, or to cast doubt on the existence of objective moral facts or the possibility of moral knowledge. Evolutionary ethicists such as [[Michael Ruse]], [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]], and [[Sharon Street]] have defended such claims.

Some philosophers who support evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine views of human well-being that rely upon Aristotelian [[teleology]], or other goal-directed accounts of human flourishing. A number of thinkers have appealed to evolutionary theory in an attempt to debunk [[moral realism]] or support moral skepticism. Sharon Street is one prominent ethicist who argues that evolutionary psychology undercuts moral realism. According to Street, human moral decision-making is "thoroughly saturated" with evolutionary influences. Natural selection, she argues, would have rewarded moral dispositions that increased fitness, not ones that track moral truths, should they exist. It would be a remarkable and unlikely coincidence if "morally blind" ethical traits aimed solely at survival and reproduction aligned closely with independent moral truths. So we cannot be confident that our moral beliefs accurately track objective moral truth. Consequently, realism forces us to embrace moral skepticism. Such skepticism, Street claims, is implausible. So we should reject realism and instead embrace some antirealist view that allows for rationally justified moral beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Street, "A Darwinian Dilemma for Realist Theories of Value." ''Philosophical Studies'', 127: 109-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of moral realism have offered two sorts of replies. One is to deny that evolved moral responses would likely diverge sharply from moral truth. According to David Copp, for example, evolution would favor moral responses that promote social peace, harmony, and cooperation. But such qualities are precisely those that lie at the core of any plausible theory of objective moral truth. So Street's alleged "dilemma"—deny evolution or embrace moral skepticism—is a false choice.&lt;ref&gt;David Copp, "Darwinian Skepticism about Moral Realism." ''Philosophical Issues'', 18: 186-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second response to Street is to deny that morality is as "saturated" with evolutionary influences as Street claims. William Fitzpatrick, for instance, argues that "[e]ven if there is significant evolutionary influence on the content of many of our moral beliefs, it remains possible that many of our moral beliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases wholly) through autonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as with our mathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology," Section 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variability of moral codes, both across cultures and historical time periods, is difficult to explain if morality is as pervasively shaped by genetic factors as Street claims.

Another common argument evolutionary ethicists use to debunk moral realism is to claim that the success of evolutionary psychology in explaining human ethical responses makes the notion of moral truth "explanatorily superfluous." If we can fully explain, for example, why parents naturally love and care for their children in purely evolutionary terms, there is no need to invoke any "spooky" realist moral truths to do any explanatory work. Thus, for reasons of theoretical simplicity we should not posit the existence of such truths and, instead, should explain the widely held belief in objective moral truth as "an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes in order to get us to cooperate with one another (so that our genes survive)."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ruse and E. O. Wilson, "The Evolution of Ethics." ''New Scientist'', 102: 1478 (17 October 1985): 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here again the central question is whether the influence of evolution on morality is as pervasive as the critics of moral realism claim. If, as seems likely, there are important aspects of morality that cannot be explained in genetic terms, appeals to moral truth may not be explanatory fifth-wheels.

'''Existence''' is the ability to, directly or indirectly, interact with reality or, in more specific cases, the [[universe]]. The exact definition of existence is one of the most important and fundamental topics of [[ontology]], the philosophical study of the nature of [[being]], existence, or reality in general, as well as of the basic [[category of being|categories of being]] and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [[metaphysics]], ontology deals with questions concerning what things or [[Entity|entities]] exist or can be said to exist, and how such things or entities can be grouped, related within a [[hierarchy]], and subdivided according to similarities and differences.

[[Materialism]] holds that the only things that exist are [[matter]] and [[energy]], that all things are composed of material, that all actions require energy, and that all phenomena (including [[consciousness]]) are the result of material interactions.

[[Idealism]] holds that the only things that exist are [[thoughts]] and [[ideas]],{{cn|date=August 2018}} that all things are composed of strings of reasoning, that all thing(s) require an associated idea of the thing(s), and that all the phenomena (including [[consciousness]]) are the result of an understanding of the imprint from the noumenal world in which lies beyond the thing-in-itself.

==Etymology==
The word "existence" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''exsistere'' meaning "to appear", "to arise", "to become", or "to be", but literally, it means "to stand out" (''ex-'' being the Latin prefix for "out" added to the causative of the verb ''stare'', meaning "to stand").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|existence}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a technical sense, this refers to ''standing out'' of both [[being]] and [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], thus having the qualities of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|existence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical conceptions ==
{{See also|Avicennism|Scholasticism}}
In the [[Western world|Western]] tradition of philosophy, the earliest known comprehensive treatments of the subject are from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', and ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', though earlier fragmentary writing exists. Aristotle developed a comprehensive theory of being, according to which only individual things, called substances, fully have to be, but other things such as relations, quantity, time, and place (called the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]]) have a derivative kind of being, dependent on individual things. In Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'', there are [[four causes]] of existence or change in nature: the material cause, the formal cause, the efficient cause and the final cause.

The [[Neo-Platonist]]s and some early [[Christianity|Christian]] philosophers argued about whether existence had any reality except in the mind of God.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Some taught that existence was a snare and a delusion, that the world, the flesh, and the devil existed only to tempt weak humankind away from God.

The [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosopher]] [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that God is pure being, and that in God [[essence]] and existence are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marenbon| first = John| authorlink = | title = Medieval Philosophy: An Historical and Philosophical Introduction| publisher = Routledge| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 2006| location = | pages = 239| language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=veGCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| doi = | id = | isbn = 9781134461837| mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the [[nominalist]] philosopher [[William of Ockham]] argued, in Book I of his ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Totius Logicae]]'' (''Treatise on all Logic'', written some time before 1327), that Categories are not a form of Being in their own right, but derivative on the existence of individuals.

The [[Early modern Europe|early modern]] treatment of the subject derives from [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole]]'s ''Logic'', or ''The Art of Thinking'', better known as the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]'', first published in 1662. Arnauld thought that a [[proposition]] or [[Decision making|judgment]] consists of taking two different ideas and either putting them together or rejecting them:

{{quote|text=After conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas and, finding that some belong together and others do not, we unite or separate them. This is called affirming or denying, and in general judging.

This judgment is also called a proposition, and it is easy to see that it must have two terms. One term, of which one affirms or denies something, is called the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]; the other term, which is affirmed or denied, is called the attribute or [[predicate (logic)|Praedicatum]].|sign=Antoine Arnauld|source=''The Art of Thinking'' (''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''), 1662, translated by J. Buroker in 1996, Logic, II.3, p. 82}}

The two terms are joined by the verb "is" (or "is not", if the predicate is denied of the subject). Thus every proposition has three components: the two terms, and the "[[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]" that connects or separates them. Even when the proposition has only two words, the three terms are still there. For example, "God loves humanity", really means "God is a lover of humanity", "God exists" means "God is a thing".

This theory of judgment dominated logic for centuries, but it has some obvious difficulties: it only considers proposition of the form "All A are B.", a form logicians call [[universal quantifier|universal]]. It does not allow propositions of the form "Some A are B", a form logicians call [[existential quantifier|existential]]. If neither A nor B includes the idea of existence, then "some A are B" simply adjoins A to B. Conversely, if A or B do include the idea of existence in the way that "triangle" contains the idea "three angles equal to two right angles", then "A exists" is automatically true, and we have an [[ontological proof]] of A's existence. (Indeed, Arnauld's contemporary [[Descartes]] famously argued so, regarding the concept "God" (discourse 4, Meditation 5)). Arnauld's theory was current until the middle of the nineteenth century.

[[David Hume]] argued that the claim that a thing exists, when added to our notion of a thing, does not add anything to the concept. For example, if we form a complete notion of Moses, and superadd to that notion the claim that Moses existed, we are not adding anything to the notion of Moses.

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] also argued that existence is not a "real" predicate, but gave no explanation of how this is possible. Indeed, his famous discussion of the subject is merely a restatement of Arnauld's doctrine that in the proposition "God is omnipotent", the verb "is" signifies the joining or separating of two concepts such as "God" and "omnipotence".{{Original research inline|date=January 2010}}

[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] claimed that “everything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, only object in relation to the subject, the perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation.”&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to him there can be "No object without subject" because "everything objective is already conditioned as such in manifold ways by the knowing subject with the forms of its knowing, and presupposes these forms&amp;hellip;"&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, § 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predicative nature==
[[John Stuart Mill]] (and also Kant's pupil [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]]) argued that the predicative nature of existence was proved by sentences like "A [[centaur]] is a [[poetic fiction]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]], ''[[A System of Logic]]'', 1843 I. iv. 1.page 124&lt;/ref&gt; or "A [[greatest number]] is impossible" (Herbart).&lt;ref&gt;''Uberweg'' (System of Logic) §68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Brentano]] challenged this; so also (as is better known) did [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. Brentano argued that we can join the concept represented by a noun phrase "an A" to the concept represented by an adjective "B" to give the concept represented by the noun phrase "a B-A". For example, we can join "a man" to "wise" to give "a wise man". But the noun phrase "a wise man" is not a sentence, whereas "some man is wise" is a sentence. Hence the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] must do more than merely join or separate concepts. Furthermore, adding "exists" to "a wise man", to give the complete sentence "a wise man exists" has the same effect as joining "some man" to "wise" using the copula. So the copula has the same effect as "exists". Brentano argued that every categorical proposition can be translated into an existential one without change in meaning and that the "exists" and "does not exist" of the existential proposition take the place of the copula. He showed this by the following examples:

: The categorical proposition "Some man is sick" has the same meaning as the existential proposition "A sick man exists" or "There is a sick man."

: The categorical proposition "No stone is living" has the same meaning as the existential proposition "A living stone does not exist" or "there is no living stone".

: The categorical proposition "All men are mortal" has the same meaning as the existential proposition "An immortal man does not exist" or "there is no immortal man".

: The categorical proposition "Some man is not learned" has the same meaning as the existential proposition "A non-learned man exists" or "there is a non-learned man".

Frege developed a similar view (though later) in his great work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', as did [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (but Peirce held that [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: metaphysics|the possible and the real are not limited to the actual, individually existent]]). The Frege-Brentano view is the basis of the dominant position in [[Analytic philosophy|modern Anglo-American philosophy]]: that existence is asserted by the [[existential quantifier]] (as expressed by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s slogan "To be is to be the value of a variable." — ''On What There Is'', 1948).&lt;ref&gt;''On What There Is'' – in Review of Metaphysics (1948). Reprinted in [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], ''From a Logical Point of View'' (Harvard University Press, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
In [[mathematical logic]], there are two quantifiers, "some" and "all", though as [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] (1838–1917) pointed out, we can make do with just one quantifier and negation. The first of these quantifiers, "some", is also expressed as "there exists". Thus, in the sentence "There exists a man", the term "man" is asserted to be part of existence. But we can also assert, "There exists a triangle." Is a "triangle" — an abstract idea — part of existence in the same way that a "man" — a physical body — is part of existence? Do abstractions such as goodness, blindness, and virtue exist in the same sense that chairs, tables, and houses exist? What [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]], or kinds of thing, can be the subject or the predicate of a proposition?

Worse, does "existence" exist?&lt;ref&gt;''To exist is to have a specific relation to existence – a relation, by the way, which existence itself does not have''. [[Bertrand Russell]] – ''The Principles of Mathematics'' – New York, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1903, second edition 1937 pages 449–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some statements, existence is implied without being mentioned. The statement "A bridge crosses the Thames at Hammersmith" cannot just be about a bridge, the Thames, and Hammersmith. It must be about "existence" as well. On the other hand, the statement "A bridge crosses the Styx at Limbo" has the same form, but while in the first case we understand a real bridge in the real world made of stone or brick, what "existence" would mean in the second case is less clear.

The [[nominalist]] approach is to argue that certain noun phrases can be "eliminated" by rewriting a sentence in a form that has the same meaning but does not contain the noun phrase. Thus [[William of Ockham|Ockham]] argued that "Socrates has wisdom", which apparently asserts the existence of a reference for "wisdom", can be rewritten as "Socrates is wise", which contains only the referring phrase "Socrates".&lt;ref&gt;Klima, G., ''John Buridan'' ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=7A_iBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 146]&lt;/ref&gt; This method became widely accepted in the twentieth century by the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic school]] of philosophy.

However, this argument may be inverted by [[Philosophical realism|realists]] in arguing that since the sentence "Socrates is wise" can be rewritten as "Socrates has wisdom", this proves the existence of a hidden referent for "wise".

A further problem is that human beings seem to process information about [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] in much the same way that they process information about real people. For example, in the [[2008 United States presidential election]], a politician and actor named [[Fred Thompson]] ran for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination. In polls, potential voters identified Fred Thompson as a "law and order" candidate. Thompson plays a fictional character on the television series ''[[Law &amp; Order franchise|Law and Order]]''. The people who make the comment are aware that ''Law and Order'' is fiction, but at some level, they may process fiction as if it were fact, a process included in what is called the Paradox of Fiction{{Dubious|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this is the common experience of actresses who play the villain in a soap opera being accosted in public as if they are to blame for the actions of the characters they play.

A scientist might make a clear distinction between objects that exist, and assert that all objects that exist are made up of either matter or energy. But in the layperson's [[worldview]], existence includes real, fictional, and even contradictory objects. Thus if we reason from the statement "[[Pegasus]] flies" to the statement "Pegasus exists", we are not asserting that Pegasus is made up of atoms, but rather that Pegasus exists in the worldview of classical myth. When a mathematician reasons from the statement "ABC is a triangle" to the statement "triangles exist", she is not asserting that triangles are made up of atoms but rather that triangles exist within a particular [[mathematical model]].

==Modern approaches==
According to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Descriptions]], the negation operator in a singular sentence can take either wide or narrow scope: we distinguish between "some S is not P" (where negation takes "narrow scope") and "it is not the case that 'some S is P'" (where negation takes "wide scope"). The problem with this view is that there appears to be no such scope distinction in the case of proper names. The sentences "Socrates is not bald" and "it is not the case that Socrates is bald" both appear to have the same meaning, and they both appear to assert or presuppose the existence of someone (Socrates) who is not bald, so that negation takes a narrow scope. However, Russell's theory analyses proper names into a logical structure which makes sense of this problem. According to Russell, Socrates can be analyzed into the form 'The Philosopher of Greece.' In the wide scope, this would then read: It is not the case that there existed a philosopher of Greece who was bald. In the narrow scope, it would read the Philosopher of Greece was not bald.

According to the [[Direct reference|direct-reference]] view, an early version of which was originally proposed by [[Bertrand Russell]], and perhaps earlier by [[Gottlob Frege]], a proper name strictly has no meaning when there is no object to which it refers. This view relies on the argument that the semantic function of a proper name is to tell us ''which'' object bears the name, and thus to identify some object. But no object can be identified if none exists. Thus, a proper name must have a bearer if it is to be meaningful.

===Existence in the wide and narrow senses===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
According to the "two sense" view of existence, which derives from [[Alexius Meinong]], existential statements fall into two classes.

# Those asserting existence in a ''wide'' sense. These are typical of the form "N is P" for singular N, or "some S is P".
# Those asserting existence in a ''narrow'' sense. These are typical of the form "N exists" or "Ss exist".

The problem is then evaded as follows. "Pegasus flies" implies existence in the wide sense, for it implies that ''something'' flies. But it does not imply existence in the narrow sense, for we deny existence in this sense by saying that Pegasus does not exist. In effect, the world of all things divides, on this view, into those (like [[Socrates]], the planet [[Venus]], and New York City) that have existed in the narrow sense, and those (like [[Sherlock Holmes]], the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Minas Tirith]]) that do not.

However, common sense suggests the non-existence of such things as [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]] or places.

=== European views ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Influenced by the views of Brentano's pupil [[Alexius Meinong]], and by [[Edmund Husserl]], Germanophone and Francophone philosophy took a different direction regarding the question of existence.

===Anti-realist arguments===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
[[Anti-realism]] is the view of idealists who are skeptics about the physical world, maintaining either: (1) that nothing exists outside the [[mind]], or (2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality even if it may exist. Realists, in contrast, hold that perceptions or [[sense data]] are caused by mind-independent objects. An "anti-realist" who denies that other minds exist (i. e., a [[solipsist]]) is different from an "anti-realist" who claims that there is no fact of the matter as to whether or not there are unobservable other minds (i. e., a logical [[behaviorist]]).

== Dharmic "middle way" view ==
The Indian philosopher [[Nagarjuna#Philosophy|Nagarjuna]] (c. 150–250 CE) largely advanced existence concepts and founded the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhism.

In Eastern philosophy, [[Anicca]] (Sanskrit ''anitya'') or "[[impermanence]]" describes existence. It refers to the fact that all conditioned things ([[sankhara]]) are in a constant state of flux. In reality there is no thing that ultimately ceases to exist; only the appearance of a thing ceases as it changes from one form to another. Imagine a leaf that falls to the ground and decomposes. While the appearance and relative existence of the leaf ceases, the components that formed the leaf become particulate material that goes on to form new plants. Buddhism teaches a middle way, avoiding the extreme views of [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/various/wheel186.html | title=The Three Basic Facts of Existence |accessdate=2009-07-14| last=The Buddhist Publication Society | quote=(ref.1) Change or impermanence is the essential characteristic of all phenomenal existence. We cannot say of anything, animate or inanimate, organic or inorganic, "this is lasting"; for even while we are saying this, it would be undergoing change. All is fleeting; the beauty of flowers, the bird's melody, the bee's hum, and a sunset's glory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle way recognizes there are vast differences between the way things are perceived to exist and the way things really exist. The differences are reconciled in the concept of [[Shunyata]] by addressing the existing object's served purpose for the subject's identity in being. What exists is in non-existence, because the subject changes.

[[Trailokya]] elaborates on three kinds of existence, those of desire, form, and formlessness in which there are karmic rebirths. Taken further to the [[Trikaya]] doctrine, it describes how the Buddha exists. In this philosophy, it is accepted that Buddha exists in more than one absolute way.

'''Fair Trade coffee''' is [[coffee]] that is certified as having been produced to [[fair trade]] standards.

[[Fair trade]] organizations create trading partnerships that are based on dialogue, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[respect]], that seeks greater equity in [[international trade]]. These partnerships contribute to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to [[coffee bean]] farmers.

Fair trade organizations are engaged actively in supporting producers and sustainable environmental farming practices. Fair trade practices prohibit child or forced labor.

==History==
[[File:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|Fair trade [[coffee bean]]s being sorted]]
Prior to fair trade, prices were regulated by the [[International Coffee Organization]] according to the regulations set forth by the [[International Coffee Agreement]] of 1962. The agreement, which was negotiated at the [[United Nations]] by the Coffee Study Group, set limits on the amount of coffee traded between countries so there would be no excess supply and consequent drop in price. The ICA existed for five years, and then was renewed in 1968.

The agreement was renegotiated in 1976 due to increasing coffee prices, largely a result of a severe frost in [[Brazil]]. The new agreement allowed for the suspension of price quotas if the supply of coffee could not meet the demand, and enabling them if prices dropped too low.

In 1984, the agreement was again redrawn, this time creating a database on coffee trade, and implementing stricter import and export regulations.

[[Fair trade certification]] was then introduced in 1988 following a coffee crisis in which the supply of coffee was greater than the demand; since no price quotas had been reimplemented by the International Coffee Act, the market was flooded. Launched in the [[Netherlands]], fair trade certification aimed to artificially raise coffee prices in order to ensure growers sufficient wages to turn a profit. The original name of the organization was "[[Max Havelaar]]", after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee farmers by Dutch colonialists in the East Indies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW DID IT ACTUALLY START?|url=http://www.maxhavelaar.nl/faq/how-did-it-start?destination=english&amp;backtitle=FAQ%27s|work=FairTrade Max Havelaar Netherlands|publisher=Max Havelaar Foundation|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=Max Havelaar Foundation|language=Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization created a label for products that met certain wage standards.

Quotas remained a part of the agreement until 1989, when the organization was unable to negotiate a new agreement in time for the next year. It was decided that the 1983 agreement would be extended, but without the quotas because they had not yet been determined. A new agreement could not be negotiated until 1992.

From 1990 to 1992, without the quotas in place, coffee prices reached an all-time low because coffee price quotas could not be decided.

The agreements of 2001 and 2007 aimed to stabilize the coffee economy by promoting coffee consumption, raising the standard of living of growers by providing economic counselling, expanding research to include [[niche markets]] and quality relating to geographic area, and conducting studies of [[sustainability]], principles similar to fair trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The International Coffee Organization|url=http://www.ico.org/icohistory_e.asp|publisher=International Coffee Organization|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web |title=CERTIFICATION &amp; YOUR BUSINESS|url=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/certification|work=Fair Trade USA|publisher=Fair Trade USA|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=Fair Trade USA|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the inception of fair trade certification, the "Transfair" label was later launched in Germany, and within ten years three other labeling organizations commenced: The [[Fairtrade Foundation]], [[TransFair USA]], and [[Rättvisemärkt]]. In 1997, these four organizations jointly created Fairtrade International (formerly called FLO, or [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]]), which continues to set Fairtrade standards, inspecting and certifying growers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Fair trade organizations==

The fair trade labeling organizations having most of the market share and who sell through supermarkets refer to a definition developed by [[FINE]], an association of four international fair trade networks ([[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European World shops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA)). The standards developed by Fairtrade Labelling Organization are the most widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade Standard|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/standards.html|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification scheme ==

The certification scheme is run by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International (FLO)]].

Coffee packers pay Fairtrade a fee for the right to use the Fairtrade logo, which gives consumers an assurance that the coffee meets Fairtrade criteria. The coffee with this certification mark must be produced by farmers and cooperatives that meet these criteria.&lt;ref name="fairtrade.net"&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. (2011) “Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard,” p11  {{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}  accessed 15/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coffee retailers ==
Coffee retailers are not restricted by Fairtrade to sell Fairtrade coffee as a premium product and charge as much as they like for the coffee.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections"&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importers==

Importers of Fairtrade coffee have to be registered with Fairtrade and pay a fee. Under the Fairtrade International standards they are obliged to pay a minimum price to the exporting organization, currently $1.40c/lb New York  Board of Trade “C” contract, F.O.B. origin for Arabica, and $1.05 for Robusta London “EURONEXT LIFFE” contract, F.O.B origin with 30c/lb extra for organic.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO), “Fairtrade Minimum Price and Fairtrade Premium Table” 18.12.2012, accessed 8.1.2013; Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When the world price is above this level, they are obliged to pay 20c/lb above the world price.

==Exporters==

The exporting cooperatives incur costs including certification and inspection fees, additional marketing costs, costs of conforming to standards, and additional costs of cooperative operation,  costs which are incurred on all coffee production, even if little or none is marketed as certified, with a higher price, so the cooperatives may make a loss on Fairtrade membership.

Any deficit after paying these costs means a lower price for farmers, while any surplus will normally go on “social projects” for “common goals” organized by the exporting cooperative rather than as extra payment for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

== Enforcement of standards ==

FLO-CERT, a for-profit business owned by Fairtrade International, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with farmers, cooperatives, importers and packers.

== The marketing system==

The marketing system for Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a virtual company, paying the normal importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand rather than doing it themselves, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fair trade organizations remain that adhere to a greater or smaller degree to the original objectives of fair trade than the mainstream of Fairtrade International and its associate. These market products through alternative channels where possible, and market through specialist fair trade shops, but they have a small proportion of the total market.&lt;ref&gt;Ballet, Jerome and Aurelie Carimentrand ‘Fair trade and the Depersonalization of Ethics’ Journal of Business Ethics (2010) 92:317–330 _ Springer 2010 DOI 10.1007/s10551-010-0576-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms ==

Criticisms of fair trade have been made as a result of independent research, and these are summarized in the [[fair trade debate]].

There are also some criticisms of fair trade specific to coffee. Colleen Haight of the Stanford Innovation Review argues that fair trade coffee is merely a way to market the idea of [[ethical consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee|title=The Problem with Fair Trade Coffee (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality and transparency concerns regarding coffee are increasingly common amongst some consumers and coffee companies, as seen through the rise of the [[Third wave of coffee|third wave coffee]] movement. Maintaining a balance between ethical and higher-quality coffee may be difficult with fair trade coffee due to what some coffee roasters deem as insufficient quality incentive within many fair-trade certified coffee farms. Deborah Sick’s research, involving interviews with coffee farmers in Costa Rica, finds that many farmers often produce more fair trade coffee than they can sell, so will often end up selling to independent buyers that will often pay more than fair trade buyers can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sick|first=Deborah|date=2008-08-20|title=Coffee, Farming Families, and Fair Trade in Costa Rica: New Markets, Same Old Problems?|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/245424|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=43|issue=3|pages=193–208|doi=10.1353/lar.0.0042|issn=1542-4278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars are concerned of the artificial stimulation of coffee production, especially since worldwide demand for coffee is relatively inelastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8380592|title=Voting with your trolley|date=2006-12-07|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many who believe fair trade coffee is insufficient utilize the [[direct trade]] model, which allows for more control over quality concerns, farmer empowerment, and sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcoffee.net/direct.html|title=What is Direct Trade coffee?|website=www.ethicalcoffee.net|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is valuable in harboring closer farmer to roaster business relationships, which can ultimately increase quality of life and profits for coffee growers and buyers alike. However, direct trade is a new concept that is only utilized by for profit businesses like Counter Culture Coffee and Intelligentsia Coffee and therefore has no third party certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://counterculturecoffee.com/sustainability|title=Sustainability {{!}} Counter Culture Coffee|date=2016-08-11|work=Counter Culture Coffee|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/learn-do/community/intelligentsia-direct-trade|title=Learn &amp; Do {{!}} Community {{!}} Direct Trade {{!}} Intelligentsia Coffee|website=www.intelligentsiacoffee.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friendship bracelet diagram2.jpg|thumb|Step-by-step diagram of basic knot associated with friendship bracelets]]

A '''friendship bracelet''' is a decorative [[bracelet]] given by one person to another as a symbol of [[friendship]]. Friendship bracelets are often handmade, usually of [[embroidery floss]] or [[thread (yarn)|thread]] and are a type of  [[macrame]]. There are various styles and patterns, but most are based on the same simple [[half-hitch knot]].

The amount of thread used in bracelets varies depending on the pattern. The smallest pattern, a double chain knot, requires two strings while the candy stripe can have as 3 or more strings depending on the desired thickness.

Friendship bracelets first became popular in the [[United States]] during the 1970s. As they are unisex, they are commonly worn by both male and female [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchanan |first=Andrea J. |title=The Daring Book for Girls |year=2007 |publisher=Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-147257-3 |author2=Miriam Peskowitz |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now popular throughout the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Russell|title=Weekend: Mums on a mission|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lUBBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2agMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3899,4275950&amp;dq=friendship-bracelet&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Dirk|title=Despite rain, Denver is a mile high for the Pope|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aA0kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_tAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6544,3852443&amp;dq=friendship-bracelet&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|date=August 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glascock|first=Stuart|title=Dalai Lama draws 65,000 in Seattle|url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/04/13/8251|newspaper=Common Dreams|date=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are not only popular among teenagers but among the older generation; they are popular among celebrities as well. Friendship bracelets can be worn on various occasions; for example, they are ideal as a fashion accessory at the beach because they are made of materials that will not be easily destroyed and with which one can swim freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Friendship Bracelets and Patterns |url=http://diamondsinstyle.com/blog/friendship-bracelet-patterns.html | work=diamondsinstyle.com |accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Friendship bracelets are ancient, but their resurgence is modern. The modern popularity of friendship bracelets started in the 1980s when they were seen during protests about the disappearances of [[Mayan people|Mayan]] Indians and peasants in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news|author=Julie Hatfield, Globe Staff|title= Bracelets that Make a Statement |newspaper= The Boston Globe |publisher= The New York Times Company|date= 1988|accessdate= August 27, 2012 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8063624.html Highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship bracelets were brought into the United States by religious groups for use in political rallies.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt; 

Friendship bracelets can have many meanings and symbolic uses, such as friendship, [[folk art]], or social statements.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt; Although it is generally accepted that the origins of these colorful bands lie with the Indians in Central and South America, some decorative knots can be traced back to China from 481 to 221 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Braceletbook.com|url=http://www.braceletbook.com/history_of_friendship_bracelets.html|title=History of friendship bracelets}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, one ties a bracelet onto the wrist of a friend as a symbol of friendship and may wish for something at that moment. The bracelet should be worn until it is totally worn out and falls off by itself to honour the hard work and love put into making it. The moment at which the band falls off on its own, the wish is supposed to come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gryski |first=Camilla |author-link=Camilla Gryski |title=Friendship Bracelets |date= August 1993  |publisher=Mulberry Books |page=front inside cover |isbn=0688124372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misanga==
Misanga is an international good luck charm made from knotted [[Embroidery thread|embroidery floss]], [[thread (yarn)|thread]] or [[Gimp (thread)|gimp]]. Similar to friendship bracelets, it is made with basic knots as well as patterning techniques. Its basic structure is a three thread plaited braid. It is becoming a popular portable craft project.

The ''H''-theorem is a natural consequence of the kinetic equation derived by Boltzmann that has come to be known as [[Boltzmann's equation]]. The ''H''-theorem has led to considerable discussion about its actual implications, with major themes being:
* What is entropy? In what sense does Boltzmann's quantity ''H'' correspond to the thermodynamic entropy?
* Are the assumptions (especially the assumption of [[molecular chaos]]) behind Boltzmann's equation too strong? When are these assumptions violated?

== Definition and meaning of Boltzmann's ''H'' ==

The ''H'' value is determined from the function ''f''(''E'', ''t'') ''dE'', which is the energy distribution function of molecules at time ''t''. The value ''f''(''E'', ''t'') ''dE'' is the number of molecules that have kinetic energy between ''E'' and ''E'' + ''dE''. ''H'' itself is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; H(t) = \int_0^\infty f(E,t) \left( \ln\frac{f(E,t)}{\sqrt{E}} - 1 \right) \, dE. &lt;/math&gt;

For an isolated ideal gas (with fixed total energy and fixed total number of particles), the function ''H'' is at a minimum when the particles have a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]; if the molecules of the ideal gas are distributed in some other way (say, all having the same kinetic energy), then the value of ''H'' will be higher. Boltzmann's ''H''-theorem, described in the next section, shows that when collisions between molecules are allowed, such distributions are unstable and tend to irreversibly seek towards the minimum value of ''H'' (towards the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution).

(Note on notation: Boltzmann originally used the letter ''E'' for quantity ''H''; most of the literature after Boltzmann uses the letter ''H'' as here. Boltzmann also used the symbol ''x'' to refer to the kinetic energy of a particle.)

== Boltzmann's ''H'' theorem ==

[[Image:Translational motion.gif|thumb|right|300px|In this mechanical model of a gas, the motion of the molecules appears very disorderly. Boltzmann showed that, assuming each collision configuration in a gas is truly random and independent, the gas converges to the [[Maxwell speed distribution]] even if it did not start out that way.]]

Boltzmann considered what happens during the collision between two particles. It is a basic fact of mechanics that in the elastic collision between two particles (such as hard spheres), the energy transferred between the particles varies depending on initial conditions (angle of collision, etc.).

Boltzmann made a key assumption known as the ''Stosszahlansatz'' ([[molecular chaos]] assumption), that during any collision event in the gas, the two particles participating in the collision have 1) independently chosen kinetic energies from the distribution, 2) independent velocity directions, 3) independent starting points. Under these assumptions, and given the mechanics of energy transfer, the energies of the particles after the collision will obey a certain new random distribution that can be computed.

Considering repeated uncorrelated collisions, between any and all of the molecules in the gas, Boltzmann constructed his kinetic equation ([[Boltzmann's equation]]). From this kinetic equation, a natural outcome is that the continual process of collision causes the quantity ''H'' to decrease until it has reached a minimum.

== Impact ==

Although Boltzmann's H-theorem turned out not to be the absolute proof of the second law of thermodynamics as originally claimed (see Criticisms below), the H-theorem led Boltzmann in the last years of the 19th century to more and more probabilistic arguments about the nature of thermodynamics. The probabilistic view of thermodynamics culminated in 1902 with [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]'s statistical mechanics for fully general systems (not just gases), and the introduction of generalized [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]]s.

The kinetic equation and in particular Boltzmann's molecular chaos assumption inspired a whole family of [[Boltzmann equation]]s that are still used today to model the motions of particles, such as the electrons in a semiconductor. In many cases the molecular chaos assumption is highly accurate, and the ability to discard complex correlations between particles makes calculations much simpler.

== Criticism of the ''H''-theorem and exceptions ==
{{Refimprove|date=April 2015}}
There are several notable reasons described below why the ''H''-theorem, at least in its original 1871 form, is not completely rigorous. As Boltzmann would eventually go on to admit, the arrow of time in the ''H''-theorem is not in fact purely mechanical, but really a consequence of assumptions about initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;J. Uffink, "[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2691/1/UffinkFinal.pdf Compendium of the foundations of classical statistical physics.]" (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loschmidt's paradox ===

{{main article|Loschmidt's paradox}}

Soon after Boltzmann published his ''H'' theorem, [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] objected that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from time-symmetric dynamics and a time-symmetric formalism. If the ''H'' decreases over time in one state, then there must be a matching reversed state where ''H'' increases over time ([[Loschmidt's paradox]]). The explanation is that Boltzmann's equation is based on the assumption of "[[molecular chaos]]", i.e., that it follows from, or at least is consistent with, the underlying kinetic model that the particles be considered independent and uncorrelated. It turns out that this assumption breaks time reversal symmetry in a subtle sense, and therefore [[begs the question]]. Once the particles are allowed to collide, their velocity directions and positions in fact ''do'' become correlated (however, these correlations are encoded in an extremely complex manner). This shows that an (ongoing) assumption of independence is not consistent with the underlying particle model.

Boltzmann's reply to Loschmidt was to concede the possibility of these states, but noting that these sorts of states were so rare and unusual as to be impossible in practice. Boltzmann would go on to sharpen this notion of the "rarity" of states, resulting in his famous equation, his entropy formula of 1877 (see [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]]).

=== Spin echo ===

As a demonstration of Loschmidt's paradox, a famous modern counterexample (not to Boltzmann's original gas-related ''H''-theorem, but to a closely related analogue) is the phenomenon of [[spin echo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rothstein | first1 = J. | title = Nuclear Spin Echo Experiments and the Foundations of Statistical Mechanics | doi = 10.1119/1.1934539 | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 25 | issue = 8 | pages = 510–511 | year = 1957 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1957AmJPh..25..510R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spin echo effect, it is physically possible to induce time reversal in an interacting system of spins.

An analogue to Boltzmann's ''H'' for the spin system can be defined in terms of the distribution of spin states in the system. In the experiment, the spin system is initially perturbed into a non-equilibrium state (high ''H''), and, as predicted by the ''H'' theorem the quantity ''H'' soon decreases to the equilibrium value. At some point, a carefully constructed electromagnetic pulse is applied that reverses the motions of all the spins. The spins then undo the time evolution from before the pulse, and after some time the ''H'' actually ''increases'' away from equilibrium (once the evolution has completely unwound, the ''H'' decreases once again to the minimum value). In some sense, the time reversed states noted by Loschmidt turned out to be not completely impractical.

=== Poincaré recurrence ===

In 1896, [[Ernst Zermelo]] noted a further problem with the ''H'' theorem, which was that if the system's ''H'' is at any time not a minimum, then by [[Poincaré recurrence]], the non-minimal ''H'' must recur (though after some extremely long time). Boltzmann admitted that these recurring rises in ''H'' technically would occur, but pointed out that, over long times, the system spends only a tiny fraction of its time in one of these recurring states.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] always increases to a maximum equilibrium value. This is strictly true only in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of particles. For a finite number of particles, there will always be entropy fluctuations. For example, in the fixed volume of the isolated system, the maximum entropy is obtained when half the particles are in one half of the volume, half in the other, but sometimes there will be temporarily a few more particles on one side than the other, and this will constitute a very small reduction in entropy. These entropy fluctuations are such that the longer one waits, the larger an entropy fluctuation one will probably see during that time, and the time one must wait for a given entropy fluctuation is always finite, even for a fluctuation to its minimum possible value. For example, one might have an extremely low entropy condition of all particles being in one half of the container. The gas will quickly attain its equilibrium value of entropy, but given enough time, this same situation will happen again. For practical systems, e.g. a gas in a 1-liter container at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, this time is truly enormous, many multiples of the age of the universe, and, practically speaking, one can ignore the possibility.

=== Fluctuations of ''H'' in small systems ===

Since ''H'' is a mechanically defined variable that is not conserved, then like any other such variable (pressure, etc.) it will show [[thermal fluctuations]]. This means that ''H'' regularly shows spontaneous increases from the minimum value. Technically this is not an exception to the ''H'' theorem, since the ''H'' theorem was only intended to apply for a gas with a very large number of particles. These fluctuations are only perceptible when the system is small and the time interval over which it is observed is not enormously large.

If ''H'' is interpreted as entropy as Boltzmann intended, then this can be seen as a manifestation of the [[fluctuation theorem]].

== Connection to information theory ==

''H'' is a forerunner of Shannon's [[information entropy]]. [[Claude Shannon]] denoted his measure of [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]] ''H'' after the H-theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The article on Shannon's [[information entropy]] contains an
[[Shannon entropy#Information entropy explained|explanation]] of the discrete counterpart of the quantity ''H'', known as the information entropy or information uncertainty (with a minus sign).  By [[Shannon entropy#Extending discrete entropy to the continuous case: differential entropy|extending the discrete information entropy to the continuous information entropy]], also called [[differential entropy]], one obtains the expression in Eq.(1){{clarify|date=March 2015}}, and thus a better feel for the meaning of ''H''.

The H-theorem's connection between information and entropy plays a central role in a recent controversy called the [[Black hole information paradox]].

== Tolman's ''H''-theorem ==

[[Richard C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s 1938 book "The Principles of Statistical Mechanics" dedicates a whole chapter to the study of Boltzmann's ''H'' theorem, and its extension in the generalized classical statistical mechanics of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]]. A further chapter is devoted to the quantum mechanical version of the ''H''-theorem.

=== Classical mechanical ===

&lt;!-- This section need to be very explicit about the underpinning assumptions of the Boltzmann equation, e.g. Stosszahlansatz etc.
 Technical math derivations are fine but they should go into a collapsible block, and technical terms like "µ-space" must be at least defined!

Other inadequately defined symbols: G, P, \ln \delta v_\gamma. The derivations (or isolated formulas, if you like) are incomprehensible 
by themselves without definitions.     --&gt;

We let &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; be our [[Canonical coordinates|generalized coordinates]] for a set of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; particles. Then we consider a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that returns the probability density of particles, over the states in [[phase space]]. Note how this can be multiplied by a small region in phase space, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta q_1 ... \delta p_r&lt;/math&gt;, to yeld the (average) expected number of particles in that region.

:&lt;math&gt;\delta n = f(q_1 ... p_r,t)\,\delta q_1\delta p_1 ... \delta q_r \delta p_r.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Tolman offers the following equations for the definition of the quantity H in Boltzmann's original H theorem.

: &lt;math&gt;H= \sum_i f_i \ln f_i \,\delta q_1 \cdots \delta p_r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1938 pg. 135 formula 47.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Here we sum over the regions into which phase space is divided, indexed by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. And in the limit for an infinitesimal phase space volume &lt;math&gt;\delta q_i \rightarrow 0, \delta p_i \rightarrow 0 \; \forall \, i&lt;/math&gt;, we can write the sum as an integral.

: &lt;math&gt;H= \int \cdots \int f \ln f \,d q_1 \cdots dp_r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1938 pg. 135 formula 47.6&lt;/ref&gt;

H can also be written in terms of the number of molecules present in each of the cells.
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
H &amp; = \sum( n_i \ln n_i -  n_i \ln \delta v_\gamma) \\
&amp; = \sum n_i \ln n_i + \text{constant}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Tolman"&gt;Tolman 1938 pg. 135 formula 47.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2014}}

An additional way to calculate the quantity H is:

: &lt;math&gt;H = -\ln P + \text{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1938 pg. 135 formula 47.8&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''P'' is the probability of finding a system chosen at random from the specified [[microcanonical ensemble]]. It can finally be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;H = -\ln G + \text{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1939 pg. 136 formula 47.9&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''G'' is the number of classical states.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}

The quantity ''H'' can also be defined as the integral over velocity space{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} :

:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" |
&lt;math&gt;  \displaystyle
H \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  
\int { P ({\ln P}) \, d^3 v} 
= \left\langle \ln P \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;
| style= | (1)
|}
where ''P''(''v'') is the probability distribution.

Using the Boltzmann equation one can prove that ''H'' can only decrease.

For a system of ''N'' statistically independent particles, ''H'' is related to the thermodynamic entropy ''S'' through:&lt;ref&gt; Huang 1987 pg 79 equation 4.33 &lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  - V k H + constant&lt;/math&gt; 

So, according to the H-theorem, ''S'' can only increase.

=== Quantum mechanical ===

In Quantum statistical mechanics (which is the quantum version of classical statistical mechanics), the H-function is the function:&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1938 pg 460 formula 104.7&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;H= \sum_i p_i \ln p_i, \,&lt;/math&gt;
where summation runs over all possible distinct states of the system, and ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the probability that the system could be found in the ''i''-th state.

This is closely related to the [[Gibbs entropy|entropy formula of Gibbs]],
:&lt;math&gt;S = - k \sum_i p_i \ln p_i \;&lt;/math&gt;
and we shall (following e.g., Waldram (1985), p.&amp;nbsp;39) proceed using ''S'' rather than ''H''.

First, differentiating with respect to time gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; =  - k \sum_i \left(\frac{dp_i}{dt} \ln p_i  + \frac{dp_i}{dt}\right) \\
&amp; =  - k \sum_i \frac{dp_i}{dt} \ln p_i  \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

(using the fact that ∑&amp;nbsp;''dp''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'' = 0, since ∑&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1).

Now [[Fermi's golden rule]] gives a [[master equation]] for the average rate of quantum jumps from state α to β; and from state β to α. (Of course, Fermi's golden rule itself makes certain approximations, and the introduction of this rule is what introduces irreversibility. It is essentially the quantum version of Boltzmann's ''Stosszahlansatz''.) For an isolated system the jumps will make contributions
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dp_\alpha}{dt} &amp; = \sum_\beta \nu_{\alpha\beta}(p_\beta - p_\alpha) \\
\frac{dp_\beta}{dt}  &amp; = \sum_\alpha \nu_{\alpha\beta}(p_\alpha - p_\beta) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the reversibility of the dynamics ensures that the same transition constant ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sub&gt; appears in both expressions.

So

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dt} =  \frac{1}{2} k \sum_{ \alpha,\beta} \nu_{\alpha\beta}(\ln p_{\beta}-\ln p_{\alpha})(p_{\beta}- p_{\alpha}).&lt;/math&gt;

But the two differences terms in the summation always have the same sign, so each contribution to ''dS/dt'' cannot be negative.

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S \geq 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

for an isolated system.

The same mathematics is sometimes used to show that relative entropy is a [[Lyapunov function]] of a [[Markov process]] in [[detailed balance]], and other chemistry contexts.

== Gibbs' ''H''-theorem ==

[[File:Hamiltonian flow classical.gif|frame|Evolution of an ensemble of [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical]] systems in [[phase space]] (top). Each system consists of one massive particle in a one-dimensional [[potential well]] (red curve, lower figure). The initially compact ensemble becomes swirled up over time.]]

[[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] described another way in which the entropy of a microscopic system would tend to increase over time.&lt;ref name="gibbs12"&gt;Chapter XII, from {{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=Josiah Willard |authorlink=Josiah Willard Gibbs |title=[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics]] |year=1902 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers have called this "Gibbs' ''H''-theorem" as its conclusion resembles that of Boltzmann's.&lt;ref name="tolman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Tolman |first=R. C. | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year=1938 | title=The Principles of Statistical Mechanics | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | isbn = 9780486638966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs himself never called it an ''H''-theorem, and in fact his definition of entropy—and mechanism of increase—are very different from Boltzmann's. This section is included for historical completeness.

The setting of Gibbs' entropy production theorem is in [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] statistical mechanics, and the entropy quantity is the [[Gibbs entropy]] (information entropy) defined in terms of the probability distribution for the entire state of the system. This is in contrast to Boltzmann's ''H'' defined in terms of the distribution of states of individual molecules, within a specific state of the system.

Gibbs considered the motion of an ensemble which initially starts out confined to a small region of phase space, meaning that the state of the system is known with fair precision though not quite exactly (low Gibbs entropy). The evolution of this ensemble over time proceeds according to [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's equation]]. For almost any kind of realistic system, the Liouville evolution tends to "stir" the ensemble over phase space, a process analogous to the mixing of a dye in an incompressible fluid.&lt;ref name="gibbs12"/&gt; After some time, the ensemble appears to be spread out over phase space, although it is actually a finely striped pattern, with the total volume of the ensemble (and its Gibbs entropy) conserved. Liouville's equation is guaranteed to conserve Gibbs entropy since there is no random process acting on the system; in principle, the original ensemble can be recovered at any time by reversing the motion.

The critical point of the theorem is thus: If the fine structure in the stirred-up ensemble is very slightly blurred, for any reason, then the Gibbs entropy increases, and the ensemble becomes an equilibrium ensemble. As to why this blurring should occur in reality, there are a variety of suggested mechanisms. For example, one suggested mechanism is that the phase space is coarse-grained for some reason (analogous to the pixelization in the simulation of phase space shown in the figure). For any required finite degree of fineness the ensemble becomes "sensibly uniform" after a finite time. Or, if the system experiences a tiny uncontrolled interaction with its environment, the sharp coherence of the ensemble will be lost. [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]] argued that the blurring is subjective in nature, simply corresponding to a loss of knowledge about the state of the system.&lt;ref name="jaynes1965"&gt;E.T. Jaynes; Gibbs vs Boltzmann Entropies; American Journal of Physics,391,1965&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, however it occurs, the Gibbs entropy increase is irreversible provided the blurring cannot be reversed.

The exactly evolving entropy, which does not increase, is known as ''fine-grained entropy''. The blurred entropy is known as ''coarse-grained entropy''.
[[Leonard Susskind]] analogizes this distinction to the notion of the volume of a fibrous ball of cotton:&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Susskind]], Statistical Mechanics Lecture 7 (2013). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg15UClUY48&amp;t=83m0s Video] at [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand the volume of the fibers themselves is constant, but in another sense there is a larger coarse-grained volume, corresponding to the outline of the ball.

Gibbs' entropy increase mechanism solves some of the technical difficulties found in Boltzmann's ''H''-theorem: The Gibbs entropy does not fluctuate nor does it exhibit Poincare recurrence, and so the increase in Gibbs entropy, when it occurs, is therefore irreversible as expected from thermodynamics. The Gibbs mechanism also applies equally well to systems with very few degrees of freedom, such as the single-particle system shown in the figure. To the extent that one accepts that the ensemble becomes blurred, then, Gibbs' approach is a cleaner proof of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="jaynes1965"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7242">In mathematics, a '''Hurewicz space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies a certain basic [[selection principle]] that generalizes [[Σ-compact space|σ-compactness]]. A Hurewicz space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the space there are finite sets &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}_1 \subset \mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subset \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that every point of the space belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup\mathcal{F}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; .

== History ==
In 1926, [[Witold Hurewicz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurewicz|first=Witold|title=Über eine Verallgemeinerung des Borelschen Theorems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01216792|journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|language=de|volume=24|issue=1|pages=401–421|doi=10.1007/BF01216792|issn=0025-5874}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the above property of topological spaces that is formally stronger than the [[Menger space|Menger property]]. He didn't know whether [[Menger space|Menger's conjecture]] is true, and whether his property is strictly stronger than the Menger property, but he conjectured that in the class of metric spaces his property is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compactness.

== Hurewicz's conjecture ==
Hurewicz conjectured that in [[ZFC]] every Hurewicz metric space is σ-compact. Just, Miller, [[Marion Scheepers|Scheepers]], and Szeptycki&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Just|first=Winfried|last2=Miller|first2=Arnold W.|last3=Scheepers|first3=Marion|last4=Szeptycki|first4=Paul J.|date=1996-11-11|title=The combinatorics of open covers II|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864196000752|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=73|issue=3|pages=241–266|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that Hurewicz's conjecture is false, by showing that there is, in ZFC, a set of real numbers that is Menger but not σ-compact. Their proof was dichotomic, and the set witnessing the failure of the conjecture heavily depends on whether a certain (undecidable) axiom holds or not.

Bartoszyński and [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartoszynski|first=Tomek|last2=Shelah|first2=Saharon|date=2001-11-15|title=Continuous images of sets of reals|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864100000791|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=116|issue=2|pages=243–253|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(00)00079-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Boaz Tsaban|Tsaban]]'s solution based on their work &lt;ref&gt;Boaz Tsaban (2011), 'Menger's and Hurewicz's Problems: Solutions from "The Book"  and refinements', in "Set Theory and its Applications" Contemporary Mathematics 533, 211–226. https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5645&lt;/ref&gt; ) gave a uniform ZFC example of a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is not σ-compact.

== Hurewicz's problem ==
Hurewicz asked whether in [[ZFC]] his property is strictly stronger than the Menger property. In 2002, Chaber and Pol in unpublished note, using dichotomy proof, showed that there is a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is not Menger. In 2008, Tsaban and Zdomskyy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsaban|first=Boaz|last2=Zdomskyy|first2=Lyubomyr|date=2008-01-01|title=Scales, fields, and a problem of Hurewicz|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/doi/10.4171/JEMS/132|journal=Journal of the European Mathematical Society|volume=10|issue=3|pages=837–866|doi=10.4171/jems/132|issn=1435-9855|arxiv=math/0507043}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a uniform example of a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is Menger but not Hurewicz.

== Characterizations ==

=== Combinatorial characterization ===
For subsets of the real line, the Hurewicz property can be characterized using continuous functions into the [[Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. For functions &lt;math&gt;f,g\in \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, write &lt;math&gt;f\leq^* g&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; f(n)\leq g(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all but finitely many natural numbers &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;. A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded if there is a function &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math&gt; f\leq^* g&lt;/math&gt; for all functions &lt;math&gt; f\in A&lt;/math&gt;. A subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded if it is not bounded. Hurewicz proved that a subset of the real line is Hurewicz iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is unbounded. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than the [[Cichoń's diagram|bounding number &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;]] is Hurewicz.

=== Topological game characterization ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Hurewicz game played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game with two players Alice and Bob.

'''1st round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subset \mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2nd round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2\subset \mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''etc.'''

If every point of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup\mathcal{F}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; , then Bob wins the Hurewicz game. Otherwise, Alice wins.

A player has a winning strategy if he knows how to play in order to win the game (formally, a winning strategy is a function).

A topological space is Hurewicz iff Alice has no winning strategy in the Hurewicz game played on this space.&lt;ref name="coc12"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1996|title=Combinatorics of open covers I: Ramsey theory|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166864195000674|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=69|pages=31–62|doi=10.1016/0166-8641(95)00067-4|last1=Scheepers|first1=Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood characterization ===
A [[Tychonoff space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hurewicz iff for every compact space &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; containing the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and a &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt; subset G of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; containing the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;X\subset Y\subset G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Properties ==
* Every compact, and even σ-compact, space is Hurewicz.
* Every Hurewicz space is a [[Menger space]], and thus it is a [[Lindelöf space]]
* Continuous image of a Hurewicz space is Hurewicz
* The Hurewicz property is closed under taking &lt;math&gt;F_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; subsets
* Hurewicz's property characterizes filters whose [[Mathias forcing]] notion does not add unbounded functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chodounský|first=David|last2=Repovš|first2=Dušan|last3=Zdomskyy|first3=Lyubomyr|date=2015-12-01|title=MATHIAS FORCING AND COMBINATORIAL COVERING PROPERTIES OF FILTERS|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/div-classtitlemathias-forcing-and-combinatorial-covering-properties-of-filtersdiv/725F31CB4B307A544531F56682D06B6D|journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=80|issue=4|pages=1398–1410|doi=10.1017/jsl.2014.73|issn=0022-4812|arxiv=1401.2283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ommel-hus.jpg|thumb|Hygge is associated with coziness.|222x222px]]'''''Hygge''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|ɡ|ə}}  {{respell|HEW|gə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|ɡ|ə}} {{respell|HOO|gə}}) is a Danish and Norwegian word for a mood of coziness and comfortable conviviality with feelings of wellness and contentment. As a cultural category with its sets of associated practices ''hygge'' has more or less the same meanings in Danish and Norwegian, but the notion is more central in Denmark than Norway.&lt;ref name=Gullestad1992note&gt;{{ cite book | author = Gullestad, Marianne | year = 1992 | title = The art of social relations: essays on culture, social action and everyday life in modern Norway|chapter=Home Decoration as Popular Culture | isbn = 8200216527 | place = Oslo |language=English | publisher = Scandinavian University Press | url = https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2015102906007;page=248 | page = 235| postscript=. [note 12 for chapter III]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on ''hygge'' as a part of Danish culture is a recent phenomenon, dating to the late 20th century.

== Etymology ==
The word ''hygge'' comes from a Danish word meaning "to give courage, comfort, joy".&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHygge&gt;{{ cite book | author = [[Hjalmar Falk|Falk, Hjalmar]] &amp; [[Alf Torp|Torp, Alf]] | year = 1903 | title = Etymologisk Ordbog over det norske og det danske Sprog|chapter=Hygge | place = Kristiania |language=Norwegian| publisher = Aschehoug | url = https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2014090924004;page=324 | page = 315}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hygge'' stems from ''hyggja'' which means to think in [[Old Norse]].&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHygge/&gt; ''Hygge'' is built from the [[Old Norse]] word ''hugr'' which later became the [[Hug (folklore)|''hug'']] which means the soul, mind, consciousness.&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHug&gt;{{ cite book | author = [[Hjalmar Falk|Falk, Hjalmar]] &amp; [[Alf Torp|Torp, Alf]] | year = 1903 | title = Etymologisk Ordbog over det norske og det danske Sprog|chapter=Hu | place = Kristiania |language=Norwegian | publisher = Aschehoug | url = https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2014090924004;page=312 | page = 303}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Swedish Hygge is a harvested forest area.

But it is also speculated that ''hygge'' might originate from the word ''hug''. ''Hug'' comes from the 1560s word ''hugge'', which means "to embrace". The word ''hugge'' is of unknown origin but is highly associated with an Old Norse term, ''hygga'', which means "to comfort", which comes from the word ''hugr'', meaning "mood". In turn, the word comes from the Germanic word ''hugyan'', which relates to the Old English ''hycgan'', meaning "to think, consider".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958463988|title=The little book of hygge : the Danish way to live well|last=Wiking|first=Meik|isbn=9780241283912|oclc=958463988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It first appeared in Danish writing in the 19th Century and has since evolved into the cultural idea known in Denmark and Norway today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34345791|title=Hygge: A heart-warming lesson from Denmark|last=Parkinson|first=Justin|date=2015-10-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hygge has exactly the same meaning in Norwegian as in Danish and is a widely used word in Denmark (including in its derived forms, such as ''hyggelig''), the emphasis specifically on "hygge" as an important part of their cultural identity is mostly a recent Danish phenomenon; in Norway "hygge" is just a word, similar in status to "cozy" in English-speaking countries.

== Use ==
In both Danish and Norwegian, ''hygge'' refers to "a form of everyday togetherness", "a pleasant and highly valued everyday experience of safety, equality, personal wholeness and a spontaneous social flow".&lt;ref&gt;[https://heinz.sdu.dk:8443/ws/files/38094393/Linnet%20Phd%20dissertation.pdf ''Interweavings – A cultural phenomenology of everyday consumption and social atmosphere within Danish middleclass families'', Jeppe Trolle Linnet, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''hygge'' includes something nice, cozy, safe and known, referring to a psychological state.&lt;ref&gt;Hjalmar Falk og Alf Torp (1903): ''Etymologisk ordbog over det norske og det danske sprog''. Aschehoug, Kristiania, s. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collins English Dictionary|''Collins'' ''English Dictionary'']] defines the word as "a concept, originating in Denmark, of creating cosy and convivial atmospheres that promote wellbeing".&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/word-lovers-blog/new/top-10-collins-words-of-the-year-2016,323,HCB.html|title=Top 10 Collins Word of the Year 2016|date=2016-11-03|publisher=collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' named ''hygge'' the runner-up (after "[[Brexit]]") as word of the year in the UK in 2016.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt; This followed a period during which several books focusing on ''hygge'' had been marketed in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/18/hygge-a-soothing-balm-for-the-traumas-of-2016|title=Hygge – a soothing balm for the traumas of 2016|last=Cartier-Morley|first=Jess|date=2016-10-18|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''The Little Book of Hygge'' by Meik Wiking,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/the-little-book-of-hygge-by-meik-wiking-digested-read|title=The Little Book of Hygge by Meik Wiking – digested read|last=Crace|first=John|date=2016-09-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hygge: The Danish Art of Happiness'' by [[Marie Tourell Søderberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31129745-hygge|title=Hygge|website=Goodreads|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Book of Hygge: The Danish Art of Living Well'' by Louisa Thomsen Brits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/29/book-of-hygge-louisa-thomsen-brits-review|title=The Book of Hygge review – can the Danes really teach us how to live?|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=2016-09-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Broadway musical [[Frozen (musical)|Frozen]], there is a song called ‘Hygge’, which is all about being comfortable.

In Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', [[Jemima Davies-Smythe]] incorporates Hygge into a resdesign of her half-brother [[Karl Kennedy]]'s living room.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17402">'''Ideomotor phenomenon''' is a [[psychological]] phenomenon wherein a subject makes motions [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]ly.

[[File:Tables tournantes 1853.jpg|thumb|An example of [[table-turning]] in 19th century France. A circle of participants press their hands against a table, and the ideomotor effect causes the table to tilt in such a way as to produce a written message, in a manner similar to a ouija board.]]
[[File:Faraday apparatus for ideomotor effect on table turning.png|thumb|[[Michael Faraday|Faraday's]] apparatus for experimental demonstration of ideomotor effect on table-turning]]

The '''ideomotor response''' (or '''ideomotor reflex'''), often abbreviated to '''IMR''', is a concept in [[hypnosis]] and psychological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shin|first1=Yun Kyoung|title=A review of contemporary ideomotor theory|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycarticles/2010-18185-001|website=PsycNET|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the terms "[[wikt:ideo|ideo]]" (idea, or [[mental representation]]) and "[[wikt:motor|motor]]" (muscular action). The phrase is most commonly used in reference to the process whereby a thought or mental image brings about a seemingly "reflexive" or automatic [[muscular]] reaction, often of minuscule degree, and potentially outside of the awareness of the subject. As in reflexive responses to pain, the body sometimes reacts reflexively with an '''ideomotor effect''' to ideas alone without the person consciously deciding to take action. The effects of [[automatic writing]], [[dowsing]], [[facilitated communication]], and [[ouija|Ouija board]]s have been attributed to the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Heap, Michael. (2002). ''Ideomotor Effect (the Ouija Board Effect)''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 127-129. {{ISBN|1-57607-654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The associated term "ideo-''dynamic'' response" (or "reflex") applies to a wider domain, and extends to the description of all bodily reactions (including ideo-motor and ideo-sensory responses) caused in a similar manner by certain ideas, e.g., the salivation often caused by imagining sucking a lemon, which is a secretory response. The notion of an ideo-dynamic response contributed to James Braid's first neuro-psychological explanation of the principle through which [[suggestion]] operated in [[hypnotism]].

== History of scientific investigation ==
[[File:Charlie Charlie Challenge.jpg|thumb|The [[Charlie Charlie challenge]] relies on the ideomotor phenomenon to produce answers to questions provided by its participants - the breathing from the participants anticipating a result causes the top pencil to rotate towards an answer.]]
With the rise of [[Spiritualism]] in 1840s, [[mediums]] devised and refined a variety of techniques for communicating, ostensibly, with the spirit world including [[table-turning]] and [[planchette]] writing boards (the precursor to later [[Ouija]] boards). These phenomena and devices quickly became the subject of scientific investigation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Planchette; or, The Despair of Science|date=1869|pages=1–20|publisher=Roberts Brothers|location=Boston|url=https://archive.org/details/despairofscience00sargrich|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=John Henry|title=The Fashionable Science of Parlour Magic|date=1885|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UypbAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=magic&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Ideomotor was first used in a [[scientific paper]] discussing the means through which these spiritualistic phenomena produced effect, by [[William Benjamin Carpenter]] in 1852,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sgipt.org/medppp/psymot/carp1852.htm |title=On the influence of Suggestion in Modifying and directing Muscular Movement, independently of Volition | author=[[William Benjamin Carpenter]] | journal = | volume = | issue = | date=March 12, 1852 |accessdate=2010-02-27 |quote= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the alternative term '''Carpenter effect'''. (Carpenter derived the word ''ideomotor'' from the components ''[[wikt:ideo|ideo]]'', meaning "idea" or "mental representation", and ''[[wikt:motor|motor]]'', meaning "muscular action"). In the paper, Carpenter explained his theory that [[muscular]] movement can be independent of [[conscious]] desires or emotions.

Carpenter was a friend and collaborator of [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]], the founder of modern hypnotism. Braid soon adopted Carpenter's ideo-motor terminology, to facilitate the transmission of his most fundamental views, based upon those of his teacher, the philosopher [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], that the efficacy of hypnotic suggestion was contingent upon the subject's concentration upon a single (thus, "dominant") idea. In 1855, Braid explained his decision to abandon his earlier term "mono-ideo-motor", based on Carpenter's (1852) "ideo-motor principle", and adopt the more appropriate and more descriptive term "mono-ideo-dynamic". His decision was based upon suggestions made to Carpenter (in 1854) by their friend in common, [[Daniel Noble (physician)|Daniel Noble]], that the activity that Carpenter was describing would be more accurately understood in its wider applications (viz., wider than pendulums and ouija boards) if it were to denominated the "ideo-dynamic principle":&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jBVAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA642#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Noble (1854), Lecture III, p.642.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In order that I may do full justice to two esteemed friends, I beg to state, in connection with this term ''monoideo-dynamics'', that, several years ago, Dr. W. B. Carpenter introduced the term ''ideo-motor'' to characterise the reflex or automatic muscular motions which arise merely from ideas associated with motion existing in the mind, without any conscious effort of volition. In 1853, in referring to this term, [[Daniel Noble (physician)|Daniel Noble]] said, "''Ideo-dynamic'' would probably constitute a phraseology more appropriate, as applicable to a wider range of phenomena." In this opinion I quite concurred, because I was well aware that an idea could ''arrest'' as well as ''excite'' motion automatically, not only in the muscles of voluntary motion, but also as regards the condition of ''every other function of the body''. I have, therefore, adopted the term ''monoideo-dynamics'', as still more comprehensive and characteristic as regards the true mental relations which subsist during all dynamic changes which take place, in every other function of the body, as well as in the muscles of voluntary motion.&lt;ref&gt;Braid, (1855), footnote at p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Scientific tests by the English scientist [[Michael Faraday]], Manchester surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Braid's letter to Michael Faraday (22 August 1853).&lt;/ref&gt; the French chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], and the American psychologists [[William James]] and [[Ray Hyman]] have demonstrated that many phenomena attributed to spiritual or paranormal forces, or to mysterious "energies", are actually due to ideomotor action. Furthermore, these tests demonstrate that "honest, intelligent people can unconsciously engage in muscular activity that is consistent with their expectations".&lt;ref name="hyman"&gt;{{cite journal

Some operators claim to use ideomotor responses to communicate with a subject's "[[unconscious mind]]" using a system of physical signals (such as finger movements) for the unconscious mind to indicate "yes", "no", "I don't know", or "I'm not ready to know that consciously".&lt;ref&gt;Cheek (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple experiment to demonstrate the ideomotor effect is to allow a hand-held pendulum to hover over a sheet of paper. The paper has keywords such as YES, NO and MAYBE printed on it. Small movements in the hand, in response to questions, can cause the pendulum to move towards key words on the paper. This technique has been used for experiments in [[extrasensory perception]], lie detection, and ouija boards. This type of experiment was used by [[Kreskin]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1stingames.com/rules/kreskinsesp/index.pdf see how kreskin used this pendulum&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used by illusionists such as [[Derren Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Derren. (2007). ''Tricks of the Mind''. Transworld Publishers. p. 48. {{ISBN|978-1905026357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Responding to questions ===
&lt;!-- These are not "ideomotor questions"; and the process is not "ideomotor questioning". The questions that are delivered by the operator are couched in normal language, and are presented to the subject in a completely normal way. It is the subject's responses that involve "ideomotor" activity, displayed through (usually predetermined) sets of "ideomotor signals". --&gt;
It is strongly associated with the practice of [[hypnotherapy|analytical hypnotherapy]] based on "uncovering techniques" such as [[John G. Watkins|Watkins']] "Affect Bridge",&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, (January 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a subject's "yes", "no", "I don't know", or "I don't want to answer" responses to an operator's questions are indicated by physical movements rather than verbal signals; and are produced ''per medium'' of a pre-determined (between operator and subject) and pre-calibrated set of responses.&lt;ref&gt;LeCron, (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14201">The '''International Moral Education Congress''' was an international [[academic conference]] held in Europe six times between 1908 and 1934. It convened because of an interest in moral education by many countries beginning a decade before the inaugural event. The movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the [[Ethical movement]].&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt; The idea to hold the congress was at the behest of the International Union of Ethical Societies; its greatest proponents were Professor [[Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster]] and [[Gustav Spiller]], the secretary of the Union.&lt;ref name=Sadler1909&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadler|first1=M.

The official languages were German, English, and French.&lt;ref name=unige.ch&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources and general information about selected international congresses - Appendix n°2|url=http://www.unige.ch/fapse/SSE/erhise/pdf/Appendix2ESHHS01.pdf|publisher=Université de Genève|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Moral Education League of London was founded in 1897. This organization exercised a considerable influence, not only in the United Kingdom but in various parts of the British Empire and throughout the world. Its president was [[John Stuart Mackenzie]]. Among its members were Catholics, Anglicans, Jews, Unitarians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Nonconformists, Ethicists, Rationalists, Positivists, and others. Its secretary was Harrold Johnson, who was later appointed Hon. Secretary of the International Moral Education Congress Executive Council. The league also employed a demonstrator, [[Frederick James Gould]], who acquired an international reputation for his numerous 
books on moral lessons. This League succeeded in 1906 in inducing the Board of Education to make provision for moral instruction in the education code for England and Wales.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aikins|first1=J.A.M.|title=Report on the second International Moral Education Congress at The Hague, August, 1912 and as related thereto moral instruction in the Canadian public schools|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7062408M/Report_on_the_second_International_Moral_Education_Congress_at_The_Hague_August_1912|location=Ottawa|pages=3-|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, a new Italian Education Code was published, laying the utmost stress on moral education and making detailed regulations with regard to moral instruction. In the following year, a new Hungarian Education Code was issued. In 1905, a new Austrian Education Code came to light. In Portugal, a manual of Moral Instruction for Primary Schools, as distinct from Religious Instruction, was officially published in 1906. In the United States, schemes of moral instruction were elaborated in many places. In Germany, the Reading Books for Elementary Schools contained abundance of ethical matter. In Switzerland, several Cantons took distinct steps in the direction of drawing up Moral Instruction Programmes. In Belgium, Moral Instruction Syllabuses for Primary Schools and for Training Colleges existed. In France and Japan, where moral instruction was introduced, the subject was being studied with redoubled interest. In Russia, the authorities were turning their attention to this subject. And, finally, in England, the Code of the Board of Education for 1906 stated that "Moral instruction should form an important part of every school curriculum". Educationists generally laid increasing emphasis on the moral factor in education, while men in every walk of life came more and more to feel that the training of the intellect must be accompanied by the development of character if the school is to serve effectively the nation and humanity. This movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the [[Ethical movement]].&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt;

==1908==
[[File:Sir Michael Ernest Sadler photo by George Charles Beresford 1914.jpg|thumbnail|Sir Michael Ernest Sadler, president of the First Congress]]
The First Congress was held at the [[University of London]], London, England, on September 25–29, 1908.&lt;ref name=archive.org1st&gt;{{cite web|author1=International Moral Education Congress|author2=Spiller, Gustav|title=Papers on moral education, communicated to the first International Moral Education Congress held at the University of London September 25-29, 1908; (1908)|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924030610954|publisher=Cornell University Library|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]] served as president. The Congress counted altogether some 1,800 members and 2,000 volumes of the Papers on Moral Education were disposed of within less than four weeks after the first Congress met.&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt; Both the educational magazines and the leading daily papers rendered valuable assistance to the Congress. There were sessions on the following topics: The Principles of Moral Education; Aims, Means and Limitations in the various types of schools; Character Building by Discipline, Influence and Opportunity; the Problems of Moral Instruction; Relation of Religious Education to Moral Education; Systematic Moral Instruction; The Relation of Moral Education to Education under Other Aspects; the Problem of Moral Education under varying conditions of Age and Opportunity; Biology and Moral Education.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913 /&gt;

==1912==
The Second Congress was held at the Hague, August 22–27, 1912.&lt;ref name=archive.org2nd&gt;{{cite web|author1=International Moral Education Congress|author2=Aikins, James Albert Manning|title=Report on the second International Moral Education Congress at The Hague, August, 1912, and as related thereto moral instruction in the Canadian public schools (1913)|url=https://archive.org/details/reportonthesecon00unknuoft|publisher=University of Toronto Libraries|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. J. Th. Mouton was the President of the Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="The1912"&gt;{{cite book|title=British Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VUwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA488|edition=Public domain|year=1912|publisher=The Publisher's Circular Limited|pages=488–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following twenty-three countries sent official government delegates: Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chili, China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Haiti, Hungary, India (British), Ireland, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Romania, South Australia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and Tunis. Over 1,000 members (apart from honorary members) were officially enrolled for the congress. Over 200 papers of some 2,000 words each were contributed and appeared in the five published volumes of more than 1,200 pages. The subjects dealt with and under discussion at the various sessions were: Moral Education and Character Building considered from the Denominationalist, the Undenominationalist and the Independent-Moralist points of view; Moral Education considered from social and national points of view Formation of the Will; Physical Training as a means of Character-Building; Moral Education considered from a Practical Point of View; the Moral Education of Adolescents; Character-Building in family life and in society at large; Character-Building of young people at educational institutions not dedicated to the ordinary primary education; Character-Building of Abnormal Children. This Congress stated it would not advocate the views of any society or party, but it would afford to all who are interested in moral education, whatever their religious or ethical convictions, nationality and point of view, an equal opportunity of expressing their opinions and comparing them with those of others. This proved so good a basis that the congress with unanimity adopted it as the basis of future congresses, with the addition of the following object: The object of the Congress is to enlist the active co-operation of all, irrespective of race, nations, and creed, in promoting the work of moral education. The first aim of the Second Congress, as of the first, was to cultivate the co-operation of men and women representing different schools of thought in matters of education, giving every one an opportunity in the spirit of toleration, of defining and explaining his opinion and point of view.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913 /&gt;

==1922==
[[File:AdolpheFerriereND.jpg|thumbnail|Adolphe Ferriere, president of the Third Congress]]
The Third Congress met in the Aula, or Assembly Hall, of the [[University of Geneva]], July 28 to August 1, 1922.&lt;ref name=archive.org3rd&gt;{{cite web|title=International Moral Education Congress|publisher=JSTOR|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-2377499/2377499_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 members attended, representing 30 nationalities and 29 national committees. Thirty-three papers were contributed, all being published in French, in two volumes, by Delachaux, at Neuchatel. The topics were confined to (1) the international motive, with special reference to the teaching of history; and (2) the motive of service. [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] gave the inaugural address on behalf of the International Executive Council (London), and was followed by the newly elected president of the Congress, Dr. [[Adolphe Ferrière]], who was an  advocate of [[progressive education]]. Among the speakers during the eight sessions, perhaps the most popular were three—Professor Foerster; [[Albert Thomas (minister)|M. Albert Thomas]], Director of the Labor Office of the League of Nations; and [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of the Scout Movement. A special session was held in the hall of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, chaired by [[Gustav Spiller]], which included [[Nitobe Inazō]], Director of the Section of International Bureaus. The Congress approved of the establishment of an International Moral Education Bureau at the Hague, and decided to form a permanent association of educationists of the world, based on the 29 national committees already existing.&lt;ref name="National1921"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Education Association of the United States|title=Today's Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2IVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA316|edition=Public domain|year=1921|publisher=National Education Association|pages=316–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1926==
The Fourth Congress took place in [[Rome]], Italy, from September 28 to October 2, 1926. Francesco Orestano served as president.&lt;ref name="League1925"&gt;{{cite book|title=Quarterly Bulletin of Information on the Work of International Organisations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV8oAQAAMAAJ|year=1925|publisher=League of Nations|page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1934==
The Sixth Congress took place in [[Krakow]], Poland, September 11–14, 1934.&lt;ref name="Character1935"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Sixth International Moral Education Congress, 1934, Krakow, Poland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8f7gHAAACAAJ|year=1935|publisher=Character Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly review==
In 2004, Marco Cicchini of the University of Geneva published his study based on a review of the proceedings and publications of the six congresses. He synthesized the congresses' aims and ideals, the theoretical and institutional outlines, the socio-professional profiles of the participants, the status of their contributions, and the disciplines invited to discuss the issues. He also noted on the changes which led to the disappearance of the congress.&lt;ref name=Paedagogica2004&gt;{{cite journal|title=Un bouillon de culture pour les sciences de l'éducation?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7678">Many believe this to be an impossible paradigm (see below) but it's the basis of nuclear fusion. In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles. The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of energy. So, what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? The colliders combine and create energy. 

The '''unstoppable force paradox''', also called the '''irresistible force paradox''', '''shield and spear paradox''', is a classic [[paradox]] formulated as "What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?" The immovable object and the unstoppable force are both implicitly assumed to be indestructible, or else the question would have a trivial resolution. Furthermore, it is assumed that they are two entities.

The paradox arises because it rests on two incompatible premises: that there can exist simultaneously such things as ''unstoppable forces'' and ''immovable objects''. The "paradox" is flawed because if there exists an unstoppable force, it follows logically that there cannot be any such thing as an immovable object and vice versa.&lt;ref name=NFLS&gt;

== Origins ==
An example of this paradox in non-western thought can be found in the origin of the Chinese word for contradiction ({{zh|c=矛盾|p=máodùn|l=spear-shield}}). This term originates from a story in the 3rd century BC philosophical book ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Han Feizi'' (韓非子), chapter 36, ''Nanyi'' (難一 "Collection of Difficulties, No. 1")'.&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, a man was trying to sell a spear and a shield. When asked how good his spear was, he said that his spear could pierce any shield. Then, when asked how good his shield was, he said that it could defend from all spear attacks. Then one person asked him what would happen if he were to take his spear to strike his shield;  the seller could not answer. This led to the idiom of "''zìxīang máodùn''" (自相矛盾, "from phrase spear shield"), or "self-contradictory".

Another ancient and mythological example illustrating this theme can be found in the story of the [[Teumessian fox]], who can never be caught, and the hound [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], who never misses what it hunts. Realizing the [[paradox]], [[Zeus]] turns both creatures into static stars.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Applications ==
The problems associated with this paradox can be applied to any other conflict between two abstractly defined extremes that are opposite.

One of the answers generated by seeming paradoxes like these is that there is no contradiction – that there is a [[false dilemma]]. Dr. Christopher Kaczor suggested that the need to change indicates a lack of power rather than the possession thereof, and as such a person who was omniscient would never need to change their mind – not changing the future would be consistent with omniscience rather than contradicting it.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczor, Christopher (2009). ''This Rock'', 20(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, an unstoppable force, an object or force with infinite [[inertia]], would be consistent with the definition of an immovable object, in that they would be one and the same. Any object whose momentum or motion cannot be changed is an immovable object, and it would halt any object that moved relative to it, making it an unstoppable force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=minutephysics|title=Immovable Object vs. Unstoppable Force - Which Wins?|date=2013-01-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eKc5kgPVrA|accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deterministic universe may contain more than one of such forces/objects as long as they are never determined to meet in the entire history of such a universe.  Indeed, in the context of such a universe, one could redefine the words "irresistible" and "immovable" to "is never successfully resisted" and "is never successfully moved" (within the fixed history of said deterministic universe) instead of the counterfactual possibilities.  This is similar to the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] of the [[grandfather paradox]] in time-travel scenarios.

==Cultural references==

In [[Iain Banks]]'s novel, ''[[Walking on Glass]]'', a supremely satisfying solution to the paradox is given.

In [[DC Comics]]' ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]], [[Superman]] encounters the Ultrasphinx, who asks "What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object?", to which Superman answers "They surrender."

At Wrestlemania III, color commentator [[Gorilla Monsoon]] described the match of [[Andre the Giant]] vs [[Hulk Hogan]] as "The irresistible force meeting the immovable object."

In the film ''Imagine Me And You'' (2005) the irresistible force paradox is a recurring theme first mentioned by H and last referenced by Heck who compares Rachel's love for Luce as the unstoppable force and himself as the immovable object saying, "What you're feeling is the unstoppable force, which means I have to move."

In ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', [[KITT]] references the paradox when he was faced with the possibility of having a [[Head-on collision]] with his prototype version called KARR, who has most of KITT's abilities including a nearly indestructible body.

In [[DC Comics|DC]]'s film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008), [[the Joker]] references the irresistible force paradox in both his final scene, as well as his final dialogue between himself and [[Batman]]. The Joker attempts to ultimately explain the reason for Batman's inability to shed his Batman identity, saying, "You just couldn't let me go, could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You truly are incorruptible, aren't you, huh? You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever."

In the video game World of Warcraft, players could gain a mace named "[https://www.wowhead.com/item=19323 The Unstoppable Force]" and a shield called "[https://www.wowhead.com/item=19321 The Immovable Object]". And humorously, there also appears an apparent resolution to the paradox with "[https://www.wowhead.com/item=25402 The Stoppable Force]" and "[https://www.wowhead.com/item=25407 The Movable Object]".

The rock band [[Jane's Addiction]] use this paradox in the lyrics of the song "Irresistible Force" on their album "The Great Escape Artist" (2011)

In season 5, episode 13 of [[Burn notice]], Oswald refers to [[Michael Westen]] as an "unstoppable force", and refers to himself as an "immovable object". (2011)

'''Kermit Alan Washington''' (born September 17, 1951) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player. Washington is best remembered for punching opposing player [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] during an on-court fight in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Liz. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A12FD3E5F0C738FDDA80894DD404482&amp;pagewanted=2 Inside the N.B.A.; Three Decades Later, Washington Still Feels Effects of His Punch], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 30, 2005, accessed November 17, 2010.&lt;br&gt;*Zirin, Dave. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/dave_zirin/09/08/punch/ Kermit Washington reaches out to Oregon RB LeGarrette Blount], sportsillustrated.com, September 8, 2009, accessed November 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His punch nearly killed Tomjanovich, and resulted in severe medical problems that ultimately ended Tomjanovich's playing career. 

Washington was not a highly coveted player coming out of high school and barely got into college on an athletic scholarship. He averaged a mere four points per game (ppg) during his senior season of high school. He improved rapidly once at [[American University]], and became one of only seven players in [[NCAA]] history to average 20 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 20 rebounds throughout the course of their career.

A big defensive forward, Washington was known for his ability to gather [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]. He averaged 9.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in ten [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) seasons and played in the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] once. Washington was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] with the fifth overall pick in the [[1973 NBA draft]]. He played sparingly his first three seasons, and sought the help of retired basketball coach [[Pete Newell]] before his fourth season. Under Newell's tutelage, Washington's game rapidly improved and he became a starter for several teams. He played for the Lakers, [[Boston Celtics]], [[San Diego Clippers]], [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and [[Golden State Warriors]].

==Early life==
Kermit Washington's mother Barbara&lt;ref name="Fn110"&gt;Feinstein pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; graduated from Miner's Teacher's College (later subsumed into [[Howard University]]), where she was an excellent student; his father Alexander was an [[Radiologic technologist|X-ray technician]].&lt;ref name="Fn110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halb"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Washington had a rough childhood.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; When he was three years old, his parents had a fight in which his maternal uncle became involved and in which someone violently attacked his uncle with an iron.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; His parents soon divorced, with his father awarded custody of the children. His mother, who suffered from [[bipolar disorder]], then took him and his older brother Eric from their father on an ill-advised sojourn for which they were poorly prepared.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt; Struggling to find money to feed the children, she eventually called their father, who came and took them back.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; His stay with his father did not last long, and he and his brother were passed around to various relatives on both sides of the family.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt;

The effect of being shuttled into and out of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth.&lt;ref name="halb2"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while.&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt; After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt; However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother.&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, [[Chris Washington|Chris]].&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood.&lt;ref name="halb3"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 258&lt;/ref&gt; He had to retake many of his classes in [[summer school]] to raise his grades.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt; When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.&lt;ref name="halb3"/&gt;

As a senior in high school, Washington stood {{height|ft=6|in=4}} but weighed a mere 150&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref name="halb3"/&gt; After some rare positive feedback by his biology teacher, Barbara Thomas, he began to study and put forth a greater effort in that class.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; He quickly became a solid student in biology but poor in all other subjects.&lt;ref name="halb4"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 259&lt;/ref&gt; When Thomas became his [[home room]] teacher and saw his grades in other classes she encouraged him to try hard in all of his courses.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Washington rapidly improved his marks, making the honor roll in his senior year.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;

His basketball performance in high school was unimpressive.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench to average four [[points per game]] (ppg).&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt; His stepmother informed him that when he graduated from high school he would be thrown out of the house.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; Chris had been able to leave home on a [[athletic scholarship|football scholarship]] and would later play in the [[National Football League]], but Washington himself had nowhere to go.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; He trained for three hours a day toward the end of his senior season, and showed up uninvited at a [[streetball|playground game]] featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 116–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Young (basketball coach)|Tom Young]], who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland to become head coach at [[American University]], saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==College years==
During the summer between his senior year of high school and his freshman year of college, Washington grew four inches.&lt;ref name="halb261"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 261&lt;/ref&gt; He began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; He has frequently described his college years as "the happiest time in my life."&lt;ref name="Fn150"/&gt; He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="halb262"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams.&lt;ref name="halb262"/&gt; He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American.&lt;ref name="bref"&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/washike01.html Kermit Washington], basketball-reference.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his senior year of high school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.&lt;ref name="halb263"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

He averaged 18.6 points on 46.8 percent shooting and 20.5 rebounds in his first year of varsity basketball.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He still played a somewhat unaggressive or "soft" brand of basketball, and it was hurting his chances of being drafted by a professional team.&lt;ref name="halb264"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Between his sophomore and junior years he began lifting weights with Trey Coleman, a former football player from the [[University of Nebraska]] who was studying as an [[undergrad]] at American.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman encouraged him to be more aggressive on the court, and Washington told him that it was not in his nature. Coleman admonished him, telling him he could not afford to be "cool" on the court given his talent level if he wanted to join the pro ranks.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt; Washington was named an academic All-American his junior year. He averaged 21.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting and an [[List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders|NCAA-leading]] 19.8 rebounds in his junior season.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2010/D1.pdf 2009–10 NCAA Men's Basketball Records], ncaa.org, accessed November 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was drafted after his junior season by the [[New York Nets]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) and offered a four-year contract for $100,000 a year, which astonished him.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to stay at American with coach Young for his senior season because he felt he owed the school which had given him a chance when he was coming out of a difficult period in high school.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt; He was offered an invite to try for the 1972 [[United States men's national basketball team|Olympic basketball team]] after the season, but did not make the squad.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 147–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington was one of the best players in the country going into his senior season.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; He marveled at newspaper reports in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that mentioned "coaches of opposing teams and how they were planning to stop ''Kermit Washington''."&lt;ref name="halb265"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; He led the nation in rebounding again in his senior season.&lt;ref name="NCAA"/&gt; He was a [[1973 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|second team All-American]], and helped American into the [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT). In the last game of his college career, Washington needed to score 39 points to average 20 points and 20 rebounds a game for his career in college. He became extremely nervous before the game and could neither eat nor sleep.&lt;ref name="Fn150"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; The game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on his feet when he was introduced before the raucous crowd. He managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a 3.37 [[Grade (education)|GPA]] and a degree in [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="paroxy"&gt;Moore, Matt. [http://www.hardwoodparoxysm.com/2010/07/28/words-on-pages-the-punch-by-john-feinstein/ Words on Pages: "The Punch" by John Feinstein], hardwoodparoxysm.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences his senior year.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt;

==Professional years==
Washington was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the [[1973 NBA draft]]. A week before the team began training camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He had a difficult time making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. In basketball, many players succeed in high school and college due to superior physical skills, but when they arrive in the professional ranks, they are typically going against players that are often as physically gifted as them.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 265-66&lt;/ref&gt; Washington also had played in a primarily [[zone defense]] system in college and was not versed in [[man-to-man defense]], which is more common in the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby. pgs. 170–1&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived on a team which had legend [[Jerry West]], who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in him becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolves.nba.com/history/players/west_bio.html Jerry West bio], nba.com, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Though healthy,&lt;ref name="halb266"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt; he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be "labeled soft."&lt;ref name="Fn181"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The injury would bother him the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="Fn181"/&gt; He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult.&lt;ref name="halb266"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach [[Bill Sharman]], was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.&lt;ref name="halb266"/&gt;

[[File:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|Los Angeles acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975. "He was my hero", Washington later said. "It was a dream come true."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul-Jabbar would later play an important role in the fight that changed Washington's life.]]
Entering his fourth season, Washington knew the only thing keeping him in the league was his guaranteed contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off.&lt;ref name="halb267"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies.&lt;ref name="halb267"/&gt; Washington was particularly disturbed when in a game against [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]], he got into an awkward collision with [[Rick Barry]], upon which Barry remarked: "Listen, you better learn how to play this game."&lt;ref name="halb267"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted [[Pete Newell]] at the recommendation of an agent.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 27–8&lt;/ref&gt; Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers,&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt; and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 25–6&lt;/ref&gt; In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions over the course of his long career, and was not especially attached to Washington.&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt; He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills.&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day.&lt;ref name="halb268"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball.&lt;ref name="gf"&gt;Bucher, Ric.

Newell had Washington watch tapes of [[Paul Silas]], who was a rebounding forward for the [[Boston Celtics]], and convinced him to have more confidence in his offensive game.&lt;ref name="halb269"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 269&lt;/ref&gt; He reworked Washington's game from the ground up, and in so doing established a name for himself as a tremendous coach of big men—he would later conduct a yearly "Big Man Camp" in Hawaii which was attended by hundreds of NBA players.&lt;ref&gt;Bucher, Ric. [http://sports.espn.go.com/magazine/vol4no19bigmancamp.html The Godfather], espn.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Los Angeles had acquired [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], and Washington's style of play complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player.&lt;ref name="halb269"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 38–9&lt;/ref&gt; Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds;&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; however, he struggled with [[tendinitis]] in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 269-70&lt;/ref&gt; Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against [[Denver Nuggets|Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 270-71&lt;/ref&gt; "I could feel it tearing inside. I looked down, and my kneecap was hanging on the side of my leg."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.&lt;ref name="halb271"&gt;Halberstam pg. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Newell was the person to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was probably over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting.&lt;ref name="halbNe"&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 271-72&lt;/ref&gt; His leg had [[atrophy|atrophied]] from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas and told him that if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder.&lt;ref name="halbNe"/&gt; Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8).&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills.&lt;ref name="BS89"&gt;Simmons. pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, "Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna Hurt My Teammates."&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papanek, John. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092961/index.htm 'nobody, But Nobody, Is Going To Hurt My Teammates'], ''Sports Illustrated'', October 31, 1977, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infamous punch===
On December 9, 1977, during an NBA game between the Lakers and the [[Houston Rockets]], a scuffle broke out between several players at midcourt.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt;

The events that precipitated the fight have been frequently debated, and variously interpreted.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt; Two months earlier, on opening night of the season, the Lakers played the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. Bucks center [[Kent Benson]] elbowed Abdul-Jabbar in the stomach, and Abdul-Jabbar appeared to be in intense pain. Abdul-Jabbar then punched Benson from behind, breaking Benson's jaw and his own hand.&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt; Washington got into a brawl with several [[Buffalo Braves]] players a few games later.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby. pgs. 171–2&lt;/ref&gt; In the December game, at the beginning of the game's second half, Lakers guard [[Norm Nixon]] missed a shot. Houston's [[Kevin Kunnert]] and Washington both contended for the rebound, which Kunnert eventually got and passed out to teammate [[John Lucas II|John Lucas]]. Their battle for the rebound was more physical than usual, however. Abdul-Jabbar became involved and wrestled with Kunnert. As a result, Kermit Washington stayed behind in the backcourt in order to watch over and make sure nothing happened. After the two disengaged, Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts in order to prevent him from getting back over on offense quickly. Kunnert threw an elbow that hit Washington on the upper arm and this move spun him around so that he was facing Washington. What happened next is disputed: Washington, several Lakers, and Rocket forward [[Robert Reid (basketball)|Robert Reid]] insisted that Kunnert punched him, Kunnert said Washington swung first after he attempted to free himself from Washington's grasp. The referee who saw the action saw merely a "scuffle" between Kunnert and Abdul-Jabbar followed by the one between Kunnert and Washington then Washington's punch.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 78, 266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt; Both Washington and Abdul-Jabbar reject this account.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt;

Abdul-Jabbar then ran up behind Kunnert and grabbed his arms to try to pull him away from the scuffle.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OpAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HeEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=973,5148642&amp;dq=kermit-washington&amp;hl=en Washington Down and Out], ''[[Kentucky New Era]]'', December 10, 1977, accessed November 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; But this only left him defenseless for Washington's first punch, which hit Kunnert in the head and brought him down on one knee.&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt;

Washington saw Tomjanovich running toward the altercation. Not knowing that he intended to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a short right-hand punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8&amp;nbsp;mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious in a pool of blood in the middle of the arena. Abdul-Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a melon being dropped onto concrete.&lt;ref name="halb273"&gt;Halberstam. pg 273&lt;/ref&gt; Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1093182/index.htm A Roundup Of The Week Dec. 5-11], ''Sports Illustrated'', December 17, 1977, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Players involved say that right after Tomjanovich collapsed the absence of sound at the arena, which was filled with shocked fans, was "the loudest silence you have ever heard."&lt;ref&gt;Moore, David Leon. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/ccovtue.htm New start from old wounds], November 26, 2002, usatoday.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters heard the sound of the punch all the way in the second floor [[press box]], and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomjanovich was able to get up and walk around, however, and on the way into the locker room he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became aggressive and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs 53–4&lt;/ref&gt; Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggressiveness; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured in such a way that Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIpunch"/&gt; He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said "I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it," and likened the surgery to [[Scotch Tape|Scotch-taping]] together a badly shattered eggshell.&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
Worsening matters for Washington, the only available replay of the incident showed just his punch, not the scuffle that preceded it. This made the attack appear unprovoked,&lt;ref name="BS90"&gt;Simmons. pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', then watched by an average of 30 to 35 million people, replayed the punch countless times as a gag, having cast member [[Garrett Morris]] comically defend the punch.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons. pgs. 90, 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 91–2&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the subject of a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial and investigated on [[CBS News]] by [[Walter Cronkite]].&lt;ref name="SIpunch"&gt;Kirkpatrick, Patrick.

On-court fights had been all too common in the 1970s, often including [[bench-clearing brawl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons. pgs. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied.&lt;ref name="SIpunch"/&gt; However, Washington's punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner [[David Stern]], then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that "you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other."&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt; Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at least his team's next game.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;Kahn, Mike.

Washington received no support from the Lakers front office, aside from a single call the day after the fight from Cooke,&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 82, 92&lt;/ref&gt; and was sent torrents of [[hate mail]] filled with racial epithets.&lt;ref name="cady"&gt;Cady, Steve. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1ZEzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qOsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1254,4343693&amp;dq=kermit-washington&amp;hl=en Kermit Washington explains his version of 'the punch'], ''The New York Times'', reprinted in ''[[The Miami News]]'', December 31, 1977, accessed November 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned.&lt;ref name="BS90"/&gt; Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered,&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt; but ultimately rejected.&lt;ref name="halb274"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 274&lt;/ref&gt; Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court,&lt;ref name="SIpunch"/&gt; he and his wife became ostracized.&lt;ref name="halb275"/&gt; They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son at the time of the punch.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 62, 104&lt;/ref&gt; His wife recalls she and her children were treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 90–1&lt;/ref&gt; and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act.&lt;ref name="halb275"/&gt; The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to Newell's home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.&lt;ref name="halb275"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 275&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bob Ryan.JPG|thumb|Bob Ryan wrote a column on Washington in 1978. Ryan later said, "You couldn't not like the guy when you sat down and talked with him...He never wanted to hurt Rudy the way he did...I felt bad for him."&lt;ref name="Fn2256"/&gt; The article endeared Washington to Celtics fans.&lt;ref name="Fn2256"/&gt; The relationship was short-lived, however; he was traded after playing just 32 games for the team.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;]]

On December 27, 1977, just two weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; [[Red Auerbach]], Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a longtime fan of Washington's.&lt;ref name="halb276"&gt;Halberstam pg. 276&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Pat, stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 220&lt;/ref&gt; He pulled himself together, and began running up and down the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, [[Jerry West]], who was the Lakers coach at the time, told [[John Feinstein]] he still wanted Washington on the roster. Then-general manager [[Bill Sharman]] said he was "on the fence."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 92–3&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke, however, decided to move on.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 100–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington started alongside Hall of Fame center [[Dave Cowens]], who enjoyed playing with Washington, remarking, "It's great fun, you can always hear him grunt when he's rebounding."&lt;ref name="halb276"/&gt; Auerbach said, "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do was going to change the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Washington won Boston fans over immediately.&lt;ref name="BS90"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 226&lt;/ref&gt; His acceptance was aided by a glowing article [[Bob Ryan]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him.&lt;ref name="Fn2256"&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 225–6&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the [[Denver Nuggets]].&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 229–30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Kunnert signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 247–8&lt;/ref&gt; There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[[Associated Press]]. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WbssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LRMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4969,1342232&amp;dq=kermit-washington&amp;hl=en Washington in Awkward Position], ''[[Star-News]]'', September 7, 1978, accessed November 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington and Kunnert became involved in one of the more unusual player transactions in NBA history. Celtics owner [[Irv Levin]] wanted to move closer to his home, and business interests, in [[California]] but also wanted continue to own an NBA team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/celtics/history/Recap_1970s.html 1970s Boston Celtics history], nba.com/celtics, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; To solve this problem, he and [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]], owner of the [[Buffalo Braves]] NBA team, exchanged franchises.&lt;ref name="halb276"/&gt; Washington and Kunnert were two of four Celtics sent to Buffalo as part of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SDC/1979.html San Diego Clippers], basketballreference.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Levin then moved the Buffalo Braves to San Diego, where they were renamed the [[San Diego Clippers]].

In November 1978, San Diego played in Houston. Tomjanovich scored 26 points and collected 11 rebounds while Washington had six and two.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Before the game, the Clippers coach, [[Gene Shue]], had suggested to the Rockets coach, [[Tom Nissalke]], that the players shake hands at center court prior to tipoff. Tomjanovich rejected the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year in San Diego, Washington was traded again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center [[Bill Walton]] even though Walton had missed the entire [[1978–79 NBA season|1978–79 season]] due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert, and [[Randy Smith (basketball)|Randy Smith]] to Portland in exchange for Walton.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; This became the second time Washington and Kunnert were part of the same trade. 

Portland had strongly desired Washington, and their general manager [[Stu Inman]], was a close friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 76&lt;/ref&gt; This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt; To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets' civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles had failed to control Washington. During the trial, numerous players and coaches who were at the game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt; While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 261&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Ramsay]], Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center [[Swen Nater]] when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 260–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington shared time at the Trail Blazers power forward spot with [[Maurice Lucas]] at first, but after Lucas' trade to the [[New Jersey Nets]], he became the full-time starter.&lt;ref name="Fn262"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 262&lt;/ref&gt; He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned a spot in the [[1980 NBA All-Star Game]], after some of the top players sat out due to injury.&lt;ref name="Fn269"/&gt; During that All-Star weekend, which was held in [[Landover, Maryland]], nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season.&lt;ref name="Fn269"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 228–9&lt;/ref&gt; Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the [[1980–81 NBA season|1980–81 season]]. The pain became unbearable during the [[1981–82 NBA season|1981–82 season]], and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;

==Retirement==
Since retiring, Washington has run restaurants and is a founder and operator of a number of [[charitable organization]]s. He ran a restaurant in the Portland metropolitan area with former Blazer teammate [[Kevin Duckworth]], called "Le Slam." The restaurant closed in 2001.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Joe Freeman, [http://www.oregonlive.com/nba/index.ssf/2011/03/kermit_washington.html "Ex-NBA Tough Guy Follows Call to Africa,"] ''The Oregonian'', March 23, 2011, pp. D1, D4.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served in a coaching role with [[Stanford University]], and worked at [[Pete Newell]]'s fabled "Big Man Camp" for 15 years. In 1995, he founded The 6th Man Foundation, otherwise known as Project Contact Africa.&lt;ref name="Syken"&gt;Syken, Bill. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1032489/index.htm#ixzz11t8zrYXC Kermit Washington A onetime NBA pariah delivers medical supplies to an impoverished nation], sportsillustrated.com, July 12, 2004, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1994, Washington accompanied a team of doctors and nurses on a humanitarian mission to [[Goma]], [[Zaire]], working in a [[refugee camp]] helping victims of the bloody [[Rwandan Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; The stench of death and human waste extended for miles. "It was a sad, sad sight", Washington later recalled, "a sight I'll never forget."&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

After his career, Washington has complained of treatment he has received in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich.&lt;ref name="flak"&gt;Wittmershaus, Eric. [http://www.flakmag.com/books/punch.html The Punch], flakmag.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington has sought to portray himself as a victim of the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told ''The New York Times'' that he has been refused work as a coach time and again.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 335–6&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Tom Davis (basketball, born 1938)|Tom Davis]] hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to [[University of Iowa|Iowa]] when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.&lt;ref name="Fn336"/&gt;

Washington also claimed that American University cut off contact with him after he punched Tomjanovich. However, this appears to be a misrepresentation of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: "I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant."&lt;ref name="Fn336"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 336&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Feinstein]] and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight.&lt;ref name="paroxy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt; Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college:&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It was very hard for him to show affection. Sometimes I would ask him directly if he really cared about me, and he would say something like, "I think you're really nice." It was hard for him to be more open than that. He had never really been nurtured, never really been loved. I came to believe if I nurtured him enough, if I loved him enough, he would get past all that. But I don't believe he ever really did.}}

Washington currently lives in the Washington, D.C. area, where he is employed as a regional representative of the [[National Basketball Players Association]].&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

===Crime conviction===
On May 25, 2016, Washington was indicted for allegedly embezzling roughly $500,000 meant for children in Africa.&lt;ref name="indicted"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nba/2016/05/25/kermit-washington-arrested/84906648/ |title=Kermit Washington accused of using charity for gain |date=May 25, 2016 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2017, he pled guilty to three counts: one of aggravated identity theft, and two of making a false statement in a tax return. Washington used the charity to [[Money laundering|launder money]] he received as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]]. Washington, as a regional representative for the [[National Basketball Players Association]], referred NBA players to San Diego attorney Ronald Mix, who then made donations to the charity, but were actually illegal referral payments. Washington then withdrew this money for personal spending. Washington failed to report this money as income on his tax return.&lt;ref name="KCS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rizzo|first1=Tony|title=Washington pleads guilty in KC to African charity fraud|url=http://www.kansascity.com/site-services/legal/copyright/|website=KansasCity.com|publisher=Kansas City Star|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325150137/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article187923149.html|archivedate=March 25, 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison for charity fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former NBA player Kermit Washington sentenced for charity fraud |url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24055695/former-nba-player-kermit-washington-sentenced-charity-fraud |website=ESPN.com |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=July 10, 2018 |date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of [[eponym]]ous laws''' provides links to articles on [[Law (principle)|laws]], [[principle]]s, [[adage]]s, and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. In some cases the person named has coined the law – such as [[Parkinson's law]]. In others, the work or publications of the individual have led to the law being so named – as is the case with [[Moore's law]]. There are also laws ascribed to individuals by others, such as [[Murphy's law]]; or given [[eponym]]ous names despite the absence of the named person.

'''Lucy Burns''' (July 28, 1879 – December 22, 1966) was an American [[suffragist]] and women's rights advocate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;  She was a passionate activist in the [[United States]] and in the [[United Kingdom]]. Burns was a close friend of [[Alice Paul]], and together they ultimately formed the [[National Woman's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 8), Lunardini, 1986 (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Burns was born in New York to an Irish Catholic family.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; She was described by fellow National Woman's Party member [[Inez Haynes Irwin]] as "blue-eyed and fresh-complexioned; dimpled; and her head is burdened, even as Alice Paul's, with an enormous weight of hair." She was extremely beautiful, and lewd men always treated her disrespectfully.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, 1921 (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt; She was a gifted student and first attended Packer Collegiate Institute, or what was originally known as the Brooklyn Female Academy, for second preparatory school in 1890.&lt;ref name="autogenerated29"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Packer Collegiate Institute prided itself on "teaching girls to be ladies", and they emphasized religious education while advocating more liberal ideals such as educating "the mind to habits of thinking with clearness and force."&lt;ref name=autogenerated29 /&gt; Burns also met one of her lifelong role models, Laura Wylie, while attending [[Packer Collegiate Institute]]. Wylie was one of the first women to go to [[Yale University]] Graduate School.&lt;ref name=autogenerated29 /&gt; Burns also attended [[Columbia University]], [[Vassar College]], and Yale University before becoming an English teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 6), Lunardini, 1986 (p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns taught at Erasmus High School in Brooklyn for two years. While Burns enjoyed the educational field, she generally found the experience to be frustrating and wanted to continue her own studies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, at age twenty-seven, she moved to Germany to resume her studies in language.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 8, 14)&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, Burns studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin from 1906 to 1909.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; Burns later moved to the United Kingdom, where she enrolled at [[Oxford University]] to study English.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt; Burns was fortunate enough to have a very extensive educational background because her father, Edwards Burns, supported her and financed her international education.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

==Early activism==

Burns's first major experiences with activism were with the Pankhursts in the United Kingdom from 1909 to 1912.&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; While attending graduate school in Germany, Lucy Burns traveled briefly to England where she met [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p8-9), Barker-Benfield &amp; Clinton, 1991 (p. 456)&lt;/ref&gt; She was so inspired by their activism and charisma that she dropped her graduate studies to stay with them and work in the [[Women's Social and Political Union]], an organization dedicated to fighting for women's rights in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="autogenerated23"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns was employed by the Women's Social and Political Union as a salaried organizer from 1910 to 1912.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; While working with the Pankhursts in the United Kingdom, Lucy Burns became increasingly passionate about activism and participated in numerous campaigns with the WSPU. One of her first major contributions was organizing a parade in [[Edinburgh]] as part of the campaign in Scotland in 1909.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; While Burns is not a widely known speaker from the woman's rights movement, she did make a variety of speeches in marketplaces and on street corners while in Europe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; Her activism resulted in numerous court appearances and reports of "disorderly conduct" in the newspapers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; In August 1909, she hid on the roof of the St Andrew's Hall in [[Glasgow]] She planned to break through the roof and disrupt a political speech by the Earl of Crewe in front of an all-male audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Glasgow Herald |date=21 Aug 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

While working with the WSPU, Lucy Burns met Alice Paul at a London police station.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; Both women had been arrested for demonstrating, and Alice Paul introduced herself when she noticed that Lucy Burns was wearing an American flag pin on her lapel.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, 1921 (p. 9); Lunardini, 1986 (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; The women discussed their suffrage experiences in the United Kingdom and the American women's movement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;Barker-Benfield and Clinton, 1991 (p. 457)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Paul bonded over their frustration with the inactivity and ineffective leadership of the American suffrage movement by [[Anna Howard Shaw]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; Their similar passions and fearlessness in the face of opposition made them quickly become good friends.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; Both women were passionate about activism, and the feminist struggle for equality in the UK inspired Burns and Paul to continue the fight in the United States in 1912.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt;

Suffrage historian [[Eleanor Clift]] compares the partnership of Paul and Burns to that of [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that they "were opposites in appearance and temperament... [w]hereas Paul appeared fragile, Burns was tall and curvaceous, the picture of vigorous health...unlike Paul, who was uncompromising and hard to get along with, Burns was pliable and willing to negotiate. Paul was the militant; Burns, the diplomat."&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 97); Lunardini, 1986 (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their stark differences, Paul and Burns worked together so effectively that followers would often describe them as having "one mind and spirit.".&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==National American Women Suffrage Association==
Upon returning to the United States, Paul and Burns joined the [[National American Women Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) as leaders of its Congressional Committee.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt; Both women felt it was critical to hold the political party in power responsible for a federal suffrage amendment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; By holding an entire party accountable, Paul and Burns believed that congressmen would be forced to take action or risk losing their seats.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; This militant tactic was presented by Paul and Burns at the 1912 NAWSA convention in Philadelphia to Anna Howard Shaw and other NAWSA leaders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; NAWSA leaders rejected their proposal because they felt any action against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which had just won the presidential election, was premature at that point.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; Not willing to back down without a fight, Burns and Paul enlisted the help of [[Jane Addams]], a well-respected and more unorthodox NAWSA leader, to petition their cause to her fellow NAWSA leaders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; While the women were forced to tone down their proposal, NAWSA leaders did authorize a [[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|suffrage parade]] during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[First inauguration of Woodrow Wilson|inauguration]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt;  NAWSA's one stipulation was that Paul and Burns' Congressional Committee would receive no further funding from NAWSA.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; While Burns and Paul readily agreed to this stipulation, this event marked the beginning of their divide with NAWSA.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

==Congressional Union==

Because of the arguments over tactics and funding, Burns and Paul felt it would be best if they added to NAWSA's Congressional Committee and formed a group still associated with NAWSA, but one with its own governing body. This new committee was called the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association.&lt;ref name="autogenerated25"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 34)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns was elected unanimously as an executive member of the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1913, NAWSA decided they wanted to distance themselves from the more radical group and no longer allowed their name to be used in the title, so the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association was renamed just the [[Congressional Union]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated25 /&gt; Despite this, Burns and Paul still wanted the Congressional Union to be associated with NAWSA, so they applied for it to be considered a NAWSA auxiliary.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 36)&lt;/ref&gt; The Congressional Union was granted auxiliary membership, but the relationship remained tenuous.&lt;ref name="autogenerated27"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 44-49)&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to the growing tensions between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted to give them an ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or we will make sure you don't get reelected.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 99)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns stated "Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility."&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt; She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his [[State of the Union address|address to Congress]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt; When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

NAWSA felt they could no longer tolerate the radical tactics employed and advocated by the Congressional Union, and they wanted to officially sever their ties.&lt;ref name=autogenerated27 /&gt; Paul and Burns did not want to start a completely separate organization that could potentially rival NAWSA and hinder progress in the movement, so they tried on numerous occasions to initiate negotiations with NAWSA leaders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 49)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their efforts, the Congressional Union officially split from NAWSA on February 12, 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Many predicted that this split would do irreparable harm to women's campaign for suffrage; the cynics did not discourage Paul and Burns, and they began planning their campaign against the Democrats in the summer of 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In addition to confronting the Democratic Party, Burns and Paul had to address displeased members within their own organization; some women were complaining that the Congressional Union was elitist, authoritarian, and undemocratic.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt; Paul believed centralized authority was critical to accomplishing their goals and operating effectively, so they did not make any drastic changes; to appease their members they solicited suggestions and stated "We would be most grateful for any constructive plan which you can lay before us."&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

While trying to address both internal and external attacks, the Congressional Union worked to keep the Anthony amendment afloat in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 56)&lt;/ref&gt; The Anthony amendment, or Mondell Resolution, was a federal amendment for woman's suffrage and what would ultimately become the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|nineteenth amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 225)&lt;/ref&gt; Since their split from NAWSA, [[Ruth Hanna McCormick]] had become the chairwoman of NAWSA's Congressional Committee.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 55)&lt;/ref&gt; Without consulting the NAWSA Board, she had endorsed the alternative Shafroth-Palmer amendment on their behalf.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; This posed a huge threat to the work of Burns and Paul because the Shafroth amendment, if passed, would make suffrage a states' rights only issue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;  While Burns, Paul, and other women from both the Congressional Union and NAWSA met to address this issue, NAWSA ultimately remained in support of the Shafroth amendment, and the Congressional Union continued its campaign for federal suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 55, 59)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns was the first woman to speak before the Congressional delegates in 1914, when the Anthony amendment finally made it out of committee and into the House.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 61)&lt;/ref&gt; While her speech was primarily intended to set the stage for Alice Paul, she also outlined the accomplishments of the Congressional Union.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  The fact that she was the first to speak at such a critical time for federal suffrage shows not only her courage in the face of opposition, but how well respected she was by her fellow leaders and suffragists. The speeches of Burns and Paul were incredibly important at that time in the movement because they showed politicians that women would unite as a voting bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, the Congressional Union sent two organizers to each of the nine states where women had the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 63)&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns went to [[San Francisco, California]] with suffragist Rose Winslow.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 63); Bland, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing women in these states was not an easy task, and raising adequate funds was found to be particularly troublesome; Burns is quoted as saying "If the women here, however, would only give me the money they are willing to spend on luncheons and dinners I will get along admirably."&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns spread the message about suffrage in theaters, on the streets, by going door-to-door, and by circulating cartoons and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 11)&lt;/ref&gt; By election time in 1914 the Democratic Party had become an extremely vocal critic of the Congressional Union, and ultimately the Congressional Union claimed responsibility for five Democratic losses.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 the Congressional Union decided to put its efforts into organizing in every state that did not already have a branch.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of this plan was to continue what their 1914 state-by-state campaign had started and make suffrage a national issue with demand in every state.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In 1915 Burns also became the editor of the Congressional Union's  newspaper ''The Suffragist''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time period, NAWSA was experiencing a lot of internal strife. After their convention in 1915, Anna Howard Shaw stepped down as president, and many believed this would be a time for potential reconciliation between the Congressional Union and NAWSA.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 81-82)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns and Paul met with NAWSA officials and other women from the Congressional Union at the [[Willard Hotel]] in Washington, D.C. on December 17, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 83)&lt;/ref&gt; NAWSA wanted the Congressional Union to become an affiliate but they had numerous demands—the Congressional Union was to end its anti-Democratic Party campaign and never wage any political campaigns in the future.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 84)&lt;/ref&gt; These demands were viewed as completely unreasonable, and the meeting ended without any reconciliation or possibility of future attempts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==National Woman's Party==
After all of the turmoil of the past few years, Alice Paul announced a radical new plan for 1916—she wanted to organize a woman's political party.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns adamantly supported this plan and on June 5, 6 and 7, 1916 at the Blackstone Theater in Chicago, delegates and female voters met to organize the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP).&lt;ref&gt;Barker-Benfield &amp; Clinton, 1991 (p. 449); Lunardini, 1986 (p. 87)&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Paul were committed to [[direct action]] in fighting for women's rights and particularly their right to vote.  They were opposed by more conservative suffragists who advocated less militant tactics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated27 /&gt;  NAWSA leaders thought the tactics of the National Woman's Party were futile and would alienate Democrats that were sympathetic to suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 1981 (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership in the NWP was limited to only enfranchised women, and their sole goal was promoting a federal amendment for woman's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns played a large role in the National Woman's Party. She worked in virtually every aspect of the organization at one time or another.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, she was a chief organizer, lobby head, newspaper editor, suffrage educator, teacher, orator, architect of the banner campaign, rallying force, and symbol of the NWP.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt;  In Burns 'suffrage schools', she taught women how to conduct automobile campaigns, lobby, and work with the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;  She was savvy with working with the media and supplied two hundred news correspondents with frequent news bulletins.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, 1981 (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Woman's Party led dozens of women to picket the White House in Washington, D.C. as [[Silent Sentinels]] beginning in January 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Barker-Benfield &amp; Clinton, 1991 (p. 449)&lt;/ref&gt;  A bi-partisan organization, it directed its attacks at the office of the President of the United States, in this case, Woodrow Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 91)&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns also opposed World War I, seeing it as a war led by powerful men that resulted in young men being drafted and giving their lives with little free will.&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/national-womans-party-nwp |title=National Woman's Party (NWP) |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=September 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307182835/http://www.history.com/topics/national-womans-party-nwp |archivedate=March 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout her career with the National Woman's Party, Burns was known to have a bitter sense of injustice and become angry because of the actions of the President or apathetic Americans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

==Life in jail==
[[File:Lucy Burns in Occoquan Workhouse.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Lucy Burns in [[Occoquan Workhouse]], [[Washington, D.C.]] ]]

Burns was arrested while picketing the White House and was sent to [[Occoquan Workhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 138)&lt;/ref&gt;  In jail, Burns joined Alice Paul and many other women in hunger strikes to demonstrate their commitment to their cause, asserting that they were political prisoners.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 142)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/profiles.html |title=Visionaries: Lucy Burns (1879-1966) |author= |work=Profiles: Selected Leaders of the National Woman's Party |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burns was prepared for the hunger strikes since she had previously participated in them in Europe with the WSPU.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt;  Being imprisoned did not stop Burns' activism. From within the workhouse she organized protests with other prisoners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;

Burns also helped organize and circulate one of the first documents that defined the status of political prisoners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;  This document described the rights of political prisoners and listed their demands for an attorney, family visits, reading and writing materials, and food from outside the prison.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;  It was circulated through holes in the walls until every suffrage prisoner had signed it.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, 1920; Clift, 2003 (p. 142)&lt;/ref&gt;  Once prison officials realized what Burns was doing, they had her transferred to a district jail and put in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;

After Burns was released, she was quickly rearrested for continuing protests, picketing, and marching at the White House.&lt;ref name="autogenerated24"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 150)&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her third arrest in 1917, the judge aimed to make an example of Burns, and she was given the maximum sentence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;  Once again a prisoner at Occoquan Workhouse, Lucy Burns endured what is remembered as the "[[Night of Terror (event)|Night of Terror]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; The women were treated brutally and were refused medical attention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 151)&lt;/ref&gt; To unite the women, Burns tried to call roll and refused to stop despite numerous threats by the guards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; When they realized Lucy Burns's spirit was not going to be easily broken, they handcuffed her hands above her head to her cell door and left her that way for the entire night.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; Burns was so loved and respected by her fellow suffragists that the women in the cell across from her held their hands above their head and stood in the same position.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; Despite her courage and extraordinary leadership skills, the burden of working so diligently did bother Burns at times; she once told Alice Paul, "I am so nervous I cannot eat or sleep. I am such a coward I ought to be a village seamstress, instead of a Woman's Party organizer."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

After enduring the torture of the "Night of Terror," the women refused to eat for three days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt;  The guards tried to tempt the women with fried chicken, but this was only viewed as an insult; Burns told the other women "I think this riotous feast which has just passed our doors is the last effort of the institution to dislodge all of us who can be dislodged. They think there is nothing in our souls above fried chicken."&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 152)&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing something urgent needed to be done or he would potentially have dead prisoners on his hands, the warden moved Burns to another jail and told the remaining women that the strike was over.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;  He also ordered Burns to be force fed. Historian Eleanor Clift recounts that the force feeding of Lucy Burns required "five people to hold her down, and when she refused to open her mouth, they shoved the feeding tube up her [[nostril]]." This treatment was extremely painful and dangerous, causing Burns to have severe nosebleeds.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;  Of the well-known suffragists of the era, Burns spent the most time in jail.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt;

==Final push for suffrage==

Burns and other suffragists had been told by the chairman of the House Committee on Suffrage that the House would not pass a suffrage amendment before 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 157)&lt;/ref&gt;  To their surprise, it was announced in late 1917 that the House would make a decision on January 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 1981 (p. 5); Clift, 2003 (p. 157)&lt;/ref&gt;  The amendment passed in the House by a vote of 274 to 136, and the women of the NWP, including Burns, began working on the 11 additional votes they would need for the amendment to pass in the Senate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 158)&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately on June 27, 1918, the Senate narrowly failed to pass the amendment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt;

Burns and Paul were enraged, but after coming so close there was no chance that they were going to give up now. They resumed their protests at the White House on August 6, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 162)&lt;/ref&gt; Once again the women were jailed, exposed to horrendous conditions, and released shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 164)&lt;/ref&gt; Their focus then was moved to helping pro-suffrage candidates get elected in November.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 167)&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the NWP did not give allegiance to one party over another; they supported anyone who was willing to support suffrage, and this cost the Democrats their majority in Congress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

As tensions grew between the suffragists and President Wilson, he realized something had to be done quickly to end the highly publicized protests and clashes between the police and suffragists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated26"&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 178)&lt;/ref&gt;  He requested that Congress convene for a special session in May 1919.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt;  On May 21 the House of Representatives passed the Susan B. Anthony amendment 304 to 89, and on June 4, the Senate passed it 66 to 30.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 178-179)&lt;/ref&gt;  Surprisingly, the suffragists were very subdued at the announcement of this victory.&lt;ref&gt;Clift, 2003 (p. 180)&lt;/ref&gt;  The suffragists battle was not yet over; they still had to make sure a majority of the states ratified the amendment. Finally in August 1920, [[Tennessee]] became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the Anthony amendment, and Burns' quest for federal suffrage was finally over.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 1981 (p. 5); Clift, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point Burns was completely exhausted and quoted as saying "I don't want to do anything more. I think we have done all this for women, and we have sacrificed everything we possessed for them, and now let them fight for it now. I am not going to fight anymore."&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 152)&lt;/ref&gt;  All of her time spent in jail and experiences as a suffragist had left her bitter towards married women and others who didn't take action during the suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;Lunardini, 1986 (p. 153)&lt;/ref&gt;  After the women of the United States gained the right to vote, Burns retired from political life and devoted herself to the Catholic Church and her orphaned niece.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/profiles.html |title=Profiles: Selected Leaders of the National Woman's Party |author= |work= |publisher=Library of congress |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She died on December 22, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sicherman|first=Barbara|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period : a Biographical Dictionary, Volume 4|year=1993|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ.

{{Standard model of particle physics}}

A '''Majorana fermion''' ({{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ə|'|r|ɒ|n|ə|_|'|f|ɛər|m|iː|ɒ|n}}&lt;ref name=youtube_pronunciation&gt;{{YouTube| XHUgetdkJmg | "Quantum Computation possible with Majorana Fermions" }}, uploaded 19 April 2013, retrieved 5 October 2014; and also based on [[Ettore Majorana|the physicist's name's pronunciation]].&lt;/ref&gt;), also referred to as a '''Majorana particle''', is a [[fermion]] that is its own [[antiparticle]]. They were hypothesized by [[Ettore Majorana]] in 1937. The term is sometimes used in opposition to a [[Dirac fermion]], which describes fermions that are not their own antiparticles.

With the exception of the [[neutrino]], all of the [[Standard Model]] fermions are known to behave as Dirac fermions at low energy (after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]), and none are Majorana fermions. The nature of the neutrinos is not settled – they may be either Dirac or Majorana fermions.

In [[condensed matter physics]], bound Majorana fermions can appear as [[quasiparticle]] [[Excited state|excitations]] – the collective movement of several individual particles, not a single one, and they are governed by [[Anyon#Non-abelian anyons|non-abelian statistics]].

== Theory ==
The concept goes back to Majorana's suggestion in 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-48095-2_10 |chapter=A symmetric theory of electrons and positrons |title=Ettore Majorana Scientific Papers |pages=201–33 |year=2006 |last1=Majorana |first1=Ettore |last2=Maiani |first2=Luciano |isbn=978-3-540-48091-4 |editor1-first=Giuseppe Franco |editor1-last=Bassani }} Translated from: {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/bf02961314 |title=Teoria simmetrica dell'elettrone e del positrone |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=171–84 |year=1937 |last1=Majorana |first1=Ettore |language=Italian |bibcode=1937NCim...14..171M }}&lt;/ref&gt; that neutral [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-{{frac|1|2}} particles can be described by a real [[relativistic wave equations|wave equation]] (the [[Majorana equation]]), and would therefore be identical to their antiparticle (because the wave functions of particle and antiparticle are related by [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]]).

The difference between Majorana fermions and Dirac fermions can be expressed mathematically in terms of the [[creation and annihilation operators]] of [[second quantization]]: The creation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\dagger}_j&lt;/math&gt; creates a fermion in quantum state &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (described by a ''real'' wave function), whereas the annihilation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; annihilates it (or, equivalently, creates the corresponding antiparticle). For a Dirac fermion the operators &lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\dagger}_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; are distinct, whereas for a Majorana fermion they are identical. The ordinary fermionic annihilation and creation operators &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt; can be written in terms of two Majorana operators &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;f=(\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)/\sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\dagger}=(\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)/\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In supersymmetry models, [[neutralino]]s — superpartners of gauge bosons and Higgs bosons — are Majorana.

=== Identities ===
Another common convention for the normalization of the Majorana fermion [[creation and annihilation operators|operator]] is
:&lt;math&gt;f=(\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)/2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^\dagger=(\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)/2&lt;/math&gt;
This convention has the advantage that the Majorana operator [[idempotence|squares to the identity]].

Using this convention, a collection of Majorana fermions &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;i=1,2,..,n&lt;/math&gt;) obey the following [[commutator|commutation]] identities
*&lt;math&gt;\{\gamma_i,\gamma_j\}=2\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{ijkl} [\gamma_i A_{ij} \gamma_j, \gamma_k B_{kl} \gamma_l]= \sum_{ij}4\gamma_i [A,B]_{ij} \gamma_j &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are [[skew-symmetric matrix|antisymmetric]] matrices.

== Elementary particles ==
Because particles and antiparticles have opposite conserved charges, Majorana fermions have zero charge. All of the elementary fermions of the [[Standard Model]] have gauge charges, so they cannot have fundamental [[Majorana mass]]es.

However, the right-handed [[sterile neutrino]]s introduced to explain [[neutrino oscillation]] could have Majorana masses. If they do, then at low energy (after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]), by the [[seesaw mechanism]], the neutrino fields would naturally behave as six Majorana fields, with three of them expected to have very high masses (comparable to the [[GUT scale]]) and the other three expected to have very low masses (below 1&amp;nbsp;eV). If right-handed neutrinos exist but do not have a Majorana mass, the neutrinos would instead behave as three [[Dirac fermion]]s and their antiparticles with masses coming directly from the Higgs interaction, like the other Standard Model fermions.
[[File:Ettore Majorana.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ettore Majorana]] hypothesised the existence of Majorana fermions in 1937]]

The seesaw mechanism is appealing because it would naturally explain why the observed neutrino masses are so small. However, if the neutrinos are Majorana then they violate the conservation of [[lepton number]] and even of [[B − L]].

[[Double beta decay#Neutrinoless double beta decay|Neutrinoless double beta decay]], which has not (yet) been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Werner |last=Rodejohann |title=Neutrino-less double beta decay and particle physics |journal=[[International Journal of Modern Physics]] |volume=E20 |issue=9 |pages=1833–1930 |year=2011 |doi=10.1142/S0218301311020186 |arxiv=1106.1334 |bibcode=2011IJMPE..20.1833R |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be viewed as two ordinary [[beta decay]] events whose resultant antineutrinos immediately annihilate with each other, and is only possible if neutrinos are their own antiparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= J. |last1=Schechter |first2= J.W.F. |last2=Valle |title=Neutrinoless double beta decay in SU(2) x U(1) – Theories |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=2951–2954 |year=1982 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.25.2951 |bibcode=1982PhRvD..25.2951S |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Majorana bound states ==
In [[Superconductivity|superconducting materials]], Majorana fermions can emerge as (non-fundamental) [[quasiparticle]]s (more commonly referred to as [[Bogoliubov quasiparticles]] in condensed matter physics). This becomes possible because a quasiparticle in a superconductor is its own antiparticle.

Mathematically, the superconductor imposes [[electron hole]] "symmetry" on the quasiparticle excitations, relating the creation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma(E)&lt;/math&gt; at energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to the annihilation operator  &lt;math&gt;{\gamma^{\dagger}(-E)}&lt;/math&gt; at energy &lt;math&gt;-E&lt;/math&gt;. Majorana fermions can be bound to a defect at zero energy, and then the combined objects are called Majorana bound states or Majorana zero modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Frank | last = Wilczek | title = Majorana returns | journal = [[Nature Physics]] | volume=5 | pages=614–618 | date=2009 | doi = 10.1038/nphys1380 | url = http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/Majorana_return434.pdf | issue=9 | bibcode=2009NatPh...5..614W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This name is more appropriate than Majorana fermion (although the distinction is not always made in the literature), because the statistics of these objects is no longer [[Quantum field theory#Fermions|fermionic]]. Instead, the Majorana bound states are an example of [[Anyon#Non-abelian anyons|non-abelian anyons]]: interchanging them changes the state of the system in a way that depends only on the order in which the exchange was performed. The non-abelian statistics that Majorana bound states possess allows them to be used as a building block for a [[topological quantum computer]].&lt;ref name=nayak2008&gt;{{cite journal | title = Non-Abelian anyons and topological quantum computation | journal = [[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 1083–1159 | date = 2008 | first1 = Chetan | last1 = Nayak | first2= Steven H. | last2 = Simon | first3 = Ady | last3 = Stern | first4 = Michael | last4 = Freedman | first5 = Sankar | last5 = Das Sarma | bibcode = 2008RvMP...80.1083N |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1083 | arxiv = 0707.1889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Fu and Kane provided a groundbreaking development by theoretically predicting that Majorana bound states can appear at the interface between [[topological insulators]] and superconductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Liang | last1 = Fu | first2 = Charles L. | last2 = Kane |title=Superconducting Proximity Effect and Majorana Fermions at the Surface of a Topological Insulator|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=10|page=096407|date=2008|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.096407|issue=9|bibcode = 2008PhRvL.100i6407F |arxiv = 0707.1692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Liang | last1 = Fu | first2 = Charles L. | last2 = Kane | title=Josephson current and noise at a superconductor/quantum-spin-Hall-insulator/superconductor junction|journal=[[Physical Review B]]|volume=79|page=161408|date=2009|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.161408|issue=16|bibcode = 2009PhRvB..79p1408F |arxiv = 0804.4469 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposals of a similar spirit soon followed, where it was shown that Majorana bound states can appear even without any topological insulator.

The subtle relation between those trivial bound states and Majorana bound states was reported by the researchers in Niels Bohr Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M.T. Deng|author2=S.

On 16 August 2018, a strong evidence for the existence of Majorana bound states (or Majorana anyons) in an [[iron-based superconductor]], which many alternative trivial explanations cannot account for, was reported by researchers in Prof. Gao Hong-jun's team and Prof. Ding Hong's team at Institute of Physics, [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and [[University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences|University of Chinese Academy of Sciences]], when they used [[scanning tunneling spectroscopy]] on the superconducting Dirac surface state of the iron-based superconductor. It was the first time that Majorana particles were observed in a bulk of pure substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Dongfei|last2=Kong|first2=Lingyuan|last3=Fan|first3=Peng|last4=Chen|first4=Hui|last5=Zhu|first5=Shiyu|last6=Liu|first6=Wenyao|last7=Cao|first7=Lu|last8=Sun|first8=Yujie|last9=Du|first9=Shixuan|date=2018-08-16|title=Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aao1797|journal=Science|pages=eaao1797|doi=10.1126/science.aao1797|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majorana bound states in quantum error correction===

Majorana bound states can also be realized in quantum [[error correcting code]]s.  This is done by creating so called 'twist defects' in codes such as the [[Toric code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bombin|first1=H.|title=Topological Order with a Twist: Ising Anyons from an Abelian Model|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=14 July 2010|volume=105|issue=3|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.030403|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105c0403B|arxiv=1004.1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; which carry unpaired Majorana modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.92.245139 | volume=92 | title=Demonstrating non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions using twist defects | journal=Physical Review B| arxiv=1508.04166 | bibcode=2015PhRvB..92x5139Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The braiding of Majoranas realized in such a way forms a [[projective representation]] of the [[braid group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.87.045130 | volume=87 | title=Twist defects and projective non-Abelian braiding statistics | journal=Physical Review B| arxiv=1208.4834 | bibcode=2013PhRvB..87d5130B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a realization of Majoranas would allow them to be used to store and process [[quantum information]] within a [[Quantum computer|quantum computation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hastings|first1=M. B.|last2=Geller|first2=A.|title=Reduced Space-Time and Time Costs Using Dislocation Codes and Arbitrary Ancillas|journal=QIC|date=2015|volume=15|pages=0962–0986|url=http://www.rintonpress.com/xxqic15/qic-15-1112/0962-0986.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the codes typically have no Hamiltonian to provide suppression of errors, fault-tolerance would be provided by the underlying quantum error correcting code.

      <comment>Removed incorrect insertion. My understanding of the original text is, the parts of the human psyche one can infer from mentalization are thus... But the new addition of "hope" as an example of a feeling is wrong, hope is not a feeling in the standard sense that feelings are basal/primitive/to a degree unconcious and hope is a far more abstract and higher level concept.</comment>

In [[psychology]], '''mentalization''' is the ability to understand the [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]], of oneself or others, that underlies overt [[behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychoanalysis/unit-staff/mentalization_bpd.htm UCL (Psychoanalysis Unit) Peter Fonagy's Homepage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231165607/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychoanalysis/unit-staff/mentalization_bpd.htm |date=2007-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mentalization can be seen as a form of imaginative mental activity that lets us perceive and interpret human behaviour in terms of intentional mental states (e.g., needs, desires, feelings, beliefs, goals, purposes, and reasons).&lt;ref name="mbt"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070812072835/http://www.riksforeningenpsykoterapicentrum.se/pdf-doc/mbt_training_jan06.pdf Psychotherapy for Borderline Personality Disorder.

Affect regulation, mentalization and the development of the self. New York; Other Press&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes described as "understanding misunderstanding." Another term that David Wallin has used for mentalization is "Thinking about thinking".&lt;ref name="Implications of attachment theory"&gt;{{cite book |title='''Implications of attachment theory''' |last=Wallin |first=David |authorlink=David Wallin |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=mentalhelp.net |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_index.php?idx=119&amp;d=1&amp;w=9&amp;e=29433  |accessdate=22 Apr 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentalization can occur either automatically or consciously. Mentalization ability, or mentalizing, is weakened by intense emotion.

While the [[Theory of Mind]] has been discussed in [[philosophy]] at least since [[Descartes]], the concept of mentalization emerged in [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] literature in the late 1960s, and became empirically tested in 1983 when [[Heinz Wimmer]] and [[Josef Perner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–128 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ran the first experiment to investigate when children can understand [[false belief]], inspired by [[Daniel Dennett]]'s interpretation of a [[Punch and Judy]] scene.

The field diversified in the early 1990s when [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] and [[Uta Frith]], building on the Wimmer and Perner study, and others merged it with research on the psychological and biological mechanisms underlying [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Concomitantly, [[Peter Fonagy]] and colleagues applied it to developmental psychopathology in the context of [[Attachment in children|attachment]] relationships gone awry.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J.

Mentalization has implications for [[attachment theory]] and self-development. According to Peter Fonagy, individuals with disorganized attachment style (e.g., due to physical, psychological, or sexual abuse), can have greater difficulty developing the ability to mentalize. Attachment history partially determines the strength of mentalizing capacity of individuals. Securely-attached individuals tend to have had a primary caregiver that has more complex and sophisticated mentalizing abilities. As a consequence, these children possess more robust capacities to [[Representation (psychology)|represent]] the states of their own and other people’s minds. Early childhood exposure to mentalization can protect the individual from psychosocial adversity.&lt;ref name = "mbt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16470710 | doi=10.1002/jclp.20241 | volume=62 | title=Mechanisms of change in mentalization-based treatment of BPD | year=2006 | journal=J Clin Psychol | pages=411–30 | last1 = Fonagy | first1 = P | last2 = Bateman | first2 = AW}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory needs further empirical support.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15337">The [[probability]] of the outcome of an experiment is never negative, although a [[quasiprobability distribution]] allows a '''negative probability''', or '''quasiprobability''' for some events. These distributions may apply to unobservable events or conditional probabilities.

==Physics and mathematics==
In 1942, [[Paul Dirac]] wrote a paper "The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1942.0023|pages=1–39|jstor=97777|title=Bakerian Lecture. The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=180|issue=980|year=1942|last1=Dirac|first1=P. A. M.|bibcode=1942RSPSA.180....1D}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he introduced the concept of [[negative energy|negative energies]] and negative [[probabilities]]:

: "Negative energies and probabilities should not be considered as nonsense.  They are well-defined concepts mathematically, like a negative of money."

The idea of negative probabilities later received increased attention in physics and particularly in [[quantum mechanics]].  [[Richard Feynman]] argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard P. |date=1987 |editor1-last=Peat |editor1-first=F. David |editor2-last=Hiley |editor2-first=Basil |title=Quantum Implications: Essays in Honour of David Bohm |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |pages=235–248 |chapter=Negative Probability |isbn=978-0415069601 |chapter-url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/154856/files/pre-27827.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; that no one objects to using negative numbers in calculations: although "minus three apples" is not a valid concept in real life, negative money is valid. Similarly he argued how negative probabilities as well as probabilities above [[1 (number)|unity]] possibly could be useful in probability [[calculations]].

Mark Burgin gives another example:
{{quote|"Let us consider the situation when an attentive person A with the high knowledge of English writes some text T. We may ask what the probability is for the word “texxt” or “wrod” to appear in his text T. Conventional probability theory gives 0 as the answer. However, we all know that there are usually misprints. So, due to such a misprint this word may appear but then it would be corrected. In terms of extended probability, a negative value (say, −0.1) of the probability for the word “texxt” to appear in his text T means that this word may appear due to a misprint but then it’ll be corrected and will not be present in the text T."|Mark Burgin|{{cite arXiv  |authorlink= |eprint=1008.1287 |title= Interpretations of Negative Probabilities|class= physics.data-an|year= 2010|version= |last1= Burgin|first1= Mark}}  }}

Negative probabilities have later been suggested to solve several problems and [[paradoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. Y. (1997): ''Non-Archimedean Analysis: Quantum Paradoxes, Dynamical Systems and Biological Models''. Kluwer Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7923-4800-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half-coins'' provide simple examples for negative probabilities. These strange coins were introduced in 2005 by [[Gábor J. Székely]].&lt;ref&gt;Székely, G.J. (2005) [http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf Half of a Coin: Negative Probabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108010759/http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf |date=2013-11-08 }}, Wilmott Magazine July, pp 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Half-coins have infinitely many sides numbered with 0,1,2,... and the positive even numbers are taken with negative probabilities. Two half-coins make a complete coin in the sense that if we flip two half-coins then the sum of the outcomes is 0 or 1 with probability 1/2 as if we simply flipped a fair coin.

In ''[[Convolution quotient]]s of nonnegative definite functions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages= 235–239|doi=10.1007/BF01352002|title=Convolution quotients of nonnegative functions|journal=Monatshefte für Mathematik|volume=95|issue=3|year=1983|last1=Ruzsa|first1=Imre Z.|last2=SzéKely|first2=Gábor J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Algebraic Probability Theory'' &lt;ref&gt;Ruzsa, I.Z. and Székely, G.J. (1988): ''Algebraic Probability Theory'', Wiley, New York {{ISBN|0-471-91803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Imre Z. Ruzsa]] and [[Gábor J. Székely]] proved that if a [[random variable]] X has a signed or quasi distribution where some of the probabilities are negative then one can always find two random variables, Y and Z, with ordinary (not signed / not quasi) distributions such that X, Y are independent and X + Y = Z in distribution. Thus X can always be interpreted as the "difference" of two ordinary random variables, Z and Y. If Y is interpreted as a measurement error of X and the observed value is Z then the negative regions of the distribution of X are masked / shielded by the error Y.

Another example known as the Wigner distribution in [[phase space formulation|phase space]], introduced by [[Eugene Wigner]] in 1932 to study quantum corrections, often leads to negative probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=749–759|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.40.749|title=On the Quantum Correction for Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Physical Review|volume=40|issue=5|year=1932|last1=Wigner|first1=E.|bibcode=1932PhRv...40..749W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it has later been better known as the [[Wigner quasiprobability distribution]]. In 1945, [[M. S. Bartlett]] worked out the mathematical and logical consistency of such negative valuedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bartlett | first=  M. S.| year = 1945| title= Negative Probability | journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 41| pages=  71–73 | doi = 10.1017/S0305004100022398|bibcode = 1945PCPS...41...71B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wigner distribution function is routinely used in [[physics]] nowadays, and provides the cornerstone of [[Weyl quantization|phase-space quantization]]. Its negative features are an asset to the formalism, and often indicate quantum interference.  The negative regions of the distribution are shielded from direct observation by the quantum [[uncertainty principle]]: typically, the moments of such a non-positive-semidefinite quasiprobability distribution are highly constrained, and prevent ''direct measurability'' of the negative regions of the distribution. But these regions contribute negatively and crucially to the [[expected value]]s of observable quantities computed through such distributions, nevertheless.

=== An example: the double slit experiment ===

Consider a double slit experiment with photons. The two waves exiting each slit can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;f_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;f_2(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the distance to the detection screen, ''a'' is the separation between the two slits, ''x'' the distance to the center of the screen, ''λ'' the wavelength and ''dN/dt'' is the number of photons emitted per unit time at the source. The amplitude of measuring a photon at distance ''x'' from the center of the screen is the sum of these two amplitudes coming out of each hole, and therefore the probability that a photon is detected at position ''x'' will be given by the square of this sum:

&lt;math&gt;I(x) = \left\vert f_1(x)+f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 + \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 + \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;,

This should strike you as the well-known probability rule:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{either}\,\,\mathtt{slit})
 = \,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1}) \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2}) \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits}) \\ \\
=\,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1})\,P(\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1}) \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2})\,P(\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2}) \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits}) \\ \\
=\,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1})\,\frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2})\,\frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Negative joint probability 2.svg|thumb|In blue, the sum of the probabilities of going through holes 1 and 2; in red, minus the joint probability of going through "both holes". The interference pattern is obtained by adding the two curves.]]whatever the last term means. Indeed, if one closes either one of the holes forcing the photon to go through the other slit, the two corresponding intensities are

&lt;math&gt;I_1(x) = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;I_2(x) = \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

But now, if one does interpret each of these terms in this way, the joint probability takes negative values roughly every &lt;math&gt;\lambda\frac{d}{a}&lt;/math&gt; !&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} I_{12}(x) &amp; = \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right] \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\sin\left[(h/\lambda)(\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}-\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2})\right] \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, these negative probabilities are never observed as one can't isolate the cases in which the photon "goes through both slits", but can hint at the existence of anti-particles.

== Finance ==

Negative probabilities have more recently been applied to [[mathematical finance]]. In quantitative finance most probabilities are not real probabilities but pseudo probabilities, often what is known as [[risk neutral]] probabilities.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} These are not real probabilities, but theoretical "probabilities" under a series of assumptions that helps simplify calculations by allowing such pseudo probabilities to be negative in certain cases as first pointed out by Espen Gaarder Haug in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Haug, E. G. (2004): [http://www.espenhaug.com/NegativeProbabilitiesHaug.pdf Why so Negative to Negative Probabilities], Wilmott Magazine, Re-printed in the book (2007); Derivatives Models on Models, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

A rigorous mathematical definition of negative probabilities and their properties was recently derived by Mark Burgin and Gunter Meissner (2011). The authors also show how negative probabilities can be applied to financial [[option pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1773077  Burgin and Meissner: Negative Probabilities in Financial Modeling] Wilmott Magazine March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engineering ==

The concept of negative probabilities have also been proposed for reliable facility location models where facilities are subject to negatively correlated disruption risks when facility locations, customer allocation, and backup service plans are determined simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=L.V.|last2=Daskin|first2=M.S.|date=2005|title=Reliability Models for Facility Location: The Expected Failure Cost Case|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.1040.0107|journal=Transportation Science|volume=39|issue=3|pages=400–416|doi=10.1287/trsc.1040.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=T.|last2=Ouyang|first2=Y.|last3=Shen|first3=Z-J.

This approach reduces a problem from one with correlated disruptions to one without. Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=Li|first2=X.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=|year=2015|title=Decomposition of general facility disruption correlations via augmentation of virtual supporting stations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515001290|journal=Transportation Research Part B|volume=80|pages=64–81|doi=10.1016/j.trb.2015.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; later showed how negatively correlated disruptions can also be addressed by the same modeling framework, except that a supporting station now may be disrupted with a “failure propensity” which

“... inherits all mathematical characteristics and properties of a failure probability except that we allow it to be larger than 1...”

This finding paves ways for using compact mixed-integer mathematical programs to optimally design reliable location of service facilities under site-dependent and positive/negative/mixed disruption correlations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=An|first2=K.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=2017|title=Planning of Facility Location under Correlated Facility Disruptions|url=|journal=Under Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed “propensity” concept in Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; turns out to be what Feynman and others referred to as “quasi-probability.” Note that when a quasi-probability is larger than 1, then 1 minus this value gives a negative probability. The truly physically verifiable observation is the facility disruption states, and there is no direct information on the station states or their corresponding probabilities. Hence the failure probability of the stations, interpreted as “probabilities of imagined intermediary states,” could exceed unity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2950">'''Paritarian''' (from the French “paritaire”; ”paritair” in Dutch, “paritätische“ in German,  “Paritetico” in Italian) means jointly managed on an equal basis ([[Parity (law)|parity]] basis).

In the field of [[social protection]], '''paritarian institutions''' are non-profit institutions which are jointly managed by the [[social partners]] (representatives of the employers and employees). In other words, the governance of these institutions is based on the equal representation of employees (normally the [[trade unions]]) and employers in their governing bodies.

The social protection funds managed by the paritarian institutions are set up through [[collective agreements]] at the company, the industry-wide (such as construction sector, metal sector, etc.) or the inter-sectoral level, and they can provide several [[social benefits]] such as [[pension]] (in particular occupational pension funds), health care, unemployment, disability, paid holidays and other such benefits.

Within the paritarian model there are two phases: in the negotiation phase, when a collective agreement between the trade unions and the employers’ representatives set up the social fund; and in the management phase, the signatory parties decide to manage their negotiated social funds themselves by establishing a Paritarian Institution in which they are equally represented.

Paritarian Institutions of Social Protection are widespread in Europe, especially in Western Europe and Scandinavia. The combined funds currently managed by the Paritarian Institutions of Social Protection total to a rough estimate of  1.3 trillion euro in assets and cover about 80 million European citizens.

In 1996, a European Organization the European Association of Paritarian Institutions of Social Protection (AEIP) &lt;ref&gt;[http://aeip.net/ European Association of Paritarian Institutions of social protection (AEIP)]&lt;/ref&gt; was created in order to represent the Paritarian Institutions to the European Union. AEIP underlines the specific peculiarities of the Paritarian Institutions compared to other similar actors like private insurance companies or [[mutual organization]]s.

Even though of European origins, paritarian institutions also exist in other parts of the world like in North America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccmp.org/ National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans (NCCMP)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mebco.org/ Multi-Employer Benefit Plan Council of Canada (MEBCO)]&lt;/ref&gt; South America, India and Japan.

The '''philosophy of human rights''' attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of [[human rights]] and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why the concept of human rights developed.

One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.&lt;ref name="IEOP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Human Rights|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH4b|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural rights==

{{Main article|Natural law|Natural right}}

Natural law theories base human rights on a "natural" moral, religious or even biological order that is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.

[[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (δίκαιον φυσικόν ''dikaion physikon''; [[Latin]] ''ius naturale''). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law,&lt;ref&gt;Shellens (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sills (1968, 1972) ''Natural Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the early [[Church Fathers]] sought to incorporate the until then [[paganism|pagan]] concept of natural law into [[Christianity]]. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], and [[John Locke]].

In the 16th century, asked by the Spanish monarchs to investigate the legitimacy of claims to land dominion by the ''indios'' of Latin America, Francisco de Vitoria expounded a theory of natural rights, especially in his famous ''Relectio de Indis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Thomas D.|title=The Pre-Hobbesian Roots of Natural Rights Theory|url=http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao7103-williams.pdf|publisher=Alpha Omega|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] founded a [[social contract|contractualist theory]] of [[legal positivism]] beginning from the principle that man in the state of nature, which is to say without a "commonwealth" (a state) is in a state of constant war one with the other and thus in fear of his life and possessions (there being no property nor right without a sovereign to define it). Hobbes asserted natural law as how a rational human, seeking to survive and prosper, would act; the first principle of natural law being to seek peace, in which is self-preservation. Natural law (which Hobbes accepted was a misnomer, there being no law without a commonwealth) was discovered by considering humankind's natural interests, whereas previous philosophers had said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for human beings to agree to create a commonwealth by submitting to the command of a sovereign, whether an individual or an assembly of individuals. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.

[[Hugo Grotius]] based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no [[God]] or that he does not care for human affairs." (''De iure belli ac pacis'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank Van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm|author=van Dun, Frank|accessdate=28 December 2007 |title=Natural Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dignity" is a key term for the discussion of human rights. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] does not justify its claims on any philosophical basis, but rather it simply appeals to human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington D.C.|pages = 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Rahner]] discusses human dignity as it relates to freedom. Specifically, his ideas of freedom relate to human rights as an appeal to the freedom to [[Karl Rahner#Incarnation-grace|communicate with the divine]]. As embodied individuals who can have this freedom and dignity threatened by external forces, the protection of this dignity takes on an appeal to protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington, D.C.|pages = 85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "human rights" has replaced the term "natural rights" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weston, Burns H.|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106289?query=human%20rights&amp;ct=eb|title=Human Rights|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, p. 2|accessdate=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the debate on human rights remains thus a debate around the correct interpretation of Natural Law, and human rights themselves a positive, but reductionist, expression thereof&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Cornides, [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jakob_cornides Natural and Un-Natural Law], New York, C-Fam (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social contract==

The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] suggested the existence of a hypothetical ''social contract'' where a group of free individuals agree for the sake of preservation to form institutions to govern them. They give up their natural complete liberty in exchange for protection from the Sovereign. This led to [[John Locke]]'s theory that a failure of the government to secure rights is a failure which justifies the removal of the government, and was mirrored in later postulation by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his "Du Contrat Social" ([[The Social Contract]]).

International [[equity (law)|equity]] expert Paul Finn has echoed this view:

{{cquote|the most fundamental fiduciary relationship in our society is manifestly that which exists between the community (the people) and the state, its agencies and [[official]]s.|||Paul Finn&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"/&gt;}}

The relationship between government and the governed in countries which follow the [[English law]] tradition is a [[fiduciary]] one. In equity law, a politician's fiduciary obligations are not only the duties of good faith and loyalty, but also include duties of skill and [[competence (human resources)|competence]] in managing a country and its people. Originating from within the [[Court of equity|Courts of Equity]], the fiduciary concept exists to prevent those holding positions of power from abusing their authority. The fiduciary relationship between government and the governed arises from the governments ability to control people with the exercise of its power. In effect, if a government has the power to abolish any rights, it is equally burdened with the fiduciary duty to protect such an interest because it would benefit from the exercise of its own discretion to extinguish rights which it alone had the power to dispose of.&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"&gt;Salevao (2005) p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reciprocity==

The Golden Rule, or the ''[[ethic of reciprocity]]'' states that one must do unto others as one would be treated themselves; the principle being that reciprocal recognition and respect of rights ensures that one's own rights will be protected. This principle can be found in all the world's major religions in only slightly differing forms, and was enshrined in the "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic" by the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in 1993.

==Soviet concept of human rights==

{{Main article|Human rights in the Soviet Union}}

Soviet concept of human rights was different from conceptions prevalent in the West. According to Western legal theory, "it is the individual who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted ''against'' the government", whereas Soviet law declared that [[State (polity)|state]] is the source of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lambelet, Doriane. "The Contradiction Between Soviet and American Human Rights Doctrine: Reconciliation Through Perestroika and Pragmatism." 7 ''Boston University International Law Journal''. 1989. p. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shiman&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiman | first = David | title = Economic and Social Justice: A Human Rights Perspective | publisher = Amnesty International | year= 1999 | url = http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/edumat/hreduseries/tb1b/Section1/tb1-2.htm | isbn = 0-9675334-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Soviet legal system regarded [[law]] as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; Extensive [[Extrajudicial punishment|extra-judiciary powers]] were given to the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet secret police agencies]]. The regime abolished Western [[rule of law]], [[civil liberties]], [[Criminal justice|protection of law]] and [[Property rights|guarantees of property]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (2001) ''Communism'' Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-64688-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (1994) ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-679-76184-5}}., pages 401–403.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the purpose of [[People's court (Soviet Union)|socialist courts]] was "not to eliminate [[Red Terror|terror]] ... but to substantiate it and legitimize in principle".&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt;

Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, but as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society. For example, [[Speculation|a desire to make a profit]] could be interpreted as a [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionary activity]] punishable by death.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; [[Dekulakization|The liquidation and deportation of millions peasants in 1928–31]] was carried out within the terms of Soviet Civil Code.&lt;ref name="Pipes"&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', Vintage books, Random House Inc., New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-394-50242-6}}, pages 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; Some Soviet legal scholars even asserted that "criminal repression" may be applied in the absence of guilt.".&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; [[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]] explained: "Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which [[social class|class]] he belongs, what is his background, his [[education]], his [[profession]]. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the [[Red Terror]]."&lt;ref name="State"&gt;[[Yevgenia Albats]] and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. ''The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia – Past, Present, and Future'', 1994. {{ISBN|0-374-52738-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[Show trial|public trials]] was "not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime – that was predetermined by the appropriate [[CPSU|party authorities]] – but to provide yet another forum for [[Soviet propaganda|political agitation and propaganda]] for the instruction of the citizenry (see [[Moscow Trials]] for example). Defense lawyers, who had to be [[CPSU|party members]], were required to take their client's guilt for granted..."&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt;

==Other theories of human rights==

The philosopher [[John Finnis]] argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hum-rts.htm#SH4b|title=''Human Rights''|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Fagan, Andrew|year=2006|accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finnis (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:

{{cquote|Human rights law, applied to a State's own citizens serves the interest of states, by, for example, minimizing the risk of violent resistance and protest and by keeping the level of dissatisfaction with the government manageable|||Niraj Nathwani in ''Rethinking refugee law''&lt;ref&gt;Nathwani (2003) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Biology|biological]] theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and [[altruism]] in the context of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnhart (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Schloss (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Miller, Paul (2001): Arnhart, Larry. ''Thomistic Natural Law as Darwinian Natural Right'' p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Human security}}
[[Human security]] is an emerging school of thought which challenges the traditional, state-based conception of security and argues that a people-focused approach to security is more appropriate in the modern interdependent world and would be more effective in advancing the security of individuals and societies across the globe.

;Ipso facto legal rights theory

According to the recommendation of human rights scholar Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LLB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK: ‘Right’ being synonymous of ‘legal’ and antonymous of both ‘wrong’ and ‘illegal’, every ‘right’ of any human person is ipso facto a ‘legal right’ which deserves protection of law and legal remedy irrespective of having been written into the law, constitution or otherwise in any country.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LlB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK. [Page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Man for man theory of world peace

According to Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan: The only way ‘(a) to make the world terrorism and war free and also free from hunger, poverty, discrimination and exploitation; (b) to establish rule of law and economic, political and social justice; and (c) to confirm freedom of man, peace and development worldwide’ is protection and promotion human rights as ‘Ipso Facto Legal Rights’ and the unity of the world community in one and single theory of ‘man for man’ correlative, interdependent and ‘one to one-cum-one for other’ approach, namely, the ‘Man for Man Theory’ approach of world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan, LLB Honours (London), LLM (Northumbria), PhD (CIU), PGDL (Northumbria), Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK [Page 70-71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of human rights==

The idea of [[human rights]] is not without its critics. [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Marx]] are examples of historical philosophers who criticised the notion of [[natural rights]]. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a leading contemporary critic of human rights. His criticisms are discussed below.

===Edmund Burke on natural rights===

[[Edmund Burke]] was an 18th-century philosopher, political theorist and statesman largely associated with the school of [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampsher-Monk|first=Iain|title=The political philosophy of Edmund Burke|year=1987|publisher=Longman|location=New Work|pages=preface, x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views on [[natural rights]] are best articulated in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', which directly attacked the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' (1789) and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of Burke’s uneasiness of the ''Declaration'' lies in the drafter’s abandonment of the existing establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Burke, constitutional legitimacy was derived not from the Rousseauian doctrine of [[general will]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from a form of inherited wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that it was arrogant and limiting for the drafters of the ''Declaration'' to cast aside traditional notions that had stood the test of time.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Edmund|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France 1790|url=http://www.constitution.org/eb/rev_fran.htm#01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“they have no respect for the wisdom of others; but they pay it off by a very full measure of confidence in their own”&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may seem to the drafters that they had abandoned the shackles of tradition, for Burke, they had limited their findings to the narrow minded conception of one person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosher|first=Michael A.|title=The Skeptic's Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in Frabce, 1790-1990|journal=Political Theory|date=August 1991|volume=19|issue=3|pages=391–418 at 404|doi=10.1177/0090591791019003006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the grounding from which Burke’s attack of the ''Declaration'' is based.

Burke did not deny the existence of natural rights; rather he thought that the [[a priori (epistemology)|a priori]] reasoning adopted by the drafters produced notions that were too abstract to have application within the framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stating that “the pretended right of these theorists are all extremes; and in a proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically false”,&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; Burke identified that abstract rights are meaningless without a societal framework:

{{cquote|What is the use of discussing a man’s abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

In contrast to [[John Locke|Locke]], Burke did not believe the purpose of government was to protect pre-existing natural rights;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believed “the primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke it was the government, as a result of long social evolution, that transformed the meaningless natural rights into the practical advantaged afforded to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not the rights themselves, as much as the level of abstraction and the placing of them above government which Burke found dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated “those who pull down important ancient establishments, who wantonly destroy modes of administration, and public institutions… are the most mischievous, and therefore the wickedest of men”.&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke politics had no simple answers, and definitely no overarching, universal maxims such as those expressed in the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather the rights afforded to individuals were to be assessed in the context of the social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he acknowledged that the simplicity of the ''Declaration'' was attractive and feared its ability to undermine social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke believed that the absolute nature of these principles of abstraction were inherently revolutionary; they were uncompromising and any derogation from the principles a reason to rise up in arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a problem because;

{{cquote|All government… is founded on compromise and barter. We balance inconveniences; we give and take; we remit some rights, that we may enjoy others; and we choose rather to be happy citizens, than subtle disputants.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

The natural rights “Against which there can be no prescription; against these no agreements is binding”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; gave the revolutionaries the tools to destroy the very society that Burke believed afforded them with rights. In this way Burke thought the rights contained in the ''Declaration'' would lead to “the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;

===Jeremy Bentham on natural rights===

The 18th-century [[Utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] criticised the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' in his text ''Anarchical Fallacies''. He famously asserted that the concept of natural rights was “nonsense upon stilts”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham criticised the ''Declaration'' both for the language that it adopted and the theories it posited, stating; “Look to the letter, you find nonsense; look beyond the letter, you find nothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the critiques Bentham levelled against the ''Declaration'' was its assertions of rights in the form of absolute and universal norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified that absolute rights possessed by everyone equally are meaningless and undesirable. They lack meaning because if everyone has, for example, unbounded liberty, there is nothing precluding them from using that liberty to impinge on the liberty of another. In this way “human government and human laws”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; are required to give some bounds to rights in order for them to be realised.&lt;ref name="Waldron 1987 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if advocates of absolute rights recognise this necessity, as the proponents of the ''Declaration'' did, Bentham argues that it is in vain.&lt;ref name="Waldron 1987 39"/&gt; “It would be self-contradictory, because these rights are, in the same breath which their existence is declared, declared to be impresciptable; and impriscriptable… means nothing unless it excludes the interference of the laws.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this contradiction, Bentham warned of the dangers of couching rights in absolute terms. A government that is able to protect every person’s right absolutely and equally is a utopian aspiration, but the ''Declaration'' couches it as the conditions for its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Against every government which fails in any degree of fulfilling these expectations, then, it is the professed object of this manifesto to excite insurrection.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham does not deny that there are some laws that are morally wrong; his uneasiness is in easily justifying a revolutionary call to arms – with the violence, chaos and destruction associated with it – based on a repugnant law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the theoretical faults, Bentham thought that natural rights were a construction adopted to pursue the selfish aims of the drafters, of which no logical basis could be found.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"&gt;Philip Schofield, "Bentham, Jeremy (1748–1832)"; Ed. Donald M. Borchert, ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Vol. 1. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2006) at 555&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that it may be desirable to have rights, but “a reason for wishing that a certain right were established, is not that right; want is not supply; hunger is not bread.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish rights existed by virtue of laws enacted by a sovereign was logically sound, but to assert rights established by nature was not.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"/&gt; “A natural right is a son that never had a father.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did Bentham think that there was no logical basis for the theory of natural rights, but he believed that their individualistic approach was harmful to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentham thought that society was dependent upon people's ability to pursue the greater good, not just the short-term satisfaction of their own desires. The advancement of natural rights, which he saw as celebrating selfishness, was to provide the means to break down the social community that makes human life bearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist Critique of human rights===
In [[On the Jewish Question]], [[Karl Marx]] criticized ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' as bourgeois ideology:
:''Above all, we note the fact that the so-called rights of man, the droits de l'homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen, are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society – i.e., the rights of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. ... according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791:
:''"Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others."''
:''Liberty, therefore, is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post.''
and that:
:''Security is the supreme social concept of bourgeois society, the concept of the police, the whole society exists only to ensure each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property.''

Thus for Marx, liberal rights and ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs protection from other human beings. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view denies is the possibility — according to Marx, the fact — that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found in human community, not in isolation. So insisting on a regime of rights encourages us to view each other in ways which undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation.

Marxist critical theorist [[Slavoj Žižek]] argued that: "liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness, openness to it, and an obsessive fear of harassment. In short, the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive, insofar as it is not really the other. Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space—in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be 'harassed', that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others." and "universal human rights are effectively the right of white, male property-owners to exchange freely on the market, exploit workers and women, and exert political domination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/against-human-rights-zizek |title=Against human rights - Slavoj Žižek |publisher=libcom.org|date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologist [[Robert Fine]] claims that the key to Marx’s argument was to rebut the radicalism Bauer espoused: a radicalism that not only denied the rights of Jews but at once trashed the rights of man and citizen as such. What Marx stood for in the Jewish Question as in his earlier writings more generally was a philosophy of right. Fine believes what Marx stood against was a spiritless radicalism that revealed its inhumanity not only through its hostility to Jews but also through its hostility to the idea of right." Moreover, Fine argued that Marx argued that the society that gives rise to the idea of rights is the same as that which gives rise to the commodity form. They are two sides of the same medal. It is a society based on production by independent producers whose contact with each other is mediated through the exchange of products on the market. These producers are formally free to produce what and how much they wish. They are formally equal in that no producer can force others to produce against their will or expropriate their products against their will. They are self-interested in that they are all entitled to pursue their own private interests regardless of what others think or do. Their contact with other producers takes the form of free and equal exchanges in which individuals exchange their property in return for the property of another and this exchange of unneeded things in return for useful things appears to be done for the mutual benefit of each party.

Fine also claims that for Marx, exchange relations appear to be formed among free and equal property owners who enter a voluntary contract in pursuit of their own self-interest. Fine cites what he believes to be Marx's point about how in exchange lies the clue to all modern conceptions of freedom and equal right:

:Although individual A feels a need for the commodity of individual B, he does not appropriate it by force, nor vice versa, but rather recognise one another reciprocally as proprietors, as persons whose will penetrates their commodities. Accordingly, the juridical moment of the Person enters here… all inherent contradictions of bourgeois society appear extinguished ... and bourgeois democracy even more than the bourgeois economists takes refuge in this aspect.: (Marx, Grundrisse:243, 251)

Furthermore, the parties to the exchange must place themselves in relation to one another as persons whose will resides in those objects and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other and alienate his own, except through an act to which both parties consent. Marx characterised this sphere of commodity exchange as ‘a very Eden of the innate rights of man’ – the realm of Freedom, Equality, Property and
Bentham:

:‘Freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity ... are determined only by their own free will....Equality because each enters into relations with the other as with a simple owner of commodities and they exchange equivalent with equivalent. Property because each disposes only what is his own. And Bentham because each looks only to his own advantage. The only force bringing them together is the selfishness, the gain and the private interest of each.: (Marx, Capital 1: 280)

Thus according to [[Robert Fine]], Marx's basic criticism was that within political society people were seen as co-operative, while in their economic roles they were competitive, individualistic and egoistic. In short, the theory of rights expressed the division and alienation of human beings.

===Alasdair MacIntyre on human rights===

[[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a Scottish philosopher who has published a number of works in a variety of philosophical fields, including [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Ted|title=Political Philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p-macint/|work=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2005 |editor1=James Fieser|editor2=Bradley Dowden}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacIntyre criticises the concept of [[human rights]] in [[After Virtue]] and he famously asserts that “there are no such rights, and belief in them is one with belief in witches and in unicorns.”&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacIntyre argues that every attempt at justifying the existence of human rights has failed. The assertions by 18th century philosophers that [[natural rights]] are self-evident truths, he argues, are necessarily false as there are no such things as self-evident truths. He says that the plea 20th century philosophers made to intuition show a flaw in philosophical reasoning. MacIntyre then outlines that, although [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]] is not wrong in asserting that the inability to demonstrate a statement does not necessitate its falsity, the same argument can be applied in relation to witches and unicorns.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"/&gt;

MacIntyre made this critique of human rights in the context of a wider argument about the failure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to produce a coherent moral system.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of the enlightenment sought to cast aside the discredited notions of hierarchy and [[theology]] as justifications for morality. Instead, MacIntyre argues, the enlightenment placed the individual as the sovereign authority to dictate what is right and wrong. However allegiances to historical notions of morality remained and philosophers sought to find a secular and rational justification for existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem, MacIntyre maintains, is that theological morality was developed to overcome defects in human nature; to posit an example of the ideal. Without this notion of ‘perfect humanity’ the only remaining foundation to build a moral theory on was the foundation of imperfect human nature.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; For MacIntyre, the result was a collection of moral stances, each claiming to have a rational justification and each disputing the findings of the rival notions.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"/&gt;

MacIntyre believes that a number of the moral debates that occur in society can be explained as a result of this failure of the “Enlightenment Project”.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 96&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights are an example of a moral belief, founded in previous theological beliefs, which make the false claim of being grounded in rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate how the principles lead to conflict, he gives the example of [[abortion]]; in this case the right of the mother to exercise control over her body is contrasted with the deprivation of a potential child to the right to life. Although both the right to liberty and the right to life are, on their own, considered morally acceptable claims, conflict arises when we posit them against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of value and property==
{{See also|Property}}
[[Henry of Ghent]] articulated the theory that every person has a property interest in their own body.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] uses the word property in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, property precedes government and government cannot "dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily." To deny valid property rights according to Locke is to deny human rights. The British philosopher had significant impacts upon the development of the Government of the UK and was central to the fundamental founding philosophy of the United States. [[Karl Marx]] later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his ''Theories of Surplus Value'', seeing the beginnings of a theory of [[surplus value]] in Locke's works. In Locke's ''Second Treatise'' he argued that the right to own private property was unlimited as long as nobody took more than they could use without allowing any of their property to go to waste and that there were enough common resources of comparable quality available for others to create their own property. Locke did believe that some would be more "industrious and rational" than others and would amass more property, but believed this would not cause shortages. Though this system could work before the introduction of [[money]], Marx argued in ''Theories of Surplus Value'' that Locke's system would break down and claimed money was a contradiction of the law of nature on which private property was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''polar city''' is a proposed sustainable polar retreat designed to house human beings in the future, in the event that global warming causes the equatorial and middle latitudes of the Earth to become uninhabitable for a long period of time. Although they have not been built yet, some futurists have been giving considerable thought to the concepts involved. High-population-density cities, to be built near the [[Arctic]] Rim and in [[Antarctica]], [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Patagonia]], with sustainable energy and transportation infrastructure, will require substantial nearby agriculture. Boreal soils are largely poor in key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, but nitrogen-fixing plants (such as the various [[alder]]s) with the proper symbiotic microbes and mycorrhizal fungi can likely remedy such poverty without the need for petroleum-derived fertilizers. Regional probiotic soil improvement should perhaps rank high on any polar cities priority list. [[James Lovelock]]'s notion of a widely distributed almanac of science knowledge and post-industrial survival skills also appears to have value.

== History ==

The polar cities climate retreat living pod concept is a worst-case scenario prediction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/roundtables/has-the-time-come-geoengineering#rt3845 "We should plan for the worst-case climate scenario" Ken Caldeira, ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists''] 29 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; based on the ideas of British
chemist and inventor [[James Lovelock]]: life in polar cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.mongabay.com/2008/03/18/polar-cities-is-an-idea-whose-time-i-hope-never-comes/ "“Polar Cities” is an idea whose time I hope never comes" ]&lt;/ref&gt; arrayed inland and
around the shores of an ice-free [[Arctic Ocean]] in a greenhouse-warmed
world. Dr. Lovelock, who in 1972 conceived of the Earth's crust, climate,
and veneer of life as a unified self-sustaining entity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaia hypothesis]]&lt;/ref&gt; foresees
humanity in full pole-bound retreat within a century as areas around
the tropics roast — a scenario far outside even the worst-case
projections of climate scientists.

After reading a newspaper column&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/james-lovelock-the-earth-is-about-to-catch-a-morbid-fever-that-may-last-as-long-as-100000-years-523161.html "James Lovelock: The Earth is about to catch a morbid fever that may last as long as 100,000 years", ''The Independent''] 16 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 in which Dr. Lovelock predicted
disastrous warming, Danny Bloom, a freelance newspaper reporter and climate blogger, teamed up with Deng Cheng-hong, a Taiwanese
artist, and set up websites showing designs for self-sufficient
Arctic communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climatechange3000.blogspot.com/ "Global Warming and Polar Cities"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Bloom's intent is to conduct a non-threatening thought
experiment that might prod people out of their comfort zone on climate change.

== Popular culture ==

In 2012, two books about polar cities were published. ''Polar City Red'', by Jim Laughter, is a [[climate fiction]] novel about life in
a polar city in the year 2075 in Alaska. ''Polar City Dreaming: How Climate Change Might Usher In The Age Of Polar Cities,'' by Stephan Malone, is a nonfiction history of polar city ideas.

== Design ==

The design of polar cities climate retreat living pods is currently (2008) driven entirely by volunteers under the name of "The Polar City Project". Danny Bloom is currently leading this effort.  The defining design characteristics are efficiency, both for operational costs as well as construction costs, and a desire for the city to be a [[Zero energy building]]. The proposed agricultural module, for example, is a [[Sustainable agriculture]] vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verticalfarm.com/ "The Vertical Farm Project"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Power and Control: Domestic Violence in America''''' is a [[documentary film]] released in 2010 that depicts the issue of [[domestic violence in the U.S.]] as told through the personal story of Kim Mosher, a mother of three from [[Wabasha, Minnesota]] and victim of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]]. Finally leaving her husband in 2008 and facing an uncertain future, she succeeds in re-building much of her life, seeking refuge at a [[women's shelter]] and forming deep friendships with other victims.&lt;ref name=synopsis/&gt; 

Detailing the problems dealt with by the multi-disciplinary anti-abuse effort known as the "[[Duluth model]]", it has received a variety of supportive critical reviews from publications such as the ''[[City Pages]]'' and ''The Minnesota Post''.&lt;ref name=digital/&gt;

==Background and film contents==
{{expand section|date=October 2013|the background issues in fighting domestic violence and the related details of how the anti-abuse programs work}}
As stated before, the film looks at the film of Kim Mosher and her suffering at the hands of both physical and emotional abuse. The [[Wabasha, Minnesota]] mother wanted to keep her ten-year marriage and family together, yet, once her husband began to physically [[Child abuse|abuse their children]] as well, she left her home with her children in 2008 for the Safe Haven battered [[women's shelter]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] where she began to build a new life for them as well as her. The film shows her struggles as she searches for a job, seeks child care services, looks out for affordable housing, and otherwise attempts to raise her children safely.&lt;ref name=synopsis&gt;[http://www.powerandcontrolfilm.com/synopsis/ ''Power and Control: Domestic Violence in America'' Synopsis.] Hillcrest Films LLC. Retrieved November 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary specifically explores the '[[Duluth model|Domestic Abuse Intervention Project]]', often called the '[[Duluth model]]', which was the first multi-disciplinary program designed to coordinate the actions of a variety of agencies in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] dealing with [[domestic violence]] for a more effective outcome. This organizational effort has become a test case looked at for programs in many other U.S. [[jurisdiction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theduluthmodel.org/history.php Domestic Abuse Intervention Project: History]&lt;/ref&gt;  A nationwide study published in 2002, sponsored by the [[U.S. federal government|federal government]], found that batterers who complete programs based on the model are less likely to repeat acts of domestic violence than those who do not complete any batterers intervention program.&lt;ref name="MTwohey"&gt;{{cite web | last= Twohey | first = Megan | title = How Can Domestic Violence Be Stopped? | publisher = Chicago Tribune | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-abusers-02-jan02,0,1147422.story?page=2 | date = 2009-01-02 | accessdate = 2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
The movie made its world premiere at the 'Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival' in April 2010. Upon wide release, it has received critical praise from several publications. For example, ''[[City Pages]]'' writer Ira Booker found the film a "stark reminder that this kind of violence is all around us." ''The Minnesota Post'' ran an article referring to it as "a purely harrowing story" and "highly recommended.” As well, the [[Buffalo, NY]] web-project ''Educational Media Reviews Online'' endorsed the film.&lt;ref name=digital&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdaydigital.com/Power-and-Control.html?authorization=3A38CEEE9528ADE0DEF5E81ABAC0F6A0&amp;verify=0|title=Power and Control|publisher=[http://www.newdaydigital.com newdaydigital.com]|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistics]], the '''principle of marginality''' is the fact that the average (or [[main effect|main]]) effects, of variables in an analysis are [[marginal distribution|marginal]] to their [[interaction effect]]—that is, the main effect of one [[explanatory variable]] captures the effect of that variable averaged over all values of a second explanatory variable whose value influences the first variable's effect. The principle of marginality implies that, in general, it is wrong to test, estimate, or interpret main effects of [[dependent and independent variables|explanatory variables]] where the variables interact or, similarly, to model interaction effects but delete main effects that are marginal to
them.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;Fox, J. [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Courses/SPIDA/dummy-regression-notes.pdf Regression Notes].&lt;/ref&gt; While such models are interpretable, they lack applicability, as they ignore the dependence of a variable’s effect upon another variable’s value.

(1998). [http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS3/Exegeses.pdf "Exegeses on Linear Models"]. Paper presented to the S-PLUS User’s Conference Washington, DC, 8–9 October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued strongly for the importance of this principle in [[regression analysis]].

== Regression form ==

If two independent continuous variables, say ''x'' and ''z'', both influence a [[dependent variable]] ''y'', and if the extent of the effect of each independent variable depends on the level of the other independent variable then the regression equation can be written as: 

:&lt;math&gt;y_i=a+bx_i+cz_i+d(x_iz_i)+ e_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' indexes observations, ''a'' is the intercept term, ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' are effect size parameters to be estimated, and ''e'' is the [[errors and residuals|error]] term. 

If this is the correct model, then the omission of any of the right-side terms would be incorrect, resulting in misleading interpretation of the regression results. 

With this model, the effect of ''x'' upon ''y'' is given by the [[partial derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x''; this is &lt;math&gt;b+dz_i&lt;/math&gt;, which depends on the specific value &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; at which the partial derivative is being evaluated. Hence, the main effect of ''x'' – the effect averaged over all values of ''z'' – is meaningless as it depends on the design of the experiment (specifically on the relative frequencies of the various values of ''z'') and not just on the underlying relationships. Hence:

* In the case of interaction, it is wrong to try to test, estimate, or interpret a "main effect" coefficient ''b'' or ''c'', omitting the interaction term.&lt;ref&gt;See Venables, p.13: "... testing main effects in the presence of an interaction is a violation of the marginality principle".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition:

* In the case of interaction, it is wrong not to include ''b'' or ''c'', because this will give incorrect estimates of the interaction. &lt;ref&gt;See Venables, p.14/15, about the S-Plus command &lt;code&gt;drop1&lt;/code&gt;, which does not drop the main effect terms from a model with interaction: "To my delight I see that marginality constraints between factor terms are by default honoured". In R, the marginality requirement of the &lt;code&gt;dropterm&lt;/code&gt; function (in package MASS) is stated in the Reference Manual.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The above regression model, with two independent continuous variables, is presented with a numerical example, in Stata, as Case 3 in [http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/faq/what-happens-if-you-omit-the-main-effect-in-a-regression-model-with-an-interaction  What happens if you omit the main effect in a regression model with an interaction?].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12370">In response to the [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]] (DESD, 2005-2014), the [[United Nations University]] (UNU) called for the development of regional networks for the promotion of [[Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD). These networks address local sustainable development challenges through research and capacity development. This was the birth of '''Regional Centres of Expertise''' on ESD (RCEs). RCEs are acknowledged by the UNU based on recommendations of the Ubuntu Committee of Peers for the RCEs, which consists of signatories of the [https://www.un.org/events/wssd/pressconf/020901conf1.htm Ubuntu Declaration] signed in 2002.

RCEs aspire to achieve the goals of the DESD by translating its global objectives into the context of the local communities in which they operate. This is then accomplished by acting as a catalyst for institutions that promote ESD through formal, non-formal and informal education, and by providing suitable platforms to share information and experiences and to promote dialogue among regional stakeholders through partnerships for sustainable development. They also develop regional knowledge bases to support ESD and promote its goals in a resource effective manner. This can be achieved through the delivery of training programmes, by facilitating research into ESD, through public awareness raising, and by increasing the quality and access to ESD in the region.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

An RCE should have four core elements:

* Governance - addressing issues of RCE management and leadership
* Collaboration - addressing the engagement of actors from all levels of formal, non-formal and informal education
* Research and development - addressing the role of research and its inclusion in RCE activities, as well as contributing to the design of strategies for collaborative activities, including those with other RCEs
* Transformative education - contributing to the transformation of the current education and training systems to satisfy ambitions of the region regarding sustainable living and livelihood.

RCEs also have four major ESD goals to be promoted in an effective way:

* Re-orienting education towards SD, by covering integrating SD and ESD into the current curriculum and tailoring it to address issues and local context of the community in which they operate;
* Increase access to quality education that is most needed in the regional context;
* Deliver trainers’ training programmes and to develop methodologies and learning materials for them;
* Lead advocacy and awareness raising efforts to raise public awareness about the importance of educators and the essential role of ESD in achieving a sustainable future. RCEs promote the long-term goals of ESD, such as environmental stewardship, social justice, and improvement of the quality of life.

RCEs are not only significant for the region itself, where they provide a unique opportunity to promote learning and development for SD, but also important at international level where they help to constitute the Global Learning Space for Sustainable Development. Globally, RCEs are facilitated through the [http://www.ias.unu.edu United Nations University Institute for Advanced Studies (UNU-IAS)] who provide a framework for strategy, best practice and techniques for success, which can then be translated to the regional level.

RCEs have recently{{when|date=November 2018}} been acknowledged in the 2009 Bonn Declaration which calls for action to “develop knowledge through ESD networking” through “networks that could serve as centres of expertise and innovation”.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Repressed memories''' are [[memory|memories]] that have been unconsciously blocked due to the memory being associated with a high level of stress or trauma.&lt;ref name=loftus1993/&gt; The theory postulates that even though the individual cannot recall the memory, it may still be affecting them subconsciously,&lt;ref name="childhood abuse"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/trauma/memories.aspx?item=1 Questions and Answers about Memories of Childhood Abuse]. apa.org&lt;/ref&gt; and that these memories can emerge later into the consciousness. Ideas on repressed memory hiding trauma from awareness were an important part of [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] early work on [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=loftus1993/&gt; He later took a different view.

The existence of repressed memories is an extremely controversial topic in psychology; although some studies have concluded that it can occur in a varying but generally small percentage of victims of trauma, many other studies dispute its existence entirely.&lt;ref name="pmid17803876"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNally|first1=RJ|title=Dispelling confusion about traumatic dissociative amnesia|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=September 2007|volume=82|issue=9|pages=1083–90|pmid=17803876|doi=10.4065/82.9.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists support the theory of repressed memories and claim that repressed memories can be recovered through therapy, but most psychologists argue that this is in fact rather a process through which false memories are created by blending actual memories and outside influences.&lt;ref name="pmid17803876" /&gt; One study concluded that repressed memories were a cultural symptom for want of written proof of their existence before the nineteenth century, but its results were disputed by some psychologists, and a work discussing a repressed memory from 1786 was eventually acknowledged, though the others stand by their hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pettus|first=Ashley|title=cultural symptom? repressed memory|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/01/repressed-memory.html|website=Harvard Magazine|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brown1"&gt;Baum, Deborah (July 7, 2009) [https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/07/memory Brown Professor Continues Debate Over Recovered Memory]. ''Brown University News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Psychological Association]], it is not possible to distinguish repressed memories from false ones without corroborating evidence.&lt;ref name="childhood abuse" /&gt; The term repressed memory is sometimes compared to the term dissociative amnesia, which is defined in the [[DSM-V]] as an "inability to recall autobiographical information. This amnesia may be localized (i.e., an event or period of time), selective (i.e., a specific aspect of an event), or generalized (i.e., identity and life history)."

According to the Mayo Clinic, [[amnesia]] refers to any instance in which memories stored in the long-term memory are completely or partially forgotten, usually due to brain injury.
According to proponents of the existence of repressed memories, such memories can be recovered years or decades after the event, most often spontaneously, triggered by a particular smell, taste, or other identifier related to the lost memory, or via suggestion during [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref name="dissoc-9-4"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Memory recovery of childhood sexual abuse |last=Albach |first=Francine |author2=Peter Paul Moormann | author3=Bob Bermond |journal=Dissociation |volume= 9| issue =  4 |pages= 261–273 |hdl=1794/1774 |date=December 1996|issn=0896-2863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was initially claimed that there was no documented writing about repressed memories or [[dissociative amnesia]] (as it is sometimes referred to), before the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0033291706009500|pmid=17156503|title=Is dissociative amnesia a culture-bound syndrome? Findings from a survey of historical literature|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=37|issue=2|pages=225–33|year=2006|last1=Pope|first1=Harrison G.|last2=Poliakoff|first2=Michael B.|last3=Parker|first3=Michael P.|last4=Boynes|first4=Matthew|last5=Hudson|first5=James I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding, by Harrison G. Pope, was based on a competition in which entrants could win $1000 if they could identify "a pre-1800 literary example of traumatic memory that has been repressed by an otherwise healthy individual, and then recovered."  Pope claimed that no entrant had satisfied the criteria. Ross Cheit, a political scientist at Brown University, cited [[Nina (Dalayrac)|Nina]], a 1786 opera by the French composer Nicolas Dalayrac.&lt;ref name="brown1"/&gt;

The concept of repressed memory originated with [[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1896 essay ''Zur Ätiologie der Hysterie'' ("On the etiology of hysteria").&lt;ref name="freud"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Hinz|first=Paul|title=Die Verfassung des Freistaates Preussen|year=1920|publisher=J. Bensheimer|pages=55–57}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the studies published in his essay involved a young woman by the name of [[Anna O.]] Among her many ailments, she suffered from stiff paralysis on the right side of her body. Freud stated her symptoms to be attached to psychological traumas. The painful memories had separated from her consciousness and brought harm to her body. Freud used hypnosis to treat Anna O. She is reported to have gained slight mobility on her right side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boag|first=Simon|title=Freudian Repression|year=2012|publisher=Karnac Books|location=London|isbn=9781855757387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud's repressed memory theory joined his philosophy of [[psychoanalysis]]. Repressed memory has remained a heavily debated topic inside of Freud's psychoanalysis philosophy.

Van der Kolk and Fisler's research shows that traumatic memories are retrieved, at least at first, in the form of mental imprints that are dissociated. These imprints are of the affective and sensory elements of the traumatic experience. Clients have reported the slow emergence of a personal narrative that can be considered explicit (conscious) memory. The level of emotional significance of a memory correlates directly with the memory's veracity. Studies of subjective reports of memory show that memories of highly significant events are unusually accurate and stable over time.&lt;ref name="pmid8564271"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Kolk BA, Fisler R |title=Dissociation and the fragmentary nature of traumatic memories: overview and exploratory study |journal=J Trauma Stress |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=505–25 |year=1995 |pmid=8564271 |doi= 10.1002/jts.2490080402|url=http://www.trauma-pages.com/a/vanderk2.php | accessdate = March 22, 2008|citeseerx=10.1.1.487.1607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The imprints of traumatic experiences appear to be qualitatively different from those of nontraumatic events. Traumatic memories may be coded differently from ordinary event memories, possibly because of alterations in attentional focusing or the fact that extreme emotional arousal interferes with the memory functions of the hippocampus.&lt;ref name="pmid8564271"/&gt;

Another possibility is that traumatic events are pushed out of consciousness until a later events elicits or triggers a psychological response. Support for this idea has come from studies in which trauma was temporarily induced. For example, a high percentage of female psychiatric in-patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carmen E.

There has also been significant questioning of the reality of repressed memories. There is considerable evidence that rather than being pushed out of consciousness, the difficulty with traumatic memories for most people are their intrusiveness and inability to forget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McHugh | first = PR | authorlink = Paul R.

Retrospective studies (studying the extent to which participants can recall past events) depend critically on the ability of informants to recall accurate memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Herman J. L. |author2=Schatzow E. | year = 1984 | title = Time-limited group therapy for women with a history of incest | doi=10.1080/00207284.1984.11732563|pmid=6519859 | journal = International Journal of Group Psychotherapy | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 605–616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of reliability in participants’ introspective abilities has been questioned by modern psychologists. In other words, a participant accurately recalling and remembering their own past memories is highly criticized, because memories are undoubtedly influenced by external, environmental factors.

Psychologists [[Elizabeth Loftus]] and Katherine Ketcham are authors of the seminal work on the fallacy of repressed memory, ''[[The Myth of Repressed Memory]]'' (St. Martin's Press, 1994).

==Cause==
It is hypothesised that [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] may be one method used by individuals to cope with traumatic memories, by pushing them out of awareness (perhaps as an adaptation via [[psychogenic amnesia]]) to allow a child to maintain [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to a person on whom they are dependent for survival.&lt;ref name=Freyd2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freyd |first=J. |year=1994 |title=Betrayal trauma: traumatic amnesia as an adaptive response to childhood abuse |journal= Ethics &amp; Behavior |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=307–330 |url=http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jjf/articles/freyd94.pdf |accessdate= January 13, 2008 |doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0404_1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have proposed that repression can operate on a social level as well.&lt;ref name=Freyd3&gt;{{cite journal |last= Freyd |first= Jennifer J. |year= 2007 |title= Archiving Dissociation as a Precaution Against Dissociating Dissociation |journal= [[Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation]] |volume= 8 |issue= 3 |url= http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jjf/articles/freyd2007.pdf |accessdate= December 29, 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theoretical causes of forgotten memories have stemmed from the idea of ''Retrieval-Influenced Forgetting'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson M. C. |author2=Bjork R. A. |author3=Bjork E. L. | year = 1994 | title = Remembering can cause forgetting: Retrieval dynamics in long-term memory | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 1063–1087 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.5.1063|citeseerx=10.1.1.119.3933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that “false” memories will be more accurately recalled when rehearsed more, than when actual memories get rehearsed. In this scenario, the action of rehearsing a falsified memory can actually take precedence over the actual memory that a person experiences. Anderson et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; discovered that rehearsal of novel information exhibits inhibitive processes on one’s ability to remember or recall the prior (real) memory. This conclusion indicates that past memories can be easily forgotten, simply by attending to “real”, novel memories that are brought into awareness.

===Authenticity===

Memories ''can'' be accurate, but they are not ''always'' accurate. For example, eyewitness testimony even of relatively recent dramatic events is notoriously unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/107385802236964 | last1 = Gonsalves | first1 = B | last2 = Paller | first2 = KA |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2002 | title = Mistaken memories: remembering events that never happened | url = | journal = [[The Neuroscientist]] | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 391–5 | pmid = 12374423 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.24.8545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memories of events are a mix of fact overlaid with emotions, mingled with interpretation and "filled in" with imaginings. Skepticism regarding the validity of a memory as factual detail is warranted.&lt;ref name="pmid22577300"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Schacter DL| title=Constructive memory: past and future | journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci | year= 2012 | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | pages= 7–18 | pmid=22577300 | doi= | pmc=3341652 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22577300  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one study where victims of documented child abuse were reinterviewed many years later as adults, 38% of the women denied any memory of the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams LM  |title=Recall of childhood trauma: a prospective study of women's memories of  child sexual abuse |journal=[[J Consult Clin Psychol]] |volume=62 |issue=6  |pages=1167–76  |year=1994 |pmid=7860814 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.62.6.1167|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/courses/2004-05/winter/psy130/Debate2Williams1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against the existence of "traumatic amnesia" note that  various manipulations can be used to implant false memories (sometimes called "pseudomemories"). These can be quite compelling for those who develop them, and can include details that make them seem credible to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laney | first1 = C | last2 = Loftus | first2 = EF |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2005 | title = Traumatic memories are not necessarily accurate memories | url = | journal = [[Can J Psychiatry]] | volume = 50 | issue = 13| pages = 823–8 | pmid = 16483115 | doi = 10.1177/070674370505001303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic experiment in  memory research, conducted by [[Elizabeth Loftus]], became widely known as "Lost in the Mall"; in this, subjects were given a booklet containing three accounts of real childhood events written by family members and a fourth account of a wholly fictitious event of being lost in a shopping mall. A quarter of the subjects reported remembering the fictitious event, and elaborated on it with extensive circumstantial detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/eloftus/Articles/sciam.htm|author=Loftus, E |year=1997|title= Creating false memories |journal=Scientific American|volume= 227|issue=3|pages=71–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment inspired many others, and in one of these, Porter et al. could convince about half of his subjects that they had survived a vicious animal attack in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1022344128649 | last1 = Porter | first1 = S |name-list-format=vanc| last2 = Yuille | year = 1999 | first2 = JC | last3 = Lehman | first3 = DR | title = The nature of real, implanted, and fabricated memories for emotional childhood events: implications for the recovered memory debate | url = | journal = [[Law Hum Behav]] | volume = 23 | issue = 5| pages = 517–37 | pmid = 10487147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implications for clinical practice | url = | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 172 | issue = 4| pages = 296–307 | pmid = 9722329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus recognised by professional organizations that a risk of implanting false memories is associated with some similar types of therapy. The ''American Psychiatric Association'' advises: "...most leaders in the field agree that although it is a rare occurrence, a memory of early childhood abuse that has been forgotten can be remembered later. However, these leaders also agree that it is possible to construct convincing pseudomemories for events that never occurred.

Nevertheless, many therapists believe in the authenticity of the recovered memories that they hear from their clients. In a non-random study by Loftus and Herzog (1991) with 16 clinicians, 13 (81%) said that they invariably believed their clients. The most common basis for this belief was the patient’s symptomology (low self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, self-destructive behaviour) or body memories (voice frozen etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loftus|first=Elizabeth F.|title=The reality of repressed memories|journal=American Psychologist|volume=48|issue=5|pages=518–537|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.48.5.518|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism(s) by which both of these phenomena happen are not well understood and, at this point it is impossible, without other corroborative evidence, to distinguish a true memory from a false one."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/memories.html Questions and Answers about Memories of Childhood Abuse] ''American Psychiatric Association''&lt;/ref&gt; Sheflin and Brown state that a total of 25 studies on amnesia for child sexual abuse exist and that they demonstrate amnesia in their study subpopulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sheflin | first = AW | author2 = Brown D |year=1996 | title = Repressed memory or dissociative amnesia: what the science says | journal = J Psychiat Law | volume = 24  | pages = 143–88 | issn = 0093-1853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an editorial in the ''British Medical Journal'' states on the Sheflin and Brown study that "on critical examination, the scientific evidence for repression crumbles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Brown et al. estimate that 3 to 5% of laboratory subjects are vulnerable to post-event misinformation suggestions. They state that 5–8% of the general population is the range of high-hypnotizability. Twenty-five percent of those in this range are vulnerable to suggestion of pseudomemories for peripheral details, which can rise to 80% with a combination of other social influence factors. They conclude that the rates of memory errors run 0–5% in adult studies, 3–5% in children's studies and that the rates of false allegations of child abuse allegations run 4–8% in the general population.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;

===Neurological basis of memory===

The neuroscientist [[Donald Hebb]] (1904–1985) was the first to distinguish between [[short-term memory]] and [[long-term memory]]. According to current theories in neuroscience, things that we "notice" are stored in short-term memory for up to a few minutes; this memory depends on "reverberating" electrical activity in neuronal circuits, and is very easily destroyed by interruption or interference. Memories stored for longer than this are stored in "long-term memory". Whether information is stored in long-term memory depends on its "importance"; for any animal, memories of traumatic events are potentially important for the adaptive value that they have for future avoidance behavior, and [[hormones]] that are released during stress have a role in determining what memories are preserved. In humans, traumatic stress is associated with acute secretion of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] (adrenaline and noradrenaline) from the [[adrenal medulla]] and [[cortisol]] from the [[adrenal cortex]]. Increases in these facilitate memory, but chronic stress associated with prolonged hypersecretion of cortisol may have the opposite effect. The [[limbic system]] is involved in memory storage and retrieval as well as giving emotional significance to sensory inputs. Within the limbic system, the [[hippocampus]] is important for [[explicit memory]], and for [[memory consolidation]]; it is also sensitive to stress hormones, and has a role in recording the emotions of a stressful event. The [[amygdala]] may be particularly important in assigning emotional values to sensory inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0272-7358(98)00037-3 | last1 = Zola | first1 = SM |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1998 | title = Memory, amnesia, and the issue of recovered memory: neurobiological aspects | url = | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 8| pages = 915–32 | pmid = 9885767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although memory distortion occurs in everyday life, the brain mechanisms involved are not easy to study in the laboratory, but [[neuroimaging]] techniques have recently been applied to this subject. In particular, there have recently been studies of false recognition, where individuals incorrectly claim to have encountered a novel object or event, and the results suggest that the hippocampus and several cortical regions may contribute to such false recognition, while the prefrontal cortex may be involved in retrieval monitoring that can limit the rate of false recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schacter | first1 = DL | last2 = Slotnick | first2 = SD |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2004 | title = The cognitive neuroscience of memory distortion | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 149–60 | pmid = 15450167 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amnesia===
[[Amnesia]] is partial or complete loss of memory that goes beyond mere forgetting. Often it is temporary and involves only part of a person's experience. Amnesia is often caused by an injury to the brain, for instance after a blow to the head, and sometimes by psychological trauma. [[Anterograde amnesia]] is a failure to remember new experiences that occur after damage to the brain; [[retrograde amnesia]] is the loss of memories of events that occurred before a trauma or injury. For a memory to become permanent (consolidated), there must be a persistent change in the strength of connections between particular neurons in the brain. Anterograde amnesia can occur because this consolidation process is disrupted; retrograde amnesia can result either from damage to the site of memory storage or from a disruption in the mechanisms by which memories can be retrieved from their stores. Many specific types of amnesia are recognized, including:
* [[Childhood amnesia]] is the normal inability to recall memories from the first three years of life. Sigmund Freud observed that not only do humans not remember anything from birth to three years, but they also have “spotty” recollection of anything occurring from three to seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Josselyn S.

W. | year = 2012 | title = Infantile amnesia: A neurogenic hypothesis | url = | journal = Learning &amp; Memory | volume = 19 | issue = 9| pages = 423–433 | doi = 10.1101/lm.021311.110 | pmid=22904373}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various theories as to why this occurs: some believe that language development is important for efficient storage of long-term memories; others believe that early memories do not persist because the brain is still developing.
* A [[fugue state]], formally dissociative fugue, is a rare condition precipitated by a stressful episode. It is characterized by episode(s) of traveling away from home and creating a new identity.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, R. J. (1991).

Arlington, VA, US: American Psychiatric Association, Arlington, VA.&lt;/ref&gt;
The form of amnesia that is linked with recovered memories is dissociative amnesia (formerly known as psychogenic amnesia). This results from a psychological cause, not by direct damage to the brain, and is a loss of memory of significant personal information, usually about traumatic or extremely stressful events. Usually this is seen as a gap or gaps in recall for aspects of someone's life history, but with severe acute trauma, such as during wartime, there can be a sudden acute onset of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition: DSM-IV-TR® |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC |year=2000 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of trauma on memory===

"Betrayal Trauma Theory" proposes that in cases of  childhood abuse, dissociative amnesia is an adaptive response, and that “victims may need to remain unaware of the trauma not to reduce suffering but rather to promote survival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | doi = 10.1207/s15327019eb0404_1  | last = Freyd| first =  J| year = 1994| title = Betrayal trauma: Traumatic amnesia as an adaptive response to childhood abuse  | journal = Ethics Behav  | volume = 4 | pages = 307–29| issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When stress interferes with memory, it is possible that some of the memory is kept by a system that records emotional experience, but there is no symbolic placement of it in time or space.&lt;ref name="Van der Kolk 1994 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Van der Kolk | first=B.A. | title=The Body Keeps the Score: Memory and the Evolving Psychobiology of Posttraumatic Stress | publisher=Harvard Medical School, Department of Psychiatry | year=1994 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOuUZwEACAAJ | access-date=7 August 2018 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Traumatic memories are retrieved, at least at first, in the form of dissociated mental imprints of the affective and sensory elements of the traumatic experience. Clients have reported the slow emergence of a personal narrative that can be considered explicit (conscious) memory.

Psychiatrist [[Bessel van der Kolk]]&lt;ref name=Van1995/&gt; divided the effects of traumas on memory functions into four sets:
* Traumatic amnesia; this involves the loss of memories of traumatic experiences. The younger the subject and the longer the traumatic event is, the greater the chance of significant amnesia. He stated that subsequent retrieval of memories after traumatic amnesia is well documented in the literature, with documented examples following natural disasters and accidents, in combat soldiers, in victims of kidnapping, torture and concentration camp experiences, in victims of physical and sexual abuse, and in people who have committed murder.
* Global [[Memory disorder|memory impairment]]; this makes it difficult for subjects to construct an accurate account of their present and past history.  "The combination of lack of autobiographical memory, continued dissociation and of meaning schemes that include victimization, helplessness and betrayal, is likely to make these individuals vulnerable to suggestion and to the construction of explanations for their trauma-related affects that may bear little relationship to the actual realities of their lives"
* [[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociative processes]]; this refers to memories being stored as fragments and not as unitary wholes.
* Traumatic memories’ [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] organization. Not being able to integrate traumatic memories seems to be linked to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;Diagnostic symptoms of PTSD include reexperience such as flashbacks and nightmares, difficulty falling or staying asleep, feelings of panic or fear, depression, headache, and physiological symptoms including irregular heartbeat and diarrhoea. [http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfoforall/problems/posttraumaticstressdisorder/posttraumaticstressdisorder.aspx  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)]. The Royal College of Psychiatrists&lt;/ref&gt;

According to van der Kolk, memories of highly significant events are usually accurate and stable over time; aspects of traumatic experiences appear to get stuck in the mind, unaltered by time passing or experiences that may follow. The imprints of traumatic experiences appear to be different from those of nontraumatic events, perhaps because of alterations in attentional focusing or the fact that extreme emotional arousal interferes with  memory.&lt;ref name=Van1995/&gt; van der Kolk and Fisler's hypothesis is that under extreme stress, the memory categorization system based in the hippocampus fails, with these memories kept as emotional and sensory states.  When these traces are remembered and put into a personal narrative, they are subject to being condensed, contaminated and embellished upon.

When there is inadequate recovery time between stressful situations, alterations may occur to the [[stress response]] system, some of which may be irreversible, and cause pathological responses, which may include memory loss, learning deficits and other maladaptive symptoms. In animal studies, high levels of [[cortisol]] can cause hippocampal damage, which may cause short-term memory deficits; in humans, MRI studies have shown reduced hippocampal volumes in combat veterans with PTSD, adults with posttraumatic symptoms and survivors of repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse. Trauma may also interfere with implicit memory, where periods of avoidance may be interrupted by intrusive emotional occurrences with no story to guide them. A difficult issue is whether those presumably abused accurately recall their experiences.&lt;ref name=Bremner2002&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bremner| first =  JD| year = 2002| title = Does Stress Damage the Brain?

The Working Group on Investigation of Memories of Child Abuse of the American Psychological Association presented findings mirroring those of the other professional organizations. The Working Group made five key conclusions:&lt;ref name="Working Group"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.17744/mehc.29.2.j0v2206152596157 |title=Recovered Memory Debate Revisited: Practice Implications for Mental Health Counselors |journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=93–120 |year=2007 |last1=Colangelo |first1=James }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Controversies regarding adult recollections should not be allowed to obscure the fact that child sexual abuse is a complex and pervasive problem in America that has historically gone unacknowledged;
# Most people who were sexually abused as children remember all or part of what happened to them;
# It is possible for memories of abuse that have been forgotten for a long time to be remembered;
# It is also possible to construct convincing pseudo-memories for events that never occurred; and
# There are gaps in our knowledge about the processes that lead to accurate and inaccurate recollections of childhood abuse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many critics believe that memories may be distorted and false. Psychologist [[Elizabeth Loftus]] questions the concept of repressed memories and the possibility of them being accurate. Loftus focuses on techniques that therapists use in order to help the patients recover their memory. Such techniques include age regression, guided visualization, trance writing, dream work, body work, and hypnosis.
Loftus' research indicates that repressed memory faces problems, such as memory alteration. In one case a teenage boy was able to “conjure a memory of an event that never occurred.” According to Loftus, if a stable person could be influenced to remember an event that never occurred, an emotionally stressed person would be even more susceptible.&lt;ref name=loftus1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftus|first=Elizabeth|title=The Reality of Repressed Memories|journal=American Psychologist|date=May 1993|volume=48|issue=1|pages=518–537|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.48.5.518|pmid=8507050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medico-legal issues===

Serious issues arise when recovered but false memories result in public allegations; false complaints carry serious consequences for the accused. Many of those who make false claims sincerely believe the truth of what they report. A special type of false allegation, the [[false memory syndrome]], arises typically within therapy, when people report the "recovery" of childhood memories of previously unknown abuse. The influence of practitioners' beliefs and practices in the eliciting of false "memories" and of false complaints has come under particular criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boakes | first1 = J |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1999 | title = False complaints of sexual assault: recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse | url = | journal = Med Sci Law | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 112–20 | pmid = 10332158 | doi = 10.1177/002580249903900205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally accepted that people sometimes are unable to recall traumatic experiences. An old version of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM-IV), published by the ''American Psychiatric Association'', states that "Dissociative amnesia is characterized by an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness."&lt;ref&gt;Section 300.12: [http://psych.org/MainMenu/Research/DSMIV.aspx DSM-IV] Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, American Psychiatric Association
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "recovered memory", however, is not listed in DSM-IV or used by any mainstream formal psychotherapy modality.&lt;ref name="whitfield56"&gt;{{cite book|title=Misinformation Concerning Child Sexual Abuse and Adult Survivors |last= Whitfield  |first=Charles L. |author2=Joyanna L. Silberg | author3=Paul Jay Fink |page=56 |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-7890-1901-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal state ===
Some criminal cases have been based on a witness's testimony of recovered repressed memories, often of alleged childhood sexual abuse. In some jurisdictions, the [[statute of limitations]] for child abuse cases has been extended to accommodate the phenomena of repressed memories as well as other factors.  The repressed memory concept came into wider public awareness in the 1980s and 1990s followed by a reduction of public attention after a series of scandals, lawsuits, and license revocations.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robbins, Susan P.|title= The Social and Cultural Context of Satanic Ritual Abuse Allegations|journal=Issues in Child Abuse Accusations|volume=10|year= 1998|url=http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume10/j10_8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass. 1996), United States District Court – District of Massachusetts Ann Shahzade, plaintiff Civil Action No.: V. 92-12139-EFH George Gregory, Defendant. {{cite web |url=http://www.jimhopper.com/memory-decision/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319013757/http://www.jimhopper.com/memory-decision/ |archivedate=March 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalenberg argues that the evidence shows that recovered memory cases should be allowed to be prosecuted in court.&lt;ref name=Dalenberg/&gt;

The apparent willingness of courts to credit the recovered memories of complainants but not the absence of memories by defendants has been commented on: "It seems apparent that the courts need better guidelines around the issue of dissociative amnesia in both populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =10.1016/S0160-2527(00)00066-2 | author =Porter S |display-authors=etal | year = 2001 | title = Memory for murder.

In 1995, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in Franklin v. Duncan and Franklin v. Fox, Murray ''et al''. (312 F3d. 423, see also 884 FSupp 1435, N.D. Calif.),&lt;ref&gt;Franklin v. Duncan Court Order https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3066228776991890480&lt;/ref&gt; that repressed memory is not admissible as evidence in a legal action because of its unreliability, inconsistency, unscientific nature, tendency to be therapeutically induced evidence, and subject to influence by hearsay and suggestibility. The court overturned the conviction of a man accused of murdering a nine-year-old girl purely based upon the evidence of a 21-year-old repressed memory by a lone witness, who also held a complex personal grudge against the defendant.&lt;ref name="articles.sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-11-21/news/17820388_1_appeals-court-george-franklin-repressed-memory-testimony | work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] | first=Reynolds | last=Holding | title=Repressed Memory Case Ruling / Appeals court refuses to restore murder conviction | date=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victimsofthestate.org/CA/Franklin.htm "Victims of the State: George Franklin"].

Mass. 1996); Civil Action No. 92-12139-EFH Memorandum and Order; May 8, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Freyd writes that Ross Cheit's case of suddenly remembered sexual abuse is one of the most well-documented cases available for the public to see. Cheit prevailed in two lawsuits, located five additional victims and tape-recorded a confession.&lt;ref name=Freyd/&gt;

On December 16, 2005, the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal issued a certificate confirming a Miscarriage of Justice to a former nun, [[Nora Wall]] whose 1999 conviction for child rape was partly based on repressed-memory evidence. The judgement stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IECCA/2005/C140.html |title=D.P.P.-v- Nora Wall [2005&amp;#93; IECCA 140 (16 December 2005) |publisher=Bailii.org |accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no scientific evidence of any sort adduced to explain the phenomenon of "flashbacks" and/or "retrieved memory", nor was the applicant in any position to meet such a case in the absence of prior notification thereof.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Darcythompson.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|In his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Thompson]] illustrates the [[Transformation (geometry)|geometric transformation]] of [[Argyropelecus|one fish's]] body form into [[Sternoptyx|another]] with a 20° [[shear mapping]]. He does not discuss the [[evolution]]ary causes of such a structural change, and has accordingly been suspected of [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;]]

'''Biological''' or '''process structuralism''' is a school of biological thought that objects to an exclusively [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] or [[adaptationism|adaptationist]] explanation of [[natural selection]] such as is described in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|20th century's modern synthesis]]. It proposes instead that [[Alternatives to Darwinism|evolution is guided differently]], basically by more or less physical forces which shape the development of an animal's body, and sometimes implies that these forces supersede selection altogether.

Structuralists have proposed different mechanisms that might have guided the formation of [[body plan]]s. Before Darwin, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued that animals shared  [[homology (biology)|homologous parts]], and that if one was enlarged, the others would be reduced in compensation. After Darwin, [[D'Arcy Thompson]] hinted at [[vitalism]] and offered geometric explanations in his classic 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. [[Adolf Seilacher]] suggested mechanical inflation for "pneu" structures in [[Ediacaran biota]] fossils such as ''[[Dickinsonia]]''. [[Günter P. Wagner]] argued for developmental bias, structural constraints on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. [[Stuart Kauffman]] favoured [[self-organisation]], the idea that complex structure emerges [[holism|holistically]] and spontaneously from the dynamic interaction of all parts of an [[organism]]. [[Michael Denton]] argued for laws of form by which [[Universals|Platonic universals]] or "Types" are self-organised. [[Stephen J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] proposed [[spandrel (biology)|biological "spandrels"]], features created as a byproduct of the adaptation of nearby structures. [[Gerd B. Müller]] and Stuart A. Newman argued that the appearance in the [[fossil record]] of most of the current [[phylum|phyla]] in the [[Cambrian explosion]] was "pre-Mendelian"{{efn|[[Gregor Mendel]] pioneered the study of [[genetics]].}} evolution caused by physical factors. [[Brian Goodwin]], described by Wagner as part of "a [[pseudoscience|fringe]] movement in evolutionary biology",&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt; denies that biological complexity can be [[reductionism|reduced]] to natural selection, and argues that [[pattern formation]] is driven by [[morphogenetic field]]s.

Darwinian biologists have criticised structuralism, emphasising that there is plentiful evidence both that natural selection is effective and, from [[deep homology]], that [[gene]]s have been involved in shaping organisms throughout [[evolutionary history]]. They accept that some structures such as the [[cell membrane]] self-assemble, but deny the ability of self-organisation to drive large-scale evolution.

==History==
[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Multiple [[alternatives to Darwinism]] have been offered since the 19th century to explain how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially objected to [[natural selection]]. Many of these theories, including structural or developmental constraints, led (solid blue arrows) to some form of directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows). These theories were largely swept aside by the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[genetics]] and natural selection in the early 20th century (dashed orange arrows).]]

===Geoffroy's law of compensation===
{{Main|Cuvier–Geoffroy debate}}

In 1830, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued a structuralist case against the functionalist ([[teleology in biology|teleological]]) position of [[Georges Cuvier]]. Geoffroy believed that [[homology (biology)|homologies]] of structure between animals indicated that they shared an ideal pattern; these did not imply evolution but a unity of plan, a law of nature.{{efn|In this, Geoffroy's homologies were like [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle's forms]].}} He further believed that if one part was more developed within a structure, the other parts would necessarily be reduced in compensation, as nature always used the same materials: if more of them were used for one feature, less was available for the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Racine, Valerie |title=Essay: The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/essay-cuvier-geoffroy-debate |publisher=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia, Arizona State University |date=7 October 2013 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D'Arcy Thompson's morphology===

In his "eccentric, beautiful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroi, Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] revisited the old idea of "[[hylomorphism|universal laws of form]]" to explain the observed forms of living organisms.&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ruse, Michael |editor1-last=Henning |editor1-first=Brian G. |editor2-last=Scarfe |editor2-first=Adam |title=Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |date=2013 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=419 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtosxAtq-EC|chapter=17. From Organicism to Mechanism-and Halfway Back?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science writer [[Philip Ball]] states that Thompson "presents mathematical principles as a shaping agency that may supersede natural selection, showing how the structures of the living world often echo those in inorganic nature", and notes his "frustration at the '[[Just So Stories|Just So]]' explanations of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] offered by Darwinians." Instead, Ball writes, Thompson elaborates on how not heredity but physical forces govern biological form.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=Philip |title=In retrospect: On Growth and Form |journal=Nature |date=7 February 2013|volume=494 |issue=7435 |pages=32–33 |doi=10.1038/494032a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v494/n7435/full/494032a.html|bibcode=2013Natur.494...32B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Michael Ruse]] similarly wrote that Thompson "had little time for natural selection", certainly preferring "mechanical explanations" and possibly straying into [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name="Ruse"/&gt;

Like Thompson, the palaeontologist [[Adolf Seilacher]] emphasised fabricational constraints on form.

===Wagner's constraints on development===

In his 2014 book ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation'', the evolutionary biologist [[Günter P. Wagner]] argues for "the study of novelty as distinct from adaptation." He defines novelty as occurring when some part of the body develops an individual and quasi-independent existence, in other words as a distinct and recognisable structure, which he implies might occur before natural selection begins to adapt the structure for some function.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014&gt;[[Günter P. Wagner|Wagner, Günter P.]], ''Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation''.  Princeton University Press. 2014. {{ISBN|978-0691156460}}.

===Kauffman's self-organisation===
[[File:Fluid Mosaic.svg|thumb|Darwinists and structuralists agree that cell structures like the [[cell membrane]] spontaneously [[self-organization#Biology|self-organize]]. They disagree on how important [[self-organization]] is in other areas of biology.]]

The mathematical biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]] suggested in 1993 that [[self-organization#Biology|self-organization]] may play a role alongside [[natural selection]] in three areas of [[evolutionary biology]], namely [[population dynamics]], [[molecular evolution]], and [[morphogenesis]]. With respect to molecular biology, Kauffman has been criticised for ignoring the role of [[energy]] in driving [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] in cells, which can fairly be called self-[[catalysis|catalysing]] but which do not simply self-organise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=Ronald F. |title=Review of Stuart Kauffman, The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution |journal=Biophys.

===Denton's 'T&lt;!--U/C name--&gt;ypes'===
The biochemist [[Michael Denton]]&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Denton|Denton, Michael]]. ''[[Evolution: A Theory in Crisis]]'', Adler &amp; Adler, 1985. ISBN 0-917561-52-X&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; has argued a structuralist case for self-organization. In a 2013 paper, he claimed that "the basic forms of the natural world—the Types—are immanent in nature, and determined by a set of special natural biological laws, the so called 'laws of form'." He asserts that these "recurring patterns and forms" are "genuine [[universals]]".{{efn|Universals are central to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] theory, [[Platonic realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=plato-metaphysics |title=Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology |last=Silverman |first=Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Form is in this view not shaped by natural selection, but by "self-organizing properties of particular categories of matter" and by "cosmic fine-tuning of the laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Michael J. |title=The Types: A Persistent Structuralist Challenge to Darwinian Pan-Selectionism |journal=BIO-Complexity |date=August 2013 |url=http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2013.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denton has been criticised by the biochemist Laurence A. Moran as anti-Darwinian and favouring [[creationism]].&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moran |first1=Laurence A. |title=What is "Structuralism"? |url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/what-is-structuralism.html |website=Sandwalk (blog of a recognised expert) |accessdate=9 December 2016|date=2016-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gould and Lewontin's spandrels===
&lt;!--File:San Marco spandrel.jpg|in the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica di San Marco]], [[Venice]] --&gt;

{{main|Spandrel (biology)}}

In 1979, influenced by Seilacher among others, the [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen J. Gould]] and the [[population genetics|population geneticist]] [[Richard Lewontin]] wrote what Wagner called "the most influential structuralist manifesto", "The [[spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]]s of San Marco and the [[Panglossian]] Paradigm".&lt;ref name=GouldLewontin1979&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme |journal=Proc.

Instead, architects couldn't help creating small triangular areas between [[arch]]es and [[pillar]]s, as arches need (evolve) to be curved, and pillars need to be vertical. The resulting spandrels are [[exaptation]]s, consequences of other evolutionary changes. Evolution, they argued, did not select for a protruding human chin: instead, reducing the length of the tooth row left the jaw protruding.&lt;ref name=Wagner2014/&gt;

===Müller and Newman's pre-Mendelian evolution===

Extreme structuralists like [[Gerd B. Müller]] and Stuart A. Newman, inheriting the viewpoint of D'Arcy Thompson, have proposed that physical laws of structure, not [[genetics]], govern major diversifications such as the [[Cambrian explosion]], followed later by co-opted genetic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Erwin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erwin |first1=Douglas H. |author1link=Douglas Erwin |title=Evolutionary uniformitarianism |journal=Developmental Biology |date=September 2011 |volume=357 |issue=1 |pages=27–34 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.01.020 |pmid=21276788 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160611000443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller | first1=Gerd B. |author1link=Gerd B.

They note for example that [[deep homology|deep homologies]] between widely separated groups of organisms, such as the [[signalling pathway]]s and [[transcription factor]]s of [[choanoflagellate]]s and [[metazoa]]ns, demonstrate that genes have been involved throughout [[evolutionary history]].&lt;ref name="King2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Nicole |title=The Unicellular Ancestry of Animal Development |journal=Developmental Cell |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=313–325 |doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2004.08.010|pmid=15363407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from evolutionary biologists==
[[File:CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified, Animals emphasized.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Laurence Moran notes that structuralism focuses mainly on [[animal]]s, but that animals (emphasized) form only a small portion of the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]].&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;]]

While agreeing that pattern formation mechanisms such as those described by Goodwin exist, the biologists Richard Dawkins, Stephen J. Gould, [[Lynn Margulis]], and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have criticised Goodwin for suggesting that chemical signalling forms an alternative to natural selection.&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;

Moran, a "skeptical biochemist", comments that 'structuralism' is a "new buzzword ... guaranteed to impress the creationist crowd because nobody understands what it means but it sounds very 'sciency' and philosophical."&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt; The philosopher of science [[Paul E. Griffiths]] writes that structuralists "view this structuring of the space of biological possibility as part of the fundamental physical structure of nature. But the phenomena of phylogenetic inertia and developmental constraint do not support this interpretation. These phenomena show that the evolutionary pathways available to an organism are a function of the developmental structure of the organism."&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Paul E. |authorlink=Paul E. Griffiths |title=Darwinism, Process Structuralism, and Natural Kinds |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=63 |year=1996 |pages=S1–S9 |doi=10.1086/289930 |jstor=188505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moran summarizes: "There's nothing in science that supports the views of the structuralists. We have perfectly good explanations for why bumblebees are different than mushrooms and why all vertebrates have vertebrae and not exoskeletons. There's no evidence to support the idea that if you replay the tape of life it will come out looking anything like what we see today. You can be confident that when you visit another planet you will not find vertebrates."&lt;ref name=MoranWhatIsStruct/&gt;

The [[evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biologist]] [[Lewis Held]] wrote that "The notion that aspects of anatomy can be explained by physical forces (like expansion cracking) was advocated ~ 100 years earlier in D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 ''On Growth and Form'' and in [[Theodore Andrea Cook|Theodore Cook]]'s 1914 book ''The Curves of Life''.{{efn|The artist Theodore Cook's ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924028937179 The Curves of Life]'', Constable, 1914 to some extent anticipated D'Arcy Thompson, exploring [[spiral]]s in art and nature.}} Over the intervening century, various traits have been proposed to arise ''mechanically'' rather than ''genetically'': brain convolutions, cartilage condensations, flower corrugations, tooth cusps, and fish otoliths. To this kooky list we can now add the crooked smile of the crocodile, or at least the cracked skin that surrounds it."{{efn |Held's final point was that the cracks in the crocodile's skin are genuinely explained by cracking, unlike all the other examples he lists.&lt;ref name=Held2014/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Held2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Held |first=Lewis Irving |title=How the snake lost its legs: curious tales from the frontier of evo-devo |titlelink=How the Snake Lost its Legs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom New York |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-62139-8 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">In [[type theory]], a type system has the property of '''subject reduction''' (also '''subject evaluation''', '''type preservation''' or simply '''preservation''') if [[evaluation (computer science)|evaluation]] of [[expression (computer science)|expression]]s does not cause their [[type (computer science)|type]] to change. Formally, if Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'' and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  then Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;''.

Together with [[progress (type theory)|progress]], it is an important meta-theoretical property for establishing [[type soundness]] of a type system.

The opposite property, if Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'' and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  then Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'', is called '''subject expansion'''. It often does not hold as evaluation can erase ill-typed sub-terms of an expression, resulting in a well-typed one.

'''Systems simulation''' is a set of techniques that use [[computer]]s to imitate the operations of various real-world tasks or processes through [[simulation]]. Computers are used to generate numeric models for the purpose of describing or displaying complex interaction among multiple variables within a system. The complexity of the system arises from the [[stochastic]] (probabilistic) nature of the events, rules for the interaction of the elements and the difficulty in perceiving the behavior of the systems as a whole with the passing of time.

==Systems Simulation in Video Games==
One of the most notable video games to incorporate systems simulation is [[Sim City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/the-philosophy-of-simcity-an-interview-with-the-games-lead-designer/275724/|title=The Philosophy of SimCity: An Interview With the Game's Lead Designer|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which simulates the multiple systems of a functioning city including but not limited to: electricity, water, sewage, public transportation, population growth, social interactions (including, but not limited to jobs, education and emergency response).

The '''Tetrapharmakos''' ({{lang|grc|τετραφάρμακος}}) "four-part remedy" is a summary of the first four of the Κύριαι Δόξαι (''Kuriai Doxai'', the forty Epicurean ''Principal Doctrines'' given by [[Diogenes Laertius]] in his ''[[Lives of the Eminent Philosophers|Life of Epicurus]]'') in [[Epicureanism]],  a recipe for leading the happiest possible life.  
They are recommendations to avoid [[anxiety]] or [[existential dread]].&lt;ref&gt;"The fundamental obstacle to happiness, says Epicurus, is [[anxiety]],"  Hutchinson 1994, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[tetrapharmacum|tetrapharmakos]]" was originally a compound of four drugs ([[wax]], [[tallow]], [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and [[resin]]); the word has been used metaphorically by Roman-era Epicureans.&lt;ref&gt;The name cannot be traced further back than [[Cicero]] and [[Philodemos]].  
Pamela Gordon, ''Epicurus in Lycia: The Second-century World of Diogenes of Oenoanda'', University of Michigan Press (1996), p. 61, fn 85, citing A. Angeli, "Compendi, eklogai, tetrapharmakos" (1986), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the four remedies for healing the soul.&lt;ref&gt;See Liddell and Scott, ''[[Greek–English Lexicon]]'', New Edition revised and Augmented by Stuart Jones, Oxford, Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a summary of the first four of the forty Epicurean ''Principal Doctrines'' (''Sovran Maxims'') given by [[Diogenes Laertius]], which in the [[:wikisource:Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_X#Kuriai_Doxai|translation]] by [[Robert Drew Hicks]] (1925) read as follows:

:1. A happy and eternal being has no trouble himself and brings no trouble upon any other being; hence he is exempt from movements of anger and partiality, for every such movement implies weakness 
:2. Death is nothing to us; for the body, when it has been resolved into its elements, has no feeling, and that which has no feeling is nothing to us. 
:3. The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit in the removal of all pain. When pleasure is present, so long as it is uninterrupted, there is no pain either of body or of mind or of both together. 
:4. Continuous pain does not last long in the body; on the contrary, pain, if extreme, is present a short time, and even that degree of pain which barely outweighs pleasure in the body does not last for many days together. Illnesses of long duration even permit of an excess of pleasure over pain in the body. 

===Don't fear god===
In Hellenistic religion, the gods  were conceived as hypothetical beings in a perpetual state of bliss,  indestructible entities that are completely invulnerable. Gods in this view are mere role models for human beings, who are to "emulate the happiness of the gods, within the limits imposed by human nature."&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson 1994, p. ix–x.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Don't worry about death===
As D. S. Hutchinson wrote concerning this line, "While you are alive, you don't have to deal with being dead, but when you are dead you don't have to deal with it either, because you aren't there to deal with it." In Epicurus' own words, "Death means nothing to us...when we exist, death is not yet present, and when death is present, then we do not exist,"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html Letter to Menoeceus]'', 125&lt;/ref&gt; for there is no [[afterlife]]. Death, says Epicurus, is the greatest anxiety of all, in length and intensity. This anxiety about death impedes the quality and happiness of one's life by the theory of afterlife: the worrying about whether or not one's deeds and actions in life will translate well into the region of the gods, the wondering whether one will be assigned to an eternity of pain or to an eternity of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson 1994, p. viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===What is good is easy to get===
Sustenance and shelter, these things can be acquired by anyone — by both animal and human — with minimal effort, regardless of wealth. But if one wants more than one needs (over indulgency, gluttony, etc.), one is limiting the chances of satisfaction and happiness, and therefore creating a “needless anxiety” in one’s life. "What is good is easy to get" implies that the minimum amount of necessity it takes to satisfy an urge is the maximum amount of interest a person should have in satisfying that urge.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson 1994, p. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===What is terrible is easy to endure===
The Epicureans understood that, in nature, illness and pain is not suffered for very long, for pain and suffering is either "brief or chronic ... either mild or intense, but discomfort that is both chronic and intense is very unusual; so there is no need to be concerned about the prospect of suffering." Like "What is good is easy to get," recognizing one's physical and mental limit and one's threshold of pain — understanding how much pain the body or mind can endure — and maintaining confidence that pleasure only follows pain (and the avoidance of anxiety about the length of pain), is the remedy against prolonged suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson 1994, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Game''' is a [[mental game]] where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself. Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win most versions of The Game. Depending on the variation of The Game, the whole world, or all those aware of the game, are playing it all the time. Tactics have been developed to increase the number of people aware of The Game and thereby increase the number of losses.

== Gameplay ==
There are three commonly reported rules to The Game:&lt;ref name="nebraskan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/mind-game-enlivens-students-across-u-s/article_8770c834-d289-52d5-a6c8-b6fac8c98263.html|title=Mind game enlivens students across U.S.|first=Andy|last=Boyle|date=19 March 2007|newspaper=The Daily Nebraskan|access-date=18 May 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="depers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Rules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/12/03/three-rules-of-the-game-210986/|title=Three rules of The Game|date=2008-12-03|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rutland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MCNP&amp;p_multi=RHDB&amp;p_theme=mcnp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11C0ED30E5F12A50&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Don't think about the game|work=[[Rutland Herald]]|date=3 October 2007|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Everyone in the world is playing The Game. (This is alternatively expressed as, "Everybody in the world who knows about The Game is playing The Game" or "You are always playing The Game.") A person cannot refuse to play The Game; it does not require consent to play and one can never stop playing.
# Whenever one thinks about The Game, one loses.
# Losses must be announced. This can be verbally, with a phrase such as "I just lost The Game", or in any other way: for example, via [[Facebook]]. Some people may have ways to remind others of The Game.

The definition of "thinking about The Game" is not always clear. If one discusses The Game without realizing that they have lost, this may or may not constitute a loss. If someone says "What is The Game?" before understanding the rules, whether they have lost is up for interpretation. According to some interpretations, one does not lose when someone else announces their loss, although the second rule implies that one loses regardless of what made them think about The Game. After a player has announced a loss, or after one thinks of The Game, some variants allow for a [[grace period]] between three seconds to thirty minutes to forget about the game, during which the player cannot lose the game again.&lt;ref name="canpress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080117/thegame_youlose_080117|title=Teens around the world are playing 'the game'|work=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=17 January 2008|first=Shannon|last=Montgomery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lal"/&gt;

The common rules do not define a point at which The Game ends. However, some players state that The Game ends when the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] announces on television that "The Game is up."&lt;ref name="The Rules"/&gt;

=== Strategies ===
Strategies focus on making others lose The Game. Common methods include saying "The Game" out loud or writing about The Game on a hidden note, in graffiti in public places, or on banknotes.&lt;ref name="depers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.depers.nl/entertainment/269673/Nederland-gaat-nu-ook-verliezen.html|title=Nederland gaat nu ook verliezen|work=[[De Pers]]|date=15 December 2008|first=Sanne|last=Rooseboom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215183945/http://www.depers.nl/entertainment/269673/Nederland-gaat-nu-ook-verliezen.html|archivedate=15 December 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/12/03/if-you-read-this-youve-lost-the-game-210990/|title=If you read this you've lost The Game|date=3 December 2008|newspaper=[[Metro (British Newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations may be made with The Game, especially over time, so that one thing inadvertently causes one to lose. Some players enjoy thinking of elaborate pranks that will cause others to lose the game.&lt;ref name="kansas"/&gt;

Other strategies involve merchandise: T-shirts, buttons, mugs, posters and bumper stickers have been created to advertise The Game. The Game is also spread via social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref name="kansas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/851/story/1336405.html|title='The Game' is a fad that will get you every time|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724150953/http://www.kansascity.com/851/story/1336405.html|deadurl=yes|date=21 July 2009|archivedate=24 July 2009|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|last=Fussell|first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:You lose The Game.jpg|thumb|right|A woman holds up a sign reading "You Lose The Game".]]
The origins of The Game are uncertain. In a 2008 news article, Justine Wettschreck says The Game has probably been around since the early 1990s, and may have originated in Australia or England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dglobe.com/content/column-playing-game-other-kids|title=Playing 'The Game' with the other kids|last=Wettschreck|first=Justine|publisher=[[Daily Globe (Worthington)|Daily Globe]]|date=31 May 2008|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that it was invented in [[London]] in 1996 when two British engineers, Dennis Begley and Gavin McDowall, missed their last train and had to spend the night on the platform; they attempted to avoid thinking about their situation and whoever thought about it first lost.&lt;ref name="lal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; Another theory also traces The Game to London in 1996, when it was created by Jamie Miller "to annoy people".&lt;ref name="canpress"/&gt; Journalist Mic Wright of ''The Next Web'' recalled playing The Game at school in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2015/04/13/you-just-lost-again/|title=You just lost The Game: the enduring hold of the pre-Web world’s Rickroll|last=Wright|first=Mic|work=The Next Web|date=April 13, 2015|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, The Game may have been created in 1977 by members of the [[Cambridge University Science Fiction Society]] when attempting to create a game that did not fit in with [[game theory]]. A blog post by Paul Taylor in August 2002 described The Game; Taylor claimed to have "found out about [the game] online about 6 months ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arseburgers.co.uk/blog/archives/000246.html|title=The Game (I lost!).|date=10 August 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614182818/http://www.arseburgers.co.uk/blog/archives/000246.html|archivedate=14 June 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest known reference on the internet.&lt;ref name=canpress/&gt;

The Game is most commonly spread through the internet, such as via [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]], or by word of mouth.&lt;ref name="kansas"/&gt;

== Psychology ==
{{see also|Ironic process theory}}
The Game is an example of ironic processing (also known as the "White Bear Principle"), in which attempts to avoid certain thoughts make those thoughts more persistent.&lt;ref name="lal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laloyolan.com/opinion/you-just-lost-the-game/article_597f90c7-7397-5050-87a1-229cbf4317e3.html|title=You just lost the Game|last=Kaniewski|first=Katie|date=1 March 2009|work=Los Angeles Loyolan|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are early examples of ironic processing: in 1840, [[Leo Tolstoy]] played the "white bear game" with his brother, where he would "stand in a corner and not think of the white bear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tolstoy|first=Leo|authorlink=Leo Tolstoy|date=2008|title=Leo Tolstoy, His Life and Work|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3M2WxoNXUzIC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=|archiveurl=https://archive.org/stream/leotolstoyhislif00biriiala/leotolstoyhislif00biriiala_djvu.txt|archivedate=6 July 2014|isbn=1408676974}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] mentioned the same game in 1863 in the essay ''[[Winter Notes on Summer Impressions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFLsy9JR-RsC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Try+to+pose+for+yourself+this+task:+not+to+think+of+a+polar+bear+and+you+will+see+that+the+cursed+thing+will+come+to+mind+every+minute.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8qrPzep_wL&amp;sig=kY3nobR8ZmN36IAINHtagca5A4k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s_fLS4PcD4SyrAeYvrGXBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Try%20to%20pose%20for%20yourself%20this%20task%3A%20not%20to%20think%20of%20a%20polar%20bear%20and%20you%20will%20see%20that%20the%20cursed%20thing%20will%20come%20to%20mind%20every%20minute.%22&amp;f=false|title=Winter Notes on Summer Impressions|page=49|last=Dostoyevsky|first=Fyodor|publisher=''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]''|date=1863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The Game has been described as challenging and fun to play, and as pointless, childish and infuriating.&lt;ref name="canpress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lal"/&gt; In some [[Internet forum]]s, such as [[Something Awful]] and [[GameSpy]], and several schools, The Game has been banned.&lt;ref name="depers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt;

The 2009 [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] poll was [[Time 100#Hacking|most likely manipulated]] by the hacktivist group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], so that the top 21 people's names formed an [[acrostic]] for "marblecake also the game", referencing The Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/time-magazine-throws-up-its-hands-as-it-gets-pwned-by-4chan/|title=Time Magazine Throws Up Its Hands As It Gets Pwned By 4Chan|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|last=Schonfeld|first=Erick|date=27 April 2009|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/04/marble-cake-and/|title=Marble Cake and moot|work=[[ABC News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111113606/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/04/marble-cake-and|deadurl=yes|date=30 April 2009|accessdate=2 November 2014|archivedate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures''''' ({{lang-de|Der Philosophische Diskurs der Moderne: Zwölf Vorlesungen}}) is a 1985 book by [[Jürgen Habermas]], in which the author reconstructs and deals in depth with a number of philosophical approaches to the critique of modern [[reason]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] "project" since [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], including the work of 20th century philosophers [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]]. The work is regarded as an important contribution to [[Frankfurt School|Frankfurt School critical theory]]. It has been characterized as a critical (largely negative) evaluation of the concept of [[world disclosure]] in modern philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kompridis" /&gt;

An English translation by [[Frederick G. Lawrence]] was published in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22J%3Frgen+Habermas%22The+Philosophical+Discourse+of+Modernity%22%22Frederick+G.+Lawrence%22 occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;  A French translation by Christian Bouchindhomme and Rainer Rochlitz was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Le Discours philosophique de la modernité : Douze conférences'' (Paris: Gallimard, 1988).  {{ISBN|978-2-07-074632-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Habermas presents an outline of the “cultural self-understanding of modernity” as it emerged in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and attempts to retrieve the “historical context of Western rationalism” in which modernity or modernization (more narrowly conceived in terms of social and economic transformation)&lt;ref&gt;Habermas summarizes this transformation in the following way: “…the concept of modernization refers to a bundle of processes that are cumulative and mutually reinforcing: to the formation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]… the development of the [[forces of production]]… the establishment of a centralized state power and the formation of national identities; to the proliferation of rights of political participation, of urban forms of life, and of formal schooling; to the [[secularization]] of values and norms.” ''Philosophical Discourse'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; was originally understood as both a process of [[disenchantment]] and [[Social alienation|alienation]] ''as well as'' the “historical objectification of rational structures.”&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen, ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''. Tr. by Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1987. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This presentation prepares the ground for the larger argument of the book, namely, that by losing sight of the “cultural impulse of modernity,” and abandoning the project of modernity as a whole, European intellectuals on both ends of the political spectrum have ignored the emancipatory dimension of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and thereby have renounced the only means of developing a consistent and [[immanent critique]] of modernity itself.

Modernity is defined by Habermas as a set of problems related to the issue of time, problems produced by the transformation of European society in accordance with what Hegel called the “principle of [[subjectivity]],” the notion of individual autonomy as the essence of man.&lt;ref&gt;‘In modernity… religious life, state, and society as well as science, morality, and art are transformed into just so many embodiments of the principle of subjectivity.” ''Philosophical Discourse'', 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This freedom from all forms of external [[authority]], which includes [[nature]] as well as [[tradition]], means that the subject “has to create its normativity out of itself;”&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, ''Philosophical Discourse'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; because it is free, it cannot accept any value or law that it does not recognize as its own. Subjectivity, in other words, is defined by “the right to criticism: the principle of the modern world requires that what anyone is to recognize shall reveal itself to him as something entitled to recognition."&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, ''Philosophical Discourse'',17&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as the subject wills only those laws that recognizes as rational, laws which are “self-proscribed and self-obligated,” the subject wills only itself, or, in Hegel terms, it “wills the Will:” “The [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] is Free only when it does not will anything alien, extrinsic, foreign to itself (as long as it does so, it is dependent), but wills itself alone&amp;nbsp;– wills the Will. This is the absolute Will&amp;nbsp;– the volition to be free.”&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F Hegel, ''The Philosophy of History'', trans. J. Sibree, Buffalo: Prometheus Books. 1991, 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Habermas, Nietzsche undertakes a critique of “subject-centered reason,” of modern forms of knowledge and [[ethics]], from a standpoint that only appears to be “[[genealogical]],” that is, situated, historically, outside of modernity and Enlightenment thinking in an archaic, Dionysian era of myth, prior to the formation of modern subjectivity in the renunciation of instinct or “life.” He sees Nietzsche’s argument that all moral and cognitive claims (along with the rational subject) are the historical products of a power forced inward by its inability to discharge itself not as being based on a genealogy of modernity, but rather as a critique of the modern cognitive and practical subject from the perspective of an equally modern [[aesthetics]] (which Nietzsche “transposes,” according to Habermas, “into the archaic”), elevating the “judgment of taste of the art critic into a model for value judgment.” Nietzsche's critique of subject, in other words, is based on a modern aesthetic experience&amp;nbsp;– in particular, the “painful de-differentiation, a de-delimitation of the individual, a merging with amorphous nature within and without”&amp;nbsp;– which presupposes the modern subject itself. What appears, then, in Nietzsche as the historical “other” reason is in fact a version of [[Kantian aesthetics]] shorn of any claim of intersubjective validity.

==Reception==
''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity'' is regarded as an important contribution to [[Frankfurt School|Frankfurt School critical theory]]. It has been characterized as a critical (largely negative) evaluation of the concept of [[world disclosure]] in modern philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kompridis"&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Doughty Miller''' (September 19, 1835 – March 1, 1897) was a Baptist preacher from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the late 19th century. Before the [[US Civil War]] (1861-1865), he was a part of [[abolitionist]] society in Philadelphia, and after the war he played a leading role in the Baptist Church. In 1881 he was called "the best colored preacher ever located in Philadelphia".&lt;ref name="Cathcart1881"&gt;Cathcart, William, ed. The Baptist Encyclopædia: A Dictionary of the Doctrines, Ordinances, Usages, Confessions of Faith, Sufferings, Labors, and Successes, and of the General History of the Baptist Denomination in All Lands: with Numerous Biographical Sketches of Distinguished American and Foreign Baptists, and a Supplement. Vol. 2. LH Everts, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Theodore Doughty Miller was born September 19, 1835 in New York City. His parents were Henry and Sarah Miller. Henry died when Theodore was an infant and Sarah died when he was about sixteen. He had an older brother who went to California during the gold rush and died in the 1862 sinking of the [[SS Golden Gate]]. As a boy, he went to colored school no. 1 headed by [[John Patterson (educator)|John Patterson]]. In July, 1849 he passed the teacher's examination and became first assistant in the Public High School. As a youth he attended St. Phillips Episcopal Church. He left this church and joined the Church of the Messiah led by [[Alexander Crummell]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p260-266&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1849 to 1851 he studied during the evenings and Saturdays at the [[St. Augustine Institute]] and began to study all religious creeds and compare them with the bible. He was baptized into the Baptist church, but did not agree with that church's doctrine of Baptism. In 1851 he moved to [[Trenton, New Jersey]] to become principal of a public school there. Around that time he married Elizabeth P. Wood. He also helped form a young men's association and organized a choir and Sunday school of the local Mt. Zion A. M. E. church. In 1856 he left Trenton to take charge of a public school at [[Newburgh, New York]], where he finally joined the Baptist church along with his wife, both being baptized February 22, 1857 in the [[Hudson River]]. He joined the Shiloh Baptist Church where his position as a church leader was opposed by the white pastor. In spite of this, he was chosen as teacher and then superintendent of the Sunday school and made a trustee and deacon of the church. When his further advancement was opposed by the pastor, he opened his own church where he preached on Sunday afternoons and nights - although he was not licensed to preach by the Church. He attended the [[American Baptist Missionary Society]] Convention at Philadelphia in 1858&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; where he along with [[Leonard Grimes]], [[William Spellman]], and [[Sampson White]] pushed the organization to oppose slavery. They voted to have no fellowship with slave-holding ministries.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Henry H. Black Church beginnings: The long-hidden realities of the first years. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004. p120&lt;/ref&gt; He preached at the convention and he was given a recommendation that he be licensed, either at Shiloh or at the First Baptist Church, a white church which had promised to give him license. Under this pressure, Shiloh granted him a license and he began to preach.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In 1858, he was called by the Zion Baptist Church of [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and was ordained on January 19, 1859 at the Concord Street Church in Brooklyn. That same year, he moved to [[Albany, New York]] where he preached for five years&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; at the Hamilton Street Baptist Church. In Albany, Miller supported anti-slavery efforts and served as secretary of the Irrepressible Conflict Society for Human Rights organized immediately following the execution of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in December 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Benjamin. Allies for Freedom. Da Capo Press, 2001. p150-1953&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he studied under [[Elias Lyman Magoon]], a noted preacher in Albany. In 1864, he preached at Oak Street Baptist Church and the Pearl Street Church, both in West Philadelphia, and became pastor at the Pearl Street Branch on August 1, where he finally settled.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; The church was also known as the First Baptist Church and moved to Cherry Street when it overran capacity at the previous location.&lt;ref&gt;Africa, the Colored Population of Philadelphia, The Evening Telegraph (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) March 30, 1867, page 1-2, accessed September 19, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6696219// and https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6696227//&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership in the Baptist Church==
He held many leadership positions in the church, including corresponding secretary of the American Baptist Missionary Convention and recording secretary of the New England Baptist Missionary Convention.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He gave the opening sermon at the Philadelphia Baptist Association in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons 1887 and Cathcart 1881 have it in 1879, Pegues 1892 has 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; He led the Sunday School at his church. He organized a church in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] and a branch of his church in [[Germantown, Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He also received a [[Doctor of Divinity]].&lt;ref name="Pegues1892"&gt;Pegues, Albert Witherspoon.

'''Virtue''' ({{lang-la|[[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]}}, {{lang-grc|ἀρετή}} "[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]") is [[morality|moral]] [[excellence]]. A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally [[Good and evil|good]] and thus is [[Value (ethics)|valued]] as a foundation of [[principle]] and good moral being. Personal virtues are characteristics [[Value (personal and cultural)|valued]] as promoting collective and individual greatness. In other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards. Doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong. The opposite of virtue is [[vice]]. 

The four classic cardinal  virtues are temperance, prudence, courage, and justice. Christianity derives the three theological virtues of faith, hope and love (charity) from 1 Corinthians. Together these make up the [[seven virtues]]. Buddhism's four [[brahmavihara]] ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The Japanese [[Bushidō]] code is characterized by up to ten virtues,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} including rectitude, courage, and benevolence.

==Etymology==
The ancient Romans used the Latin word ''virtus'' (derived from ''vir'', their word for ''man'') to refer to all of the "excellent qualities of men, including physical strength, valorous conduct, and moral rectitude." The French words ''vertu'' and ''virtu'' came from this Latin root. In the 13th century, the word ''virtue'' was "borrowed into English".&lt;ref&gt;’’The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories’’. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==
[[File:Maat.svg|thumb|upright|[[Maat]], to [[ancient Egypt]]ians, personified the virtue of [[truth]] and [[justice]]. Her feather represents truth.&lt;ref&gt;Karenga, M. (2004), Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During Egyptian civilization, [[Maat]] or Ma'at (thought to have been pronounced *[muʔ.ʕat]), also spelled māt or mayet, was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian concept of [[truth]], [[balance (metaphysics)|balance]], [[Natural order (philosophy)|order]], [[law]], [[morality]], and [[justice]]. Maat was also personified as a goddess regulating the stars, seasons, and the actions of both mortals and the deities. The deities set the order of the universe from chaos at the moment of creation. Her (ideological) counterpart was [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], who symbolized [[chaos (mythology)|chaos]], lies, and injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Norman Rufus Colin Cohn| title = Cosmos, Caos and the World to Come: The Ancient Roots of Apocalyptic Faith| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-300-05598-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Assmann]], Translated by Rodney Livingstone, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8047-4523-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical antiquity==
[[File:Arete - Areté- Éfeso.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Personification]] of virtue ([[Greek Language|Greek]] ''Ἀρετή'') in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesos]], [[Turkey]]]]

===Platonic virtue===
The four classic [[cardinal virtues]] are:&lt;ref&gt;Stanley B. Cunningham (2002), Review of Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy, Dialogue, Volume 21, Issue 01, March 1982, pp. 133–37&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]: {{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}} (''sōphrosynē'')
* [[prudence]]: {{lang|grc|φρόνησις}} (''phronēsis'')
* [[courage]]: {{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}} (''andreia'')
* [[justice (virtue)|justice]]: {{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}} (''dikaiosynē'')

This enumeration is traced to Greek philosophy and was listed by [[Plato]] in addition to [[piety]]: {{lang|grc|ὁσιότης}} (hosiotēs), with the exception that wisdom replaced prudence as virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, D. J. (1991), [http://www.peterlang.de/download/datasheet/42753/datasheet_61504.pdf The virtue of prudence], P. Lang., in Studies in Moral Philosophy. Vol. 5 General Editor: John Kekes&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (1988), The cardinal virtues and Plato's moral psychologym The Philosophical Quarterly, 38(151), pp. 186–200&lt;/ref&gt; consider either of the above four virtue combinations as mutually reducible and therefore not cardinal.

It is unclear whether multiple virtues were of later construct, and whether Plato subscribed to a unified view of virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, The Unity of the Virtues in the "Protagoras", The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 25, No. 3 (Mar., 1972), pages 415-458&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' and ''[[Meno]]'', for example, he states that the separate virtues cannot exist independently and offers as evidence the contradictions of acting with wisdom, yet in an unjust way; or acting with bravery (fortitude), yet without wisdom.

=== Aristotelian virtue ===
In his work ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] defined a virtue as a point between a deficiency and an excess of a trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aristotle |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/summary.html |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point of greatest virtue lies not in the exact middle, but at a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] sometimes closer to one extreme than the other. However, the virtuous action is not simply the "mean" (mathematically speaking) between two opposite extremes.  As Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics: "at the right times, about the right things, towards the right people, for the right end, and in the right way, is the intermediate and best condition, and this is proper to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |title=Nicomachean Ethics |publisher=Home.wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232937/http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not simply splitting the difference between two extremes.  For example, generosity is a virtue between the two extremes of miserliness and being profligate.  Further examples include: courage between cowardice and foolhardiness, and confidence between [[self-deprecation]] and vanity.  In Aristotle's sense, virtue is excellence at being human.

===Prudence and virtue===
[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], the Roman [[Stoicism|Stoic]], said that perfect [[prudence]] is indistinguishable from perfect virtue. Thus, in considering all consequences, a prudent person would act in the same way as a virtuous person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The same rationale was expressed by [[Plato]] in [[Meno]], when he wrote that people only act in ways that they perceive will bring them maximum good. It is the lack of wisdom that results in the making of a bad choice instead of a prudent one. In this way, wisdom is the central part of virtue. Plato realized that because virtue was synonymous with wisdom it could be taught, a possibility he had earlier discounted. He then added "correct belief" as an alternative to knowledge, proposing that knowledge is merely correct belief that has been thought through and "tethered".

===Roman virtues===
The term "virtue" itself is derived from the Latin [[Virtus (virtue)|"virtus"]] (the personification of which was the deity [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]), and had connotations of [[masculinity|"manliness"]], [[honor|"honour"]], worthiness of deferential respect, and civic duty as both [[Cincinnatus|citizen and soldier]]. This virtue was but one of many virtues which Romans of good character were expected to exemplify and pass on through the generations, as part of the [[mos maiorum|Mos Maiorum]]; ancestral traditions which defined [[Romanitas|"Roman-ness"]]. Romans distinguished between the spheres of private and public life, and thus, virtues were also divided between those considered to be in the realm of private family life (as lived and taught by the [[paterfamilias]]), and those expected of an upstanding Roman [[Citizenship#Roman ideas|citizen]].

Most Roman concepts of virtue were also personified as a [[numina|numinous deity]]. The primary Roman virtues, both public and private, were:
* [[Auctoritas]] – "spiritual authority" – the sense of one's social standing, built up through experience, Pietas, and Industria. This was considered to be essential for a magistrate's ability to enforce law and order.
* Comitas – "humour" – ease of manner, courtesy, openness, and friendliness.
* Constantia – "perseverance" – military stamina, as well as general mental and physical endurance in the face of hardship.
* [[Clementia]] – "mercy" – mildness and gentleness, and the ability to set aside previous transgressions.
* [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|Dignitas]] – "dignity" – a sense of self-worth, personal self-respect and self-esteem.
* [[Disciplina]] – "discipline" – considered essential to military excellence; also connotes adherence to the legal system, and upholding the duties of citizenship.
* Firmitas – "tenacity" – strength of mind, and the ability to stick to one's purpose at hand without wavering.
* [[frugality|Frugalitas]] – "frugality" – economy and simplicity in lifestyle, without being miserly.
* [[Gravitas]] – "gravity" – a sense of the importance of the matter at hand; responsibility, and being earnest.
* Honestas – "respectability" – the image that one presents as a respectable member of society.
* [[Humanitas]] – "humanity" – refinement, civilization, learning, and generally being cultured.
* Industria – "industriousness" – hard work.
* [[justice|Iustitia]] – "justice" – sense of moral worth to an action; personified by the goddess [[Iustitia]], the Roman counterpart to the Greek [[Themis]].
* [[Pietas]] – "dutifulness" – more than religious piety; a respect for the natural order: socially, politically, and religiously. Includes ideas of patriotism, fulfillment of [[Cult (religious practice)|pious obligation to the gods]], and honoring other human beings, especially in terms of the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron and client relationship]], considered essential to an orderly society.
* [[Prudentia]] – "prudence" – foresight, wisdom, and personal discretion.
* Salubritas – "wholesomeness" – general health and cleanliness, personified in the deity [[Salus]].
* Severitas – "sternness" – self-control, considered to be tied directly to the virtue of gravitas.
* [[honesty|Veritas]] – "truthfulness" – honesty in dealing with others, personified by the goddess [[Veritas]]. Veritas, being the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], was considered the root of all virtue; a person living an honest life was bound to be virtuous.
* [[Virtus (virtue)|Virtus]] – "manliness" – valor, excellence, courage, character, and worth. 'Vir' is Latin for "man".

===The Seven Heavenly Virtues===
In 410 CE, [[Prudentius| Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] listed seven "heavenly virtues" in his book [[Psychomachia]] (Battle of Souls) which is an allegorical story of conflict between vices and virtues. The virtues depicted were:
*chastity
*temperance 
*charity
*diligence 
*patience 
*kindness
*humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudentius Seven Heavenly Virtues |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/prudentius_virtues.htm |website=Changing Minds |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Chivalric virtues==
In the 8th Century, upon the occasion of his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] published a list of knightly virtues:

Love God
Love your neighbour
Give alms to the poor
Entertain strangers
Visit the sick
Be merciful to prisoners
Do ill to no man, nor consent unto such
Forgive as ye hope to be forgiven
Redeem the captive
Help the oppressed
Defend the cause of the widow and orphan
Render righteous judgement
Do not consent to any wrong
Persevere not in wrath
Shun excess in eating and drinking
Be humble and kind
Serve your liege lord faithfully
Do not steal
Do not perjure yourself, nor let others do so
Envy, hatred and violence separate men from the Kingdom of God
Defend the Church and promote her cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The origins of Chivalry |url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/chivalry/chival1a.html |website=Baronage |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious traditions ==

===Judaism===
{{main article|Jewish ethics}}Loving God and obeying his laws, in particular the [[Ten Commandments]], are central to Jewish conceptions of virtue. Wisdom is personified in the first eight chapters of the [[Book of Proverbs]] and is not only the source of virtue but is depicted as the first and best creation of God (Proverbs 8:12-31). Wisdom is also celebrated in the [[Book of Wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/7#27007022|title=Wisdom, Chapter 7, Verse 22|last=|first=|date=|website=USCCB Bible|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the most concise terms, Hillel replied (reputedly while standing on one leg): "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|Virtues fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]{{main article|Christian ethics}}{{See also|Seven virtues|Evangelical counsels}}
In [[Christianity]], the [[three theological virtues]] are [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Agape|love]], a list which comes from [[1 Corinthians 13]]:13 ({{lang|grc|νυνὶ δὲ μένει πίστις}} ''pistis'' (faith), {{lang|grc|ἐλπίς}} ''elpis'' (hope), {{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agape'' (love), {{lang|grc|τὰ τρία ταῦτα· μείζων δὲ τούτων ἡ ἀγάπη}}). The same chapter describes love as the greatest of the three, and further defines love as "patient, kind, not envious, boastful, arrogant, or rude." (The Christian virtue of love is sometimes called [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and at other times a Greek word [[agape]] is used to contrast the love of God and the love of humankind from other types of love such as friendship or physical affection.)

Christian scholars frequently add the four Greek [[cardinal virtues]] (prudence, justice, temperance, and courage) to the theological virtues to give the [[seven virtues]]; for example, these seven are the ones described in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', sections 1803–1829.

The Bible mentions additional virtues, such as in the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]," found in Galatians 5:22-23: "By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit it is [[Temperance (virtue)|benevolent]]-love: joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is absolutely no law against such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Aland]], [[Kurt Aland]], Matthew Black, [[Carlo M. Martini]], [[Bruce M. Metzger]] and [[Allen Wikgren]], ''The Greek New Testament'', 4th ed. (Federal Republic of Germany: United Bible Societies, 1993, c1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval and renaissance periods saw a number of models of sin listing the seven deadly sins and the virtues opposed to each.

===Islam===
{{main article|Islamic views on virtue}}
In Islam, the [[Qur'an]] is believed to be the literal word of God, and the definitive description of virtue. [[Muhammad]] is considered an ideal example of virtue in human form. The [[hadiths]], his reported sayings, are central to the Islamic understanding of virtue.

Virtue is defined in [[hadith]]. It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an:
{{quote|"The Prophet Muhammad said, "Piety/virtue is good manner, and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported:
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of Allah and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about Piety/virtue?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Piety/virtue is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi}}

For Muslims fulfilling the human rights are valued as an important building block of Islam, According to Muslim beliefs Allah will forgive individual sins but the bad treatment of humans and injustice with others will only be pardoned by the humans and not by Allah.
===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], attainment of [[enlightenment]] is possible only if the seeker possesses certain virtues. All [[Jains]] are supposed to take up the five vows of [[ahimsa]] (non violence), [[satya]] (truthfulness), [[asteya]] (non stealing), [[aparigraha]] (non attachment and [[brahmacharya]] (celibacy) before becoming a monk. These vows are laid down by the [[Tirthankaras]]. Other virtues which are supposed to be followed by both monks as well as laypersons include forgiveness, humility, self-restraint and straightforwardness. These vows assists the seeker to escape from the karmic bondages thereby escaping the cycle of birth and death to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/bliss-of-wisdom/जैन-धर्म-के-पाँच-मूलभूत-सिद्धांत-bfc9b756d509&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main article|Hindu ethics}}Virtue is a much debated&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}; pages 268-72;
* Quote: "(In Hinduism), srutis did not pretend to deal with all situations or irregularities in the moral life, leaving these matters to human reasons (Mbh Xii.109); Accordingly, that again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be sin (...); Under certain conditions, acts that are apparently evil (such as violence) can be permitted if they produce consequences that are good (protection of children and women in self-defense when the society is attacked in war)
* Quote: "(The Hindu scripture) notes the interrelationship of several virtues, consequentially. Anger springs from covetousness; (the vice of) envy disappears in consequence of (the virtues) of compassion and knowledge of self (Mbh Xii.163);&lt;/ref&gt; and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S. Cromwell (1982), The evolution of Hindu ethical ideals, Asian Studies Program, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Becker (2001), Encyclopedia of Ethics, {{ISBN|978-0415936729}}, 2nd Edition, Routledge, pages 845-848&lt;/ref&gt; The essence, need and value of virtue is explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};
* Also see: Apastamba, Dharma Sutra, 1.20.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtues lead to ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुण्य,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=puNya&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 puNya] Spoken Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; holy living) in Hindu literature; while vices lead to ''pap'' (Sanskrit: पाप,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html search for pApa] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[sin]]). Sometimes, the word ''punya'' is used interchangeably with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;What Is Hinduism?, Himalayan Academy (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-934145-00-5}}, page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtues that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' ([[forgiveness]]), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K. N. (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought: A Philosophical Study of Hindu, Jaina, and Buddhist Morals, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1608-4}}, pp 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] - considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong - argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S.

===Buddhism===
{{main article|Buddhist ethics}}
Buddhist practice as outlined in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] can be regarded as a progressive list of virtues.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Right View - Realizing the [[Four Noble Truths]] (samyag-vyāyāma, sammā-vāyāma).
# Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness (samyak-smṛti, sammā-sati).
# Right Concentration - Wholesome one-pointedness of mind (samyak-samādhi, sammā-samādhi).

Buddhism's four ''[[brahmavihara]]'' ("Divine States") can be more properly regarded as virtues in the European sense. They are:
# [[Metta]]/Maitri: loving-kindness towards all; the hope that a person will be well; loving kindness is the wish that all sentient beings, without any exception, be happy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm |title=Buddhist Studies for Secondary Students, Unit 6: The Four Immeasurables |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Karuṇā]]: compassion; the hope that a person's sufferings will diminish; compassion is the wish for all sentient beings to be free from suffering.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# [[Mudita]]: altruistic joy in the accomplishments of a person, oneself or other; sympathetic joy is the wholesome attitude of rejoicing in the happiness and virtues of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# Upekkha/[[Upeksa|Upeksha]]: equanimity, or learning to accept both loss and gain, [[praise]] and [[blame]], success and failure with detachment, equally, for oneself and for others. Equanimity means not to distinguish between friend, enemy or stranger, but to regard every sentient being as equal. It is a clear-minded tranquil state of mind - not being overpowered by delusions, mental dullness or agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |title=A View on Buddhism, The four immeasurables: Love, Compassion, Joy and Equanimity |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819075238/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |archive-date=2006-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also the [[Paramitas]] ("perfections"), which are the culmination of having acquired certain virtues. In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali Canon|canonical]] [[Buddhavamsa]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddhavamsa, chapter 2. For an on-line reference to the Buddhavamsa's seminality in the Theravada notion of ''parami'', see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]&lt;br&gt;In terms of other examples in the [[Pali literature]], Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 454, [https://archive.is/20120629172506/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:2679.pali entry for "Pāramī,"] (retrieved 2007-06-24) cites [[Jataka]] i.73 and [[Dhammapada]] [[Atthakatha]] i.84. Bodhi (2005) also mentions Acariya [[Dhammapala]]'s treatise in the [[Cariyapitaka]]-[[Atthakatha]] and the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]] [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentary (''tika'')]].&lt;/ref&gt; there are Ten Perfections (''dasa pāramiyo''). In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the [[Lotus Sutra]] (''Saddharmapundarika''), there are Six Perfections; while in the [[Dasabhumika Sutra|Ten Stages]] (''Dasabhumika'') Sutra, four more ''Paramitas'' are listed.

===Bahá'í faith===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], virtues are direct spiritual qualities that the human soul possesses, inherited from the world of God. The development and manifestation of these virtues is the theme of the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and are discussed in great detail as the underpinnings of a divinely-inspired society by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in such texts as ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Daoism===
"Virtue", translated from Chinese ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ([[Wikt:德|德]]), is also an important concept in [[Chinese philosophy]], particularly [[Daoism]]. ''De'' ({{zh|c=德|p=''dé''| w=''te''}}) originally meant normative "virtue" in the sense of "personal character; inner strength; integrity", but semantically changed to moral "virtue; kindness; morality". Note the semantic parallel for English ''[[Wikt:virtue|virtue]]'', with an archaic meaning of "inner potency; divine power" (as in "by virtue of") and a modern one of "moral excellence; goodness".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In early periods of [[Confucianism]], moral manifestations of "virtue" include ''ren'' ("[[Human nature|humanity]]"), ''xiao'' ("[[filial piety]]"), and ''li'' ("[[Li (Confucian)|proper behavior, performance of rituals]]"). The notion of [[Confucianism#Humaneness|ren]] - according to Simon Leys - means "humanity" and "goodness". [[Confucianism#Humaneness|Ren]] originally had the archaic meaning in the Confucian Book of Poems of "virility", but progressively took on shades of ethical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Yu-sheng: "The evolution of the pre-Confucian meaning of jen and the Confucian concept of moral autonomy," Monumenta Serica, vol.31, 1974-75&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the virtues identified in early Confucianism as non-theistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Yang, C. K. (1971), Religion in Chinese society: a study of contemporary social functions of religion and some of their historical factors, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-88133-621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daoist concept of ''De'', compared to Confucianism, is more subtle, pertaining to the "virtue" or ability that an individual realizes by following the [[Tao|Dao]] ("the Way"). One important normative value in much of Chinese thinking is that one's social status should result from the amount of virtue that one demonstrates, rather than from one's birth. In the ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] explains ''de'' as follows: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu Lunyu 2/1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005031/http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu |date=2007-09-27 }}, tr. [[James Legge]]&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods, particularly from the Tang dynasty period, Confucianism as practiced, absorbed and melded its own concepts of virtues with those from Daoism and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt;

==Samurai virtue==
In [[Hagakure]], Yamamoto Tsunetomo encapsulates his views on 'virtue' in the four vows he makes daily:&lt;ref&gt;''Hagakure: The Secret Wisdom of the Samurai'', by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, Translated by Alexander Bennett, Tuttle Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|978-4-8053-1198-1}} (Full Translation)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Never to be outdone in the way of the samurai or [[bushido]].
# To be of good use to the master.
# To be filial to my parents.
# To manifest great compassion and act for the sake of Man.

Yamamoto goes on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas every morning, he will have the strength of two men and never slip backward. One must edge forward like the inchworm, bit by bit. The gods and Buddhas, too, first started with a vow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bushidō code is typified by seven virtues:&lt;ref&gt;see Random House's Japanese-English, English-Japanese Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rectitude (義,gi)
* Courage (勇,yuu)
* Benevolence (仁,jin)
* Respect (礼,rei)
* Honesty (誠,sei)
* Honor (誉,yo)
* Loyalty (忠,chuu)

Others that are sometimes added to these:
* Filial piety (孝,kō)
* Wisdom (智,chi)
* Care for the aged (悌,tei)

==Philosophers' views==
===Valluvar===
While religious scriptures generally consider ''[[dharma]]'' or ''aṟam'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] term for virtue) as a divine virtue, [[Valluvar]] describes it as a way of life rather than any spiritual observance, a way of harmonious living that leads to universal happiness.&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”&gt;{{cite book |author= N. Sanjeevi |title= First All India Tirukkural Seminar Papers |url= |year= 1973 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of Madras | location=Chennai |isbn = |page= xxiii–xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Valluvar keeps ''aṟam'' as the cornerstone throughout the writing of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]].&lt;ref name="UMI_WhyNationalBook?"&gt;{{cite book

While [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]] such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and their descendants opined that justice cannot be defined and that it was a divine mystery, Valluvar positively suggested that a divine origin is not required to define the concept of justice. In the words of [[V. R. Nedunchezhiyan]], justice according to Valluvar "dwells in the minds of those who have knowledge of the standard of right and wrong; so too deceit dwells in the minds which breed fraud."&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”/&gt;

===René Descartes===
For the [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Men should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that these goods contribute to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;Blom, John J., ''Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology''. New York University Press. 1978. {{ISBN|0-8147-0999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', expresses true virtue as different from what commonly is known about this moral trait. In Kant's view, to be goodhearted, benevolent and sympathetic is not regarded as true virtue. The only aspect that makes a human truly virtuous is to behave in accordance with moral principles. Kant presents an example for more clarification; suppose that you come across a needy person in the street; if your [[sympathy]] leads you to help that person, your response does not illustrate your virtue. In this example, since you do not afford helping all needy ones, you have behaved unjustly, and it is out of the domain of principles and true virtue. Kant applies the approach of [[four temperaments]] to distinguish truly virtuous people. According to Kant, among all people with diverse temperaments, a person with [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] frame of mind is the most virtuous whose thoughts, words and deeds are one of principles.

=== Friedrich Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s view of virtue is based on the idea of an order of rank among people. For Nietzsche, the virtues of the strong are seen as vices by the weak and slavish, thus Nietzsche's virtue ethics is based on his distinction between [[master and slave morality|master morality and slave morality]]. Nietzsche promotes the virtues of those he calls "higher men", people like Goethe and Beethoven. The virtues he praises in them are their creative powers (“the men of great creativity” - “the really great men according to my understanding” (WP 957)).
According to Nietzsche these higher types are solitary, pursue a "unifying project", revere themselves and are healthy and life-affirming.&lt;ref name="Leiter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/#2 |last= Leiter |first=Brian |title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mixing with the herd makes one base, the higher type “strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority…” (BGE 26). The 'Higher type' also "instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities" (WP 944) in the form of an "organizing idea" for their life, which drives them to artistic and creative work and gives them psychological health and strength.&lt;ref name="Leiter"/&gt; The fact that the higher types are "healthy" for Nietzsche does not refer to physical health as much as a psychological resilience and fortitude. Finally, a Higher type affirms life because he is willing to accept the [[eternal return]] of his life and affirm this forever and unconditionally.

In the last section of ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche outlines his thoughts on the noble virtues and places [[solitude]] as one of the highest virtues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude. Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people (“society”) inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every
community makes people – “base.” (BGE §284)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche also sees truthfulness as a virtue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genuine honesty, assuming that this is our virtue and we cannot get rid of it, we free spirits – well then, we will want to work on it with all the love and malice at our disposal and not get tired of ‘perfecting’ ourselves in our virtue, the only one we have left: may its glory come to rest like a gilded, blue evening glow of mockery over this aging culture and its dull and dismal seriousness! ([[Beyond Good and Evil]], §227)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Benjamin Franklin ===
[[File:Seal of Virginia.svg|thumb|upright|Virtue, spear in hand, with her foot on the prostrate form of [[Tyranny]] on the [[Sic Semper Tyrannis|Great Seal of Virginia]]]]
These are the virtues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftrain.com/franklin_improving_self.html Franklin's 13 Virtues] Extract of Franklin's autobiography, compiled by Paul Ford.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Benjamin Franklin]] used to develop what he called 'moral perfection'. He had a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to his virtues.

They became known through [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's autobiography]].

# Temperance: Eat not to Dullness. Drink not to Elevation.
# Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling Conversation.
# [[Order (virtue)|Order]]: Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Part of your Business have its Time.
# Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Waste nothing.
# Industry: Lose no Time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary Actions.
# Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.
# Moderation: Avoid Extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.
# Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity: Rarely use [[wikt:venery#Etymology 2|Venery]] but for Health or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another's Peace or Reputation.
# Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

==Contemporary views==

===Virtues as emotions===
Marc Jackson in his book ''Emotion and Psyche'' puts forward a new development of the virtues. He identifies the virtues as what he calls the good emotions "The first group consisting of [[love]], [[kindness]], [[joy]], [[faith]], [[awe]] and [[pity]] is good"&lt;ref&gt;Marc Jackson (2010) ''Emotion and Psyche.'' O-books. p. 12 ({{ISBN|978-1-84694-378-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; These virtues differ from older accounts of the virtues because they are not character traits expressed by action, but emotions that are to be felt and developed by feeling not acting.

===In Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]] held that her morality, the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Ethics: rational self-interest|morality of reason]], contained a single axiom: existence exists, and a single choice: to live. All values and virtues proceed from these. To live, man must hold three fundamental values that one develops and achieves in life: Reason, Purpose, and Self-Esteem. A value is "that which one acts to gain and/or keep ... and the virtue[s] [are] the act[ions] by which one gains and/or keeps it." The primary virtue in [[Objectivist ethics]] is rationality, which as Rand meant it is "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness|The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism]]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; These values are achieved by passionate and consistent action and the virtues are the policies for achieving those fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Gotthelf|Gotthelf, Allan]] ''On Ayn Rand''; p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Ayn Rand describes seven virtues: rationality, productiveness, pride, independence, integrity, honesty and justice. The first three represent the three primary virtues that correspond to the three fundamental values, whereas the final four are derived from the virtue of rationality. She claims that virtue is not an end in itself, that virtue is not its own reward nor sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil, that life is the reward of virtue and happiness is the goal and the reward of life. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality, not the degree of your intelligence but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of your knowledge but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn (1961) ''For the New Intellectual Galt’s Speech,'' "[[For the New Intellectual|For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]", pp. 131, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern psychology===
[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]], two leading researchers in [[positive psychology]], recognizing the deficiency inherent in [[psychology]]'s tendency to focus on dysfunction rather than on what makes a healthy and stable [[personality]], set out to develop a list of "[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of study, 24 traits (classified into six broad areas of virtue) were identified, having "a surprising amount of similarity across cultures and strongly indicat[ing] a historical and cross-cultural convergence."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. p. 36. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; These six categories of virtue are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. pp. 36-39. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists suggest that these virtues are adequately grouped into fewer categories; for example, the same 24 traits have been grouped into simply: Cognitive Strengths, Temperance Strengths, and Social Strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie. 2010. The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of

==Vice as opposite==
{{Main article|Vice}}
{{See also|List of virtues}}
The opposite of a virtue is a [[vice]]. Vice is a habitual, repeated practice of wrongdoing. One way of organizing the vices is as the corruption of the virtues.

As [[Aristotle]] noted, however, the virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be considered the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates ''in medio stat virtus'' - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are opposites of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the opposites of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more "modern" virtue, [[Toleration|tolerance]], can be considered the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness on the one hand and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the opposites of virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.

'''Worse is better''', also called '''New Jersey style''', was conceived by [[Richard P. Gabriel]] in an essay "Worse is better" to describe the dynamics of software acceptance, but it has broader application. It is the idea that [[Software quality|quality]] does not necessarily increase with functionality—that there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

As to the [[oxymoron]]ic title, Gabriel calls it a caricature, declaring the style bad in comparison with "The Right Thing". However he also states that "it has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing" development style and is superior to the "MIT Approach" with which he contrasted it in the original essay.&lt;ref name="WIB"&gt;[http://dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html Worse Is Better] (Richard P. Gabriel, personal recollection)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Gabriel was a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] programmer when he formulated the concept in 1989, presenting it in his essay "Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big". A section of the article, titled "The Rise of 'Worse is Better'", was widely disseminated beginning in 1991, after [[Jamie Zawinski]] found it in Gabriel's files at [[Lucid Inc.]] and e-mailed it to friends and colleagues.&lt;ref name="WIB"/&gt;

== Description ==
In ''The Rise of Worse is Better'', Gabriel claimed that "Worse-is-Better" is a model of software design and implementation which has the following characteristics (in approximately descending order of importance):

; Simplicity: The design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface. '''Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design'''.
; Correctness: The design should be correct in all observable aspects, but '''It is slightly better to be simple than correct'''.
; Consistency: '''The design must not be overly inconsistent'''. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to introduce either complexity or inconsistency in the implementation.
; Completeness: The design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases should be covered. '''Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality'''. In fact, completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained; especially worthless is consistency of interface.

Gabriel argued that early [[Unix]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], developed by [[Bell Labs]], are examples of this design approach.

== The MIT approach ==
Gabriel contrasted his philosophy with what he called the "MIT/Stanford style of design" or "[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] approach" (also known as "the Right Thing"), which he described as follows. Contrasts are in bold:

; Simplicity: The design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is '''more important for the interface to be simple''' than the implementation.
; Correctness: The design must be correct in all observable aspects. '''Incorrectness is simply not allowed'''.
; Consistency: '''The design must be consistent'''. A design is allowed to be slightly less simple and less complete to avoid inconsistency. Consistency is as important as correctness.
; Completeness: The design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases must be covered. '''Simplicity is not allowed to overly reduce completeness'''.

== Effects ==
Gabriel argued that "Worse is better" produced more ''successful'' software than the MIT approach: As long as the initial program is basically good, it will take much less time and effort to implement initially and it will be easier to adapt to new situations. Porting software to new machines, for example, becomes far easier this way. Thus its use will spread rapidly, long before a program developed using the MIT approach has a chance to be developed and deployed ([[first-mover advantage]]). Once it has spread, there will be pressure to improve its functionality, but users have already been conditioned to accept "worse" rather than the "right thing". "Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing. In concrete terms, even though [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] compilers in 1987 were about as good as C compilers, there are many more compiler experts who want to make C compilers better than want to make Lisp compilers better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dreamsongs.com/WIB.html Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big], Richard P. Gabriel&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel credits [[Jamie Zawinski]] for excerpting the worse-is-better sections of "Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big" and e-mailing them to his friends at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], who sent them to their friends at Bell Labs, "who sent them to their friends everywhere". He apparently connected these ideas to those of [[Richard Stallman]] and saw related ideas that are important in the [[Unix philosophy|design philosophy of Unix]], and more generally in the [[open-source movement]], both of which were central to the development of [[Linux]].

Gabriel later answered his earlier essay with one titled ''Worse Is Better Is Worse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dreamsongs.com/Files/worse-is-worse.pdf Worse Is Better Is Worse] (PDF) (Richard P. Gabriel as "Nickieben Bourbaki")&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[pseudonym]] "Nickieben Bourbaki" (an allusion to [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]).

[[File:Nietzsche187c.jpg|thumb|187px|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in 1869]]

The '''''Übermensch''''' ([[German language|German]] for "Beyond-Man", "Superman", "Overman", "Superhuman", "Hyperman", "Hyperhuman"; {{IPA-de|ˈˀyːbɐmɛnʃ}}) is a [[concept]] in the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]]. In his 1883 book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' ({{lang-de|Also sprach Zarathustra}}), [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] has his character Zarathustra posit the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself. It is a work of philosophical [[allegory]], with a structural similarity to the [[Gathas]] of [[Zoroaster|Zoroaster/Zarathustra]].
&lt;!-- The following statement was removed on 9/26: There is no consensus regarding the precise meaning of the ''Übermensch,'' nor on the importance of the concept in Nietzsche's thought. There are other conceptions of [[superhuman]] nature besides those that are labeled Übermensch. It was removed in spite of this comment preceding it in the editing box: Please DO NOT REMOVE this statement without discussion on the talk page first. It is required if the article is to maintain a neutral point of view. Officially used for the Medic in tf2. --&gt;

== In English ==

In 1896, [[Alexander Tille]] made the first English translation of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', rendering ''Übermensch'' as "Beyond-Man". In 1909, [[Thomas Common]] translated it as "Superman", following the terminology of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1903 stage play ''[[Man and Superman]]''. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons: first, the failure of the English prefix "super" to capture the nuance of the German ''[[über]]'' (though in Latin, its meaning of "above" or "beyond" is closer to the German); and second, for promoting misidentification of Nietzsche's concept with the comic-book character [[Superman]] (whom [[Fredric Wertham]] described&lt;ref&gt;''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]''&lt;/ref&gt; as "un-American and fascist"). Kaufmann and others preferred to translate ''Übermensch'' as "overman". Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lampert|first=Laurence|title=Nietzsche's Teaching|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German prefix ''[[über]]'' can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached.&lt;ref&gt;''Duden Deutsches Universal Wörterbuch A–Z,'' s.v. über-.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mensch'' refers to a human being, rather than a male specifically. The adjective ''übermenschlich'' means super-human: beyond human strength or out of proportion to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Übermenschlich. PONS.eu Online Dictionary. Retrieved from http://en.pons.eu/german-english/%C3%BCbermenschlich.&lt;/ref&gt;

==This-worldliness==
Nietzsche introduces the concept of the Übermensch in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of [[Christianity]]: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the Übermensch to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fullfillment to draw them away from the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingdale, R. J. (1961), page 44 - English translation of Zarathustra's prologue; "I love those who do not first seek beyond the stars for reasons to go down and to be sacrifices: but who sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth may one day belong to the Superman"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietsche, F. (1885) - p. 4, Original publication - "Ich liebe die, welche nicht erst hinter den Sternen einen Grund suchen, unterzugehen und Opfer zu sein: sondern die sich der Erde opfern, dass die Erde einst des Übermenschen werde."&lt;/ref&gt;  The turn away from the earth is prompted, he says, by a dissatisfaction with life that causes the sufferer to imagine another world which will fulfill his revenge. The Übermensch grasps the earthly world with relish and gratitude.

Zarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or [[asceticism]]. Zarathustra further links the Übermensch to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|page=61|isbn=978-0-140-44118-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of God and the creation of new values==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
Zarathustra ties the Übermensch to the [[God is dead|death of God]]. While the concept of God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts, belief in God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. "God is dead" means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values exhausted, the danger of [[nihilism]] looms.

Zarathustra presents the Übermensch as the creator of new values to banish nihilism. If the Übermensch acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.

In order to avoid a relapse into [[Platonic idealism]] or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the Übermensch will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see [[Nietzschean affirmation]]).

==As a goal==
Zarathustra first announces the Übermensch as a goal humanity can set for itself. All human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings. The aspiration of a woman would be to give birth to an Übermensch, for example; her relationships with men would be judged by this standard.&lt;ref&gt;''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', I.18; Lampert, ''Nietzsche's; Rosen, ''Mask of Enlightenment'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarathustra contrasts the Übermensch with the degenerate [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity, an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself.  [[Last man|The last man]] appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a smothering of aspiration antithetical to the sprit of the Übermensch.

According to [[Rüdiger Safranski]], some commentators associate the Übermensch with a program of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 262-64, 266-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is most pronounced when considered in the aspect of a goal that humanity sets for itself.  The reduction of all [[psychology]] to [[physiology]] implies, to some, that human beings can be bred for cultural traits. This interpretation of Nietzsche's doctrine focuses more on the future of humanity than on a single cataclysmic individual.  There is no consensus regarding how this aspect of the Übermensch relates to the creation of new values.

==Re-embodiment of amoral aristocratic values==

For [[Rüdiger Safranski]], the Übermensch represents a higher biological type reached through [[artificial selection]] and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential, good and "evil", to become an "artist-tyrant". In ''Ecce Homo'', Nietzsche vehemently denied any idealistic, democratic or humanitarian interpretation of the Übermensch: "The word Übermensch [designates] a type of supreme achievement, as opposed to 'modern' men, 'good' men, Christians, and other nihilists ... When I whispered into the ears of some people that they were better off looking for a [[Cesare Borgia]] than a [[Percival|Parsifal]], they did not believe their ears."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', Why I Write Such Good Books, §1)&lt;/ref&gt; Safranski argues that the combination of ruthless warrior pride and artistic brilliance that defined the [[Italian Renaissance]] embodied the sense of the Übermensch for Nietzsche. According to Safranski, Nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the Übermensch to serve as a Machiavellian bogeyman of the modern Western middle class and its pseudo-Christian egalitarian value system.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 365&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the eternal recurrence==
The Übermensch shares a place of prominence in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' with another of Nietzsche's key concepts:  the [[Eternal return#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence of the same]]. Several interpretations for this fact have been offered.

Laurence Lampert suggests that the eternal recurrence replaces the Übermensch as the object of serious aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert, ''Nietzsche's Teaching''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in part due to the fact that even the Übermensch can appear like an other-worldly hope.  The Übermensch lies in the future — no historical figures have ever been Übermenschen — and so still represents a sort of [[eschatology|eschatological]] redemption in some future time.

Stanley Rosen, on the other hand, suggests that the doctrine of eternal return is an [[esotericism|esoteric]] ruse meant to save the concept of the Übermensch from the charge of Idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, ''The Mask of Enlightenment''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than positing an as-yet unexperienced perfection, Nietzsche would be the prophet of something that has occurred a countless number of times in the past.

Others&lt;!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---&gt; maintain that willing the eternal recurrence of the same is a necessary step if the Übermensch is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism.  Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values.  Therefore, it could seem that the Übermensch, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism.  Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism.

Still others&lt;!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---&gt; suggest that one must have the strength of the Übermensch in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the Übermensch will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.

==Nazism==
The term Übermensch was used frequently by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or Germanic master race;&lt;ref name="Alexander 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=A Contemporary Introduction to Sociology |edition=2nd |year=2011|publisher=Paradigm|isbn=978-1-61205-029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[racism|racial]] version of Nietzsche's Übermensch became a philosophical foundation for National Socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/nietzsche_crimes/7.html "Nietzsche inspired Hitler and other killers - Page 7"], Court TV Crime Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi notion of the [[master race]] also spawned the idea of "inferior humans" (''[[Untermensch]]en'') who should be dominated and enslaved; this term does not originate with Nietzsche, who was critical of both [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche.27s criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|antisemitism and German nationalism]]. In his final years, Nietzsche began to believe that he was in fact Polish, not German, and was quoted as saying, "I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], "Ecce Homo: How One Becomes What One Is" [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecce_Homo.html?id=tVL-Dmg6TlUC]&lt;/ref&gt; In defiance of nationalist doctrines, he claimed that he and Germany were great only because of "Polish blood in their veins",&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Louis Mencken]], "The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche", T. Fisher Unwin, 1908, reprinted by University of Michigan 2006, pg. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nnEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;as_brr=3]&lt;/ref&gt; and that he would be "having all anti-semites shot" as an answer to his stance on anti-semitism. Nietzsche died long before Hitler's reign, and it was partly Nietzsche's sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] who manipulated her brother's words to accommodate the worldview of herself and her husband, [[Bernhard Förster]], a prominent German nationalist and antisemite.&lt;ref&gt;

==Anarchism==
The thought of Nietzsche had an important [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|influence anarchist authors]]. Spencer Sunshine writes: "There were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of 'herds'; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'overman' — that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, 'Yes' to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values' as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history."&lt;ref name="anarchonietzche"&gt;[http://radicalarchives.org/2010/05/18/nietzsche-and-the-anarchists/ Spencer Sunshine, "Nietzsche and the Anarchists"]&lt;/ref&gt; The influential American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]], in the preface of her famous collection ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', defends both Nietzsche and [[Max Stirner]] from attacks within anarchism when she says "The most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or personality. Friedrich Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a hater of the weak because he believed in the Übermensch. It does not occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant mind that this vision of the Übermensch also called for a state of society which will not give birth to a race of [[Master-slave morality|weaklings and slaves]]."&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emma_Goldman__Anarchism_and_Other_Essays.html ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'' by Emma Goldman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunshine says that the "Spanish anarchists also mixed their class politics with Nietzschean inspiration." [[Murray Bookchin]], in ''[[The Spanish Anarchists]]'', describes prominent CNT–FAI member [[Salvador Seguí]] as "an admirer of Nietzschean individualism, of the ''superhombre'' to whom 'all is permitted'." Bookchin, in his 1973 introduction to [[Sam Dolgoff]]'s ''[[The Anarchist Collectives]]'', even describes the reconstruction of society by the workers as a Nietzschean project. Bookchin says that "workers must see themselves as human beings, not as class beings; as creative personalities, not as 'proletarians,' as self-affirming individuals, not as 'masses'. . .(the) economic component must be humanized precisely by bringing an 'affinity of friendship' to the work process, by diminishing the role of onerous work in the lives of producers, indeed by a total 'transvaluation of values' (to use Nietzsche's phrase) as it applies to production and consumption as well as social and personal life."&lt;ref name="anarchonietzche"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The comic-book hero [[Superman]], when [[Jerry Siegel|Jerome "Jerry" Siegel]] first created him, was originally a villain modeled on Nietzsche's idea (see "[[The Reign of the Superman]]").{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} He was re-invented as a hero by his eventual designer, [[Joe Shuster|Joseph "Joe" Shuster]], after which he bore little resemblance to the previous character. However, Superman does find an adversary in the mold of the Nietzschean Übermensch in the recurring arch-villain [[Lex Luthor]],{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} his greatest enemy on Earth. Luthor is preceded, even, by a supervillain resembling Siegel's original concept for Superman bearing the synonymous name of '[[Ultra-Humanite]]'. A direct reference to the term occurs in the episode "Double Trouble" of the TV series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]],'' in which a German-speaking character calls the title character "{{lang|de|verfluchter Übermensch}}" ("cursed Superman").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary |last=Grossman |title=Superman: Serial to Cereal |year=1976 |page=67 |location=New York |publisher=Popular Library |isbn=0445040548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tenth season of the show ''[[Smallville]]'', an alternate Lionel Luthor refers to Clark as the "Übermensch". Overman is an [[Alternative versions of Superman|alternate version of Superman]], from [[Earth-10]], an Earth where the [[Axis victory in World War II|Axis Powers won World War II]].&lt;ref name="supermanbeyond1"&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Grant Morrison]] | Penciller = [[Doug Mahnke]] | Inker = Christian Alamy, Rodney Ramos, Tom Nguyen, Walden Wong | Title = [[Final Crisis]]: Superman Beyond | Volume = | Issue = 1 | Date = October 2008 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jack London]] dedicated his novels ''[[The Sea-Wolf]]'' and ''[[Martin Eden]]'' to criticizing Nietzsche's concept of the Übermensch and his radical [[individualism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Bridgwater |title=Nietzsche in Anglosaxony: A Study of Nietzsche's Impact on English and American Literature |location=Leicester |publisher=Leicester University Press |year=1972 |page=169 |isbn=0718511042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which London considered to be [[Selfishness|selfish]] and egoistic.
* [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1903 play ''[[Man and Superman]]'' is a reference to the archetype; its main character considers himself an untameable revolutionary, above the normal concerns of humanity.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}
* [[James Joyce]] utilizes the ''Übermensch'' in the first chapter of his novel [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]. Joyce makes [[Buck Mulligan]] say it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=James|title=Ulysses|year=1922|publisher=Shakespeare &amp; Co.|isbn=0-679-72276-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the ''Uebermensch''. Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen."
* In [[The Power (1956 novel)|''The Power'']], a 1956 book by Frank M. Robinson, the villain consciously models himself upon Nietzsche's Übermensch, and a quotation from Nietzsche serves as the book's motto.
* In real life, [[Leopold and Loeb]] committed murder in 1924 partly out of a superficially Übermensch-like conception of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/nietzsche_crimes/index.html "Nietzsche inspired Hitler and other killers"], Court TV Crime Library&lt;/ref&gt; Their story has been dramatized many times, including in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', the 1959 film Compulsion based on Meyer Levin's novel, the 1994 film ''[[Swoon (film)|Swoon]]'', the 2002 film ''[[Murder by Numbers]]'', and the 2005 Off-Broadway musical ''[[Thrill Me]]: The Leopold and Loeb Story''.
* A character in the show ''[[Dollhouse (show)|Dollhouse]]'' (Season 1, Episode 12; titled "Omega") references Übermensch in relation to Nietzsche when trying to describe a person that had the memories, skills, and intelligence of dozens of people uploaded into their (single) mind by means of futuristic technology.
* The Medic character in the video game ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' will sometimes chant "I am the Übermensch!" for one of his "Cheers" voice commands.
* In the Disney TV Cartoon, Pepper Ann, in an episode titled "Effie Shrugged", Effie, a physically imposing bully teaches Pepper Ann some basic information on Übermensch.
* [[David Bowie]]'s song titled "[[The Supermen]]", from his 1970 album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]'', was inspired by the work of Nietzsche. Bowie later said "I was still going through the thing when I was pretending that I understood Nietzsche... And I had tried to translate it into my own terms to understand it so 'Supermen' came out of that."&lt;ref&gt;David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination - David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': p.267&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Avatar Press]] comic book series, "[[Über]]", written by [[Kieron Gillen]] uses the idea in an alternate universe during [[World War II]] in which [[Nazi Germany]] creates superhuman soldiers.
*A chapter in the novel [[Old School (novel)|Old School]] by [[Tobias Wolff]] is entitled 'Übermensch'. It humorously castigates [[Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand's]] better-and-bigger-than-life characters and satirically depicts the narrator/main character as deluded, because of Rand's [[The Fountainhead]], in his belief that he is superior to others.
*The TV show ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' features a race of genetically engineered super-humans called [[Nietzscheans]] who follow the philosophies and teachings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Social Darwinism]]. The Nietzscheans regard themselves as superior to "[[Kludge|Kludges]]" (ordinary unmodified humans) and are often referred to as "Übers", pejoratively, by such humans.
