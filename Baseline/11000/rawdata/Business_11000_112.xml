'''Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton''' &lt;small&gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;/small&gt; (18 October 1863 – 19 February 1930) was a Scottish consulting [[electrical engineer]], who provided the theoretical basis for the electronic [[television]], two decades before the technology existed to implement it.&lt;ref name="Oakesin51"&gt;Oakes, Elizabeth (2009), ''A to Z of STS Scientists''. Infobase publishing, pp. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He began experimenting around 1903 with the use of cathode ray tubes for the electronic transmission and reception of images.&lt;ref name="Burns-Swinton"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell described the theoretical basis for an all electronic method of producing television in a 1908 letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. Campbell-Swinton's concept was central to the cathode ray television because of his proposed modification of the cathode ray tube that allowed its use as both a transmitter and receiver of light.&lt;ref name="Oakesin51"/&gt; The cathode-ray tube was the system of electronic television that was subsequently developed in later years, as technology caught up with Campbell-Swinton's initial ideas. Other inventors would use Campbell-Swinton's ideas, as a starting-point to realise the cathode ray tube television as the standard, workable form of all electronic television that it became for decades after his death. It is generally considered that the original credit for the successful theoretical conception of using a cathode ray tube device for imaging should belong to Campbell-Swinton.&lt;ref name="Oakesin51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidsarnoff.org/rcatechtv.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born in [[Edinburgh]] the son of advocate [[Archibald Campbell Swinton]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Alan_Archibald_Campbell_Swinton&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell-Swinton was educated at [[Cargilfield Trinity School]] and [[Fettes College]] (1878–1881).&lt;ref name="bibiography"&gt;

He was one of the first to explore the medical applications of [[radiography]], opening the first radiographic laboratory in the United Kingdom in 1896. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1915. He is better known by his work on the electronic television. He discovered the phenomenon known as ''[[Video camera tube#Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes|magnetic focusing]]'' in 1896, he found that a longitudinal magnetic field generated by an axial coil can focus an electron beam.&lt;ref name="Swinton_ESMF"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell-Swinton wrote a letter in response to an article in the 4 June 1908 issue of [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] by [[Shelford Bidwell]] entitled "Telegraphic Photography and Electric Vision". Even as early as 1908, it was recognised that "The final, insurmountable problems with any form of mechanical scanning were the limited number of scans per second, which produced a flickering image, and the relatively large size of each hole in the disk, which resulted in poor resolution".

&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the 18 June 1908 issue of ''Nature''. The name of the article is "Distant Electric Vision". He wrote: "This part of the problem of obtaining distant electric vision can probably be solved by the employment of two beams of cathode rays (one at the transmitting and one at the receiving station) synchronously deflected by the varying fields of two electromagnets placed at right angles to one another and energised by two alternating electric currents of widely different frequencies, so that the moving extremities of the two beams are caused to sweep simultaneously over the whole of the required surface within the one-tenth of a second necessary to take advantage of visual persistence. Indeed, so far as the receiving apparatus is concerned, the moving cathode beam has only to be arranged to impinge on a suitably sensitive fluorescent screen, and given suitable variations in its intensity, to obtain the desired result."&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave a speech in London in 1911 where he described in great detail how distant electric vision could be achieved. This was to be done by using [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) at both the transmitting and receiving ends. The photoelectric screen in the proposed transmitting device was a mosaic of isolated rubidium cubes.&lt;ref name="Swinton-Rontgen1"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first iteration of the electronic television which is still in use today. When Swinton gave his speech others had already been experimenting with the use of cathode ray tubes as a receiver, but the use of the technology as a transmitter was unheard of. His concept for a fully electronic television system was later popularised by Hugo Gernsback as the ''"Campbell-Swinton Electronic Scanning System"'' in the August 1915 issue of the popular magazine ''Electrical Experimenter''.&lt;ref name="Swinton-Watson"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 he once again described his system in his presidential address to the Roentgen Ray Society and in 1921 a book was published describing it in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Aw9IAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=the+electrical+transmission+of+photographs&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sYzqt9XXen&amp;sig=5ijTnMlLo2Ndo9p202p6suHGY8s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C_dpSv-AD5Gutgf77rW_Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 ''The Electrical Transmission of Photographs'' by Marcus J Martin; Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd, London, New York, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; He himself described his system seven years later in the June 1928 issue of ''[[Modern Wireless]]'', "Television by Cathode Rays". 
:''"Surely it would be better policy if those who can afford the time and money would abandon mechanical devices and expend their labours in what appears likely to prove the ultimately more promising method in which the only moving parts are imponderable electrons."''

In a letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some "not very successful experiments" he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a [[Cathode ray|cathode ray beam]].&lt;ref name="Burns-Swinton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Swinton_ET1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but they were later repeated by two different teams in 1937, by his students H. Miller and J. W. Strange from [[EMI]],&lt;ref name="Miller-Strange"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams succeeded in transmitting "very faint" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate, but much better images were obtained when the metal plate was covered with zinc sulphide or selenide,&lt;ref name="Miller-Strange"/&gt; or with aluminium or zirconium oxide treated with caesium.&lt;ref name="Iams-Rose-1937"/&gt; These experiments are the base of the future [[Video camera tube#Vidicon|vidicon]].

Alongside his research into the electrical transmission of images, Campbell-Swinton also worked in voice telephony, founding the short-lived [[Equitable Telephone Association]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;

'''Anacarsis Lanús''' ([[Concepción del Uruguay]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], Nov 14, 1820 – Oct 14, 1888) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] entrepreneur of [[French people|French]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] origin.

==Biography==
He had a formidable role during the years of the secessionist [[State of Buenos Aires]] movement. He was also Deputy Head of Police in the city of Buenos Aires.

Later, during the [[War of Triple Alliance]], he turned one of the richest men in his country as a purveyor to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] armies, and also during the [[Conquest of the Desert]].
&lt;!--== Biografía ==
En su juventud se dedicó al comercio minorista en la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Durante la gobernación de [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] hizo grandes negocios con importaciones desde Europa y con el tráfico a través del [[río Paraná]].

Después de la [[Batalla de Caseros]] se unió al partido de [[Bartolomé Mitre]] y participó en la [[revolución del 11 de septiembre de 1852]]. El gobierno del [[Estado de Buenos Aires]] lo nombró subjefe de policía de la ciudad. Durante la década siguiente fue diputado provincial y aumentó su fortuna proveyendo a las milicias que enfrentaban a los [[campañas previas a la Conquista del Desierto|indígenas del sur de la provincia]].

Fue uno de los más importantes proveedores de los ejércitos aliados durante la [[Guerra de la Triple Alianza]]. Aumentó enormemente su fortuna, y los testimonios de los militares que combatían coinciden en acusarlo de repetidas maniobras especulativas, y de proveer alimentos y vestimenta de muy inferior calidad a la contratada. Continuó prestando servicios de provisión del [[Ejército Argentino]] durante la [[rebelión jordanista]] iniciada en [[1870]]. En los años siguientes continuó negociando con la provisión de los [[fortín|fortines]] de la frontera indígena. Era considerado el hombre más rico del país.

Fundó un pueblo con su nombre, [[Lanús]], en las afueras de la ciudad de Buenos Aires, que hoy es uno de los partidos más poblados del [[Gran Buenos Aires]].

En [[1874]] se pronunció a favor de la [[Revolución de 1874|revolución]] de ese año, organizada por el ex presidente Mitre. Financió gran parte de la campaña de Mitre, de modo que cuando ésta terminó con su completa derrota perdió gran parte de su fortuna y de su prestigio comercial.

Comenzó a recuperar la fortuna perdida al producirse en [[1879]] la llamada [[Conquista del Desierto]], como proveedor del ejército organizado por el ministro general [[Julio Argentino Roca]]; debió compartir los negocios con los hermanos del ministro, especialmente con [[Ataliva Roca]].

A principios de [[1888]] comenzó a diversificar sus negocios, al conseguir la concesión del ferrocarril a [[Bolivia]]; pero falleció en octubre del mismo año, sin haber iniciado la obra.

Su hijo, también llamado Anacarsis Lanús, fue gobernador del [[Territorio Nacional del Chaco]] entre [[1911]] y [[1914]] --&gt;

'''Andrey V. Kirikov''' (born 29 September 1975 in [[Kemerovo]]) is a [[Russia]]n lawyer and entrepreneur. He was one of the founding shareholders of [[Sibcement|Sibir Cement Group]], a major Russian cement producer.

==Biography==
Born in Kemerovo in 1975 to a  mathematician and a medical doctor, Andrey graduated from the Law School of the [[Kemerovo State University]] in 1997. After graduation, Andrey Kirikov went to work full-time as a legal counsel at [[Kuzbassprombank]], which he had joined while still in law school.

In 1999, he became legal counsel to Deputy Governor for Construction of the [[Kemerovo Region]], moving up to Head of Legal Support for Deputy Governor for Revenue. He became Director for Legal and General Management at [[Novokuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant|Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant]] in 2000, subsequently becoming head of the private [[Регионсервис|Regionservice Bar Association]], an NPO.

He defended his PhD thesis on legal support for crime prevention at the [[Griboedov Institute for International Law and Economics]] in 2002, earning his PhD equivalent in law. His thesis was the first law research document in Russia to formulate the concept of legal support for crime prevention as an essential category of criminology and provide theoretical underpinnings for it. In the conclusion to his thesis, Andrey Kirikov noted the need for passing a basic law in this area – the federal law on prevention of crime.

Andrey Kirikov was a Director (member of the Board of Directors) at [[Sibcement|Sibir Cement Holding Company]] in 2004—2008, moving on to start an investment business of his own after that.

==Law practice and business activities==
While still in law school, Andrey Kirikov was hired by [[Kuzbassprombank]] as a legal counsel, a position he held until 1998. His experience of legal work in banking, government service, and in the steel industry led him to start a non-profit in 2001 – the private Bar Association Regionservice, which Kirikov led for eight years.

Andrey Kirikov became one of three founders, a core shareholder and Board Member of public joint-stock [[Sibcement|OAO Sibir Cement Holding Company]], a major Russian financial and industrial groups, in 2004. True to its name, the company focused on production and marketing of [[Portland cement]] in the vast Russian region of [[Siberia]]. Kirikov was one of the key people in the Sibir Cement Group until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1391910 «Сибцемент» теряет основателей]&lt;/ref&gt;

After resigning from Sibir Cement, together with its President and core shareholder [[Андрей Анатольевич Муравьёв|Andrey Muravyov]], Andrey Kirikov sold his 12% stake in the company. New management of Sibir Cement later sued Kirikov for more than RUB 70 million (approximately US$2.3 million at the time), claiming that Kirikov had failed to repay a loan he borrowed from the Group in 2007. The Russian media trace the roots of conflict between Sibir Cement and its former top managers to disagreements over a EUR 600-million deal to buy [[Set Group]], the Turkish division of [[Italcementi Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/286511/starye_dolgi Старые долги]&lt;/ref&gt; The Moscow City Court dismissed SIbir Cement’s claims against Kirikov on January 24, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pravo.ru/news/view/81789/ Мосгорсуд оставил бывшему совладельцу «Сибцема» Кирикову 51,8 млн руб.: заем без договора — не заем]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrey Kirikov has been a Director at Mercury Capital Trust, an asset management firm, since 2008.

==Family==
In the summer of 1995, Andrey married his elementary and high school classmate Alina Kaidorina, whom he had met in the second grade.

Andrey and Alina Kirikovs have two sons, Igor (b. 1999) and Demyan (b. 2007). Andrey Kirikov is an avid hunter, scuba diver, amateur boxer and alpine skier.

'''Antonio Mattei Lluberas'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Mattei'''|'''Lluberas'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (September 7, 1857 – January 15, 1908), was a businessman and politician who in 1897 planned and led the second and last major uprising against Spanish colonial rule in [[Puerto Rico]], known as the [[Intentona de Yauco]].

==Early years==
Mattei Lluberas was born in the town of [[Yauco, Puerto Rico]] to Antonio Mattei Casanova and Mercedes Lluberas Torres de Figueroa. Mattei Lluberas' father's parents, who were of [[Corsican people|Corsican]] descent, sent him to France where he received his primary and secondary education.&lt;ref name="GHA"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/pers12.htm Protagonistas de la Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico Parte XII]&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Puerto Rico and became a wealthy businessman after he established a successful coffee plantation. He later married Ana María Rita Emmanuelli Negroni, the (daughter of Louis Henri Emanuelli Ciavaldini b 1824 [[Corsica]] and Ana Maria Negroni Rodriguez) and had three children: Rita María, Rita Monserrate and Luis Antonio.&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt;

==Intentona de Yauco==
[[File:Intentona de Yauco.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the "Intentona de Yauco" revolt]]
{{Main article|Intentona de Yauco}}
Mattei Lluberas was among the many Puerto Ricans at the time who professed liberal ideals and believed that Puerto Rico should be an independent nation free from Spanish Colonial rule. As such, he became involved with the island's revolutionary movement and became one of their leaders.&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt; In 1896, Mattei Lluberas met with Mateo Mercado and a group of "Yaucanos" (as the natives of Yauco are known) who believed in full independence of Puerto Rico in ''Barrio Barinas'' of Yauco and made plans to overthrow the government. On December of that year, the local Civil Guard discovered their plans and proceeded to arrest all those involved who, besides Mercado and Mattei Lluberas, included Dario and Carlos Franchesi and Emiliano Lavergue, however they were soon released and returned to their respective homes.&lt;ref name="HMPR"&gt;''Historia militar de Puerto Rico'', by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 305–06; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Spanish; {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}; {{ISBN|978-84-7844-138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Mattei Lluberas visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ramon Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Méndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising was to be directed by Betances, organized by Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Rius Rivera. At the time Rius Rivera, who joined [[José Martí]]'s struggle for Cuban independence as a member of the Cuban Liberation Army, was the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solidaridad_cuba.tripod.com/id50.html ''Noticias de la XVII Brigada Juan Rius Rivera en Cuba'']{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance to the plan, Mattei Lluberas purchased 30,000 machetes which were to be distributed amongst the rebels. Mattei Lluberas returned to Puerto Rico with a [[Flag of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican flag]] and began to proceed with the plans of the revolt with his group. The Budet Rivera brothers established an insurgent training camp in the farm of Gullermo Velazco. Fellow rebels, Gerardo Forest Velez and Agustin F. Morales (himself a general in the Army of the [[Dominican Republic]]), were in charge of propaganda and traveled throughout the island seeking public support for their cause. Cuban revolutionist Tomas Estrada Palma, offered a contribution of 500 rifles with half a million rounds of ammunition and his comrade offered a steamship with an invading force of 200 men under the command of General Agustin F. Morales. The revolution was set for the beginning of the month of December 1897.&lt;ref name="MHPR"&gt;''Historia militar de Puerto Rico'', by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 307; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Spanish; {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}; {{ISBN|978-84-7844-138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayor of Yauco Francisco Lluch Barreras heard the rumors of the planned uprising, he immediately notified General Sabas Marín González the governor of the island.

Fidel Velez, a native of [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande]] and one of the separatist leaders, found out that the Spanish authorities knew about their plans and immediately held a meeting with Mattei Lluberas and the other leaders. Fearing that they all would soon be arrested, he demanded that the insurrection start immediately and not in December. In the discussion that followed, the other leaders did not agree with him, fearing that such a haste action would lead to the same disastrous results of ''[[El Grito de Lares]]''.&lt;ref name="MHPR"/&gt;

On March 24, 1897, Fidel Velez and his men met at Susua Arriba, just outside Yauco. They unfurled the Puerto Rican flag for the first time in Puerto Rican soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseosvaldo.freeyellow.com/Sabiausted.htm Sabia Usted?] {{es icon}}, Sabana Grande, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/pr.html#f The Flag], Flags of the World, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and marched towards the town. They planned to attack the barracks of the Spanish Civil Guard with the aim of gaining control of the arms and ammunition which were stored there. The plan did not succeed because when they arrived they were ambushed by the Spanish forces who had set up positions and were waiting for them. A firefight ensued upon the arrival of the group and the rebels quickly retreated. On March 26, another group headed by Jose Nicolas Quiñones Torres and Ramon Torres attempted to fight the Spaniards in a barrio called "Quebradas" of Yauco, however said revolt also failed.&lt;ref name="MHPR"/&gt; Over 150 rebels were arrested, accused of various crimes against the state and sent to prison in the City of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. Velez fled to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] where he lived in exile, while Mattei Lluberas went into exile in New York City and joined a group known as the "Puerto Rican Commission".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Enciclopedia_Ilustrada/Documentos_historicos/Protagonistas/P12.htm Projecto Salon Hogar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092737/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Enciclopedia_Ilustrada/Documentos_historicos/Protagonistas/P12.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mattei Lluberas and the [[Puerto Rican Commission]] in New York had been trying to convince President [[William McKinley]] to invade Puerto Rico for sometime. After Cuba was taken during the [[Spanish–American War]], President McKinley approved the land invasion of Puerto Rico. A convoy of ships left [[Tampa, Florida]] and on July 21 another convoy departed from [[Guantánamo]] for a 4-day journey to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="AAMPR"&gt;

Also known as [[guerrilla marketing]] or [[ambush marketing]], '''attack marketing''' is a form of [[marketing]] that incorporates a series of creative and strategic techniques used to build and maintain public awareness surrounding a person, place, product, or event. Attack [[marketing]] utilizes the power of social interactions to execute non-traditional marketing campaigns that drive sales, increase name awareness and create long-term buzz around a specific business.
Attack marketing is used by many marketing, [[advertising]], [[public relations]] and [[promotional event]] marketing agencies to promote popular worldwide brands and events. Attack marketing can be tailored to fit marketing programs of all budgets, small and large.

==History==
Attack marketing was traditionally used by bootstrapped businesses looking for cheaper forms of [[advertising]].  As the marketing industry evolved, engaging consumers who had been bombarded with duplicated advertisements became difficult.

The innovation of non-traditional marketing, such as attack marketing, gained greater popularity. Currently, attack marketing is prominently used to promote small businesses as well as larger brands such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Disney]], [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] and more.

*In 1954, the [[Marlboro Man]] appears in [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] ads, making the company to become the #1 cigarette brand in the US.
*[[Guerrilla]], ambush and attack marketing became popular in the 1970s.
*In 1982, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] aired its first national television ads, created by newly formed ad agency Wieden+Kennedy, during the New York Marathon.
*In 1984 Jay Conrad Levinson's book on [[Guerrilla Marketing]] is distributed to bookstores
*In 1986, [[Run DMC]] created a single called "My Adidas" and significantly raised [[Adidas]] shoe sales overnight.
*In 1996 Atlanta [[Olympics]], Linford Christie wore contact lenses embossed with the [[Puma AG|Puma]] logo at the press conference preceding the 100 metres final.
*The London [[Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006]] restricts ambush, guerrilla, and attack advertising at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The concept behind attack marketing is based on a form of warfare called [[guerrilla warfare]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Stoeckl|first = Verena E.|last2 = Luedicke|first2 = Marius K.|date = 2015-12-01|title = Doing well while doing good? An integrative review of marketing criticism and response|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315002635|journal = Journal of Business Research|volume = 68|issue = 12|pages = 2452–2463|doi = 10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.06.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mainly focuses on ambushes, sabotage and the element of surprise. Although advertising has been around since the Egyptians in 4000 BC,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.creativeguerrillamarketing.com/what-is-guerrilla-marketing/|title = What Is Guerrilla Marketing? |last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an increase in economic activity, increase in technology and in increase in living standards around the world, advertising has been forced to adapt, making it more important to satisfy consumer wants and needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that the aim of advertising has shifted, it is no longer to inform them or allow the consumer to have perfect knowledge of the market but rather to entertain or encourage them to buy. Seeing the changes around him [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] wrote his novel ''Guerrilla Advertising'' in 1984; this book highlighted benefits that attack advertising has for smaller businesses with smaller marketing budgets as well as unconventional methods for ensuring that an advertising campaign is memorable and relates to the customer on a personal level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Many countries around the world are becoming more diverse and multi-cultural which makes it even harder to create a message that people find relatable, memorable as well as ensuring no one gets offended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, this marketing strategy is constantly changing due to a shifts in cultural, social, economic, environmental and moral demands advertising agencies have to be on high alert for anything that could potentially be offensive.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; An example of this change is the use of movie stars endorsing popular cigarette brands in movies. This was a popular method of advertising with 88% of Walt Disney movies between 1999–2003 including smoking with the aim to endorse smoking as a societal norm. This, however, is an unacceptable practice in 2016 with campaigns to have smoke-free movies being created around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsra-adnf.ca/cms/file/files/pdf/Smoke-free_Movies_factsheet.pdf |title=SMOKEREE|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427104057/https://www.nsra-adnf.ca/cms/file/files/pdf/Smoke-free_Movies_factsheet.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of attack marketing is to reach high volumes of consumers; if a campaign is not thought out and is considered offensive or derogatory, the result can be catastrophic to businesses. This is in part due to [[social media]]. In the past, if a campaign was considered a "fail", the public could only coordinate small boycotts in protest, but now social media campaigns can mobilize far more people, which can destroy a business' brand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Failed campaign ===
In 2007 [[Cartoon Network]] hired a third party marketing firm to promote the new release of the cartoon ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' with a low budget, attack marketing strategy.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; They achieved this by developing little blinking electronic devices and placing them in the streets of Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston. Weeks went by before a Boston citizen called the police mistaking the promotional devices as an explosive device. Emergency services and the bomb squad were called out to the site and Boston went into lockdown. This failed marketing stunt cost Cartoon Network 2 million dollars in compensation to Boston services as well as a ruined reputation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This incident highlights the importance in understanding the changing environment as well as being able to communicate with your target market.

=== Successful campaign ===
Although this theory was created to help little firms with smaller budgets get head in their given industry larger companies such as Coca-Cola have adapted this practice to suit them. Coca-Cola's "Happiness" campaign is an example of successful attack-style marketing. This was implemented through the use of vending machines dispensed throughout out America which gave out free cokes, pizzas, footballs and other prizes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=coca+cola+happiness+commercial)|title = coca cola happiness commercial) - YouTube|website = www.youtube.com|access-date = 2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was filmed and put on YouTube with the tag "where will happiness strike next?" These videos have had over 11 million combined views&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and are viewed on an international platform. This campaign was a major success and fits the definition of attack marketing: it ambushed and surprised the consumers at the various locations, created a large amount of social buzz, and was achieved through an unconventional method.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Strategies==
Attack marketing uses a number of different strategies to create memorable interactions between businesses and consumers, including use of:

===Promotional staff to interact with consumers===
*Brand ambassadors – knowledgeable brand representatives
*Promotional models – brand representatives that display brand image
*In-store demonstrators – brand representatives that demonstrate and distribute product samples
*[[Street team]]s – teams of brand ambassadors promoting brand outdoors

===Non-traditional marketing techniques===
*[[Street marketing]] – Outdoors promotions with promotional staff
*College campus activation – College campus marketing events and programs
*Social media – Event marketing online through Facebook, Twitter, etc.
*Mobile media – Promotional event marketing with vehicles
*Airport marketing – Product sampling and displays at airports
*Spring break marketing – Promotional event marketing at popular Spring Break destinations (flyering, product sampling, etc.)
*Publicity stunts – Flash mobs, mock protests with promotional models
*[[Green marketing]] – Event marketing using sustainable products
*Wearable media – Promotional marketing with electronics
*Outdoor postering – Outdoor poster placements
*Guerrilla projections – Outdoor digital displays during marketing event
*Chalking/stenciling – Outdoor sidewalk stenciling
*Flyer distributions – Public distribution of flyers by promotional staff

To help execute attack marketing programs, many businesses hire other resource agencies that provide event staffing, field support and [[guerrilla marketing]] services to help with event logistics.

The '''Auditor General of Pakistan''' is a government organization and the prime and supreme audit institution (SAI) in the country for ensuring public accountability and fiscal transparency and oversight in governmental operations. The organization is expected to bring about improvements in the financial discipline and internal control environment in the executive departments for minimizing the possibility of waste and fraud.

==Appointments==
The Auditor General is appointed by the [[President of Pakistan]]. His reports are presented to the Public Accounts Committees (PAC) of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National]], [[List of provincial governments of Pakistan#Assemblies|Provincial]], and [[Local government in Pakistan|District assemblies]]. His mandate enables him to strengthen the legislative oversight by providing an independent and objective assessment of the process of governance at the federal and provincial levels.

The business empire of Haw Par Brothers International and Aw family was completely dismantled after the takeover and the death of Aw Cheng Chye in 1971. After the brother-in-law and sister of Aw Cheng Chye resigned as the directors of Thai subsidiary of Haw Par Brothers International, the Thai subsidiary, which was responsible to make "Tiger Balm" [[liniment]] in Thailand, was sold in 1972. A proposal to acquire the remaining shares of Chung Khiaw Bank by [[United Overseas Bank]], was announced in the same year. At that time due to the ability of director from the related parties being able to vote in such deal, a minority shareholder made a public statement on the newspaper, requesting the government to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/nysp19720623-1.2.58.12|title=祟僑銀行一股東的申訴|date=23 June 1972|access-date=11 October 2017|work=Nanyang Siang Pau|publication-place=Singapore|language=Chinese|via=Singapore National Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being based in Nigeria for a decade, Cassava Republic Press launched in [[London]], England, in April 2016,&lt;ref name=Wanner&gt;[[Zukiswa Wanner]], [https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-453917284/bibi-comes-to-london "Bibi Comes to London"], ''[[New African]]'' Vol. 561, May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatsonafrica.org/nigerian-publishing-press-cassava-republic-launches-london-april/ "Nigerian Publishing House Cassava Republic Comes to the UK This April"], What's On Africa ([[Royal African Society]]), April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 launched in the US,&lt;ref name=PW /&gt; becoming "the first African publisher to open a subsidiary outside the continent", as reported by the ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Fic, [https://www.ft.com/content/8cebd6d6-79b4-11e6-97ae-647294649b28?mhq5j=e6 "Publisher’s expansion brings Nigerian writers to world stage"], ''Financial Times'', 27 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2006, Bibi Bakare-Yusuf — previously an academic in the [[UK]] and Nigeria, holding a PhD in [[Gender Studies]] from the [[University of Warwick]] — set up a company, with her partner [[Jeremy Weate]],&lt;ref&gt;Belinda Otas and Tolu Ogunlesi, [http://publishingperspectives.com/2010/04/feeding-the-african-imagination-visiting-nigerias-cassava-republic/#.VqlavZqLTZ4 "Feeding the African Imagination: Nigeria’s Cassava Republic"], ''Publishing Perspectives'', 27 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to produce high-quality African literature at a price that would enable it to be enjoyed by as wide an audience as possible.&lt;ref name=Umaisha /&gt; They had no business or publishing experience, "just passion and a desire to see African stories written and owned by Africans. Inspirational figures in publishing such as [[Margaret Busby]], co-founder of [[Allison &amp; Busby]], were our guide", as Bakare-Yusuf has recalled:&lt;ref name=Wanner /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I moved to Nigeria as an academic, there were all these interesting African writers being published abroad, and they’re not available locally.... So I decided, ‘okay, I’m going to start a publishing company’. Cassava Republic Press. I knew nothing, nothing nothing nothing, about publishing! I knew everything about reading and writing, but nothing about the business of publishing. 

150 million people. 77 million of them young people under 30. How do we get those people reading? Those are the people I’m actually interested in converting. We want to convert minds. We want to convert them to question who they are, and also question society."&lt;ref name=BooksLive /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Explaining the company's name, she says: "[[Cassava]] is a relatively affordable but nutritious food crop found across West Africa and in the [[African diaspora]]. I wanted a publishing house that will connect Africa to itself and its diaspora and vice versa. The idea of a Republic implies the end of a monarchy and a fresh start.... The strapline or slogan for the company is ‘Feeding the African Imagination’, which fits nicely with our brand name."&lt;ref name=Umaisha&gt;Sumaila Umaisha, [http://everythinliterature.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/rebuilding-reading-and-writing-culture.html "Rebuilding the reading and writing culture (interview)"], ''New Nigerian'', 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Headquartered in [[Abuja]], Nigeria, Cassava Republic has built a reputation primarily for literary fiction (with authors including winners of the [[Caine Prize]], [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] and [[Orange Prize]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://geosireads.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/cassava-republic-hosts-christmas-fair/ "Cassava Republic hosts Christmas Fair"], Geosi Reads, November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but also for fiction in other genres, such as crime. In addition, the list includes books for children and young adults, and several titles have been on Nigeria's national curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldfellows.yale.edu/bibi-bakare-yusuf "Bibi Bakare-Yusuf, 2012"], Yale World Fellows.&lt;/ref&gt; Among notable authors published by the company are [[Sarah Ladipo Manyika]], [[Lola Shoneyin]], [[Teju Cole]], [[Helon Habila]], [[Elnathan John]], [[Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani]], [[Mũkoma wa Ngũgĩ]], [[Chigozie Obioma]], [[Abubakar Adam Ibrahim]], [[Christie Watson]], [[John Collins (musician/researcher)|John Collins]], [[Sade Adeniran]], [[Toni Kan]], [[Doreen Baingana]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3H7X6d46c9JgnWQH7pMNw2m/meet-the-authors "Meet the authors"], ''Writing a New Nigeria'', BBC Radio 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Shercliff, [https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/five-nigerian-novelists-should-read "Five Nigerian novelists you should read"], Voices – [[British Council]], 8 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an associated imprint called '''Ankara Press''' was launched, with titles available in digital form as e-books,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamesmurua.com/cassava-republic-unveils-nigerias-newest-romance-imprint/ "Cassava republic unveils Nigeria’s newest romance imprint"], James Murua, 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to publish "a new kind of romance" that challenges conventional stereotypes, reflecting the lives and aspirations of modern African women and men:&lt;ref&gt;[http://chimurengachronic.co.za/ankara-press-new-romance-imprint-from-cassava-republic-press/ "Ankara Press, new romance imprint from Cassava Republic Press"], ''[[Chimurenga (magazine)|The Chimurenga Chronic]]'', 15 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Shercliff, [http://africasacountry.com/2014/12/ankara-press-a-new-kind-of-romance/ "Ankara Press: A New Kind of Romance"], Africa is a Country, 15 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Carpenter, [http://www.thebookseller.com/news/new-empowering-romance-imprint-cassava-republic "New 'empowering' romance imprint from Cassava Republic"], ''[[The Bookseller]]'', 17 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brittlepaper.com/2015/01/6-african-romance-novels-mills-boon "Ankara Press Debuts 6 African Romance Novels That are Better Than Mills &amp; Boon"], Brittle Paper, 14 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "We want scenarios that discard dangerous notions of male dominance, control and manipulation. Above all, we want writers who will allow African women to see the best version of themselves in print."&lt;ref&gt;Chinelo Onwualu, [http://www.cassavarepublic.biz/blogs/main/7870341-introducing-ankara-press#sthash.cf2r6mQY.dpuf "Introducing Ankara Press"], Cassava Republic website.&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Bakare-Yusuf has said: "I felt that our ideas about African literature needed to be more diverse.... We don’t think of African literature in terms of [[genre fiction]]. Yet, genre fiction is the mainstay of many publishing houses all over the world."&lt;ref name=Thisday /&gt;

===Expansion into the UK and US===
In 2015 Cassava Republic Press announced plans to launch its titles in the UK in April 2016, with a presence at literary festivals as part of a partnership with the [[British Council]].&lt;ref name=PP&gt;Dennis Abrams, [http://publishingperspectives.com/2015/11/africas-cassava-republic-press-to-launch-in-the-uk/#.VqlB9ZqLTZ4 "Nigeria’s Cassava Republic Press to Launch in the UK"], ''Publishing Perspectives'', 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BooksLive&gt;Jennifer, [http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2015/11/25/a-renewed-interest-in-literature-from-africa-trailblazer-cassava-republic-press-to-launch-in-the-united-kingdom/ "A Renewed Interest in Literature from Africa: Trailblazer Cassava Republic Press to Launch in the United Kingdom"], ''Books Live'', 25 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jess Barratt, [http://fmcm.co.uk/news/2016/2/5/cassava-republic-to-launch-in-the-uk-april-2016 "Cassava Republic to launch in the UK in April 2016"], FMcC, 24 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Felix, [http://www.mhpbooks.com/cassava-republic-press-to-publish-leading-african-authors-in-the-uk/ "Cassava Republic Press to publish leading African authors in the UK"], Melville House, 25 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Bakare-Yusuf, now based in [[London]], has described the move as "unprecedented: an African publishing house establishing a base in the UK after nearly ten years in Africa rather than the reverse. This is the birthing of African publishing onto the world stage."&lt;ref name=PP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Onwuemezi, [http://www.thebookseller.com/news/african-publisher-cassava-republic-launch-uk-317035 "African publisher Cassava Republic to launch in UK"], ''The Bookseller'', 24 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://africainwords.com/2015/12/06/leading-african-publisher-to-launch-in-the-uk-introducing-the-finest-new-voices-from-the-continent/ "Leading African Publisher to launch in the UK introducing the finest new voices from the continent"], Africa in Words, 6 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura Angela Bagnetto, [http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20160120-abuja-based-publishing-house-cassava-republic-opens-uk-office-interview "Nigeria: Abuja-Based Publishing House Cassava Republic Opens UK Office"], Radio France Internationale, 20 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Titles launched in the UK include Elnathan John’s ''Born on a Tuesday'', Sarah Ladipo Manyika's ''Like A Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun'', Leye Adenle's ''Easy Motion Tourist'', [[H. J. Golakai]]'s ''The Lazarus Effect'' and Abubakar Adam Ibrahim's ''Season of Crimson Blossoms''.&lt;ref&gt;Zaynab Quadri, [http://www.pulse.ng/books/cassava-republic-press-leading-african-publishing-house-to-launch-in-the-u-k-id4395909.html "Leading African publishing house to launch in the U.K"], ''Pulse'', 26 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassava Republic further expanded sales of its titles with a distribution deal to make the company's books directly available in US bookstores in 2017, when Bakare-Yusuf was quoted in ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' as saying: "[London and New York] give symbolic legitimization to African writing whether we like it or not and we are acutely aware if that. But we are always saying even if they are the centers for legitimization, the means of production must be owned by Africans."&lt;ref&gt;Frankie Edozien, [https://qz.com/982069/how-a-boutique-nigerian-book-publisher-is-breaking-into-the-us-market/ "How a boutique Nigerian book publisher is breaking into the US market"], ''Quartz Africa'', 12 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, as reported by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'': "Our aim is to show the broader reading audience that there is more to African life and literature than what you might read in the news."&lt;ref name=PW&gt;Ed Nawotka, [https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/international-book-news/article/73739-cassava-republic-brings-africa-to-america.html "Cassava Republic Brings Africa to America"],''Publishers Weekly'', 30 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In preference to the conventional route of selling publication rights to US publishers, Cassava Republic instead distributes its own editions to American booksellers through Consortium, a Minnesota-based distributor, and this represents "a significant new landmark for African literature", according to ''[[The New York Times]]'': "Until now, much if not all of the African literature in the West has been filtered through the tastes of European and American publishers and editors, who often select works they judge to be historically significant, educational or prize worthy. Now, for the first time, an African publisher is choosing which books get exported, and as a result, Western readers are gaining access to a greater variety of titles, ranging from contemporary African romance and hard-boiled crime to epic fantasy and children’s books."&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Alter, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/books/fiction-nigeria-writers.html "A Wave of New Fiction From Nigeria, as Young Writers Experiment With New Genres"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Category management''' is an approach to the organisation of [[purchasing]] within a business [[organisation]]. Applying category management to purchasing activity benefits organisations by providing an approach to reduce the cost of buying goods and services, reduce risk in the supply chain, increase overall value from the supply base and gain access to more innovation from suppliers. It is a strategic approach which focuses on the vast majority of organisational spend. If applied effectively throughout an entire organisation, the results can be significantly greater than traditional transactional based purchasing negotiations, however the discipline of category management is sorely misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitaker|first1=John|title=Category Management in Purchasing|journal=Supply Management|date=May 2013|volume=18|issue=5|page=50&lt;!--|pages=51|accessdate=19 October 2016--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Category Management in purchasing originated in the late 1980s. There is no single founder or originator, but the methodology first appeared in the [[automotive]] sector and has since been developed and adopted by organisations worldwide. Today Category Management is considered by many global companies as an essential strategic purchasing approach. Category Management has been defined as “an evolving methodology that drives sourcing strategy in progressive organisations today”.&lt;ref&gt;"Five Best Practices for Category Management", Justin Falgione et al., Inside Supply Management, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply]] defines Category Management as:

:"Organizing the resources of the procurement team in such a way as to focus externally onto the supply markets of an organisation (as against having a focus on the internal customers or on internal Procurement departmental functions) in order to fully leverage purchasing decisions”.&lt;ref&gt;CIPS Knowledge Works: Category Management, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan O'Brien, author of ''Category Management in Purchasing'', defines Category Management as:

:"the practice of segmenting the main areas of organisational spend on bought-in goods and services into discrete groups of products and services according to the function of those goods or services and, most importantly, to mirror how individual marketplaces are organised. Using this segmentation organisations work cross functionally on individual categories, examining the entire category spend, how the organisation uses the products or services within the category, the marketplace and individual suppliers.",&lt;ref&gt;"Category Management in Purchasing by Jonathan O'Brien, Second Edition (2012), Kogan Page, London, {{ISBN|978-0-7494-6498-1}} E-ESBN 978 0 7494 6499 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Webb of Future Purchasing makes three statements in defining Category Management:

:"It is a strategic end-to-end process for buying goods and services; it aligns business goals and customer requirements with supply market capability and it maximises long-term value for the organisation." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.futurepurchasing.com/blog/2014/02/07/is-category-management-more-than-just-strategic-sourcing&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Hunt, partner at ADR International, writes

:“the term category management can mean different things to different people, so a working definition is needed. A ‘category’ is the logical grouping of similar expenditure items, such as spend on advertising agency services or IT hardware. Category management is the sourcing process used to manage these categories to satisfy business needs while maximising the value delivered from the supply base”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supplymanagement.com/resources/q-and-a/2003/category-management-explained/ 'Category management explained", Supply Management, 30 January 2003], accessed 26.5.2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public sector organisations have recently adopted category management as a strategic transformation tool. [[Sir Philip Green]], in his “Efficiency Review” of UK government spending, recommended that “centralised procurement [should be] mandated for common categories to leverage ... buying power and achieve best practice”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/efficiency/sirphilipgreenreview.pdf Sir Philip Green, Efficiency Review by Sir Philip Green] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014013523/http://download.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/efficiency/sirphilipgreenreview.pdf |date=2010-10-14 }}, accessed 13.6.2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the federal [[General Services Administration]], working with the [[Office of Management and Budget|Office of Management and Budget’s]] Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), adopted Category Management as an operational tool for purchasing in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2014/04/09/the-future-fas-categorically-the-right-thing-to-do-for-taxpayers/, accessed 6.3.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilbert Clotaire Rapaille''', known as '''G Clotaire Rapaille''', is a French marketing consultant and the CEO and Founder of [[Archetype Discoveries Worldwide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archetypediscoveries.com/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are - Archetype Discoveries Worldwide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapaille is an accomplished author, having published 17 books with topics ranging from Psychology, Marketing, Sociology and Cultural Anthropology.

==Early life and education==
Rapaille was born in France and immigrated to the United States in the early 80s.

Rapaille attended [[Sciences Po|The Paris Institute of Political Sciences]] for a degree in Political and Social Sciences and later went on to receive a PhD in Social Psychology from [[Paris-Sorbonne University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archetypediscoveries.com/biography/|title=Dr. Rapaille's Biography - Archetype Discoveries Worldwide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In addition to his books, he is known for advising politicians and advertisers on how to influence people's unconscious decision making. Rapaille's work identifies the unstated needs and wants of people in a certain culture or country as cultural archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://buffalo.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2000/05/08/story2.html | first=Tom | last=Hartley | title=Cruisin' for the right look | date=2000-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapaille developed his theory on the brain after working as a psychologist for autistic children and studying [[Konrad Lorenz]] theory of [[Imprint (trade name)|Imprint]]s and [[John Bowlby]] theory of [[Attachment theory|attachment]].&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715203023/http://www.randomhouse.com/broadway/culturecode/influences.html|title=The Culture Code, by Clotaire Rapaille|date=15 July 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/03/18/319875/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Car Shrinks Forget rear-seat legroom. Automakers have decided that the key to higher sales lies in meeting your deepest emotional needs. Here come the | first=Phil | last=Patton | date=2002-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work led him to believe that while children learn a given word and the idea connected with it, they associate it with certain emotions. He called that primal emotional association an imprint. This imprint determines our attitude towards a particular thing. These pooled individual imprints make up a collective cultural unconscious, which unconsciously pre-organize and influence the behavior of a culture.&lt;ref name="assets.browardpalmbeach.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.browardpalmbeach.com/content/printVersion/131254|title=Getting Sleeeepy…|first=Bob|last=Whitby|date=14 September 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archetypediscoveriesworldwide.com/learn.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapaille subscribes to the [[triune brain]] theory of [[Paul D. MacLean]], which describes three distinct brains: the [[neocortex|cortex]], [[limbic]], and reptilian. Beneath the cortex, the seat of logic and reason, is the limbic, which houses emotions. Camouflaged underneath those is Rapaille's theorized brain—the reptilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/104/rapaille.html|title=Crack This Code|date=1 April 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapaille believes that buying decisions are strongly influenced by the reptilian brain, which is made up of the [[brain stem]] and the [[cerebellum]]. Only accessible via the subconscious, the reptilian brain is the home of our intrinsic instincts. It programs us for two major things: survival and reproduction. Rapaille proposes that in a three-way battle between the cortical, the limbic (home of emotion) and the reptilian areas, the reptilian always wins, because survival comes first. This theory has become the basis for his thoughts on what a product means to consumers on the most fundamental level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2003/0901/034a.html | work=Forbes | title=Mind Games | date=2003-01-09 | first=Melanie | last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His theory that culture gets imprinted into the "Reptilian Brain" during early childhood&lt;ref name=CultCode&gt;{{cite book |last=Rapaille |first=Clotaire |year=2007 |title=Culture Code |publisher=Broadway |isbn=978-0-76-792057-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been heavily contradicted by scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas|last2=Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title=Cultural Strategy |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His practice of leading managers into regression sessions to tap into their unconscious in an attempt to discover a "code" word, has also been cited as "primitive" and has been heavily contradicted by scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=CultStrat /&gt;

In the opening of his book, 7 Secrets of Marketing, he says, "Cultures, like individuals, have an unconscious. This unconscious is active in each of us, making us do things we might not be aware of."&lt;ref&gt;G. Clotaire Rapaille, 7 Secrets of Marketing, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  This collective cultural unconscious can be further defined as a pool of shared imprinting experiences that unconsciously pre-organize and influence the behavior of a culture.&lt;ref name="promenadespeakers.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="promenadespeakers.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promenadespeakers.com/page8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715122858/http://www.promenadespeakers.com/page8.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapaille's claim of technique of "archetype discovery" stems from the psychoanalytic methods pioneered by the Viennese psychologist [[Ernest Dichter]]. This technique doesn't ask what people want, but why they want it.&lt;ref name="creativityatwork.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativityatwork.com/Newsletters/Aug00ReptilianBrain.html|title=The Reptilian brain always wins in the marketplace|date=10 August 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These research methods focus on finding what he calls the “code”, the unconscious meaning people give to a particular product, service or relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Rapaille. "Marketing to the Reptilian Brain." Forbes 03 July 2006: 44. Business Source Premier. EBSCO. Web. 15 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapaille posits that sublimated emotional memories occupy a place between each individual's unconscious ([[Freud]]) and the collective unconscious of the entire human race ([[Jung]]).&lt;ref name="creativityatwork.com"/&gt;

Rapaille Associates worked on [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]]'s Archetype Project, an effort to study the emotional reasons why people smoke, presumably so the company could better leverage these emotions in advertising and promotions. Rapaille noted that typically peoples' first experience with smoking involved seeing an admired adult do it, and having a feeling that they were excluded from the activity and strongly wanting to be included. Rapaille ultimately linked smoking with adult initiation rituals, risk taking, bonding with peers and the need for kids to feel like they belong to a group and can partake in an "adult activity".  Rapaille's recommendations explain why PM supports—and advertises widely that it supports—restricting sales cigarette sales to minors and moving cigarettes out of reach of kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/vlx52c00|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapaille appeared in a ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' [[List of Frontline (PBS) episodes#Season 22|episode]] about [[marketing]] entitled "The Persuaders", which first aired on November 9, 2004 on [[PBS]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/view/|title=The Persuaders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Rapaille was hired in February 2010, at the approximate cost of $300,000, by [[Quebec City]]'s mayor Régis Labeaume to analyze the city's image on an international level.
But an article published by Pierre-André Normandin in [[Le Soleil (Quebec)|Le Soleil de Québec]] revealed that Rapaille's client list and CV contained several falsehoods and exaggerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/dossiers/quebec-et-son-image/201003/27/01-4264886-premier-contrat-dans-le-public-pour-rapaille.php Premier contrat dans le public pour Rapaille], Le Soleil, March 27, 2010.
Quote: "At the beginning of February, the Frenchman and naturalized American went before the Quebec City press to try to quiet the controversy surrounding his $250,000 contract (plus $20,000 in expenses). In the meeting, he explained that he'd worked for several big cities, ranging from Singapore to Dubai (United Arab Emirates) to Macao (China), not to mention Paris (France) and Venice (Italy). [...] Except that no cities appear in his client list, available on his website. An omission which is easy to explain: 'It wasn't for the mayor, it was for clients,' he admitted in an interview with Le Soleil while he was in Quebec City this week. 'Working directly for the mayor, yes, it's the first time.' In fact, his work for a group of companies was not so much to improve the cities' images as to break the 'codes' of the city-states of Hong Kong and Macao, in China, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, and Singapore. Of all the clients named by Clotaire Rapaille on his website, there is only one government: that of French president Georges Pompidou. But how could his company, which was founded in 1976, have been hired by a statesman who died in 1974? Asked this, Clotaire Rapaille admitted that he did not work for the government, but instead for the foundation created in 1970 by the president's wife Claude Pompidou. [...] Clotaire Rapaille's client list contains more than 75 company names, including AT&amp;T, Boeing, Pepsi, IBM, GM and Procter &amp; Gamble, to name but a few. Though it was not possible to verify these companies individually, a former executive at Chrysler told Le Soleil how Rapaille had managed to put together an address book like that. [...] In fact, here is how the Frenchman by birth was able to obtain such an impressive list of clients. Rather than hiring him directly, 'non-competing' companies would come together to decipher some code."
&lt;/ref&gt; Following those revelations his contract with [[Quebec City]] was terminated. Although the mayor terminated his contract early on March 29, 2010, he was still paid almost the entire sum.

Rapaille said during his investigation that the city of Quebec has a masochistic side to it. He also claimed his mother listened to [[Félix Leclerc]] during WW2, before Felix Leclerc (a French-Canadian singer-songwriter and political activist) recorded his first album in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[https://montrealgazette.com/business/Quebec+mayor+sacks+French+marketing+whiz+being+failure/2741831/story.html Quebec's mayor sacks French marketing whiz for being 'a failure'], ''[[The Montreal Gazette]]'', March 30, 2010. [http://phylliscartersjournal.blogspot.com/2010/03/psychic-rapaille-rip-off-no-surprise.html] "It was claims about himself that proved to be problematic, including about his war record.
The Quebec City daily Le Soleil checked his claims and found discrepancies.
In his first meeting with Quebec City reporters in February, Rapaille said his attachment to the province dates back to his wartime years in France.
His father and grandfather were taken away by the Nazis, he recalled, and he listened to the records of Quebec singer Felix Leclerc, who became his spiritual father. However, Rapaille was only four in 1945 when the war ended and Leclerc only became known in France after 1950.
He has given varying accounts of the Liberation of France in 1944, when he was three, telling different interviewers that he rode an American tank in Normandy. In another version, he got his first taste of chocolate – which he still remembers – from an American G.I., as U.S. soldiers were known in the Second World War. In an alternate version, a G.I. gave him his first taste of chewing gum, and in a third version, Rapaille dedicated his 2006 book ''Culture Codes'' 'to that G.I., leaning from his tank, who gave me chocolate and chewing gum two weeks after the invasion.' Rapaille also admits that at the time he was living in Paris, which was liberated only two months later."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''František Křižík''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈfraɲcɪʃɛk ˈkr̝̊ɪʒiːk|lang}}; July 8, 1847 – January 22, 1941) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] inventor, electrical engineer, and entrepreneur. 

==Biography==
Křižík was born into a poor family in [[Plánice]], located at the time within the [[Austrian Empire]]. In spite of this, Křižík managed in 1866 to study engineering at the Technical University of Prague [[ČVUT]]. 

Křižík is considered the pioneer in practical electrical engineering and in electrification of Bohemia (and Austro-Hungarian empire) and at the time was often compared to [[Thomas Edison]]. In 1878 Křižík invented a remotely operated signalling device to protect against collision between [[train]]s.&lt;ref name=cz&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/static/inventors/krizik František Křižík]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Křižík's cores''' are magnetic
solenoids cores shaped so as to insure an approximately uniform pull in different positions in the solenoid.

His first experiments in [[Plzeň]] resulted in invention in 1880 of the automatic electric [[arc lamp]], the so-called "Plzen Lamp"  which was displayed at the [[International Exposition of Electricity]] in Paris in 1881. This lamp, with self-adjusting brushes, won the gold medal from among 50 similar devices.&lt;ref name=cz/&gt; Later he successfully defended his patent against [[Werner von Siemens|Werner Siemens]] claim to have created it first. His lamps were successfully used in many cities for street lighting. The restored and fully functional patented arc lamp with automated electrode adjustment can be viewed at the Museum of Pilsen.

In 1895 Křižík build one of first electromobiles in Austrian empire.

In 1884 Křižík set up his own company building city lighting, tramway lines, street cars, power stations, and various electric equipment. 

A Prague subway station was named after František Křižík – [[Křižíkova]].

==Electric railway [[Tábor]] – [[Bechyně]]==

František Křižík built the first [[electric railway]] in the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1903. The track gauge was {{Track gauge|1435mm|allk=on}}. The maximum speed was {{convert|50|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. 

Railroad Stations: 
[[Tábor]] – Horky u Tábora – Slapy – Libějice – Malšice – Čenkov u Malšic – Třebelice – Všechlapy – Bechyňská Smoleč – Sudoměřice u Bechyně – Bežerovice – [[Bechyně zastávka]] – [[Bechyně]]

==Legacy==
The [[main belt]] [[asteroid]] [[5719 Křižík]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="JP: Small-body Database Browser"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=5719 | title = JPL Small-Body Database Browser | accessdate = 2008-05-03 | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Genoa International Boat Show''' ({{lang-it|Salone Nautico Internazionale di Genova }}) is one of the world's premier [[boat show]]s, held annually in [[Genoa]], Italy, typically during the month of October. The exhibition is organised by Fiera di Genova SpA and UCINA, Italy's professional association of the [[yachting]] industry, and takes place at ''Fieristico'' as well as parts of the old town and [[port of Genoa]].

== History ==
[[File:Fiera di Genova air.jpg|thumb|left|aerial view of Pavilion B]]

Owing the popularity of [[nautical tourism]] along the [[Italian Riviera]], as well as Genoa's history as a city for the ship and yacht building industry, the 1st International Boat Show was opened by Senator De Gregorio, Undersecretary to the Treasury, on 27 January 1962. With 300,000 visitors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genoaboatshow.com/StoriaSaloneNautico/Anno.aspx?anno=1962&amp;Language=EN Genoa International Boat Show 1962]&lt;/ref&gt; that year, the Salone Nautico Internazionale was an instant success. With the 5th International Boat Show in 1966, the organisation was moved from the City of Genoa to the co-operation of Fiera di Genova SpA and UCINA.

Over the years, the Boat show grew mainly by an increasing number of exhibitors and professional organisations attending the show, and with the 46th International Boat Show in 2006, the marina underwent one of its most substantial extensions. In 2009 the new 20.000 sqm Pavilion B - designed by French architect [[Jean Nouvel]] - was opened.

Since its inception, the shows were officially opened by Italian government ministers of [[Italian Minister of Economy and Finance|Economy and Finance]], [[Italian Minister of Infrastructures|Infrastructures]] and [[Italian Minister of Transports|Transports]] respectively. Next to the [[boot Düsseldorf]] [[trade fair]], the Salone Nautico is regarded as one of the world's largest [[boat show]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/europe-hosts-worlds-biggest-boat-shows-in-2010-1837891.html Europe hosts world's biggest boat shows in 2010], [[The Independent]], 10 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salone nautico 47 Genova 05.jpg|thumb|indoor exhibition space]]
[[File:Salone nautico 47 Genova 01.jpg|thumb|sailing boats]]

The exhibition area comprises both on land and in water shows, with 100,000 square meters of water basin surface and more than 200,000 square meters of pavilions and outdoor areas. In 2009, 1,450 exhibitors (37% of which from abroad, with many of the world's major marine manufacturer and boat builder) exhibited a total of over 2,400 [[sailing boat]]s, [[luxury yacht]]s, [[motor yacht]]s, [[catamaran]]s, [[sailboat]]s, and [[maxi yacht]]s. The spectrum of industries includes all types of vessels, ship components, accessories, motors and electronics as well as water sports equipment, yacht leasing and financing.

The exhibition is accompanied by various seminars, lectures and discussion sessions with leading industry experts, government representatives and opinion leaders. Topics discussed include [[yacht broker]]age, [[yacht charter]], [[yacht transport]] and [[yacht delivery]] within the [[Mediterranean]] and worldwide.

[[Image:Global Unions.png|right]]
'''Global Unions''' or '''Council of Global Unions''' is a [[website]], which is jointly owned and managed by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC), the [[Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD|Trade Union Advisory Committee]] to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], and ten [[global union federation]]s (GUFs).

The Council of Global Unions (CGU) held its inaugural meeting in Brussels, 9–10 January 2007. All GUFs, with the exception of the International Metalworkers' Federation, as well as TUAC, became members of the Council and signed the agreement.

The CGU was created to encourage closer co-operation among global unions in order to act more effectively at the international level to build a more favourable, enabling environment for organising and collective bargaining. Although its work has policy implications, it was not established to make policy. That is the responsibility of the organisations that constitute the CGU.

The Global Unions group is made up of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), which has 175 million members in 151 countries; the global union federations, which represent their respective sectors at the international trade union level (BWI, EI, IAEA, ICEM, IFJ, IMF, ITF, ITGLWF, IUF, PSI and UNI); and the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) to the OECD.

In November 2006 two international union organizations were created, the ITUC and the Council of Global Unions that emerged from a reorganization of the international trade union movement (which was divided because of post-war divisions). ITUC is the result of the breakup of both the WCL and ICFTU for the purposes of uniting under one organisation. The Council of Global Unions was created at the first meeting of ITUC and is a body involving the GUFs, ITUC, and TUAC.

Although Global Unions are described as 'global', this represents more an "aspiration than a reality since they are more accurately described as international bodies with wide coverage that are 'globalising{{'"}} (Croucher and Cotton, 2009). Historically, they have built outwards from their European bases in an attempt to include unions in other regions and are still trying to extend their coverage to every country where unions are found.

According to Harold Lewis (2003) the Global Union Federations are responsible for 80 per cent of the international movement’s activity and 90 per cent of its work directly affecting workplaces.

=== The focus on cabins: Crystal Cabin Award and Aircraft Interiors Expo {{anchor|Aircraft Interiors Expo}}===

A particular focus for many aviation companies in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region is the interior fittings of aircraft along with the design of aircraft cabins. Airbus develops and builds the cabins for the A380 at [[Finkenwerder Airport]], and Lufthansa Technik AG designs [[in-flight entertainment]] systems along with luxury VIP fittings for private aircraft.&lt;ref name="gallagherAII" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/crystal-cabin-award.html |title=Wo die inneren Werte zählen – Hamburgs Kabinenkompetenz |publisher=Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e.V. |access-date=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319210813/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/crystal-cabin-award.html |archivedate=2013-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous small and medium-sized enterprises specialised in cabin design, cabin fittings, cabin technology and In-Flight Entertainment and Communications (IFE&amp;amp;C).
The aviation region’s focus on this field is clearly seen in the Aircraft Interiors Expo, an annual specialist trade fair held in Hamburg since 2002. Launched in 2007, the [[Crystal Cabin Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystal-cabin-award.com/index.php?id=160 |title=General Information |publisher=Crystal Cabin Award Association |access-date=2013-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106210825/http://www.crystal-cabin-award.com/index.php?id=160 |archivedate=2014-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for outstanding product innovations in the field of aircraft interior fittings is presented as part of this trade fair.&lt;ref&gt;Munke, Hans-Jörg: Weltweit führende Fachmesse, Artikel in: Hamburger Abendblatt, 21. März 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is funded by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.

== The aerospace cluster: Hamburg Aviation ==

In the field of [[economics]], an accumulation of companies spread throughout the value creation chain, interwoven with research and training facilities, such as exists in the aviation industry in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, is termed a [[Business cluster]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Michael E.: Clusters and the New Economics of Competition; Harvard Business Review: 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A cluster is defined by a triple helix structure: the interplay between commerce, research and education, and the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Etzkowitz, Henry: The Triple Helix. University-Industry-Government Innovation in Action, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, companies, universities and government bodies joined forces to establish the “Hamburg Aviation Initiative” in order to promote the development of the aviation industry cluster in Hamburg. This developed into the “Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e.V.” association, with 15 founding members, formally established in 2011. Hamburg Aviation is the brand name of this association. Its goal is the joint coordination of initiatives to support the aviation industry in the region.&lt;ref name="hamburg-aviation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/spitzencluster.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Strategie und Erfolge des Spitzenclusters |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620134414/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/spitzencluster.html |archivedate=2013-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of its work include the initiation of cooperative research projects and the management of EU research projects along with regular industry gatherings such as the Hamburg Aviation Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/hamburg-aviation-forum.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Das Hamburg Aviation Forum |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802042757/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/hamburg-aviation-forum.html |archivedate=2013-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organisation of events designed to secure the next generation of aviation specialists.

=== Winning the Leading-Edge Cluster competition ===

In 2008, the then Hamburg Aviation Initiative was recognised as a Leading-Edge Cluster in the first Leading-Edge Cluster Competition organised by the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF).&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, Bob: [http://www.abendblatt.de/wirtschaft/article559622/Bund-staerkt-Hamburger-Luftfahrtbranche.html ''Bund stärkt Hamburger Luftfahrtbranche''] Article in Hamburger Abendblatt, 3 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a total of 40 million euros of public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/regional/hamburg/forschung/euro-fuer-hamburgs-luftfahrt-forschung-5684244.bild.html ''Hamburg Luftfahrt-Forschung: Bund gibt 40 Millionen Euro'']. Article in Bild, 3 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This partial funding, combined with the support of companies in the cluster, financed numerous research and development projects.&lt;ref name="hamburg-aviation" /&gt; The total investment in research and development as a result of winning the competition was over 80 million euros.&lt;ref name="rüther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aerobrief"&gt;''Luftfahrtcluster Metropolregion Hamburg e. V. mit neuem Vorstand zu neuen Horizonten'' in ''Aerobrief 25/2011'' 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network projects: ZAL and HCAT ===

In 2009, as a network project of the universities, aviation enterprises, industry associations, research institutions and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the Center of Applied Aeronautical Research (Zentrum für Angewandte Luftfahrtforschung, or ZAL) was established – an initiative of Hamburg Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Brendan: ''Hamburg hothouse for cabin technology to open in 2013'' in ''APEXnews'' 15 March 2011, Airline Passenger Experience Association, London, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperative campus of the Hamburg Centre of Aviation Training (HCAT), is one project focussed on the training of qualified specialist personnel, securing the next generation of aviation specialists.&lt;ref name="gallagherAII"&gt;Gallagher, Brendan: ''hamburg hothouse'' in ''Aircraft Interiors International'' June 2011, pp.66-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schütte, Gisela: [https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/hamburg/article13877009/Ein-Flugzeug-als-schwieriges-Puzzlespiel.html ''Ein Flugzeug als schwieriges Puzzlespiel. Studenten lernen im HCAT, wie Kabinen und Cockpits optimal gestaltet werden''].Online at: Die Welt, 20 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamburg Aviation: the next generation ===

Securing the next generation of qualified personnel is a significant focus of the work of Hamburg Aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/nachwuchsfoerderung.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Nachwuchsförderung und Qualifizierung |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723190931/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/aktivitaeten/nachwuchsfoerderung.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous projects, jointly supported by the industry, the city and the universities, serve this purpose. Examples include the Faszination Technik Klub,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faszination-fuer-technik.de/startseite.html |title=Faszination Technik Klub für Kinder &amp; Jugendliche in Hamburg |publisher=Faszination-fuer-technik.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; organising lectures and events related to aviation for children and teenagers, and the [[DLR School Lab]] at the Hamburg University of Technology, where school pupils can carry out technical and scientific experiments.

=== International cooperative programs ===

Another area in which the association is active is the promotion of international cooperation between aviation locations. In May 2009, Hamburg Aviation launched the [[European Aerospace Cluster Partnership]] (EACP).&lt;ref name="rüther" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/partnerschaft-kooperationen.html |title=Hamburg Aviation: Weltweite Kooperationen |publisher=Hamburg-aviation.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723194553/http://www.hamburg-aviation.de/de/ueber-uns/partnerschaft-kooperationen.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the organisation is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and to initiate cooperative projects across national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eacp-aero.eu |title=EACP: European Aerospace Cluster Partnership |language=de |publisher=Eacp-aero.eu |date=2013-06-23 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such project is CARE: Clean Aerospace Regions, funded by the European Commission. The project provides a framework for 10 partners, 8 of them EACP members, to collaborate in promoting research into ecologically efficient technologies and processes for the air transportation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://care-aero.eu |title=CARE Aero: CARE Aero |publisher=Care-aero.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829020312/http://care-aero.eu/ |archivedate=2013-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jose Claveria de Venecia Jr.''' also known as JDV or Joe De V (born December 26, 1936) is a former [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]], serving from 1992 to 1998 and from 2001 to 2008. As Speaker, he was the fourth highest-ranking official of the [[Philippines]].  He was the former president of the [[Philippines|Philippines']] dominant party, [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|LAKAS-CMD]]. He ran for [[President of the Philippines|president]] in the [[Philippine general election, 1998|1998 election]] but lost to [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Joseph Estrada]], finishing second among 11 candidates.

Beginning in 1987, de Venecia has been elected to six terms as a Representative of the [[Congressional districts of Pangasinan#4th District|4th District]] of [[Pangasinan]]. He served as [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives]] throughout the [[9th Congress of the Philippines|Ninth]], [[10th Congress of the Philippines|Tenth]], [[12th Congress of the Philippines|Twelfth]] and [[13th Congress of the Philippines|Thirteenth]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Congresses of the Philippines]]. He had served for more than a year as the House Speaker of the [[14th Congress of the Philippines|Fourteenth Congress]] when on February 5, 2008, 174 representatives, or a considerable majority of members of the House, voted to remove de Venecia as Speaker. He is the first Filipino who has held the Speakership five times in separate terms. He was conferred an Honorary Doctorate in International Relations from the [[University of Cambodia]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uc.edu.kh/ucb/List%20of%20Honorary%20Doctorates%20%282004%20-%202014%29/2015-07-22%2006:43:17/1889/|title=List of Honorary Doctorates|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
De Venecia was born in [[Dagupan City|Dagupan]] to Judge Jose R. de Venecia, Sr., and Casimira Villamil Clavería. In 1947, he finished his elementary studies at the Dagupan Elementary School where he was accelerated by one year. Then in 1951, he completed his secondary education at the [[De La Salle University|De La Salle College]] High School.

As an entrepreneur, de Venecia pioneered overseas contract work for Filipinos where he was one of the first Philippine prime contractors in the Middle East and North Africa in the mid-1970s. He hired 51,000 Filipinos for his companies and engaged in port operations in [[Saudi Arabia]], agriculture in Africa, and mass housing and oil exploration in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. His Middle East initiative was followed and later led to the employment of millions of Filipinos. In the 1970s, he was initiated an [[oil exploration|oil and gas exploration]] program that led to the first oil and gas strikes in offshore [[Palawan]]. He was elected president of the Petroleum Association of the Philippines.

De Venecia was a diplomat as Minister-Economic Counselor from 1966 to 1969. He conceived and implemented the historic dollar-remittance program for overseas Filipino workers worldwide. He was one of the Ten Outstanding Congressmen before [[martial law in the Philippines]].

De Venecia came from an influential political family. His grandfather, Guillermo de Venecia was the  municipal president (now known as mayor) from 1916 to 1918 and from 1925 to 1926. He ran and won as congressman of the second district of [[Pangasinan]] from 1969 to 1972. After the restoration of the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1987, he ran and won as congressman of the fourth district of Pangasinan.

==Speaker of the House (1992-1998)==
He was reelected in 1992 and joined a newly created party [[Lakas Tao]] of President of the Philippines [[Fidel Ramos]]. He initiated the move to unite the [[National Union of Christian Democrats]], a cluster of the [[Progressive Party of the Philippines]] and the [[Union of Muslim Democrats]] to [[Lakas Tao]] to make it a dominant party. At the same year, he was elected [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]] of the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Since Ramos got a low plurality in the elections, De Venecia created a ''Rainbow Coalition'', converging political parties that include the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino|LDP]], [[Nationalist People's Coalition|NPC]], [[Lakas NUCD]], and other minor parties to make a solid majority in the House. He was reelected as congressman and Speaker in 1995.

===Peace envoy===
As Ramos’ peace envoy, Speaker de Venecia reached out to insurgent groups [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF) secessionists in Mindanao, the RAM-SFP-YOU military rebels, and the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] which operates the [[New People's Army]] (NPA). He crossed Africa's [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]] twice to meet the [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] and [[Moro National Liberation Front (Misuari faction)|MNLF]] Chairman [[Nur Misuari]] and assisted in forging a peace agreement at [[Tripoli]] in 1976. His persuasion to Misuari to accept autonomy led to the signing of the peace pact on September 2, 1996.

In 1992, de Venecia began secret talks with leaders of the military rebels, led by Commodore Calajate, Gen. Abenina, and Col. Honasan, which led to a ceasefire in December of that year and a final peace agreement in 1995. In April 1997, De Venecia journeyed to the Netherlands to meet with self-exiled leaders of the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] and [[New People's Army]] led by [[Jose Maria Sison]] and Luis Jalandoni. He was the first Christian leader to enter Mindanao's Camp Abubakar mountains in November 1997 and open breakthrough peace negotiations with [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front|Hashim Salamat]], Chairman of the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF), and military Commander Murad.

===1998 presidential election===
{{See also|Philippine general election, 1998}}
In 1998, the dominant party [[Lakas-NUCD-UMDP]] held a convention to select Ramos' successor as titular president and candidate for the May 11 election. A long list of candidates was trimmed and led to a choice between de Venecia and then National Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]]. Though De Villa was seem as the frontrunner, De Venecia won the convention vote and De Villa bolted the party to form a new one called ''[[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma-Lapiang Manggagawa|Partido Reporma]]''.

De Venecia garnered the 2nd highest number of votes in a field of 11 candidates, though he was far behind the winner, [[Joseph Estrada]]. After he lost his bid, he departed from media attention and political limelight. In one of his interviews, De Venecia said that he was depressed and took several months to recover.

==Reentry to the politics==
De Venecia reemerged on [[New Year's Day]] of 2001 calling for a ''smooth transition of power'' to the [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Vice President]]. [[Joseph Estrada|Estrada]] belittled de Venecia's  statements, however, the former was ousted January 20 of that year.

==Speaker of the House (2001-2008)==
In the [[Philippine general election, 2001|2001 election]], he won without opposition as congressman of the 4th district of [[Pangasinan]]. He was reelected overwhelmingly by the house including some of the critical left-wing partylist representatives. In 2003, he received an unexpected high commendation from the public when he accepted the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] ruling that junked the petition for the [[impeachment]] of the [[Chief Justice]]. [http://www.inq7.net/nat/2003/nov/16/nat_12-1.htm] In the [[Philippine general election, 2004|2004 election]], he became instrumental for [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]'s victory as [[President of the Philippines|president]]. He also won by a landslide as congressman and he was reelected as Speaker for the fourth time.

===NBN-ZTE scandal===
On July 10, 2007, De Venecia's supporters opposed secret balloting by the majority coalition to select the speaker of the House of Representatives in the Fourteenth Congress. Rep. Eduardo Zialcita of Parañaque, said the House is not a "secret society." [https://web.archive.org/web/20070714065230/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/july/11/yehey/top_stories/20070711top8.html] Meanwhile, Sorsogon Rep. Jose Solis accused De Venecia's son, Jose de Venecia III, for questioning a $330 million broadband connection deal between the Philippine government and Chinese firm ZTE.
Solis hit De Venecia III for desiring to have his Amsterdam Holdings, Inc. (AHI) get the deal (which will connect national government agencies to local government units through the Internet and save government up to P3 billion in telephone expenses every year). Solis further claimed  that AHI is a "veritable mom's-and-pop's enterprise with a reported paid-up capital of only P650,000. How can AHI possibly undertake this project when it may not even have enough funds to run a mini grocery?" [http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75967]

===Re-election as Speaker===
On July 23, 2007, 159 lawmakers picked De Venecia House Speaker for 5th time—after the House commenced at 2:17 pm a roll-call vote for the position. De Venecia was the lone nominee, while his opponent, Cebu Rep. Pablo Garcia, was not nominated. Iloilo Rep. Arthur Defensor was elected Majority Leader while San Juan Rep. [[Ronaldo Zamora]] was elected minority leader. The 14th Congress of the House of Representatives is composed of 240 lawmakers, 21 of whom are party-list representatives.

===Ousted as Speaker===
On January 31, 2008, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) announced that 134 congressmen signed a [[manifesto]] of "loss of confidence" versus Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr. [[Camarines Sur]] 2nd District Rep. [[Luis Villafuerte]], KAMPI president, said the successor should be [[Davao City]] [[Legislative districts of Davao City#1st District|1st District]] representative [[Prospero Nograles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=107520  Abs-Cbn Interactive, KAMPI expecting new speaker by Monday]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the regular session on February 4, 2008, [[Palawan]] Representative Abraham Kahlil Mitra moved that the position of [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|House Speaker]] be declared vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116757/121-votes-to-declare-Speakership-vacant-reached# |title=121 votes to declare Speakership vacant reached |access-date=2008-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207003735/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116757/121-votes-to-declare-Speakership-vacant-reached# |archive-date=2008-02-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the motion was submitted to a vote, De Venecia delivered a speech before the House where he criticized President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] and alleged that her government was behind the move to oust him from the Speakership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JDV: Palace behind ouster plot against me |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=107973 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=107973 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-07-09 |publisher=ABS-CBN News Online |date= 2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-04 }} &lt;/ref&gt; He recounted the times he had stood to defend President Arroyo, and said, ''"It pains me grievously to hurt the President and to hurt the First Family because I have invested so much more than any of you in this chamber to help the President become Vice President, become President…."'' Shortly after his remarks, de Venecia acknowledged to reporters: "I will join the opposition to denounce corruption in this administration. I will join the battle against corruption."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Venecia declares ‘war’ against Arroyo |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116644/De-Venecia-declares-war-against-Arroyo |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207003602/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116644/De-Venecia-declares-war-against-Arroyo |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his speech at the House plenary, de Venecia said that three military generals visited his house. They were accompanied by [[Raul Lambino]].

{{cquote|''General Santos, commanding general of the Philippine Army, commander of the United Nations Forces in East Timor, came to my house accompanied by Attorney Raul Lambino, who is his friend, and who is also my friend, and he said, 'Mr. Speaker you and your son [should] keep quiet because they want to kill you and I know they can kill you and I know they have killed other people.''}}

De Venecia's son reported the incident to the Makati City police. The Speaker, meanwhile, wrote a letter to President Arroyo to ask her to do something about the threat on their lives.

{{cquote|''My son reported this to the Makati Police and in the same day following, General Santos, such a respected general of the Armed Forces, changed his tune and said he never said such a thing. How could he say that he never said such a thing when he came to my house to ask me to listen to his story, accompanied by Raul Lambino in the presence of my son Joey, in the presence of my wife [[Gina de Venecia|Gina]].''}}

The Speaker said he asked Mrs. Arroyo in a letter to "please do something."

{{cquote|''So I wrote a letter to President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. Dear Madam President, I write to you because General Santos came to see me and said to me, and confessed to me that they wanted to kill myself and my son and that they have killed other people. I asked you because these three generals belonged to your government, please do something. That was late October of last year. Do you think up to know Malacanang has lifted a finger to arrest or to investigate these attempts on my life and of my son?''}}

"''It's simple arrogance. Just plain arrogance that Malacañang and the people of the Palace are above the law. Someday this can happen to you''," he said. The speech was delivered hours after Palawan 2nd District Rep. Abraham Kahlil Mitra, an ally of Davao City Rep. Prospero Nograles, moved the speaker's position be declared vacant.

==Post-speakership==
Shortly after midnight, February 5, 2008, 174 members of the House voted in favor of the motion to declare the position of House Speaker as vacant, removing de Venecia from his position. 35 members voted against the motion while 16 members abstained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=De Venecia ousted as House speaker |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116757/De-Venecia-ousted-as-House-speaker |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207003740/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116757/De-Venecia-ousted-as-House-speaker# |archive-date=2008-02-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prospero Nograles|Nograles]] was elected as the new House Speaker.

On March 10, 2008 Mr. De Venecia resigned his post as president of [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Lakas-CMD]].  Since then he has remained active. In 2010 he travelled to the United States to speak to Filipino people who were living and working there. He mentioned that overseas workers sent over $18 billion home every year and said about this: "This is your contribution. You must be aware of it, you should be proud of it. This is why we call you the heroes and heroines of the Filipino people." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com/?pid=19&amp;id=9099 Philippines political leader visits Kodiak], ''Kodiak Mirror'', September 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, De Venecia was appointed by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] as Special Envoy for Inter-Cultural Dialogue. The [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] said that as special envoy, De Venecia will serve to advise the administration on policies regarding cultural diversity and citizen participation under the [[UNESCO]] declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/09/1698259/duterte-appoints-de-venecia-special-envoy |title=Duterte appoints De Venecia as special envoy |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Viray, P.L. |date=9 May 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance rating==

[[File:01-jung-en.svg|400px|thumb|Administrative divisions]]
'''Jung District (Jung-gu)''' is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|''gu'']], or district, covering the downtown area of [[Daegu]], [[South Korea]].  It borders most of the other districts of Daegu, including [[Nam-gu (Daegu)|Nam-gu]] to the south, [[Seo-gu (Daegu)|Seo-gu]] to the west, [[Buk-gu (Daegu)|Buk-gu]] to the north, and [[Dong-gu (Daegu)|Dong-gu]] and [[Suseong-gu]] to the east.  The northern border is formed by the [[Gyeongbu Line]] railroad, and the eastern border by the [[Sincheon (Daegu)|Sincheon]] stream.

Jung-gu is at the nexus of [[Daegu Subway Line 1]] and [[Daegu Subway Line 2]].  [[Daegu Subway Line 3]] will also pass through the district when it is completed.

==History==
Much of Jung-gu once lay within the old confines of [[Daegu Castle]], which at one time comprised the entire town of Daegu.  A small part of the castle wall is preserved in [[Dalseong Park]].  Many historical incidents in the history of Daegu took place in the district, including the recent [[Daegu subway fire]] and the [[February 28th movement]] calling for the end of the autocratic [[First Republic of South Korea|Rhee regime]] in 1960.  The district was formally established in 1963, with the introduction of the ''gu'' system.

==Land use, demographics==
The land of Jung-gu is almost entirely developed, with only 16% greenspace remaining.  The population of Jung-gu fell steadily after peaking at 218,900 in 1980, as outlying residential districts expanded and residences were replaced by businesses.  In the mid-2000s this trend appeared to stabilize, with the 2005 population rising slightly over 2004.

==Economy and shopping==
The district has been the chief shopping center of Daegu throughout recorded history, beginning with the [[Yangnyeongsi]] and [[Seomun Market|Seomun]] markets, both of which are still in operation.  [[Chilseong Market]], a major center of hardware and furniture sales, is also located in Jung-gu.  Most of the city's department stores are located in or near the district, as are a vast number of smaller shops.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">[[File:Maus Gatsonides (1964).jpg|thumb|Maus Gatsonides (1964)]]
'''Maurice''' ("Maus") '''Gatsonides''' (February 14, 1911 in [[Gombong]], [[Kebumen Regency]] &amp;ndash; November 29, 1998 in  [[Heemstede]]) was a Dutch [[rally driver]] and inventor. Gatsonides was born in [[Central Java]] in the former [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). He founded the company "Gatsometer BV" in the Netherlands in 1958.

Today, Gatsonides' fame largely results from inventing the [[Gatso]] speed camera, a speed measuring device used today by many police forces to catch [[speeding]] drivers. He originally invented the Gatso speed camera to measure his cornering speed in an attempt to improve his driving.

==Motor racing==
Gatsonides is primarily known for inventing the [[speed camera]], but his primary interest was in motor racing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supercars.net/cars/302.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:1948 Gatso 1500 Sport (37977905262).jpg|thumb|Gatso 1500 Sport, aka "Platje", 1948]]Maurice was passionate about racing and raced in many events. However, in 1949, he built his own car. It was nicknamed the "Platje" (English: "Flatty")  because of its aerodynamic shape. The car caused a sensation at the Dutch [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort Racetrack]], passing all of the opponents including [[MG Cars|MG]]'s. Maurice was forced to sell the Flatty to pay creditors after trying to put his own V8 sportscar into production. The Flatty however, survived. It was found abandoned in the 1970s and has now been restored by Joop Bruggeman. It is the last surviving Gatso car. Gatsonides won the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1953 driving a [[Ford Zephyr]].

'''Miguel Ruiz''' (1856–1912) founded a [[coffee]] processing company which would later become "Jimenez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc." the makers of ''Café Yaucono''.

==Early years==
Ruiz, a native of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], began working in the coffee industry at a young age. His interest in that sector of [[agriculture]] led him to establish a small coffee processing company in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|Miramar]], a section of San Juan. In 1896, Ruiz started elaborating coffee using rudimentary equipment. His small operation started to grow and he soon sent for his cousin-in-law, Tiburio Jiménez, who lived in [[Spain]]. In 1911, Jiménez went to work and immediately, he too fell in love with the coffee industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaucono.com/History/history3.htm Timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314203051/http://www.yaucono.com/History/history3.htm |date=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, tragedy befell upon the family and Miguel Ruiz died. He left the company in the hands of his family and Jimenez.

=="Cafe Yaucono"==

Tomas Prado, from [[Yauco, Puerto Rico|Yauco]] was the owner of "The Coffee Co." and in 1914, created the coffee brand "Cafe Yaucono".  Jiménez became interested in the brand and soon began negotiations with Prado with the intention of buying him out. In 1916, Prado sold "The Coffee Co." and its brand "Yaucono" to the heirs of Migul Ruiz. In 1917, the Ruiz family sold the company and Jiménez quit the company. Soon afterwards, Jiménez started his own company with Juan Fernández which they named "Jiménez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs.".

==Jiménez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc.==
In 1921, the company, which was incorporated and renamed "Jimenez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc.", bought a lot in the [[Manuel Fernandez Juncos (Journalist)|Fernández Juncos]] Ave. and built a two-story building. The company operated in the first floor and the Jiménez family lived in the second floor. Jiménez married and had three children, among them José Enrique Jiménez.

In 1931, Juan Fernández sold his part of the company to Jiménez. During this period the company was faced with limitations and hardships. The [[Great Depression]], hurricanes and [[World War II]] almost completely bankrupted the entire coffee industry in Puerto Rico. Jiménez was forced to close his company on two occasions during this time.

When Jiménez reopened the company, the demand for coffee was so great that its sales soared. In 1957, Tiburcio's son José Enrique, began to work for "Yaucono" and in 1960, he was named Manager of the Sales and Marketing departments.  José Enrique started a strong advertising campaign and in 1963 introduced the "Cafe Yaucono" character "Mama Inés", becoming one of the biggest marketing symbols in Puerto Rican history. In 1965, José Enrique was named president and [[CEO]] of the company.

==Postscript==
In 1985, "Café Yaucono" received the highest award from the Puerto Rico Product Association, the "International Award for Quality". In 1996, "Cafe Yaucono" received the "Commercial Prestige Award" from Spain. "Cafe Yaucono" controls 40% of the coffee market in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaucono.com/History/history3.htm Cafe Yaucono] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314203051/http://www.yaucono.com/History/history3.htm |date=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miguel Ruiz died in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] in 1912 and Tiburcio Jiménez died in 1975 in the same city.

'''Occupation of factories''' is a method of the [[workers' movement]] used to prevent [[lock out]]s. They may sometimes lead to "recovered factories", in which the [[workers' self-management|workers self-manage]] the [[factories]].

They have been used in many [[strike action]]s, including:

*the 1920–22 ''[[Biennio rosso|Biennio Rosso]]'' (in particular the [[Turin factory occupation of 1920]])
*[[1936 French general strike]] (see [[1936 Matignon agreements]])
*in the [[May 68 revolts]], supported by the [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations]]
*in the 1970s in Italy (35-day occupation of the [[Fiat]])
*upper Clyde shipbuilder workers staged a work-in during 1971-72 with about 260 further occupations in Britain in the following decade
*the [[1971 Harco work-in]], Australia

*[[Lip factory]] in France in 1973
*the occupation of the ceramics factory formerly known as Zanon in Argentina starting in 2001, that under workers' control changed its name to [[FaSinPat]]

== Biennio Rosso ==
Radical unionism started after the first world war. The movement was a result of increasing internal commissions or "faculty councils". Around November 1918, the councils/commissions had morphed into a national problem. By February 1919, the federation of Italian metal workers had successfully received a contract permitting these commissions in their factories. In May 1919, these commissions began to transfer into councils that were managing the factories and were dominating the power structure of said workplaces. The contract also prevented democratic elections of these council members or "stewards". In April 1920, at Fiat, there was the beginning of sit-in strikes by the workers, which eventually grew to 500,000 workers striking at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/history/articles/italy-factory-occupations-1920|title=1918-1921: The Italian factory occupations and Biennio Rosso|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The French General Strike ==
In France in January 1936, the PCF, a Stalinist communist organization spurred the creation of a coalition of radicals called the "popular front". This organization was designed to defend democracy and disassemble fascist bonds. In May 1936, the popular front won a majority election and assembled a cabinet of eighteen socialist, thirteen radicals and four independent socialist to govern. Communists supported the leaderrLeon Blum but refused to join the cabinet. This change in power was spurred by a massive general strike in the years preceding where thousands of factories had been occupied by French workers to ensure said democratic governance. Blum effectively ended the strike when this government came to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/6469|title=1936: “The French revolution has begun”|last=B|first=Simon|website=Workers' Liberty|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== May 68 Revolution ==
During a period of civil unrest in France in the 1960s, student protests were joined by factory occupations and strikes by French workers. See [[May 1968 events in France]].

== Fiat Occupation in Italy ==
In the 1960s, a historic movement of strikes and factory occupations had a significant effect on Italy. After constant failure by the government to follow through on promises for reform in Italy, a surge of uprising and strikes occurred between 1968 and 1970. Earlier strikes at northern factories in Turin were successful in gaining momentum in 1962. The Lancia factory walkout was successful in gaining some workers rights. The Michelin Factory strike around the same time had less success. A large strike in Turin however, amassing 93,000 of the Fiat workforce for a massive walkout and intimidation of those who did not participate. After further political negotiation and action through the years that followed, and unsatisfactory changes in policy coupled with increasingly educated and aware workers, the series of massive strikes broke out in 1968. The autumn of 1969 is considered the climax of these strikes and they continued through the early 1970s resulting in significantly improved conditions for Italian workers. In 1973, over 6 million workers were on strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1962-1973-worker-student-struggles-italy|title=1962-1973: Worker and student struggles in Italy|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Upper Clyde Ship Builder Work-In ==
The Upper Clyde Ship Builders are a Scottish shipbuilder consortium that was birthed in 1968 by an adjoining of 5 shipbuilders. It was liquidated in 1971 resulting in occupation/work-in campaign by shop stewards in shipyards. See [[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders]].

== Harco Work-In ==
The Harco work-in of 1971 was an occupation by steel plant workers in New South Wales, Australia. The 4-week long work-in was the result of a dispute between Harco owners and workers on company sacking and rehiring practices during low production periods to save money. See [[1971 Harco work-in]].

== Uruguayan General Strike ==
During 1973, a close of parliament and essential dictatorship by the president created unrest and the leftist union called for a general strike and occupation of factories. After two weeks most of the union leaders were in jail, exile, or dead. See [[1973 Uruguayan general strike]].

== French LIP Factory ==
When the LIP factory in France decided to close a factory due to financial problems in the late 60s and early 70s, strikes and a very public factory occupation eventually transferred control and management of the factory to the workers. See [[LIP (company)]]

== Zanon Factory Occupation ==
During the Argentine uprising of the early 2000s, there was a complete takeover of the Zanon tile factory in Argentina. The workers went on strike in the year 2000, the first of a series of strikes that was spurred by the death of a worker from a heart attack. They also were adamant about making their conflicts with the company very public. Workers traveled and occupied places other than factories as well. In January 2001, there was a 6-day strike over unpaid wages. In April 2001, there was a 34-day strike over outstanding wages. These strikes were followed by many other occupations and strikes that ultimately cause the factories to lose almost 50% of their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/zanon-factory-occupation-interview-with-workers|title=Zanon factory occupation - interview with workers|website=libcom.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic Windows and Doors Occupation ==
When Republic Windows and Doors company was declared bankrupt in December 2008, an organized sit-own strike of 200 workers in the factory occurred to protest federal labor law violations by the company.

== Ssangyong Car Factory Occupation ==
A long occupation of the Ssangyong car factory by 900 factory workers and several thousand others began on May 22, 2009 after a list of firings was released by the company that showed over 1000 workers to be laid off. This was the result of the company filing for bankruptcy in February 2009. Workers were essentially sieged by the company during their occupation and workers refused all company negotiations that did not include jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/07/kore-j01.html|title=South Korea: Clashes erupt at Ssangyong factory occupation - World Socialist Web Site|last=Cook|first=Terry|website=www.wsws.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pasteurization''' [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|or]] '''pasteurisation''' is a process in which certain packaged and non-packaged foods (such as [[milk]] and fruit [[juice]]) are treated with mild heat, usually less than {{convert|100|C|F}}, to eliminate [[pathogen]]s and extend [[shelf life]]. The process is intended to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] foods by destroying or inactivating organisms that contribute to [[food spoilage|spoilage]], including vegetative [[bacteria]] but not bacterial spores.&lt;ref name=":810"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Processing Technology Principles and Practice|last=Fellows|first=P.J|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Series in Food Science, Technology and Nutrition|year=2017|isbn=978-0-08-101907-8|location=|pages=563–578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Thermal and Non-Thermal Food Preservation|last=Tewari|first=Gaurav|last2=Juneja|first2=Vijay K.|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=3, 96, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process was named after the French scientist [[Louis Pasteur]], whose research in the 1880s demonstrated that thermal processing would inactivate unwanted microorganisms in [[wine]].&lt;ref name=":45"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Spoilage enzymes are also inactivated during pasteurization. Today, pasteurization is used widely in the [[dairy]] industry and other [[food processing]] industries to achieve [[food preservation]] and [[food safety]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://milkfacts.info/Milk%20Processing/Heat%20Treatments%20and%20Pasteurization.htm|title=Heat Treatments and Pasteurisation {{!}} MilkFacts.info|website=milkfacts.info|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most liquid products are heat treated in a continuous system where heat can be applied using a [[plate heat exchanger]] and/or the direct or indirect use of hot water and steam. Due to the mild heat, there are minor changes to the nutritional quality and sensory characteristics of the treated foods.&lt;ref name=":93" /&gt; [[Pascalization]] or high pressure processing (HPP) and [[Food preservation#Pulsed electric field electroporation|pulsed electric field]] (PEF) are non-thermal processes that are also used to pasteurize foods.&lt;ref name=":810" /&gt;

==History==

[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|Louis Pasteur's pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself. These experiments were important pieces of evidence supporting the idea of the Germ Theory of Disease.]]
The process of heating wine for preservation purposes has been known in China since AD 1117,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/books/hornsey-2003-history-of-beer.html|title=A History of Beer and Brewing|author=Hornsey, Ian Spencer and George Bacon|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-85404-630-0|page=30|quote=[…] sake is pasteurized and it is interesting to note that a pasteurization technique was first mentioned in 1568 in the _Tamonin-nikki_, the diary of a Buddhist monk, indicating that it was practiced in Japan some 300 years before Pasteur. In China, the first country in East Asia to develop a form of pasteurization, the earliest record of the process is said to date from 1117.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was documented in Japan in the diary ''Tamonin-nikki'', written by a series of monks between 1478 and 1618.

Much later, in 1768, Italian priest and scientist [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]]'s research proved a product could be made "sterile" after thermal processing. Spallanzani boiled meat broth for one hour, sealed the container immediately after boiling, and noticed that the broth did not spoil and was free from microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VR19282"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQ_hjAuH9xEC&amp;pg=PA113|title=Life of Pasteur 1928|author1=Vallery-Radot|first1=René|date=2003-03-01|isbn=978-0-7661-4352-4|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795, a Parisian chef and confectioner named [[Nicolas Appert]] began experimenting with ways to preserve foodstuffs, succeeding with soups, vegetables, juices, dairy products, jellies, jams, and syrups. He placed the food in glass jars, sealed them with cork and sealing wax and placed them in boiling water.&lt;ref name="biodict23"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=978-0-415-19399-3|editor=Lance Day, Ian McNeil}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, the French military offered a cash prize of 12,000 [[French franc|francs]] for a new method to preserve food. After some 14 or 15 years of experimenting, Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFzIphx7CUQC&amp;pg=PA187|title=Food Packaging: Principles End Practice|author1=Gordon L. Robertson|publisher=Marcel Dekker|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8247-0175-8|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Appert published ''L'Art de conserver les substances animales et végétales'' (or ''The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances''). This was the first cookbook of its kind on modern food preservation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?id=2541|title=''The First Book on Modern Food Preservation Methods (1810)''|date=2009-09-29|publisher=Historyofscience.com|accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTLjD_irdS4C&amp;pg=PA66|title=Minimally processed refrigerated fruits and vegetables|author1=Wiley|first1=R.

''La Maison Appert'' ({{lang-en|The House of Appert}}), in the town of Massy, near Paris, became the first food-bottling factory in the world,&lt;ref name="biodict23"/&gt; preserving a variety of foods in sealed bottles. Appert's method was to fill thick, large-mouthed glass bottles with produce of every description, ranging from beef and fowl to eggs, [[milk]] and prepared dishes. He left air space at the top of the bottle, and the cork would then be sealed firmly in the jar by using a [[vise]]. The bottle was then wrapped in canvas to protect it while it was dunked into boiling water and then boiled for as much time as Appert deemed appropriate for cooking the contents thoroughly. Appert patented his method, sometimes called ''appertisation'' in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia, Adrian|first=Rebeca, Jean|date=March 2009|title=Nicolas Appert: Inventor and Manufacturer|journal=Food Reviews International|volume=25|issue=2|pages=115–125|doi=10.1080/87559120802682656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appert's method was so simple and workable that it quickly became widespread. In 1810, British inventor and merchant [[Peter Durand]], also of French origin, patented his own method, but this time in a [[tin can]], so creating the modern-day process of [[canning]] foods. In 1812, Englishmen [[Bryan Donkin]] and John Hall purchased both patents and began producing [[preserves]]. Just a decade later, Appert's method of canning had made its way to America.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Toffler, "Future Shock".&lt;/ref&gt; Tin can production was not common until the beginning of the 20th century, partly because a hammer and chisel were needed to open cans until the invention of a [[can opener]] by Robert Yeates in 1855.&lt;ref name="biodict23"/&gt;

A less aggressive method was developed by French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] during an 1864&lt;ref name="VR192822"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQ_hjAuH9xEC&amp;pg=PA113|title=Life of Pasteur 1928|author1=Vallery-Radot|first1=René|date=2003-03-01|isbn=978-0-7661-4352-4|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; summer holiday in [[Arbois]].

The shelf life of refrigerated pasteurized milk is greater than that of [[raw milk]]. For example, high-temperature, short-time ([[HTST]]) pasteurized milk typically has a [[Refrigeration|refrigerated]] [[shelf life]] of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment ([[Ultra-high-temperature processing|UHT]]) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as [[Aseptic processing|aseptic packaging]]), it can even be stored non-refrigerated for up to 9 months.&lt;ref name="hotchkiss23"&gt;{{Citation|last=ABB|first=Inc.|title=Recording and Control C1900 in Pasteurization processes|url=https://library.e.abb.com/public/81ad901d59844fd3ba52a1ac77bcf3b6/TD_RandC_019-EN_A.pdf|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pasteurization process==

[[File:Simple Pasteurization.png|thumb|General overview of the pasteurization process. The milk starts at the left and enters the piping with functioning enzymes that, when heat-treated, become denatured and stop the enzymes from functioning. This helps to stop pathogen growth by stopping the functionality of the cell. The cooling process helps stop the milk from undergoing the [[Maillard reaction]] and caramelization. The pasteurization process also has the ability to heat the cells to the point that they burst from pressure build-up.]]
Pasteurization is a mild heat treatment of liquid foods (both packaged and unpackaged) where products are typically heated to below 100&amp;nbsp;°C. The heat treatment and cooling process are designed to inhibit a phase change of the product. The [[acidity]] of the food determines the parameters (time and temperature) of the heat treatment as well as the duration of shelf life. Parameters also take into account nutritional and sensory qualities that are sensitive to heat.

In acidic foods ([[pH]] &lt;4.6), such as fruit juice and [[beer]], the heat treatments are designed to inactivate enzymes (pectin [[Protein-glutamate methylesterase|methylesterase]] and [[polygalacturonase]] in fruit juices) and destroy spoilage microbes (yeast and [[lactobacillus]]). Due to the low pH of acidic foods, pathogens are unable to grow. The shelf-life is thereby extended several weeks. In less acidic foods (pH &gt;4.6), such as milk and liquid eggs, the heat treatments are designed to destroy pathogens and spoilage organisms (yeast and molds). Not all spoilage organisms are destroyed under pasteurization parameters, thus subsequent refrigeration is necessary.&lt;ref name=":810"/&gt;

===Equipment===

Food can be pasteurized in two ways: either before or after being packaged into containers. When food is packaged in glass, hot water is used to lower the risk of thermal shock. Plastics and metals are also used to package foods, and these are generally pasteurized with steam or hot water since the risk of thermal shock is low.&lt;ref name=":810"/&gt;

Most liquid foods are pasteurized using continuous systems that have a heating zone, hold tube, and cooling zone, after which the product is filled into the package. [[Plate heat exchanger]]s are used for low-[[viscosity]] products such as animal milks, nut milks and juices. A plate heat exchanger is composed of many thin vertical stainless steel plates which separate the liquid from the heating or cooling medium. Scraped surface heat exchangers contain an inner rotating shaft in the tube, and serve to scrape highly viscous material which might accumulate on the wall of the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Food Process Engineering|last=Smith|first=P. G|publisher=Food Science Text Series|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=152–154, 259–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shell and tube heat exchanger|Shell or tube heat exchanger]]s are designed for the pasteurization of [[Non-Newtonian fluid|Non-Newtonian]] foods such as dairy products, tomato [[ketchup]] and baby foods. A tube heat exchanger is made up of concentric stainless steel tubes. Food passes through the inner tube while the heating/cooling medium is circulated through the outer or inner tube.

The benefits of using a [[heat exchanger]] to pasteurize non-packaged foods versus pasteurizing foods in containers are:

* &lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Heat exchanger]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s provide uniform treatment, and there is greater flexibility with regards to the products which can be pasteurized on these plates
* The process is&lt;nowiki/&gt; more energy-efficient compared to pasteurizing foods in packaged containers&lt;ref name=":810"/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;
* Greater throughput

After being heated in a heat exchanger, the product flows through a hold tube for a set period of time to achieve the required treatment. If pasteurization temperature or time is not achieved, a flow diversion valve is utilized to divert under-processed product back to the raw product tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-06-01|title=HACCP with multivariate process monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques: application to a food pasteurization process|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713504000921|journal=Food Control|language=en|volume=16|issue=5|pages=411–422|doi=10.1016/j.foodcont.2004.04.008|issn=0956-7135|last1=(Kosebalaban) Tokatli|first1=Figen|last2=Cinar|first2=Ali|last3=Schlesser|first3=Joseph E.|hdl=11147/1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the product is adequately processed, it is cooled in a heat exchanger, then filled.

High-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization, such as that used for milk ({{convert|71.5|C|F}} for 15 seconds) ensures safety of milk and provides a refrigerated shelf life of approximately two weeks. In ultra-high-temperature (UHT) pasteurization, milk is pasteurized at {{convert|135|C|F}} for 1–2 seconds, which provides the same level of safety, but along with the packaging, extends shelf life to three months under refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chavan|first=Rupesh S.|last2=Chavan|first2=Shraddha Rupesh|last3=Khedkar|first3=Chandrashekar D.|last4=Jana|first4=Atanu H.|date=2011-08-22|title=UHT Milk Processing and Effect of Plasmin Activity on Shelf Life: A Review|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|language=en|volume=10|issue=5|pages=251–268|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2011.00157.x|issn=1541-4337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verification===

Direct microbiological techniques are the ultimate measurement of pathogen contamination, but these are costly and time-consuming, which means that products have a reduced shelf-life by the time pasteurization is verified.

As a result of the unsuitability of microbiological techniques, milk pasteurization efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of [[alkaline phosphatase]], which is denatured by pasteurization. Destruction of alkaline phosphatase ensures the destruction of common milk pathogens. Therefore, the presence of alkaline phosphatase is an ideal indicator of pasteurization efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kay|first1=H.|year=1935|title=Some Results of the Application of a Simple Test for Efficiency of Pasteurization|journal=The Lancet|volume=225|issue=5835|pages=1516–1518|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)12532-8|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hoy|first1=W.

====Efficacy against pathogenic bacteria====

During the early 20th century, there was no robust knowledge of what time and temperature combinations would inactivate pathogenic bacteria in milk, and so a number of different pasteurization standards were in use. By 1943, both HTST pasteurization conditions of 72&amp;nbsp;°C for 15 seconds, as well as batch pasteurization conditions of {{convert|63|C|F}} for 30 minutes, were confirmed by studies of the complete thermal death (as best as could be measured at that time) for a range of pathogenic bacteria in milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=C.

For all practical purposes, these conditions were adequate for destroying almost all [[yeast]]s, [[mold]]s, and common [[Food spoilage|spoilage]] bacteria and also for ensuring adequate destruction of common pathogenic, heat-resistant organisms. However, the microbiological techniques used until the 1960s did not allow for the actual reduction of bacteria to be enumerated. Demonstration of the extent of inactivation of pathogenic bacteria by milk pasteurization came from a study of surviving bacteria in milk that was heat-treated after being deliberately spiked with high levels of the most heat-resistant strains of the most significant milk-borne pathogens.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearce|first=L.

The mean log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; reductions and temperatures of inactivation of the major milk-borne pathogens during a 15-second treatment are:

The [[Codex Alimentarius]] ''Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk'' notes that milk pasteurization is designed to achieve at least a 5 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; reduction of ''Coxiella burnetii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/sh-proxy/en/?lnk=1&amp;url=https%253A%252F%252Fworkspace.fao.org%252Fsites%252Fcodex%252FStandards%252FCAC%2BRCP%2B57-2004%252FCXP_057e.pdf|title=Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk and Milk Products|last=|first=|date=|website=Codex Alimentarius|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code also notes that: “The minimum pasteurization conditions are those having bactericidal effects equivalent to heating every particle of the milk to 72°C for 15 seconds (continuous flow pasteurization) or 63°C for 30 minutes (batch pasteurization)” and that “To ensure that each particle is sufficiently heated, the milk flow in heat exchangers should be turbulent, ''i.e''. the [[Reynolds number]] should be sufficiently high.” The point about turbulent flow is important because simplistic laboratory studies of heat inactivation that use test tubes, without flow, will have less bacterial inactivation than larger-scale experiments that seek to replicate conditions of commercial pasteurization.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Lindsay E.|last2=Truong|first2=H.

As a precaution, modern HTST pasteurization processes must be designed with flow-rate restriction as well as divert valves which ensure that the milk is heated evenly and that no part of the milk is subject to a shorter time or a lower temperature. It is common for the temperatures to exceed 72&amp;nbsp;°C by 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C or 2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Effects on nutritional and sensory characteristics of foods==

Because of its mild heat treatment, pasteurization increases the shelf-life by a few days or weeks.&lt;ref name=":810"/&gt; However, this mild heat also means there are only minor changes to heat-labile vitamins in the foods.&lt;ref name=":93"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vus1aZ1-sCkC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=loss+of+volatile+compounds+during+pasteurization#v=onepage&amp;q=loss%20of%20volatile%20compounds%20during%20pasteurization&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Food Preservation|last=Rahman|first=M.

Apart from meta-analysis, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effect of pasteurization on vitamins A, B12, and E based merely on consultation of the vast literature available.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Milk is not an important source of vitamins B12 or E in the North American diet, so the effects of pasteurization on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2001.

Vitamin B2 is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83&amp;nbsp;mg/liter. Because the recommended daily intake for adults is 1.1&amp;nbsp;mg/day,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2001. Dietary reference intakes-recommended intakes for individuals. National Academy of Sciences. Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.phpinfo_center~4&amp;tax_level~3&amp;tax_subject~256&amp;topic_id~1342&amp;level3_id~5140{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; milk consumption greatly contributes to the recommended daily intake of this vitamin. With the exception of B2, pasteurization does not appear to be a concern in diminishing the nutritive value of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North American diet.

===Sensory effects===

Pasteurization also has a small but measurable effect on the sensory attributes of the foods that are processed.&lt;ref name=":810" /&gt; In fruit juices, pasteurization may result in loss of volatile aroma compounds.&lt;ref name=":93" /&gt; Fruit juice products undergo a [[Deaerator|deaeration]] process prior to pasteurization that may be responsible for this loss. Deaeration also minimizes the loss of nutrients like vitamin C and [[carotene]].&lt;ref name=":810" /&gt; To prevent the decrease in quality resulting from the loss in volatile compounds, volatile recovery, though costly, can be utilized to produce higher-quality juice products.&lt;ref name=":93" /&gt;

In regards to color, the pasteurization process does not have much effect on pigments such as [[chlorophyll]]s, [[anthocyanin]]s and [[carotenoid]]s in plants and animal tissues. In fruit juices, [[polyphenol oxidase]] (PPO) is the main enzyme responsible for causing browning and color changes. However, this enzyme is deactivated in the deaeration step prior to pasteurization with the removal of oxygen.&lt;ref name=":93" /&gt;

In milk, the color difference between pasteurized and raw milk is related to the [[homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] step that takes place prior to pasteurization. Before pasteurization, milk is homogenized to separate the solids (fat) from the liquid, which results in the pasteurized milk having a whiter appearance compared to raw milk.&lt;ref name=":810"/&gt; For vegetable products, color degradation is dependent on the temperature conditions and the duration of heating.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Jing|last2=Tang|first2=Juming|last3=Barrett|first3=Diane M.|last4=Sablani|first4=Shyam S.|last5=Anderson|first5=Nathan|last6=Powers|first6=Joseph R.|date=2017-09-22|title=Thermal pasteurization of ready-to-eat foods and vegetables: Critical factors for process design and effects on quality|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=57|issue=14|pages=2970–2995|doi=10.1080/10408398.2015.1082126|issn=1549-7852|pmid=26529500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasteurization may result in some textural loss as a result of enzymatic and non-enzymatic transformations in the structure of [[pectin]] if the processing temperatures are too high as a result. However, with mild heat treatment pasteurization, tissue softening in the vegetables that causes textural loss is not of concern as long as the temperature does not get above {{convert|80|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Novel pasteurization methods==

Other thermal and non-thermal processes have been developed to pasteurize foods as a way of reducing the effects on nutritional and sensory characteristics of foods and preventing degradation of heat-labile nutrients. Pascalization or high pressure processing (HPP) and pulsed electric field (PEF) are examples of these non-thermal pasteurization methods that are currently commercially utilized.&lt;ref name=":810"/&gt;

[[Microwave volumetric heating]] (MVH) is the newest available pasteurization technology. It uses [[microwave]]s to heat liquids, suspensions, or semi-solids in a continuous flow. Because MVH delivers energy evenly and deeply into the whole body of a flowing product, it allows for gentler and shorter heating, so that almost all heat-sensitive substances in the milk are preserved.&lt;ref name="micromilk2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131115104614.htm|title=Gentle pasteurization of milk – with microwaves|work=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Personal Insolvency Arrangement''' (PIA) is  [[Ireland]]'s [[debt management]] solution for individuals who want to avoid outright [[bankruptcy]] and declare [[insolvency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Insolvency Arrangements|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html|publisher=Government of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is one of the three alternatives authorized under Ireland's Personal Insolvency Act 2012; Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSA) and Debt Relief Notices (DRN) make the other two arrangements. PIA mandates a legal agreement between a [[debtor]] and their [[creditors]], which is mediated and administered by a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). A PIA usually lasts for a term of six years and must include both [[unsecured debt]] and secured [[debts]].

== Eligibility ==
Eligibility criteria for a [[debtor]] include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility criteria for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/sec0091.html|publisher=Irish Statue Book, Office of AG, Government of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The debtor is [[insolvent]], that is they cannot pay debts in full when they are due.
* The debtor owes a debt to at least one [[secured creditor]] holding security over [[Ireland|Irish]] property or assets.
* The debtor has secured debts less than €3 million (unless [[creditors]] agree to upper limit)
* The debtor has co-operated with their secured creditor under a [[mortgage]] arrears process for 6 months.
* The debtor must live in the [[Republic of Ireland]], or ordinarily resided or had a place of business within [[Ireland]].
* The debtor provides a Prescribed Financial Statement and a PIP has examined the debtors financial situation and confirms eligibility.
Furthermore, a debtor must not have any agreements mandated under the instant Act, bankrupt nor accumulated 25% or more of their total debt during the previous 6 months

Personal Insolvency Act 2012 envisages that Personal Insolvency Arrangements can only be applied for through an approved third party termed as Personal Insolvency Practitioners. The practitioners are required to be authorised by the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and include Solicitors [[Barristers]], Qualified [[accountants]], qualified financial [[Financial adviser|advisers]] etc. Till  31 October 2013, it was announced that there are a total of 72 registered Personal Insolvency Practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of Personal Insolvency Practitioners|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIPs|publisher=Insolvency Service of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agreement Processes Authorized Under The Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scheme of Personal Insolvency Bill|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/presentation/examplesperinsolv.pdf|publisher=Insolvency Service of Ireland|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== Debtor insolvency declaration ===
Initially, the [[debtor]] is required to approach a PIP to provide a full disclosure of his or her financial situation. After appraisal, the PIP suggests best possible agreement. If recommended, the debtor can proceed with the PIA application and appoint the PIP to act on their behalf. A Prescribed Financial Statement is then prepared for the debtor.  which details key information about a debtor’s [[finances]] and clearly shows their [[insolvent]] status.  It must be fully supported by appropriate financial documentation, such as pay slips, bank statements etc. A [[statutory declaration]] in the presence of witnesses to confirm the Prescribed Financial Statement is true and accurate, plus completes and signs the additional documents needed to accompany the Statement to apply for a Protective Certificate. The full application is sent to the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI).

=== Issuance of Protective Certificate ===
A court is authorized to issue a Protective Certificate to the [[debtor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Protective Certificate?|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIA_and_PC|publisher=ISI Official Website|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides  [http://www.simplefs.co.uk/personal-insolvency-arrangements.asp PIP] and the debtor 70 days protection against creditor for preparation of a PIA proposal.

=== Preparation of PIA proposal ===
After issuance of  Protective Certificate, PIP has been mandated to prepare a draft PIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insolvency Process|url=http://www.personal-insolvency-arrangement.ie/|publisher=Personal-Insolvency-Arrangement.ie|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the process, the market value of the secured assets can either be agreed between the debtor, creditor and PIP or services of independent valuer can be solicited.

=== Creditors' meeting and approval of PIA ===
Sequel to debtor’s agreement on the PIA proposal, the PIP is required to call a [[creditor]]s' meeting in which through voting, creditors representing at least 65% of the total [[debts]] – 50% of the unsecured and 50% of the secured – must agree to the proposal. After approval in the vote, the documents are required to be forwarded to ISI, which will notify the [[Circuit Court]]. Thus final approval sits with the court, and any [[creditor]]'s objection will be considered by them.
The law requires that after approval the debtor’s name, address details, birth year and PIA start date o be made available on the [[Insolvency Service of Ireland|ISI website]].

=== Execution of PIA ===
After formal approval by the courts and notification with ISI, [[debtors]] are required to set up payments to the PIP, which in turn distribute the payments to creditors as per agreements. A PIA has a lifespan of six years.

==== Completion ====
If a debtor completes all of their obligations under the PIA, the agreement is considered complete. At completion, PIP through [[creditors]] finalize the treatment of the remaining balances debt; unsecured debt balances will be written off, while secured debt balances are discharged as per the PIA agreement. The PIP coordinates the removal of debtor’s information from the Register of Personal Insolvency Arrangements within three months, making the debtor solvent.

==== Failure ====
A PIA will be deemed to have failed if [[creditors]] do not agree to the PIA or if the debtor fails to maintain his or her duties and obligations.
This can be avoided if a debtor can anticipate a potential problem keeping up with payments, because their PIP may be able to arrange a variation with creditors to ensure a way can be found to continue with the PIA and prevent it from failing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What happens when a PIA fails?|url=http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/WP13000122|publisher=ISI website|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insolvency agreements in the UK ==
In the UK, a similar arrangement exists under the name of individual voluntary arrangement (IVA). IVA has been mandated under the Insolvency Act 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Options for paying off your debts|url=https://www.gov.uk/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/individual-voluntary-arrangements|publisher=UK Government Government Digital Service|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Putney Swope''''' is a 1969 [[Satire#Satire and Humor|satirical comedy]] film written and directed by [[Robert Downey Sr.]] and starring [[Arnold Johnson (actor)|Arnold Johnson]] as the title character, a black advertising executive. The film satirizes the [[advertising|advertising world]], the portrayal of [[race (human categorization)|race]] in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]], the [[White supremacy|white power structure]], and the nature of [[Corporate crime|corporate corruption]].

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
Putney Swope, the only black man on the executive board of an advertising firm, is accidentally put in charge after the sudden death of the [[Board of directors|chairman of the board]]: prevented by the company by-laws to vote for themselves, in a [[secret ballot]], most board members voted for the one person they thought could not win:  Putney Swope.

Renaming the business "Truth and Soul, Inc.", Swope replaces all but one of the white employees with blacks and insists they no longer accept business from companies that produce [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]] or [[toy guns]].  The success of the business draws unwanted attention from the United States government, which considers it "a threat to the [[national security]]".

==Production==

In an interview on the [[DVD]] version of the film, Downey states that Arnold Johnson had great difficulty memorizing and saying his lines during the film shoot. Downey says he was not concerned because he had developed a plan to dub in his own voice to replace Johnson's.

Though the movie is in black-and-white, Truth and Soul's commercials are shown in color.

==Legacy==
The character Buck Swope ([[Don Cheadle]]), from [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', was named as an homage to this film.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} [[Robert Downey Sr.]] also made a small cameo in ''Boogie Nights'' as the owner of a recording studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/37-things-we-learned-from-the-boogie-nights-commentary-fb8bba501524#.f1o1nidqv |title=37 Things We Learned From the ‘Boogie Nights’ Commentary |date=September 13, 2012 |author=jeremykirk13 |publisher=[[Film School Rejects]] |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character Wing Soney, a [[China|Chinese]] businessman, was the inspiration for Cosmo, the Chinese character throwing [[firecrackers]] during the drug deal scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/275870/Putney-Swope-Movie-Clip-Wing-Soney.html |title=Putney Swope - (Movie Clip) Wing Soney |publisher=Tcm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Thomas Anderson]] and [[Jim Jarmusch]] have cited the film as an inspiration for their approach to filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/louis-ck-from-2010 |title=Louis C.K. on WTF with Marc Maron |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_565_-_paul_thomas_anderson |title=Paul Thomas Anderson on WTF with Marc Maron |date=2014-01-05 |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reginald "Reg" William Revans''' (14 May 1907 &amp;ndash; 8 January 2003) was an [[academic]] [[professor]], administrator and [[management consultant]] who pioneered the use of [[Action learning]]. He was also a [[long jump]]er who represented [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]] where he finished 32nd in the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics - Men's long jump|long jump event]]. At the [[1930 British Empire Games|first British Empire Games]], in 1930, he won the silver medal in both the long jump and triple jump competition.

==Early life==
He was born at [[Portsmouth]], where his father was a marine surveyor. As a boy he saw his father receive a visit from seaman’s representatives after the wreck of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He recollected attending the funeral of [[Florence Nightingale]] with his mother.{{dubious|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the late 1920s he was a doctoral student in [[astrophysics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. A Commonwealth Scholarship in 1930 took him to study astrophysics and [[astronomy]] at [[the University of Michigan|University of Michigan]], and on his return to Cambridge as a fellow to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel]] he worked at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[Lord Rutherford]] and Sir [[J. J. Thomson]]. There were five [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] prizewinners in the department, but Revans found them humble enough to share their puzzlements and to listen, rather than claiming to know and be able to instruct. Revans always remembered [[Albert Einstein]] saying to him: "If you think you understand a problem, make sure you are not deceiving yourself."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article884986.ece ''Times'' obituary&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Revans began to develop his thinking on the role of 'non-expert' in problem solving, distinguishing between [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] in so doing.

He moved into education to become assistant education officer for [[Essex]] (1935–1945) and then director of education for the [[National Coal Board]] from 1945 to 1950.

==Action Learning==
{{main article|Action learning}}
It was at the Coal Board that Revans did much of the early work on developing action learning, working alongside [[E. F. Schumacher]] (author of ''Small is Beautiful'') and [[Eric Trist]], whose theories about socio-technical systems have also had an important influence on organisation development.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He then moved to the [[Acton Society Trust]] where he worked with [[Teddy Chester]]. He and Chester both moved to the [[University of Manchester]] where Revans became the first professor of industrial management (1955–1965) but left to develop the inter-university action learning programme in Belgium.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Revans strongly held that the key to improving performance lay not with 'experts' but with practitioners themselves.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Hence he devised Action Learning as a process whereby the participant studies his own actions and experience in conjunction with others in small groups called action learning sets.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Belgium ==
After resigning from Manchester University, Revans moved to Belgium where he headed the Inter-University project, which had been set up to improve the ranking of Belgium in the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development league. Working with five 
universities and 23 of the country's largest businesses, Revans' collaborative approaches succeeded in raising Belgium's industrial productivity growth rate above that of the USA, Germany and Japan.

Revans was subsequently awarded with the nation's top honour by the King of Belgium.

In 1969, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the [[University of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bath.ac.uk/ceremonies/hongrads/older.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
During the 1970s and 1980s he travelled round the world several times and wrote his most famous books: ''Developing Effective Managers'' (1971); ''The Origins and Growth of Action Learning'' (1982) and ''ABC of Action Learning'' (1983). From the 1980s Revans worked with public and private sector organisations, in the UK and internationally, advocating the process of action learning as a way of enabling and empowering people to learn with and from each other.

In the 1990s he was associated with the City of London where he met Raymond Mahoney and Alan Wenham-Prosser who were using his techniques to solve peoples problems of managing their work load in the City, and other personal problems which had become long term when managing difficult situations.  Reg Revans was made a Freeman of the City of London for the work which he did.

Revans made furniture as a hobby, played the trumpet and painted — even illustrating small books for his children. As well as being knighted by the [[King of Belgium]], in 1997 he was awarded the freedom of the [[City of London]]. Revans died in [[Wem]], [[Shropshire]] on 8 January 2003.

==Legacy==
Revans is not remembered as one of the best known [[guru]]s of [[management]] [[education]] or organisational development, not least because of his scorn for experts and his championing of [[w:John Doe|ordinary people]]. However, his ideas have been taught at the [[Revans Centre for Action Learning and Research]] (later the [[Revans Institute]]), part of the [[Salford Business School]] and they are applied in many organisations. His techniques have been applied in many organisations and by [[Management consulting|management consultant]]s and [[academic]]s including Richard Brimble, Mike Pedler, Alan Mumford and Richard Hale in the UK, and [[Michael Marquardt]], Yury Boshyk, Robert Kramer and Joe Raelin in the United States.

Recently the Revans Centre has moved to [[Manchester Business School]] becoming the [[Revans Academy]].  The [[Revans Collection]] is to be found at Salford University.

'''Samriddhi Foundation''' is an independent economic policy think tank that facilitates a discourse on pragmatic market based solutions for a free and prosperous Nepal. Samriddhi is based in Kathmandu, Nepal. Inspired by the [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|Second People's Movement in Nepal or the Jana Andolan]], it was founded in 2006 and was formally registered in 2007.

For the creation of a prosperous Nepal, Samriddhi believes in the power of private entrepreneurs as key to economic development and engages in fostering democracy and building a more conducive environment for economic growth.

Known for bringing together entrepreneurs, politicians, business leaders, bureaucrats, experts, journalists and other groups and individuals to make an impact on the policy discourse of Nepal, Samriddhi works with a three-tier approach
* Research &amp;  Publication
* Educational &amp; Training
* Advocacy &amp;  Public Outreach
Some of its highly successful efforts include the annual economic policy reform initiative named “[[Nepal Economic Growth Agenda (NEGA)]]”, a sharing platform for entrepreneurs named “[http://samriddhi.org/advocacy-outreach/public-forums-consultations/last-thursdays-with-an-entrepreneur/ Last Thursdays with an entrepreneur]” and a regular discussion forum on contemporary political economic agendas named “Econ-ity”. Samriddhi also hosts the secretariat of ‘[http://livablenepal.org/ Campaign for a Livable Nepal]', popularly known as Gari Khana Deu campaign. One of Samriddhi's award winning programs is a five-day residential workshop on economics and entrepreneurship named [http://samriddhi.org/education-training/entrepreneurship/arthalaya-school-of-economics-entrepreneurship/ Arthalya], which has produced over 400 graduates over the past few years, among which more than two-dozen run their own enterprises now.

Samriddhi was listed in the University of Pennsylvania’s Global GoTo Think Tank Index Report 2015 in multiple categories including the category Best Independent Think Tanks.

==Vision==
Samriddhi, The Prosperity Foundation, envisions a free and prosperous Nepal where individuals can live a dignified life in a vibrant and democratic society with equal access to opportunities and respect for the rule of law.

==Mission==
To promote ideas of freedom- civil, political and economic- through public policy recommendations (based on independent research), educational programs and public participation for a free and prosperous Nepal.

==Objectives==
1.  To conduct research and generate alternative ides on the social, economic and political agendas to throw light upon the contemporary issues of public discourse and come up with policy advocacy documents to bring them into wider rhetoric.

2.    To lobby for and monitor the implementation of basic social, political and economic rights while promoting transparency and advocacy as the basis of a prosperous Nepal.

3.    To educate, train and empower public on active citizenry, ideas of free society and entrepreneurship, and the role they can play at influencing policy level decisions.

4.    To develop a comprehensive resource center for public use (especially for researchers, students and policy makers) focusing on the social, economic and political discourse moving forward at a given time period.

==Programs==
All of Samriddhi’s research and advocacy efforts are focused on

'''A. Enabling market mechanism and entrepreneurship'''

In order to facilitate regulatory reforms such that an ordinary Nepali citizen is able to participate in and reap the benefits of a market economy in order to improve his/her living standards, Samriddhi focuses on the following thematic areas:
* Taxation and Tariff Regimes                            
* Industrial Relations
* Competition Policy and Institutions                 
* Investment Policies and Institutions
* Market entry and exit policies                          
* Contract Enforcement
* Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises               
* Non – formal economy 
'''B. Improving governance'''

Samirddhi realizes that while policies and regulations can change on paper, this may not necessarily translate to changes in the actual environment. One of the major reasons behind this is weak governance. While policies may be framed, the institutional mechanism and the incentive system may not been thought through. This is where Samriddhi sees its role as a policy institute and help in the implementation aspect of reforms. The larger focus in improving governance is to make policies work for Nepal. Samriddhi focuses on the following thematic areas in this regard.
* Federalism                                                                                  
* Public Service Delivery 
* Transparency and Accountability                            
* Incentives 
* Institutions and Structures 
'''C. Fostering values for a free society'''

While policies and regulations can change on paper, this may not necessarily translate to changes in the actual environment. One of the major reasons behind this is weak governance. While policies may be framed, the institutional mechanism and the incentive system may not been thought through. This is where Samriddhi sees its role as a policy institute and help in the implementation aspect of reforms. The larger focus in improving governance is to make policies work for Nepal. Samriddhi focuses on the following thematic areas in this regard.

'''''Selling Blue Elephants: How to Make Great Products That People Want Before They Even Know They Want Them''''' is a book written by [http://www.sellingblueelephants.com/About_us.html Howard Moskowitz] and [http://www.alexgofman.com Alex Gofman] (Publisher: [[Wharton School Publishing]] 2007).

The book outlines a new solution-oriented learning experience co-developed with [[Jerry Wind|Prof. Jerry (Yoram) Wind]] of [[Wharton School of Business]] - [[Rule Developing Experimentation]] (RDE).
 
RDE is the systematized process of designing, testing and modifying alternative ideas, packages, products, or services in a disciplined way so that the developer and marketer discover what appeals to the customer, even if the customer can't articulate the need, much less the solution. The book describes best practices in the RDE from some of today's top companies: [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Prego]], [[Vlasic Pickles|Vlasic]], [[MasterCard]] and others. Filled with real-life stories, this book changes the way people think about selling to their present and future customers.

The book is currently under contracts to be translated and published in Germany, Italy, Spain (both full and digest), [[Japan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Taiwan]] (Chinese Traditional), China (Chinese Simplified), [[South Korea]], Russia, Netherlands, [[Lebanon]], [[Romania]] (both full and digest), [[Thailand]], India, [[Lithuania]] and [[Vietnam]].

'''Shanghaiing''' or '''crimping''' is the practice of [[kidnapping]] people to serve as [[sailor]]s by coercive techniques such as [[trickery]], [[intimidation]], or [[violence]]. Those engaged in this form of kidnapping were known as ''crimps.'' The related term ''[[Impressment|press gang]]'' refers specifically to [[impressment]] practices in Great Britain's [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="1911eb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica:Crimp |year=1911 |publisher=Britannica |edition= 11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Sloop-calley-shipping-articles-1786.jpg|right|thumb|The shipping articles, or contract between the crew and the ship, from a 1786 voyage to Boston.]]
Crimps flourished in port cities like London and Liverpool in England and in [[San Francisco]] in [[California]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]&lt;ref name="Portland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgsmthood.com/shanghai/history.php |title=The Portland Underground: Shanghai Tunnels |author=Michael P.

On the East Coast of the United States, New York easily led the way, followed by Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of crimps and the spread of the practice of shanghaiing resulted from a combination of laws, economic conditions, and the shortage of experienced sailors in England and on the American West Coast in the mid-19th century.

First, once an American sailor signed on board a vessel for a voyage, it was illegal for him to leave the ship before the voyage's end. The penalty was imprisonment, the result of federal legislation enacted in 1790.&lt;ref name="beatl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/maritime/MaritimeNation/TimeLines/Merchant_Marine.htm |title=American Merchant Marine Timeline, 1789–2005 |accessdate=2007-03-29 |work=Barnard's Electronic Archive and Teaching Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609130323/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/maritime/MaritimeNation/TimeLines/Merchant_Marine.htm |archivedate=2007-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This factor was mitigated by the [[Maguire Act of 1895]] and the [[White Act of 1898]], and finally abolished by the [[Seamen's Act|Seamen's Act of 1915]].)

Second, the practice was driven by a shortage of labor, particularly of skilled labor on ships on the West Coast. With crews abandoning ships en masse because of the [[California Gold Rush]], a healthy body on board the ship was a boon.&lt;ref name="poorjack"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hope |first=Ronald | title= Poor Jack: The Perilous History of the Merchant Seaman |year=2001 |publisher= Greenhill Books|location= London|isbn=1-86176-161-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sup1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailors.org/pdf/history1-2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030512184317/http://www.sailors.org/pdf/history1-2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-05-12 |title=The Lookout of the Labor Movement |accessdate=2007-04-02 |work=Sailors Union of the Pacific |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, shanghaiing was made possible by the existence of boarding masters, whose job was to find crews for ships. Boarding masters were paid "by the body," and thus had a strong incentive to place as many seamen on ships as possible.&lt;ref name="poorjack"/&gt; This pay was called "[[Blood money (term)|blood money]]," and was just one of the revenue streams available.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/shanghai/main.html|title=About That Blood in the Scuppers |accessdate=2007-04-03 |author=Georgia Smith |year=1988 |work= Reclaiming San Francisco: History Politics and Culture, a City Lights Anthology |publisher=City Lights |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061011111827/http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/shanghai/main.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors set the stage for the crimp: a boarding master who uses trickery, intimidation, or violence to put a sailor on a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

The most straightforward method for a crimp to shanghai a sailor was to render him unconscious, forge his signature on the ship's articles, and pick up his "blood money." This approach was widely used, but there were more profitable methods.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

In some situations, the boarding master could receive the first two, three, or four months of wages of a man he shipped out.&lt;ref name="poorjack"/&gt; Sailors were able to get an advance against their pay for an upcoming voyage to allow them to purchase clothes and equipment, but the advance wasn't paid directly to the sailor because he could simply abscond with the money. Instead, those to whom money was owed could claim it directly from the ship's captain. An enterprising crimp, already dealing with a seaman, could supplement his income by supplying goods and services to the seaman at an inflated price, and collecting the debt from the sailor's captain.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

Some crimps made as much as $9,500 per year ({{inflation|US|9500|1890|r=-4|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppowerus/ |title=Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-20 |last=Officer |first=Lawrence H. |authorlink= |author2=Williamson, Samuel H. |year=2008 |work=Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to 2007 |publisher=MeasuringWorth.Com |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crimps were well positioned politically to protect their lucrative trade.&lt;ref name="pickel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatwestbooks.com/shapage.htm |author=Bill Pickelhaupt |title=Shanghaied in San Francisco |accessdate=2007-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211180046/http://www.greatwestbooks.com/shapage.htm |archivedate=2006-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The keepers of boardinghouses for sailors supplied men on election day to go from one polling place to another, "[[Vote early and vote often|voting early and often]]" for the candidate who would vote in their interest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} In San Francisco, men such as Joseph "Frenchy" Franklin and George Lewis, long-time crimps, were elected to the California state legislature, an ideal spot to assure that no legislation was passed that would have a negative impact on their business.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Some examples included [[James Kelly (crimper)|Jim "Shanghai" Kelly]] and Johnny "Shanghai Chicken" Devine of San Francisco, and [[Joseph Kelly (crimper)|Joseph "Bunco" Kelly]] of Portland.&lt;ref name="pickel"/&gt; Stories of their ruthlessness are innumerable, and some have survived into print.

Another example of romanticized stories involves the "birthday party" Shanghai Kelly threw for himself, in order to attract enough victims to man a notorious sailing ship named the ''Reefer'' and two other ships.

==Ending the practice==
[[Image:Furuseth-La Follette-Steffens-1915.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|[[Andrew Furuseth]] (left) and [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.|Senator La Follette]] (center) were the architects of the Seamen's Act of 1915.  With [[muckraker]] [[Lincoln Steffens]], circa 1915.]]Demand for manpower to keep ships sailing to [[Alaska]] and the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] kept crimping a real danger into the early 20th century, but the practice was finally ended by a series of legislative reforms that spanned almost 50 years.

Before 1865, maritime labor laws primarily enforced stricter discipline onboard ships.&lt;ref name="bauer283"&gt;Bauer, 1988:283.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after 1865, this began to change.  In 1868, New York State started cracking down on sailors' boardinghouses.  They declined in number from 169 in 1863 to 90 in 1872.&lt;ref name="bauer284"/&gt;  Then in 1871, Congress passed legislation to revoke license of officers guilty of mistreating seamen.&lt;ref name="bauer284"&gt;Bauer, 1988:284.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, Congress passed the [[Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872]] to combat crimps.&lt;ref name="bauer284"/&gt;  Under this act, a sailor had to sign on to a ship in the presence of a federal shipping commissioner.&lt;ref name="bauer284"/&gt;  The presence of a shipping commissioner was intended to ensure the sailor wasn't "forcibly or unknowingly signed on by a crimp."&lt;ref name="bauer284"/&gt;

In 1884, the [[Dingley Act (shipping)|Dingley Act]] came into effect.  This law prohibited the practice of seamen taking advances on wages.&lt;ref name="bauer285"&gt;Bauer, 1988:285.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also limited the making of seamen's allotments to only close relatives.&lt;ref name="bauer285"/&gt;  However, the crimps fought back.  In 1886, a loophole to the Dingley Act was created, allowing boardinghouse keepers to receive seamen's allotments.&lt;ref name="bauer285"/&gt;
{{Slavery}}

The widespread adoption of steampowered vessels in the world's merchant marine services in the late 19th and early 20th centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor greatly diminished (and, by extension, crimping). The [[sinking of the RMS Titanic]], followed by onset of [[World War I]] (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, [[Andrew Furuseth]] and Senator [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]] pushed through the [[Seamen's Act|Seamen's Act of 1915]] that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.

==Verb==
The verb "shanghai" joined the lexicon with "crimping" and "sailor thieves" in the 1850s, possibly because [[Shanghai]] was a common destination of the ships with abducted crews.&lt;ref name="1911eb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=shanghai |title=Shanghai |accessdate=2007-04-05 |work=dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has since expanded to mean "kidnapped" or "induced to do something by means of fraud."&lt;ref&gt;For a modern definition of "shanghaied" see [[wikt:shanghaied]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergh was the director of the [[Labour Movement Archive and Library]] from 1989 to 1999, and was then employed at the Centre for Business History and, later at the Department of Innovation and Economic Organisation of [[BI Norwegian Business School]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Trond Bergh|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|first=|last=|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Trond_Bergh|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the latter work Bergh became involved in a legal case. Former secretary of the [[Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs]] [[Haakon Bingen]] sued Bergh and Eriksen as well as the publishing house Cappelen Akademiske Forlag, because the second volume of ''Den hemmelige krigen'' contained information that portrayed Bingen as a close friend of communist [[Peder Furubotn]]. In late 1999 the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] found that this was not true, and circulation of the book was forbidden, until the reference to Bingen had been amended. Bingen was also entitled to {{NOK|146,975}} of costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bingen vant mot forlag i Høyesterett|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=2 December 1999|page=6|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Bergh's books on Norwegian economic history include ''Vekst og Velstand'' (1977), ''Norge fra u-land til i-land'' (1983) and ''Foredlet virke: Historien om Borregaard 1889–1989'' (with [[Even Lange]], 1989). He also penned ''Storhetstid 1945–1965'', released 1987 as volume five of ''[[Arbeiderbevegelsens historie i Norge]]'', and in 1998 he released the two-volume history on surveillance in Norway, ''Den hemmelige krigen: overvåking i Norge 1914–1997'' about [[surveillance]] together with [[Knut Einar Eriksen]].&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

Bergh has also written volume I of the two-volume series from 2004 on the railway history of Norway, ''Jernbanen i Norge 1854–2004'', the first volume covering the period from 1854 to 1940.&lt;ref name=bergh2004&gt;{{cite book|series=Jernbanen i Norge 1854–2004|title=Nye spor og nye muligheter. 1854–1940|first=Trond|last=Bergh |volume=1|language=Norwegian |location=Bergen|publisher=Vigmostad Bjørke|year=2004 |isbn=82-419-0331-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viktor Tarasovych Plakida''' (born August 2, 1956) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[politician]] and [[businessman]]. Plakida served as the [[Prime Minister of Crimea]], an [[autonomous region]] in southern [[Ukraine]], from 2006 to 2010 (the office of Prime Minister is also known as the Chairman of the Crimean Council of Ministers). He was the [[Representatives of the President of Ukraine]] in [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name=Presrepre/&gt;

==Career==
Plakida served as the chairman of the Crimean Energy System UkrEnergo before becoming Prime Minister of Crimea.&lt;ref name=nrcu&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Crimean parliament approved Viktor Plakida as Chairman of Crimean Council of Ministers with 75 out of 93 votes |url=http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=29391 |work=[[Radio Ukraine]] |publisher=|date=2006-06-02|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2006, the Crimean Council of Ministers and the Crimean parliament removed the government of Crimean Prime Minister [[Anatoliy Burdiuhov]]. Plakida was nominated as the next Prime Minister by the Speaker of the [[Supreme Council of Crimea]], which acts as Crimea's parliament.&lt;ref name=nrcu/&gt; A power struggle ensued between Crimean politicians who were pro-Russian and those loyal to Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yushchenko]].&lt;ref name=uj/&gt; In early May 2006, politicians loyal to Yushchenko joined with four small political parties to create a 76-member majority in the Crimean parliament, which has 100 total members.&lt;ref name=uj/&gt; This majority sought to block any pro-Russian candidates for Prime Minister of Crimea.&lt;ref name=uj/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Ukraine]] requires that the country's president approve of any candidate nominated for Prime Minister of Crimea. [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] gave his approval after negotiations with Crimean political leaders and end the political impasse.&lt;ref name=nrcu/&gt; In exchange for Yushchenko's approval of Plakida's candidacy, the Crimean parliament agreed to changes in the structure and membership of the Crimean Council of Ministers.&lt;ref name=nrcu/&gt; Yushchenko signed off on Plakida's nomination on May 29, 2006.&lt;ref name=uj&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Yushchenko OKs Plakida as new Crimean PM |url=http://www.ukrainianjournal.com/index.php?w=article&amp;id=2665 |work=[[Ukrainian Journal]] |publisher=|date=2006-05-29|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Council of Crimea]] further approved Plakida as Prime Minister on June 2, 2006.&lt;ref name=nrcu/&gt; Plakida received a majority of 75 votes in the parliament out 93 members.&lt;ref name=nrcu/&gt;

Plakida served as Prime Minister until March 2010, when he resigned from office.&lt;ref name=kp&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Crimean parliament dismisses speaker, head of government |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/61899/ |work=[[Kyiv Post]] |publisher=|date=2010-03-17|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crimean parliament voted on March 17, 2010, to accept Plakida's resignation, with 71 members voting to accept his resignation and four voting against.&lt;ref name=kp/&gt; He was succeeded by [[Vasyl Dzharty]].

President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] appointed Plakida as his acting presidential representative in Crimea in October 2010.&lt;ref name=iu&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Yanukovych appoints former Construction Minister Yatsuba as his permanent representative in Crimea|url=http://main.interfax.kiev.ua/eng/main/58100/?PHPSESSID=f1d2cdd0460a3375f5adb55c935742db|work=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|publisher=|date=2011-01-12|accessdate=2011-08-18}}{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Kazarin was never Presidential representative|url=http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=12|work=ForPost|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2016-11-20|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121031123/http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=12|archivedate=2016-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yanukovych dismissed Plakida in January 2011 in favor of [[Volodymyr Yatsuba]], the former Minister of Regional Development and Construction.&lt;ref name=iu/&gt; On 28 February 2012 Yanukovych appointed Plakida as his acting presidential representative in Crimea again.&lt;ref name=Presrepre&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120229054138/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/123312/ Plakida appointed Yanukovych's envoy to Crimea], [[Kyiv Post]] (28 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vivian Murray''' (22 July 1932 – 6 March 2009) was an Irish businessman.  Murray served as the chief executive of the [[Irish Goods Council]] during the 1970s and 1980s, when it launched the "Buy Irish" and "Guaranteed Irish" [[marketing campaign]]s.&lt;ref name=rte&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Businessman Vivian Murray dies at 76
|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0306/murrayv-business.html|work=[[RTÉ]]|publisher=|date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

Murray's first job was at local [[An Post|Irish post office]] in Clonmel following his graduation from high school.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; His other earlier occupations included positions at both [[Kelly and Shiel]] and [[Remington Rand]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt;
Murray also became the chairman of both [[An Post]] and [[Bord Iascaigh Mhara]] later in his career.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt;

==Personal life==
Murray was born on 22 July 1932, in [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]] to parents, Jeremiah Murray and Mai Lynch Murray.&lt;ref name=it&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Goods Council chief executive who created Buy Irish scheme|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2009/0314/1224242845920.html|work=[[Irish Times]]|publisher=|date=14 March 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of six children in his family.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray attended the [[CBS High School Clonmel|Christian Brothers High School]] in his native Clonmel.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

He married Nancy Clear and was father to [[John Murray (Irish broadcaster)|John Murray]], an Irish [[business journalist]] and broadcaster for the [[RTÉ]] business division and a ''[[Morning Ireland]]'' presenter.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt; Vivian and Nancy had six children during their marriage.

==Irish Goods Council==
{{see also|Guaranteed Irish}}
Murray's career began to take off when he was appointed general manager at the Irish National Development Association.  The organisation would later be renamed the Irish Goods Council and was funded by the Irish government.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Under Murray, the Irish Goods Council would be known as a champion of Irish products, sold both domestically and abroad.

He became widely known for his launch of the "Guaranteed Irish" and "Buy Irish" marketing and [[advertising campaign]]s of the 1970s and 1980s, which were aimed at Irish consumers.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt; Murray's "Buy Irish" was based on his own beliefs that quality was more important in Irish products than merely purchasing an item because it was made in Ireland.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; He also believed that the Buy Irish campaign, as it came to be called, should focus on the Irish consumer market.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray also felt that low quality products should not be supported by the "Buy Irish" campaign.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;
Murray felt that [[free trade]] was important, but did not want the "Buy Irish" campaign to heavily emphasise exports, which he believed was detrimental to the domestic Irish manufacturing and consumer markets.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; However, he was also strongly against any intrusion by Irish protectionists into the marketing campaign.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Th campaign was credited with saving thousands of domestic manufacturing jobs, especially for younger people.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; He explained his goals for the Irish Goods Council and its "Buy Irish" campaign in 1980 saying, "What the Irish Goods Council does is to create the selling environment, develop new patterns of [[consumer behavior|consumer desire]], build up [[Social capital|goodwill]] and favourable attitudes. These attitudes must then be exploited by the manufacturer."&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray's success at the Irish Goods Council was widely noted. He and his colleagues at the Council were praised by then [[Seanad Éireann|Senator]] [[Mary Harney]] during a 1980 [[political debate]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt; However, success ended during the 1980s. The "Guaranteed Irish" [[promotional campaign]] was founded to be in violation of the [[European Union]]'s [[Treaty of Rome]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt; As a result, the Irish government soon cut its state funding for the campaign. Murray left the Irish Goods Council in 1989.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; However, he was still named the Small Firms' Association Business Person of the Year in 1989, the same year he left the Irish Goods Council.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

==Other positions==
Murray simultaneously appointed the chairman of the [[Bord Iascaigh Mhara]] in 1981 while still heading the Irish Goods Council.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; He stayed on as chairman of Bord Iascaigh Mhara for two terms.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

He next became the chairman of [[An Post]] in 1990 following his departure from the Irish Goods Council and was credited with returning the Irish postal system to [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] during his tenure.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray also joined the Gray-Murray [[consulting firm]], which is now known as Indecon.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

==Later life==
Vivian Murray fully retired from the business world during the middle of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; However, he continued to remain active in other causes and foundations. For example, he collaborated closely with [[Roman Catholic]] Father [[James McDyer]] in [[Glencolumcille]], [[County Donegal]], to establish projects to promote [[Irish culture]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt;
He was appointed to the [[board of trustees]] of the [[Louvain Institute]] for Ireland in Europe. The Louvain Institute, which was created to promote Ireland and its cultural heritage in the European Union, is headquartered at the [[Irish College]] in [[Leuven]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray was later awarded a fellowship by the institute.

Murray's had other very wide ranging life accomplishments and community involvements. He was appointed as a member of the first [[Independent Radio and Television Commission]].&lt;ref name=rte/&gt; Murray served as a former director of the former [[LSB College]], which has since become part of the [[Dublin Business School]]. He was also an active member of the [[The Priory Institute|Priory Institute]], which is part of the St Mary's Dominican Priory in [[Tallaght]], [[County Dublin]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

Vivian Murray died in [[Dublin]] on 6 March 2008, at the age of 76 after a long illness.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt; Murray was survived by his wife, Nancy (née Clear), and six children – daughters Mary, Anne, Bernie and Madeleine and sons, Dermot and John.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt;

'''Willy Naessens''' is a well known industrialist in [[Belgium]]. Born around [[World War II]] in [[Wortegem-Petegem]] (between [[Oudenaarde]] and [[Ghent]]), [[East Flanders]], Naessens grew up in a modest family.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

At young age, he started a construction business called "Naessens Constructions", specializing in constructing big - but rather economised - industrial buildings and swimming pools. He became one of the most powerful Belgian industrialists. Nowadays, his corporate group participates in many branches of the construction sector, and in non-construction businesses, such as restaurants and sports-teams.
Nevertheless, he always gave a share to charity. For instance, he became very popular by paying a very expensive organ transplantation for a Belgian child. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Win–loss analytics''' involves identifying and analyzing the reasons why a visitor to a website was or wasn't persuaded to engage in a desired action ([[conversion (marketing)|conversion]]).

This information allows web teams to improve the website's navigation and content, identify individuals that are more likely to convert, to improve marketing efforts.

== History==
Determining why one person engaged in a desired action and another did not has long been a topic of interest in sales, where measurement of conversion has always been possible through sales data &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dvir|first=Nim|last2=Gafni|first2=Ruti|date=2018|title=When Less Is More: Empirical Study of the Relation Between Consumer Behavior and Information Provision on Commercial Landing Pages|url=https://www.informingscience.org/Publications/4015|journal=Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline|language=en|volume=21|pages=019–039|doi=10.28945/4015|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In contrast, [[marketing]] has been mostly concerned with targeting with the masses, and the results of marketing have traditionally been more difficult to accurately measure. With the internet, it is much easier for marketers to collect data for analysis and evaluation in order to understand and demonstrate the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of their efforts and to make changes to improve them. Thus yielding the best result of a specific marketing campaign. This is the Win-Loss analytics.

== Win-loss analytics vs. web analytics ==
[[Web analytics]] tools have existed since the early days of the [[internet]] and are now ubiquitous.  These tools provide a bird's eye view of a [[website traffic|website's traffic]].  The information that is gathered allows webmasters to make informed decisions about making changes in order to improve a website.

Win–loss analytics tools track the individual perspectives of each visitor, uncovering who the visitor was, what products they were qualified for, how well they were persuaded, and why they did or didn't convert.

Win Loss programs typically focus on different elements of the buying process, including gathering buyer feedback on the solution being sold (whether it's a product or service), the buyer's perception of the effectiveness of the sales representative or sales team, buyer perceptions of the selling vendor overall (such as the firm's reputation or its long-term financial viability), and price. These categories can be broken down into greater detail for more refined feedback. For example, questions about the product or service might include the intuitiveness of the user interface or the effectiveness of specific features or functionality.
