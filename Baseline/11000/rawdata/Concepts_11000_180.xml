It has most commonly been used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.

Violence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, intimidation, impersonation, disinformation, and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Violence in [[labor unrest|labor disputes]] may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 318&lt;/ref&gt; for example the hiring and deployment of [[goon squad]]s to intimidate, threaten or even assault strikers.

== History ==

[[Image:Frank-little-d-1917.jpg|thumb|150px|Union organizer [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]] was pulled from his bed and lynched in 1917 because of his union activities]]

Historically, violence against unions has included attacks by detective and guard agencies, such as the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]], [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency|Baldwin Felts]], [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns]], or [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel]] detective agencies; citizens groups, such as the [[Citizens' Alliance]]; company guards; police; national guard; or even the military. In particular, there are few curbs on what detective agencies are able to get away with.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''From Blackjacks To Briefcases'', Robert Michael Smith states that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, anti-union agencies spawned violence and wreaked havoc on the labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; One investigator who participated in a [[Commission on Industrial Relations|congressional inquiry into industrial violence]] in 1916 concluded that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Espionage is closely related to violence. Sometimes it is the direct cause of violence, and, where that cannot be charged, it is often the indirect cause. If the [[Labor spies|secret agents of employers]], working as members of the labor unions, do not always investigate acts of violence, they frequently encourage them. If they did not, they would not be performing the duties for which they are paid, for they are hired on the theory that labor organizations are criminal in character.&lt;ref&gt;William White, The New republic, Volume 26, Republic Pub. Co., 1921, page 129, quoting Luke Grant&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In U.S. Senate testimony in 1936 about an employer who wanted to contract with the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton agency]]. Known personally to the author of the book ''The Pinkerton Story'', this employer was characterized as a "sincerely upright and Godly man." Yet Pinkerton files record that the employer wanted the agency "to send in some thugs who could beat up the strikers."&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Story, James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett, 1951, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the Pinkerton agency changed its focus from strike-breaking to undercover services.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 75, quoting ''Strikebreaking Services'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkerton declined the request from this employer.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Story, James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett, 1951, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Morris Friedman]], detective agencies were themselves for-profit companies, and a "bitter struggle" between capital and labor could be counted upon to create "satisfaction and immense profit" for agencies such as the Pinkerton company.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Such agencies were in the perfect position to fan suspicion and mistrust "into flames of blind and furious hatred" on the part of the companies.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agencies sell tactics including violence===

Harry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how one of the largest union busters in the United States, [[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], had a sales pitch offering the use of provocation and violence. The agency would routinely tell employers — prospective clients — of the methods used by their undercover operatives,&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once the union is in the field its members can keep it from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set far apart. A contract can at once be entered into with the employer, covering a long period, and made very easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Different types of violence===

[[Image:Lattimer massacre.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Striking Pennsylvania mine workers began their protest march near Harwood. [[Lattimer massacre|Many would soon be killed by the Luzerne County sheriff.]]]]Some anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing [[Anna LoPizzo]].&lt;ref&gt;William Dudley Haywood, Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the [[Frank Little (unionist)|hanging of union organizer Frank Little]] from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]]. A note was pinned to his body which said, "Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the "L" for Frank Little circled.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the [[Anaconda Road Massacre]]. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ludlow Death Car.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Machine gun equipped armored car built with steel from [[CF&amp;I|CF&amp;I's Pueblo steel works]], known to the striking miners as the ''Death Special''. "The machine gun was turned on striking miners and used to riddle the Forbes tent colony."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;]]The unprovoked attack was similar to another event, which had occurred twenty-three years earlier in Pennsylvania. During the [[Lattimer massacre]], nineteen unarmed immigrant coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine near [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]], on September 10, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John W. ''Transitions: From Eastern Europe to Anthracite Community to College Classroom.'' Bloomington, Ind.: iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-33732-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William. ''Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth.'' State College, Penn.: Penn State Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-271-02214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miners, mostly of [[Poles|Polish]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] and [[Germans|German]] ethnicity, were shot and killed by a [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County]] sheriff's [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]]. In this group as well, all of the miners had been shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Ronald L. Welsh Americans: A History of Assimilation in the Coalfields. Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Michael. Unmeltable Ethnics: Politics and Culture in American Life. 2d ed. New York: Transaction Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting followed a brief tussle over the American flag carried by the miners. Their only crime was asserting their right to march in the face of demands that they disperse.

In 1927, during a coal strike in [[Colorado]], state police and mine guards fired pistols, rifles and a machine gun into a group of five hundred striking miners and their wives in what came to be called the [[Columbine Mine massacre|Columbine Mine Massacre]]. In this incident as well, many of the miners were immigrants, and there had been a disagreement over the question of trespassing onto company property in the town of [[Serene, Colorado|Serene]], with the miners asserting it was public property because of the post office. There was, once again, a tussle over American flags carried by the strikers.

While the Columbine mine shooting was a surprise, newspapers played a deadly role in conjuring the atmosphere of hate in which  the violence occurred. Lurid editorials attacked the ethnicity of the strikers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, The Columbine Mine Massacre, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, pages 135-136&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers began calling for the governor to no longer withhold the "mailed fist", to strike hard and strike swiftly,&lt;ref&gt;''Denver Morning Post'' editorial, November 2, 1927, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; and for "Machine Guns Manned By Willing Shooters" at more of the state's coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Boulder Daily Camera, November 17, 1927, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of these editorials, state police and mine guards fired on the miners and their wives, injuring dozens and killing six.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, The Columbine Mine Massacre, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, pages 138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

In all of the above incidents, the perpetrators were never caught, or went unpunished. An exception resulted from a shooting of strikers at the Williams &amp; Clark Fertilizing Company near the Liebig Fertilizer Works at [[Carteret, New Jersey]] in 1915. One striker was killed outright, and more than twenty were injured in an unprovoked attack when deputies fired on strikers who had stopped a train to check for strikebreakers. The strikers found no strikebreakers, and were cheering as they exited the train. Forty deputies approached and suddenly fired on them with revolvers, rifles, and shotguns. As the strikers ran, "the deputies ... pursued, firing again and again."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "1 KILLED, 20 SHOT BY STRIKE GUARDS; Deputies Drive Off Laborers at the Liebig Fertilizer Works in Carteret, N.J.", January 20, 1915, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to attending physicians, all the strikers' wounds were on the backs or legs, indicating the guards were pursuing them.&lt;ref&gt;The Survey, January 30, 1915, page 458&lt;/ref&gt; A local government official who witnessed the shooting called it entirely unprovoked.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "1 KILLED, 20 SHOT BY STRIKE GUARDS; Deputies Drive Off Laborers at the Liebig Fertilizer Works in Carteret, N.J.", January 20, 1915, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Four more of the strikers, all critically injured, would die. Twenty-two of the guards were arrested and the crime was investigated by a Grand Jury; nine deputies were subsequently convicted of manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". At the Forbes tent colony,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes..."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After deaths of women and children at Ludlow,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he backlash was vicious and bloody. Over the next ten days striking miners poured out their rage in attacks across the coalfields...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The U.S. Army was called upon to put an end to the violence, and the strike sputtered to an end that December.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, pages 3,212&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be devious and subtle, as when [[union busting]] specialist Martin Jay Levitt assigned confederates to scratch up cars in the parking lot of a nursing home during an organizing drive, and then blamed it on the union as part of an anti-union campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a result of Operative Smith's "clever and intelligent" work, a number of union organizers received severe beatings at the hands of unknown masked men, presumably in the employ of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Friedman offers examples of these incidents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
About February 13, 1904, William Farley, of Alabama, a member of the [UMWA] National Executive Board ... and the personal representative of [UMWA] [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|President Mitchell]] ... addressed coal miners' meetings ... [on their return trip] eight masked men held them up with revolvers, dragged them from their wagon, threw them to the ground, beat them, kicked them, and almost knocked them into insensibility.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Saturday, April 30, 1904, W.M. Wardjon, a national organizer of the United Mine Workers, while on board a train en route to [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], was assaulted by three men at [[Sargents, Colorado|Sargents]], about thirty miles west of [[Salida, Colorado|Salida]]. Mr. Wardjon was beaten into unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Morris Friedman accused the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|Colorado Fuel and Iron Company]] (CF&amp;I), operated by [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his lieutenant in Colorado, Jesse Welborn, of responsibility for the beatings during the 1903-04 strike.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by [[Victor G. Reuther|Victor Reuther]] and others in 1937, "[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized [[tear gas]] attacks and mounted charges."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Lichtenstein, Walter Reuther: the most dangerous man in Detroit, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colorado labor war, 1903-1904 ===
[[Image:Gen sherman bell.jpg|left|thumb|140px|General Sherman Bell. Photo from [[The Pinkerton Labor Spy]], published in 1907.]][[Image:Karl linderfelt.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Karl Linderfelt, center. Photo caption reads: "OFFICERS OF THE COLORADO NATIONAL GUARD From left to right: Captain R. J. Linderfelt, Lieut. T. C. Linderfelt, Lieut. K. E. Linderfelt, (who faced the charge of assault upon Louis Tikas, the dead strike leader), Lieut. G.S. Lawrence and Major Patrick Hamrock. The last three were in the Ludlow battle of April 20, 1914."]]A study of industrial violence in 1969 concluded, "There is no episode in American labor history in which violence was as systematically used by employers as in the [[Colorado Labor Wars|Colorado labor war of 1903 and 1904]]."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

About the middle of February, 1904, leadership of the Colorado National Guard became concerned that the Mine Owners were failing to cover the payroll of the soldiers. General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to take another soldier he could trust to "hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine" in order to convince the mine owners to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of the secrecy was, the incident would then be blamed on the union.

However, Major Ellison reported that the miners took a route out of the mine that would not make ambush possible. Reardon ordered Ellison to pursue an alternative plan, which was shooting up one of the mines. Major Ellison and Sergeant Gordon Walter fired sixty shots into two mine buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; The plan worked, and the mine owners paid up. Ellison would later testify (in October 1904) that General Reardon informed him 
Adjutant General Sherman Bell and [[James Hamilton Peabody|Colorado Governor James Peabody]] knew about the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; Major Ellison's testimony about the shooting plot, and about the staged attacks on striking miners, was corroborated by two other soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludlow massacre, 1914===
Professor James H. Brewster, a faculty attorney with the [[University of Colorado]] who was investigating the strike for [[Elias M. Ammons|Governor Ammons]], was aware that militia Lieutenant [[Karl Linderfelt]] was guilty of abuse and beatings of innocent citizens, including a small Greek boy "whose head was split open".&lt;ref&gt;Industrial relations, Final Report and Testimony Submitted to Congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations, Volume 7, 1916, pages 6632-6668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, Dana Frank, Robin D. G. Kelley, Three Strikes: Miners, Musicians, Salesgirls, and the Fighting Spirit of Labor's Last Century, Beacon Press, 2002, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Brewster sent a telegram to Governor Ammons requesting Linderfelt's removal. No action was taken. In a subsequent face to face meeting with the governor, three months prior to the Ludlow Massacre, Brewster again insisted that Linderfelt be removed, but again, Ammons declined. In later testimony, Professor Brewster stated that Linderfelt was the reason for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial relations, Final Report and Testimony Submitted to Congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations, Volume 7, 1916, pages 6632-6668&lt;/ref&gt; On the day that the [[Ludlow Massacre]] occurred, Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt, commander of one of two companies of the Colorado National Guard, had [[Louis Tikas]], leader of the Ludlow tent colony of striking miners, at gunpoint. Tikas was unarmed, and the miners would later explain that he approached the militia to ask them to stop shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Zeese Papanikolas, Buried Unsung, Louis Tikas and the Ludlow Massacre, University of Nebraska Press, 1982, page 226&lt;/ref&gt; While two militiamen held Tikas, Linderfelt broke a rifle butt over his head. Tikas and two other captured miners were later found shot dead. Tikas had been shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Thomas G., Killing for Coal: America's Deadliest Labor War (Harvard UP, 2008) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies lay along the Colorado and Southern railroad tracks for three days in full view of passing trains. The militia officers refused to allow them to be moved until a local of a railway union demanded the bodies be taken away for burial. A court martial found Lieutenant Linderfelt guilty of assaulting Tikas with a Springfield rifle, "but attaches no criminality thereto. And the court does therefor acquit him."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, Dana Frank, Robin D. G. Kelley, Three Strikes: Miners, Musicians, Salesgirls, and the Fighting Spirit of Labor's Last Century, Beacon Press, 2002, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1916 Congressional investigation===

In 1916, the [[Commission on Industrial Relations]], created by the [[U.S. Congress]], issued a final report on its investigation of industrial unrest. On the question of violence in industrial disputes, the Commission stated, in part,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many instances of the use of physical force by the agents of employers have ... come before the Commission, indicating a relatively wide use, particularly in isolated communities.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Patrick Walsh, Basil M. Manly, John Rogers Commons, Final report of the Commission on industrial relations, United States. Commission on Industrial Relations, Barnard &amp; Miller print, 1915, pages 139-142&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Late 20th century anti-union violence==

By the early 1900s, public tolerance for violence during labor disputes began to decrease. Yet violence involving strikebreaking troops and armed guards continued into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi. The new methods were still effective at controlling, or reducing, unions.&lt;/ref&gt; The level of violence that anti-union agencies engaged in eventually resulted in their tactics becoming increasingly public, for there were a very great number of newspaper and muckraking articles written about such incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, pp. xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Resources that once were allocated to overt control over workforces began to be assigned to other methods of control, such as industrial espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, the public no longer considered companies unassailable.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet legislation related to employer strategies such as violent strike breaking would have to wait until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, employers began to embrace new methods of managing workers and unions which were still effective, but much more subtle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, and noted that attacks on strikers by company guards had all but disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence still occurs in labor disputes, for example, when one side miscalculates. Bringing in outside security forces, as one example, can lead to violence in modern labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of cameras and camcorders may affect levels of violence in labor disputes today.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples since 1940 ===

*[[Victor Reuther]], a leader of the [[United Auto Workers]] in [[Detroit]], survived an assassination attempt in 1949, with the loss of his right eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/05/us/victor-reuther-influential-labor-leader-dies-at-92.html|title=Victor Reuther, Influential Labor Leader, Dies at 92|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=2004-06-05|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats ===

Sometimes, threats of violence cause damage to union members or supporters. Other times, threats against unions or their members may backfire. For example, Indiana Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Cox was fired after suggesting that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker should use live ammunition against pro-union protesters involved in the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]]. More recently, a Deputy Prosecutor in Indiana's Johnson County, Carlos Lam, suggested that Governor Walker should mount a "[[false flag]]" operation which would make it ''appear'' as if the union was committing violence. After initially claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam admitted to sending the suggestion and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, American Bar Association Journal, posted Mar 25, 2011, http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/a_second_indiana_prosecutor_is_out_of_a_job_for_unusual_advice_to_wisconsin/ retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, posted March 25, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |df= }} retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cullen Werwie, press secretary for Governor Walker, states that Walker's office was unaware of Lam's email. According to CBS News, Werwie also commented, "Certainly we do not support the actions suggested in (the) email. Governor Walker has said time and again that the protesters have every right to have their voice heard, and for the most part the protests have been peaceful. We are hopeful that the tradition will continue."&lt;ref&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, American Bar Association Journal, posted Mar 25, 2011, http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/a_second_indiana_prosecutor_is_out_of_a_job_for_unusual_advice_to_wisconsin/ retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, posted March 25, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |df= }} retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arborloo-en.svg|thumb|Steps of usage of the arborloo.]]
[[File:Arborloo (5567538554).jpg|thumb|Arborloo in [[Ekwendeni]], [[Malawi]]]]
An '''arborloo''' is a simple type of [[composting toilet]] in which [[feces]] are collected in a shallow pit and a [[Fruit tree|fruiting tree]] is later planted in the fertile soil of the full pit. Arborloos have a pit like a [[pit latrine]] but less deep, a concrete slab, superstructure (toilet house or [[outhouse]]) to provide privacy and possibly a ring beam to protect the pit from collapsing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecosanres.org/toilets_that_make_compost.htm|title=Toilets That Make Compost|website=www.ecosanres.org|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arborloo works by temporarily putting the slab and superstructure above a shallow pit while this pit fills. When the pit is nearly full, the superstructure and slab is moved to a newly dug pit and the old pit is covered with the earth got by digging the new pit and left to compost. The old pit serves as a bed for a fruit tree or some other useful vegetation, which is preferably planted during the rainy season.&lt;ref name="Morgan 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Peter|title=Toilets that make compost: Low-cost, sanitary toilets that produce valuable compost for crops in an African context|year=2007|publisher=EcoSanRes Programme|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-9-197-60222-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arborloo is a type of [[dry toilet]]. In using the nutrient-rich soil of a retired pit, the arborloo, in effect, treats feces as a resource rather than a waste product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecological Sanitation|last=Winblad|first=Uno (et al.)|publisher=Ecosanres Program of the Stockholm Environment Institute|year=2004|isbn=|location=http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/Ecological_Sanitation_2004.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production. 35p|last=Jönsson et al.|first=|publisher=Ecosanres Program of the Stockholm Environment Institute|year=2004|isbn=|location=http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/ESR_Publications_2004/ESR2web.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arborloos are used in rural areas of many [[developing countries]], for example in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Dunedin recycling bins 2008.jpg|thumb|Blue box recycling bins]]

The '''blue box recycling system''' (BBRS) was initially a [[waste management]] system used by [[Canada|Canadian]] municipalities to collect source separated [[Municipal solid waste|household waste]] materials for the purpose of recycling. The first full-scale community wide BBRS was implemented in 1983 by the waste management contractor Ontario Total Recycling Systems Ltd. (a subsidiary of [[Laidlaw]] Waste Systems) for the [[Kitchener, Ontario|City of Kitchener]], Ontario. The blue box recycling system was implemented as part of the city's waste management procedures. The blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.

==Overview==
Today, many municipalities operate blue box programs that accept all forms of paper materials, most plastic packaging, glass containers, [[aluminum can]]s and [[Tin can|steel cans]]. For example, the City of Greater Napanee accepts:
* [[Glass Bottles|Glass bottles]] and jars, including all glass containers which previously contained a food or beverage product.
* Metal food and beverage cans, including all hard shell steel or [[aluminum]] containers which previously contained a food or beverage product.
* [[Aluminium foil|Aluminum foil]], meaning food wrap, food packaging and kitchenware such as pie plates made from a thin sheet of aluminum.
* Rigid-shell plastic containers, including [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PETE#I), high-density polyethylene (HDPE #2), [[low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE #4), polypropylene (PP #5) and polystyrene (PS #6), which previously contained a non-hazardous [[consumer product]].
* Rigid foam plastic containers.
* Newspapers, magazines, flyers and household papers.
* Old boxboard and old cardboard (non-waxed, flattened &amp; bundled no larger than 30"x30"x8").
* Bundled [[plastic bag]]s (LDPE).
* Other material as designated by the town from time to time.

The municipality provides the blue boxes to residents in areas serviced by the recycling program. This usually includes all [[single-family home]]s and townhouse units receiving [[Waste collection|garbage collection]]. Tenants of [[apartment building]]s typically do not use blue boxes but rather deposit their household recyclable materials in larger containers made available.

==History==

===Early stages===
An organization called Pollution Probe was formed in 1969 by students and faculty at the [[University of Toronto]] and in 1971, members published a report stressing the need for recycling. Also in 1971, the Canadian Federal Government first established a national Department of the Environment, known as [[Environment Canada]], with Environmental protection as one of its priorities. The Ontario government followed suit with a Ministry of the Environment in 1972.

Jack McGinnis of Toronto helped form a community-based non-profit organization called "Is Five" Foundation in 1974. Named for a book of poetry by [[e.e. cummings]], Is Five organized Canada’s first multi-material curbside pickup of recyclable material for 80,000 households of [[The Beaches]] neighbourhood of east [[Toronto]]. In 1977, Jack McGinnis and Derek Stephenson created a private consulting company, Resource Integration Systems (RIS) to advise governments in the field of recycling and waste management.

That same year, in response to the [[1973 energy crisis]], Rick Findlay was hired by Environment Canada’s Federal Facilities Program to develop and coordinate a resource conservation program primarily for federal government facilities in Ontario. The program was expected to improve environmental quality and reduce energy demand. The Federal Facilities Program sought advice on a recycling pilot program for [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]] and eventually made contact with RIS. RIS experimented with a variety of techniques to improve the performance recycling and found that participation rates were significantly higher when residents could simply drop their recycling in a plastic box. Initially, the project at CFB Borden used milk crates borrowed from a local grocery store. Participation was likely encouraged by a standing order from the Base Commander to recycle.

Meanwhile, a student and a volunteer at a [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]/[[Waterloo, Ontario]] office of Pollution Probe, Eric Hellman organized "Garbage Fest 77" in Kitchener to raise awareness about the consequences of garbage production. McGinnis was invited to speak about his experiences with the CFB Borden program. Hellman also requested a representative from Superior Sanitation (later to be Laidlaw Waste Systems Ltd), the local garbage collection contractor, and an employee named Nyle Ludolph attended Garbage Fest. After meeting McGinnis at the festival, Ludolph became an enthusiastic recycler at his own home and helped increase Laidlaw’s presence in recycling. Nyle managed "Total Recycling Systems", a subsidiary of Superior Sanitation/Laidlaw.

In 1978, Jack McGinnis and Eric Hellman and others met in the basement of the Trinity United Church on Yonge Street in Toronto and created the Recycling Council of Ontario.

===Implementation===
In 1981, after close cooperation with Nyle Ludolph, RIS submitted a proposal to Laidlaw to collect and recycle materials at the curbside for a pilot project in Kitchener, Ontario. Lillian and Ken Croal of Kitchener were the first to use and receive a blue box.  RIS designed the program, and Total Recycling had the responsibility to handle all operations. The Kitchener project included 1,500 households and was tested with four different approaches to recycling:
* Curbside pick-up without providing blue boxes;
* Curbside pick-up with blue boxes;
* Curbside pick-up with blue boxes, including knocking on doors to inform residents; and,
* Composting with composters provided by Laidlaw, free of charge.

The blue box recycling system was proposed to be included as an included “extra” to the regular waste management contract. Laidlaw was successful in obtaining the waste management contract for Kitchener, and the blue box system had its commercial launch. RIS came up with the slogan “We Recycle”, which was applied to every box that went out in Kitchener. Various reasons why the boxes were coloured blue, as opposed to some other colour have been posited: the facts are that RIS felt they looked best and were most visible in blue. It was also a colour that was suitable in terms of withstanding damage from ultraviolet light.

The four recycling approaches were monitored by RIS for one year and the blue box was decided as the most effective. The “test project” continued to run however, and people who did not have the blue boxes began requesting them. Laidlaw received many letters from residents expressing support for the program and for it to continue. The blue box program was implemented citywide in 1983, with Laidlaw providing the extra investment in additional boxes and trucks and handling equipment even though it was not required by their waste management contract with the City. Participation rates ran at 85 percent, and the program was regarded as a success.

In 1984 the Citywide contract for Kitchener went out to public bid, as previously scheduled. City staff simply followed previous procedures – i.e., no specific requirement to offer recycling services was included in bid documents. Laidlaw chose to submit a bid that included continuation of the blue box service while their competitors, mainly large US-based firms, did not. One such competitor submitted a bid that was about $400,000 lower than the one from Laidlaw. The Council meeting where the decision was made was filled with local citizens, especially students, asking their City to support the blue box. The City did, voting to take the blue box bid, not the low bid.

In 1985, Laidlaw won the bid for recycling in the City of Mississauga and introduced the second commercial blue box program in Ontario in June 1986, the largest recycling effort in North America.

Between 1997 and 1999, Laidlaw, Inc. exited the solid waste business after incurring heavy losses through its investments in [[Safety-Kleen]] and Greyhound Lines. After almost 20 years of expansion, Laidlaw Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2001.
 
Currently in Ontario, Canada industry compensates municipalities for approximately 50% of the net costs to operate the blue box program.&lt;ref name=Mueller2013/&gt;

The blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.

Character Assassination in Cuba |publisher=Eriginal Books |location=Miami |year=2012 |page=12 |isbn=978-1-61370-974-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents of character assassinations employ a mix of open and covert methods to achieve their goals, such as raising [[false accusations]], planting and fostering rumours, and manipulating information.

Character assassination is an attempt to tarnish a person's reputation. It may involve [[exaggeration]], misleading [[half-truth]]s, or manipulation of facts to present an untrue picture of the targeted person. It is a form of [[defamation]] and can be a form of ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument.

For living individuals targeted by character assassination attempts, this may result in being rejected by their [[community]], [[family]], or members of their living or work environment. Such acts are often difficult to reverse or rectify, and the process is likened to a literal [[assassination]] of a human life. The damage sustained can last a lifetime or, for historical figures, for many centuries after their death.

The phrase "character assassination" became popular from around 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=character+assassination&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4;,character+assassination;,c0;,s0;;character+assassination;,c0;;Character+assassination;,c0;;Character+Assassination;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|author=|date=|website=books.google.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first mentions of the phrasing in literature is dated 1950 in the collection of essays by Jerome Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com.ua/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2699&amp;context=uclrev|title=Review of Character Assassination by Jerome Davis|last=Bettelheim|first=Bruno|publisher=|year=1951|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
In practice, character assassination may involve [[doublespeak]], spreading of [[rumour]]s, [[innuendo]] or deliberate [[misinformation]] on topics relating to the subject's morals, integrity, and reputation.  It may involve [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] information that is technically true, but that is presented in a misleading manner or is presented without the necessary context.  For example, it might be said that a person refused to pay any [[income tax]] during a specific year, without saying that no tax was actually owed due to the person having no income that year, or that a person was sacked from a firm, even though he may have been made redundant through no fault of his own, rather than being terminated for cause.

Others define character assassination as the deliberate destruction of an individual's reputation, which does not include social groups or institutions. It is important to distinguish between character attacks and character assassination. Character attacks are assaults aimed at a particular individual—as opposed to attacks aimed at certain groups, movements, or nationalities, such as happen in the construction of enemy images.&lt;ref name="IcksShiraev2014"&gt;Martijn Icks &amp; Eric Shiraev (eds.), Character Assassination throughout the Ages (2014). New York: Palgrave and Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;
If they succeed in destroying their victim's reputation, we speak of successful attacks and character assassination. However, attacks can also fail.

Three features of character attacks are important to understand.&lt;ref name="IcksShiraev2014"/&gt; First, their intention: character attacks are by definition deliberate. Second, the public nature of the attacks: private insults do not lead to reputation damage. And third, the importance of the public perception of the attacks, which means that the truth of allegations is irrelevant.

== Narcissism ==
{{Main|Narcissism}}
According to Thomas, character assassination is an intentional attempt, usually by a narcissist and/or his or her [[codependents]], to [[Social influence|influence]] the portrayal or reputation of someone in such a way as to cause others to develop an extremely negative or unappealing perception of him or her. It typically involves deliberate exaggeration or [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] of facts, the spreading of rumours and deliberate misinformation to present an untrue picture of the targeted person, and unwarranted and excessive criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thomas | first = D | title = Narcissism: Behind the Mask | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychopathy in the workplace ==
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In phase four (confrontation), the psychopath will use techniques of character assassination to maintain their agenda.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
In politics, character assassination is a form of [[negative campaigning]]. [[Opposition research]] is the practice of collecting information on someone that can be used to discredit them. A [[smear campaign]] is the use of falsehoods or distortions. [[Scandalmongering]] can be used to associate a person with a negative event in a false or exaggerated way.

Perhaps the most common form of character assassination is the spread of allegations that a candidate is a liar. Other common themes may include allegations that the candidate is a bad or unpopular member of his family, has a bad relationship with his spouse or children or is not respected by his colleagues.  Another theme claims that the person routinely engages in disturbing, socially unacceptable behavior, such as [[sexual deviancy]]. The person may also be portrayed as holding beliefs widely considered despicable within society, such as supporting [[racism]] or other forms of [[bigotry]].

Charging an opponent with character assassination may have political benefits.  In the [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|hearings for Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States]], supporters claimed that both [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Anita Hill]] were victims of character assassination.&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-90751-9"&gt;{{cite book

The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination (ISSCA) specialises in the academic study and research of how character attacks and assassinations have been executed in both history and during contemporary times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://characterattack.files.wordpress.com/|title=Character Assassination|author=|date=|website=Character Assassination|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Character attacks come in three categories. The first is attacks between equals. These often happen in democracies, especially during elections. The second is top-down attacks, or authoritarian regimes cracking down on individuals.&lt;ref name="IcksShiraev2014"/&gt; Examples include:

* Luther slandered by the Catholic Church during the Reformation
* The {{ill|Gao-Rao affair|zh|高岗饶漱石事件}} in Communist China
* Vaclav Havel slandered in Communist Czechoslovakia

The third is bottom-up attacks, or individuals attacking authoritarian leaders. Examples include:

* Procopius slandering Emperor Justinian in the Secret History
* Protestant reformers slandering the Pope in the 1500s
* Dutch rebels slandering the Duke of Alba during the Dutch Revolt
* The resistance slandering Hitler in Nazi-occupied Europe

==In a totalitarian regime==
The effect of a character assassination driven by an individual is not equal to that of a state-driven campaign.
The state-sponsored destruction of reputations, fostered by political propaganda and cultural mechanisms, can have more far-reaching consequences. One of the earliest signs of a society's compliance to loosening the reins on the perpetration of crimes (and even massacres) with total impunity is when a government favors or directly encourages a campaign aimed at destroying the dignity and reputation of its adversaries, and the public accepts its allegations without question. The mobilisation toward ruining the reputation of adversaries is the prelude to the mobilisation of violence in order to annihilate them. Generally, official dehumanisation has preceded the physical assault of the victims.&lt;ref name="Rojas" /&gt;

==The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination==

In July 2011, scholars from nine countries gathered at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, to debate "the art of smear and defamation in history and today".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://characterattack.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2011-schedule.pdf|title=Character Assassination: The Art of Defamation Throughout the Ages.

The group included historians, political scientists, and political psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination https://characterattack.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a number of countries use chemical castration on [[rape|rapists]] and [[pedophilia|pedophiles]], often in return for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/indonesia-chemical-castration.html|title=Indonesia Approves Castration for Sex Offenders Who Prey on Children|first=Joe|last=Cochrane|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===On men===
When used on men, these drugs can reduce sex drive, compulsive sexual fantasies, and capacity for [[sexual arousal]]. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[osteoporosis]]. They may also experience [[gynecomastia]] (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males) as seen in [[Alan Turing]]'s case.

===On women===
{{further|Oophorectomy}}
When used on women, the effects are similar, though there is little research about chemically lowering women's sex drive or female-specific anaphrodisiacs, since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in women which can impact sex drive or sexual response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/oophorectomy/basics/risks/prc-20012991|title=Oophorectomy (ovary removal surgery) - Risks|website=Mayoclinic.org|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Oophorectomy-Risks.aspx|title=Oophorectomy Risks|date=16 August 2010|website=News-medical.net|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13697130903075345|title=Risk of hypoactive sexual desire disorder and associated factors in a cohort of oophorectomized women|first1=C.|last1=Castelo-Branco|first2=S.|last2=Palacios|first3=J.|last3=Combalia|first4=M.|last4=Ferrer|first5=G.|last5=Traveria|date=1 December 2009|journal=Climacteric|volume=12|issue=6|pages=525–532|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.3109/13697130903075345|pmid=19905904}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple.

==Treatment for sex offenders==
The first use of chemical castration occurred in 1944, when [[diethylstilbestrol]] was used with the purpose of lowering men's testosterone.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;
The [[antipsychotic]] agent [[benperidol]] is sometimes used to diminish sexual urges in people who display inappropriate sexual behavior, and can likewise be given by depot injection. But benperidol does not affect testosterone and is therefore not a castration agent.
Chemical castration is often seen as an easier alternative to [[life imprisonment]] or the [[death penalty]] because it allows the release of sex offenders while reducing or eliminating the chance that they reoffend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=21 February 1997|title=Bill would impose castration for convicted rapists|page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, in an experiment by P. Gagne, 48 males with long-standing histories of sexually deviant behaviour were given [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] for as long as 12 months. Forty of those subjects were recorded as to have diminished desires for deviant sexual behaviour, less frequent sexual fantasies, and greater control over sexual urges. The research recorded a continuation of this more positive behaviour after the administration of the drug had ended with no evidence of adverse side effects and recommended medroxyprogesterone acetate along with counselling as a successful method of treatment for serial sex offenders.&lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/5/644|title=Treatment of sex offenders with medroxyprogesterone acetate|date=1 April 2006|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=ajp.psychiatryonline.org|doi=10.1176/ajp.138.5.644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific critique===
Citing the observation that spaying causes female animals to stop mating in the same species as castration cause male animals to stop mating, and that in the animal species where females continue their mating behaviour after being spayed the males also continue to mate after being castrated, there are scientists who argue that it makes no biological sense to assume that any treatment that emulates castration would remove sex drive in men but not in women. These scientists argue that these observations, along with the fact that humans are animals and subject to [[evolution]], show that it is flawed to think that male sexuality would be treatable by medication if female sexuality is not.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aunger, Valerie Curtis (2015)"Gaining Control: How human behavior evolved"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2015). "The myth of female sexual complexity"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some criminologists argue that the appearance of a lower recidivism rate in male sex offenders who take chemical castration treatment than in those who do not can be explained by factors other than biological effects of the medication. One hypothesis is that men who accept the negative effects of hormonal treatment in exchange for shorter prison sentence are distinct in that they value freedom from incarceration higher than men who rather stay in prison for a longer time than face the side effects of chemical castration. These criminologists explain apparently lower recidivism as an artifact of men who accept chemical castration being more engaged in hiding the evidence for reoffending, and that paroling such offenders constitute a risk of releasing criminals who commit as many new crimes as others but are better at hiding it. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], and that men who sell some of their prescribed medicines on the black market for drugs get a hidden income that improve their ability to afford measures to hide recidivism that is not available to men without such prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Horne, Michael J. Lovaglia (2008). "Experiments in Criminology and Law: A Research Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Sismondo, Jeremy A. Greene (2015). "The Pharmaceutical Studies Reader"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorie A. Fridell (2016). "Producing Bias-Free Policing: A Science-Based Approach"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some neurologists acknowledge that testosterone plays a role in sexual arousal but that reducing sex drive will likely not reduce inappropriate sex behaviour. These researchers argue that since a weaker internal signal in the brain means a higher requirement for external stimulation to create a feedback loop that tires the brain circuits out as in orgasm and lead to satisfaction, a reduction of the internal stimulation from hormones would make the required external stimulation stronger and also more specific, as weaker signals involve narrower ranges of other brain functions in their loops. These scientists therefore argue that the biological (as opposed to sociological) effect of reduced testosterone is to make it more difficult and not easier to use masturbation without pornography or other socially acceptable substitutes to manage remaining sex drive in a former offender, and that many community persons (both male and female) find that a lower initial arousal makes it more difficult to orgasm by masturbation without pornography or with non-preferred stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;KC Berridge (2015).

===Argentina===
In March 2010, Guillermo Fontana of [[CNN]] reported that officials in [[Mendoza (province)|Mendoza]], a [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] in [[Argentina]], approved the use of voluntary chemical castration for rapists, in return for reduced sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/19/argentina.castration/index.html |author=Fontana, Guillermo| work=[[CNN]] | title=Argentina province OKs chemical castration for rapists | date=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In 2010, a repeat child sex offender who had been subject to chemical castration was accused of inappropriately touching and kissing a young girl. He was found not guilty by a jury, which was not informed of the context of his previous offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Townsville Bulletin|date=30 October 2010|author=Roanne Johnson|title=Convicted paedophile allowed to look after kids|url=https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/10/30/181291_news.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519161443/https://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/10/30/181291_news.html |archivedate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drug [[cyproterone acetate]] has been commonly used for chemical castration throughout Europe.  It resembles the drug MPA used in America.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], computer scientist [[Alan Turing#Conviction for indecency|Alan Turing]], famous for his contributions to mathematics and computer science, was a homosexual who was forced to undergo chemical castration in order to avoid imprisonment in 1952.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;  At the time, homosexual acts between males were still illegal and homosexual orientation was widely considered to be a mental illness that could be treated with chemical castration.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-turing-enigma-campaigners-demand-pardon-for-mathematics-genius-1773480.html The Turing enigma: Campaigners demand pardon for mathematics genius] by Jonathan Brown for the ''Independent'', August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Turing experienced side effects such as breast enlargement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|title=An Apology To Alan Turing|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/09/an-apology-to-alan-turing/196673/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|authorlink=Andrew Sullivan|archiveurl=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/09/an-apology-to-alan-turing.html|archivedate=11 September 2009|date=11 September 2009|quote=[...] One of the known side effects of these hormone injections was the development of breasts, known as gynecomastia, something which plagued Turing for the rest of his life.

In 2008, an experimental intervention program was launched in three [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[prison]]s: Carregueira ([[Sintra Municipality|Belas, Sintra]]), [[Paços de Ferreira]] and [[Funchal]]. The program developers note the voluntary nature of the program a crucial factor in its success. They initially planned to cover ten inmates per prison, contemplating a possible enlargement to other prisons in the future. The program also included a [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] component.&lt;ref name="Portugal"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mais condenações por abuso sexual de menor |publisher = [[Diário de Notícias]] |date = 5 October 2011 |url = http://umonline.uminho.pt/ModuleLeft.aspx?mdl=~/Modules/Clipping/NoticiaView.ascx&amp;ItemID=49257&amp;Mid=119&amp;lang=pt-PT&amp;pageid=74&amp;tabid=13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013803/http://umonline.uminho.pt/ModuleLeft.aspx?mdl=~%2FModules%2FClipping%2FNoticiaView.ascx&amp;ItemID=49257&amp;Mid=119&amp;lang=pt-PT&amp;pageid=74&amp;tabid=13 |archivedate = 2013-09-28 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2013, the [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonian]] authorities were working on developing a legal framework and standard procedure for implementation of chemical castration that would be used for convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]s. The castration is intended to be voluntarily, where as for the child molesters that repeat the criminal act it should be mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=11151396396&amp;id=12&amp;prilog=0&amp;setIzdanie=23028 |title=Хемиската кастрација за педофилите  ги подели психијатрите и правниците |work=novamakedonija.com.mk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119224033/http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=11151396396&amp;id=12&amp;prilog=0&amp;setIzdanie=23028 |archivedate=2013-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outrage following the [[2012 Delhi gang rape case|gang rape of a woman]] in [[Delhi]], the Government has submitted a draft proposing chemical castration along with an imprisonment of up to 30 years for rape convicts as part of the anti-rape law in India.

Government is also planning to re-define the Juvenile Act and lower their age. One of the accused in the rape case is a juvenile and aged a few months less than 18 years. A view has been expressed by a section that only those below 15 years should be described as juvenile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-30/india/36063952_1_chemical-castration-draft-bill-check-crimes | work=The Times Of India | title=Congress anti-rape draft bill proposes 30 years jail, chemical castration - The Times of India | date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In 2016, the Indonesian President [[Joko Widodo]] introduced a presidential regulation to allow chemical castration to be handed down as a punishment to child sex offenders and [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]]. The regulation alters the contents of the 2002 Law on Child Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/indonesia-chemical-castration.html|title=Indonesia Approves Castration for Sex Offenders Who Prey on Children|last=Cochrane|first=Joe|date=2016-05-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In May 2009, two brothers from [[Haifa]]—convicted child molesters—agreed to undergo chemical castration to avoid committing further crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Haaretz|author=Tali Libman|date=25 May 2009|title=Losing a battle to win the war|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/losing-a-battle-to-win-the-war-1.276650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, the [[Antiandrogen|antilibidinal drug]] [[cyproterone acetate]] is sold under the name Androcur. In November 2000 convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Jason Dittmer attacked a victim while on the drug. In 2009 a study into the effectiveness of the drug by Dr David Wales for the Corrections Department found that no research had been conducted in New Zealand into the effectiveness and such trials were "ethically and practically very difficult to carry out."&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_5264564"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/5264564/Chemicals-don-t-always-stop-sex-offenders |title=Chemicals don't always stop sex offenders |author=Francis, Clio |date=11 July 2011 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In October 2011, the Russian parliament approved a law that allows a court-requested forensic psychiatrist to prescribe the chemical castration of convicted sex offenders who have harmed children under the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rt.com/news/pedophilia-russia-chemical-castration-059/ | work=RT | title=Russia introduces chemical castration for pedophiles | date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In July 2011, South Korea enacted a law allowing judges the power to sentence sex offenders who have attacked children under the age of 16 to chemical castration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/24/idINIndia-58423020110724 | work=Reuters | title=S.

On May 23, 2012, a serial sex offender legally called Park in the court case was ordered by the committee to undergo this treatment after his most recent attempted offense. On January 3, 2013, a South Korean court sentenced a 31-year-old man to 15 years in jail and chemical castration, the country's first-ever chemical castration sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Hindu| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-korean-court-orders-first-chemical-castration/article4269112.ece |title=South Korean court orders first chemical castration|date=3 January 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130103000795 | work=Korea Herald| title=Court issues 1st chemical castration sentence | date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, feminist-backed Moon Jaein administration expanded the sentencing to include all forms of rapes and sexual assault cases against women, including attempted rape.

In South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal [[sexual assault]], punishable by a fine of under 10 million [[South Korean won|won]] and up to 5 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EC%84%B1%ED%8F%AD%EB%A0%A5%EB%B2%94%EC%A3%84%EC%9D%98%20%EC%B2%98%EB%B2%8C%20%EB%93%B1%EC%97%90%20%EA%B4%80%ED%95%9C%20%ED%8A%B9%EB%A1%80%EB%B2%95 "South Korean law on criminal sexual assault, Chapter 1 Article 14"]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01298886615999112&amp;SCD=JG31&amp;DCD=A00703|title=`몰카 찰칵했다간 철컹`…몰카범도 화학적 거세한다|first1=Ⓒ 종합 경제정보 미디어 이데일리-상업적|last1=무단전재|first2=재배포|last2=금지|date=28 July 2017|website=edaily|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment did not pass.

===United States===
In 1966, John Money became the first American to employ chemical castration by prescribing [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (MPA, the base ingredient now used in [[Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate|DMPA]]) as a treatment for a patient dealing with pedophilic urges.  The drug has thereafter become a mainstay of chemical castration in America. Despite its long history and established use, the drug has never been approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for sexual offenders.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt;

California was the first U.S. state to specify the use of chemical castration as a punishment for [[child molestation]], following the passage of a modification to Section 645 of the [[California]] [[penal code]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="califsenate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/SEN/COMMITTEE/STANDING/PUBLICSAFETY/bills/_6bill12.htm |title=XII.

The passage of this law led to similar laws in other states such as Florida's Statute Section 794.0235 which was passed into law in 1997.&lt;ref name="floridalawreview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages |first=Larry Helm |last=Spalding |journal=[[Florida State University Law Review]] |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=117–139 |url=http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/&amp;#91;Spalding&amp;#93;FloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613193448/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSpalding%5DFloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in California, treatment is mandatory after a second offense.

At least seven other states, including [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]] and [[Wisconsin]], have experimented with chemical castration.&lt;ref name=JAAPL /&gt; In Iowa, as in California and Florida, offenders may be sentenced to chemical castration in all cases involving serious sex offenses.  On June 25, 2008, following the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Kennedy v.

====Objections====

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of [[Florida]] opposes the administration of any drug that is dangerous or has significant irreversible effect as an alternative to incarceration; however, they do not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs for sex offenders under carefully controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration.&lt;ref name="aclufl"&gt;{{cite journal| publisher=Florida State University Law Review | title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages | author=Larry Helm Spalding | volume=25:117 | pages=124 | url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=25+Fla.+St.+U.L.+Rev.+117&amp;key=764569c9c4bb55ecfefa69a00154ff9d | quote=Furthermore, the ACLU of Florida opposes any attempt to offer a defendant the opportunity to avoid incarceration by taking a drug that is dangerous or that has a significant irreversible effect on an individual’s cognitive capacity or an important physical function, such as the ability to conceive children.  The ACLU of Florida does not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs under certain controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration for convicted sex offenders. Because the ACLU of Florida respects individual autonomy and supports the principle that punishment should be no more restrictive of liberty than necessary, an individual’s choice of whether to accept an antiandrogen drug is entitled to considerable respect. In addition, because this choice arises in the inherently coercive context of sentencing, and because of the capacity for abuse of this sentencing option, such treatment should be available only under the most carefully controlled circumstances. | date=1998| access-date=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law professor John Stinneford has argued that chemical castration is a cruel and unusual punishment because it exerts control over the mind of sex offenders to render them incapable of sexual desire and subjects them to the physical changes caused by the female hormones used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=918271|title=Incapacitation through Maiming: Chemical Castration, the Eighth Amendment, and the Denial of Human Dignity|first=John F.|last=Stinneford|date=20 July 2006|website=Paoers.ssrn.com|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have argued that, based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], the procedure fails to guarantee equal protection: although the laws mandating the treatment do so without respect to gender, the actual effect of the procedure disproportionately falls upon men.&lt;ref name=JAAPL&gt;[http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/31/4/502.pdf "Castration of Sex Offenders: Prisoners’ Rights Versus Public Safety"] Charles L. Scott, MD, and Trent Holmberg, MD&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of voluntary statutes, the ability to give [[informed consent]] is also an issue; in 1984, the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]'s court of appeals held that mandating chemical castration as a condition of probation was unlawful on the grounds that the drug [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] had not yet gained acceptance as being safe and reliable and also due to the difficulty of obtaining informed consent under these circumstances.&lt;ref name="JAAPL" /&gt;

==Treatment for cancer patients==
A major medical use of chemical castration is in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, such as some [[prostate cancer]], where it has largely replaced the practice of surgical castration.&lt;ref name="cruk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/prostate-cancer/treatment/hormone/about-hormone-therapy-for-prostate-cancer|title=About hormone therapy for prostate cancer|work=cancerresearchuk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIFEonADT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeonadt.com/the-adt-book/|title=The ADT Book|work=Life on ADT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical castration involves the administration of [[antiandrogen]] drugs, such as [[cyproterone acetate]], [[flutamide]], or [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]]s.

[[File:Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus Muta).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Natural selection]] has driven the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] to change from [[snow camouflage]] in winter to [[disruptive coloration]] suiting [[moorland]] in summer.]]
[[File:Cornselection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Selective breeding]] transformed [[teosinte]]'s small spikes (left) into modern [[maize]] (right). [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] argued that [[evolution]] worked in a similar way.]]

[[Animal coloration]] provided important early [[Evidence of common descent|evidence for evolution]] by [[natural selection]], at a time when little direct evidence was available. Three major functions of coloration were discovered in the second half of the 19th century, and subsequently used as [[scientific evidence|evidence]] of selection: [[camouflage]] (protective coloration); [[mimicry]], both [[Batesian]] and [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian]]; and [[aposematism]].

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, arguing from circumstantial evidence that selection by human breeders could produce change, and that since there was clearly a struggle for existence, that natural selection must be taking place. But he lacked an explanation either for [[genetic variation]] or for [[heredity]], both essential to the theory. Many [[alternatives to natural selection|alternative theories]] were accordingly considered by biologists, threatening to undermine Darwinian evolution.

Some of the first evidence was provided by Darwin's contemporaries, the naturalists [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Fritz Müller]]. They described forms of mimicry that now carry their names, based on their observations of tropical butterflies. These highly specific patterns of coloration are readily explained by natural selection, since predators such as birds which hunt by sight will more often catch and kill insects that are less good mimics of distasteful models than those that are better mimics; but the patterns are otherwise hard to explain. 
Darwinists such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], and in the 20th century [[Hugh Cott]] and [[Bernard Kettlewell]], sought evidence that natural selection was taking place. Wallace noted that [[snow camouflage]], especially plumage and pelage that changed with the seasons, suggested an obvious explanation as an adaptation for concealment. Poulton's 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', written [[Eclipse of Darwinism|during Darwinism's lowest ebb]], used all the forms of coloration to argue the case for natural selection. Cott described many kinds of camouflage, and in particular his drawings of coincident [[disruptive coloration]] in frogs convinced other biologists that these deceptive markings were products of natural selection. Kettlewell experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]], showing that the species had [[industrial melanism|adapted as pollution changed the environment]]; this provided compelling evidence of Darwinian evolution.

[[File:Arcticfox-3.jpg|thumb|[[Snow camouflage]]: [[Arctic fox]] is mainly brown in summer, all white in winter.]]

===Snow camouflage===
{{main|Snow camouflage}}

In his 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] considered the white coloration of [[Arctic]] animals. He recorded that the [[Arctic fox]], [[Arctic hare]], [[stoat|ermine]] and [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] change their colour seasonally, and gave "the obvious explanation", that it was for concealment.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallace, Alfred Russel |authorlink=Alfred Russel Wallace |title=Darwinism - An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection - With Some Of Its Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaV9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180|year=2015 |origyear=1889 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4733-7510-9 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In the case of prey animals like the Arctic hare, this is concealment from predators, reducing the chance of being seen and eaten, directly affecting survival. In the case of predators like the Arctic fox, camouflage provides concealment from prey, increasing the change of a successful hunt, and again improving survival chances. Thus whether the camouflage is defensive or aggressive, it would be favoured by natural selection. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] named the two cases "general protective resemblance" and "general aggressive resemblance" respectively.&lt;ref name=Poulton/&gt;}} The modern ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that [[crypsis|cryptic]] brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." All the same, he notes, "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by [[Gyrfalcon]]s throughout the winter."&lt;ref name=Tickell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tickell |first1=W. L. N. |title=White Plumage |journal=Waterbirds: The International Journal of Waterbird Biology |date=March 2003 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |jstor=1522461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, decreasing snow cover in Poland, caused by [[global warming]], is reflected in a reduced percentage of [[Mustela nivalis|white-coated weasels]] that become white in winter. Days with snow cover halved between 1997 and 2007, and as few as 20 percent of the weasels had white winter coats. This was shown to be a result of natural selection by predators making use of camouflage mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |title=White-furred animals could die out because of climate change, study suggests |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/05/24/white-animals-could-die-climate-change-study-suggests/ |accessdate=24 May 2018 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atmeh Andruszkiewicz Zub 2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Atmeh | first=Kamal | last2=Andruszkiewicz | first2=Anna | last3=Zub | first3=Karol | title=Climate change is affecting mortality of weasels due to camouflage mismatch | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=7648 | date=24 May 2018 | doi=10.1038/s41598-018-26057-5| pmid=29795400 | pmc=5967304 | bibcode=2018NatSR...8.7648A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of camouflage researchers [[Innes Cuthill]] and A. Székely, the English zoologist and [[List of camoufleurs|camouflage expert]] [[Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' provided "persuasive arguments for the survival value of coloration, and for [[adaptation]] in general, at [[Eclipse of Darwinism|a time when natural selection was far from universally accepted]] within evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name=Stevens2011&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Innes Cuthill|Cuthill, I.

The attitude and very striking colour-scheme thus combine to produce an extraordinary effect, whose deceptive appearance depends upon the breaking up of the entire form into two strongly contrasted areas of brown and white. Considered separately, neither part resembles part of a frog. Together in nature the white configuration alone is conspicuous. This stands out and distracts the observer's attention from the true form and contour of the body and appendages on which it is superimposed".&lt;ref name=Cott1940&gt;{{cite book | author=Cott, Hugh B. | authorlink=Hugh B.

Cott's description and in particular his drawings convinced biologists that the markings, and hence the camouflage, must have survival value (rather than occurring by chance); and further, as Cuthill and Székely indicate, that the bodies of animals that have such patterns must indeed have been shaped by natural selection.&lt;ref name=Stevens2011/&gt;{{-}}

===Industrial melanism===
{{main|Industrial melanism|Peppered moth evolution}}

Between 1953 and 1956, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]]. He presented results showing that in a polluted urban wood with dark tree trunks, dark moths survived better than pale ones, causing [[industrial melanism]], whereas in a clean rural wood with paler trunks, pale moths survived better than dark ones. The implication was that survival was caused by camouflage against suitable backgrounds, where predators hunting by sight (insect-eating birds, such as the [[great tit]]s used in the experiment) selectively caught and killed the less well-camouflaged moths. The results were intensely controversial, and from 2001 [[Michael Majerus]] carefully repeated the experiment. The results were published posthumously in 2012, vindicating Kettlewell's work as "the most direct evidence", and "one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action".&lt;ref name="Cook2012"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cook, L.

The evolutionary entomologist [[James Mallet]] noted that [[mimicry]] was "arguably the oldest [[Darwinian]] theory not attributable to Darwin."&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; Inspired by ''On the Origin of Species'', Bates realized that unrelated Amazonian butterflies resembled each other when they lived in the same areas, but had different coloration in different locations in the Amazon, something that could only have been caused by adaptation.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallet |first1=James |authorlink=James Mallet |title=Mimicry: An interface between psychology and evolution |journal=PNAS |date=July 2001 |volume=98 |issue=16 |pages=8928–8930 |doi=10.1073/pnas.171326298 |pmid=11481461 |pmc=55348|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.8928M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Müllerian mimicry]], too, in which two or more distasteful species that share one or more predators have come to mimic each other's warning signals, was clearly adaptive; [[Fritz Müller]] described the effect in 1879, in an account notable for being the first use of [[mathematical biology|a mathematical argument]] in [[evolutionary ecology]] to show how powerful the effect of natural selection would be.{{efn|If one may ignore, as [[James Mallet|Mallet]] comments, [[Malthus]]'s discussion of the effects of [[population growth]] that influenced Darwin.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{-}}

{{main|Aposematism}}

In 1867, in a letter to Darwin, Wallace [[Aposematism#Wallace, 1867|described warning coloration]]. The evolutionary zoologist [[James Mallet]] notes that this discovery "rather illogically"&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; followed rather than preceded the accounts of Batesian and Müllerian mimicry, which both rely on the existence and effectiveness of warning coloration.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{efn|[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] invented the name [[aposematism]] some years later, in 1890, in his book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]''.&lt;ref name=Poulton&gt;{{cite book |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |date=1890 |title=The Colours of Animals |page=Foldout after page 339|title-link=The Colours of Animals }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The conspicuous colours and patterns of animals with strong defences such as toxins are [[advertising in biology|advertised]] to [[predator]]s, [[honest signalling|signalling honestly]] that the animal is not worth attacking.

[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', renamed Wallace's concept of warning colours "aposematic" coloration, as well as supporting Darwin's then unpopular theories of natural selection and [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/poulton90.html | title=E.B. Poulton (1890) | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=23 November 2012 | author=Mallet, Jim |authorlink=James Mallet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poulton's explanations of coloration are emphatically Darwinian. For example, on aposematic colouration he wrote that

{{blockquote|At first sight the existence of this group seems to be a difficulty in the way of the general applicability of the theory of natural selection. Warning Colours appear to benefit the would-be enemies rather than the conspicuous forms themselves, and the origin and growth of a character intended solely for the advantage of some other species cannot be explained by the theory of natural selection. But the conspicuous animal is greatly benefited by its Warning Colours. If it resembled its surroundings like the members of the other class, it would be liable to a great deal of accidental or experimental tasting, and there would be nothing about it to impress the memory of an enemy, and thus to prevent the continual destruction of individuals. The object of Warning Colours is to assist the education of enemies, enabling them to easily learn and remember the animals which are to be avoided. The great advantage conferred upon the conspicuous species is obvious when it is remembered that such an easy and successful education means an education involving only a small sacrifice of life."&lt;ref name=Poulton1890/&gt;&lt;!--end blockquote--&gt;}}

Poulton summed up his allegiance to Darwinism as an explanation of Batesian mimicry in one sentence: "Every step in the gradually increasing change of the mimicking in the direction of specially protected form, would have been an advantage in the struggle for existence".&lt;ref name=Poulton1890&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |date=1890 |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/edward-bagnall-poulton/the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala/1-the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala.shtml |title=The Colours of Animals, their meaning and use, especially considered in the case of insects |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Trübner |pages=160–161, 220, and whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of science Peter J. Bowler commented that Poulton used his book to complain about experimentalists' lack of attention to what field naturalists (like Wallace, Bates, and Poulton) could readily see were adaptive features. Bowler added that "The fact that the adaptive significance of coloration ''was'' (sic) widely challenged indicates just how far anti-Darwinian feeling had developed.{{efn|In the [[eclipse of Darwinism]].}} Only field naturalists such as Poulton refused to give in, convinced that their observations showed the validity of selection, whatever the theoretical problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J.

'''Contextual integrity''' is a theory of privacy developed by professor [[Helen Nissenbaum]] and presented in her book ''Privacy In Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Nissenbaum, Privacy in Context, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Contextual Integrity comprises four essential descriptive claims:

* Privacy is provided by appropriate flows of information.
* Appropriate information flows are those that conform with contextual information norms
* Contextual informational norms refer to five independent parameters: data subject, sender, recipient, information type, and transmission principle
* Conceptions of privacy are based on ethical concerns that evolve over time

Contextual Integrity can be seen as a reaction to theories that define privacy as control over information about oneself, as secrecy, or as regulation of personal information that is private, or sensitive.

This places contextual integrity at odds with privacy regulation based on [[Fair Information Practice Principles]]; it also does not line up with the 1990s [[Cypherpunk]] view that newly discovered [[cryptographic]] techniques would assure privacy in the digital age because preserving privacy is not a matter of stopping any data collection, or blocking all flows of information, minimizing data flow, or by stopping information leakage.

The fourth essential claim comprising Contextual Integrity gives privacy its ethical standing and allows for the evolution and alteration of informational norms, often due to novel sociotechnical systems.  It holds that practices and norms can be evaluated in terms of:
* Effects on the interests and preferences of affected parties 
* How well they sustain ethical and political (societal) principles and values
* How well they promote contextual functions, purposes, and values.

The most distinctive of these considerations is the third. As such, Contextual Integrity highlights the importance of privacy not only for individuals, but for society and respective social domains.

==Contextual Integrity’s Parameters==

The “contexts” of contextual integrity are social domains, intuitively, health, finance, marketplace, family, civil and political, etc. The five critical parameters that are singled out to describe data transfer operation are:

# The data subject
# The sender of the data
# The recipient of the data
# The information type
# The transmission principle.

Some illustrations of contextual informational norms in western societies, include:
* In a job interview, an interviewer is forbidden from asking a candidate’s religious affiliation
* A priest may not share congregants’ confession with anyone
* A U.S. citizen is obliged to reveal gross income to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], under conditions of confidentiality except as required by law
* One may not share a friend’s confidences with others, except, perhaps, with one’s spouse
* Parents should monitor their children’s academic performance

Examples of data subjects include patient, shopper, investor, or reader.  Examples of information senders include a bank, police, advertising network, or a friend. Examples of data recipients include a bank, the police, a friend. Examples of information types include the contents of an email message, the data subject’s demographic information, biographical information, medical information, and financial information. Examples of transmission principles include consent, coerced, stolen, buying, selling, confidentiality, stewardship, acting under the authority of a court with a warrant, and national security.

A key thesis is that assessing the privacy impact of information flows requires the values of all five parameters to be specified. Nissenbaum has found that access control rules not specifying the five parameters are incomplete and can lead to problematic ambiguities.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, K and Helen Nissenbaum. "What is private about ‘public’ records data?" ''Targeted Submission: Fall Law Reviews''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissenbaum notes that the some kinds of language can lead one’s analysis astray. For example, when the passive voice is used to describe the movement of data, it allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that there is an active agent performing the data transfer. For example, the sentence “Alice had her identity stolen” allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that someone or something did the actual stealing of Alice’s identity. If we say that “Carol was able to find Bob’s bankruptcy records because they had been placed online”, we are implicitly ignoring the fact that someone or some organization did the actual collection of the bankruptcy records from a court and the placing of those records online.

==Example==
Consider the norm: “US residents are required by law to file tax returns with the US Internal Revenue Service containing information, such as, name, address, SSN, gross earnings, etc. under conditions of strict confidentiality.”


Data Subject: A US resident

Sender: The same US resident

Recipient: The US Internal Revenue Service

Information type: tax information

Transmission principle: the recipient will hold the information in strict confidentiality.


Given this norm, we can evaluate a hypothetical scenario and see if it violates the contextual integrity norm:

Hypothetical: “The US Internal Revenue Service agrees to supply Alice’s tax returns to the city newspaper as requested by a journalist at the paper.”

This hypothetical clearly violates contextual integrity because the providing the tax information to the local newspaper would violate the transmission principle under which the information was obtained.

==Technical Applications of Contextual Integrity==
In 2006 Barth, Datta, Mitchell and Nissenbaum presented a formal language that could be used to reason about the privacy rules in privacy law.  They analyzed the privacy provisions of the Grahm Leach Biley act and showed how to translate some of its principles into the formal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barth|first1=Adam|last2=Datta|first2=Anupam|last3=Mitchell|first3=John|last4=Nissenbaum|first4=Helen|title=Privacy and Contextual Integrity: Framework and Applications|journal=Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy|date=2006|pages=184–198|doi=10.1109/SP.2006.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{one source|date=May 2014}}
{{original research|date=May 2014}}
'''Continuous-flow manufacturing''', or '''Repetitive-Flow Manufacturing''', is an approach to [[discrete manufacturing]] that contrasts with [[batch production]].  It is associated with a [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time]] and [[kanban]] production approach, and calls for an ongoing examination and improvement efforts which ultimately requires integration of all elements of the production system. The goal is an optimally balanced production line with little waste, the lowest possible cost, on-time and defect-free production.

This strategy is typically applied in [[discrete manufacturing]] as an attempt to handle production volumes comprising discrete units of product in a flow which is more naturally found in [[process manufacturing]].  The basic fact is that in most cases, discrete units of a solid product cannot be handled in the same way as continuous quantities of liquid, gas or powder.

[[Discrete manufacturing]] is more likely to be performed in batches of product units that are routed from process to process in the factory.  Each process may add value to the batch during a run-time or work-time. There is usually some time spent waiting for the process during a queue-time or wait-time.  The larger the batch, the longer each unit has to wait for the rest of the batch to be completed, before it can go forward to the next process.  This queue-time is waste, [[Muda (Japanese term)]], and represents time lost that is not value-added in the eyes of the customer.  This waste is one of the most important elements targeted for reduction and elimination in [[lean manufacturing]].

Reducing the batch size in [[discrete manufacturing]] is therefore a desirable goal: it improves the speed of response to the customer, whilst improving the ratio of value-added to non value-added work.  However, it should be balanced against the finite capacity of resources at the value-adding processes.  Capacity is consumed by [[changeover]] whenever a process is required to perform work on a different part or product model than the preceding one.  Time consumed in [[changeover]] is also considered waste, and it reduces the amount of resource capacity that is available to perform value-adding work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =
Leone | first1 = Gerard | last2 = Rahn | first2 = Richard D | year = 2003 | title = Fundamentals of Flow Manufacturing | location = Boulder, Colo | publisher = Flow Pub | isbn = 0-9713031-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing batch sizes can also increase handling time, risk and complexity in planning and controlling production.

The paradigm aim is to achieve [[single-piece flow]] where a single discrete unit of product flows from process to process.  In effect, the batch quantity is one.  If there is no change in part or product model, then this objective needs to be balanced against the additional handling time, and the work-centres that perform the process will typically have to be arranged in close proximity to one another in a flow-line.  This is often a characteristic of Repetitive-flow manufacturing and most manual assembly work is performed this way in the modern factory.

If there is a change in part or product model, then the process engineer should also consider to balance the [[changeover]] time with run-time.  If the [[changeover]] time is long, as it might be on a machine, batch size reduction is typically preceded with setup reduction techniques such as [[Single-Minute Exchange of Die]].

One methodology for Repetitive-flow manufacturing is [[Demand Flow Technology]] which combines the principles of Repetitive-flow and demand-driven manufacturing.  The [[production planning and control]] is linked to a pull signal that is triggered from a customer order or consumption of finished goods stock.  A pull signal can also link a process to the down-stream, and synchronize the flow to the demand of the customer.

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

In [[physics]], a '''degree of freedom''' is an independent physical [[parameter]] in the formal description of the state of a [[physical system]]. The set of all states of a system is known as the system's [[phase space]], and degrees of freedom of the system, are the [[dimension]]s of the phase space.

==Definition==
A degree of freedom of a physical system is an independent parameter that is necessary to characterize the state of a physical system. In general, a degree of freedom may be any useful property that is not dependent on other variables.

The location of a particle in three-dimensional space requires three position coordinates. Similarly, the direction and speed at which a particle moves can be described in terms of three velocity components, each in reference to the three dimensions of space.  If the time evolution of the system is deterministic, where the state at one instant uniquely determines its past and future position and velocity as a function of time, such a system has six degrees of freedom.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} If the motion of the particle is constrained to a lower number of dimensions, for example, the particle must move along a wire or on a fixed surface, then the system has fewer than six degrees of freedom. On the other hand, a system with an extended object that can rotate or vibrate can have more than six degrees of freedom.

In [[classical mechanics]], the state of a [[point particle]] at any given time is often described with position and velocity coordinates in the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism, or with position and momentum coordinates in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] formalism.

In [[statistical mechanics]], a degree of freedom is a single [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] number describing the [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] of a system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reif |first=F. |title=Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics |year=2009 |publisher=Waveland Press, Inc. |location=Long Grove, IL |isbn=1-57766-612-7 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification of all microstates of a system is a point in the system's [[phase space]].

In the 3D [[ideal chain]] model in chemistry, two [[angle]]s are necessary to describe the orientation of each monomer.

It is often useful to specify quadratic degrees of freedom. These are degrees of freedom that contribute in a quadratic function to the energy of the system.

==Gas molecules==
[[Image:Degrees of freedom (diatomic molecule).png|thumb|right|Different ways of visualizing the 6 degrees of freedom of a diatomic molecule. (CM: [[center of mass]] of the system, T: [[translational motion]], R: [[rotation]]al motion, V: [[molecular vibration|vibrational motion]].)]]

In three-dimensional space, three degrees of freedom are associated with the movement of a particle. A diatomic gas molecule has 6 degrees of freedom{{Dubious|reason=diatomic molecules have at most 6, usually 5|date=April 2017}}. This set may be decomposed in terms of translations, rotations, and [[molecular vibration|vibrations]] of the molecule. The [[center of mass]] motion of the entire molecule accounts for 3 degrees of freedom. In addition, the molecule has two [[rotation]]al degrees of motion and one{{Dubious|reason=diatomic molecules have at most 1, usually zero vibrational modes|date=April 2017}} [[vibrational mode]]. The rotations occur around the two axes perpendicular to the line between the two atoms. The rotation around the atom–atom bond is not a physical rotation{{Dubious|reason=Diatomic molecules rotate and precess|date=April 2017}}. This yields, for a diatomic molecule, a decomposition of:
:&lt;math&gt;N = 6 = 3 + 2 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

For a general, non-linear molecule, all 3 rotational degrees of freedom are considered, resulting in the decomposition:
:&lt;math&gt;3N = 3 + 3 + (3N - 6)&lt;/math&gt;

which means that an {{mvar|N}}-atom molecule has {{math|3''N'' − 6}} vibrational degrees of freedom for {{math|''N'' &gt; 2}}. In special cases, such as adsorbed large molecules, the rotational degrees of freedom can be limited to only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/cphc.201200531|pmid=23047526|title=Stabilization of Large Adsorbates by Rotational Entropy: A Time-Resolved Variable-Temperature STM Study|journal=ChemPhysChem|volume=14|issue=1|pages=162–9|year=2013|last1=Waldmann|first1=Thomas|last2=Klein|first2=Jens|last3=Hoster|first3=Harry E.|last4=Behm|first4=R. Jürgen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined above one can also count degrees of freedom using the minimum number of coordinates required to specify a position. This is done as follows:
# For a single particle we need 2 coordinates in a 2-D plane to specify its position and 3 coordinates in 3-D space. Thus its degree of freedom in a 3-D space is 3.
# For a body consisting of 2 particles (ex. a diatomic molecule) in a 3-D space with constant distance between them (let's say d) we can show (below) its degrees of freedom to be 5.
Let's say one particle in this body has coordinate {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and the other has coordinate {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with {{math| ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} unknown. Application of the formula for distance between two coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
results in one equation with one unknown, in which we can solve for {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
One of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be unknown.

Contrary to the classical [[equipartition theorem]], at room temperature, the vibrational motion of molecules typically makes negligible contributions to the [[heat capacity]]. This is because these degrees of freedom are ''frozen'' because the spacing between the energy [[eigenvalue]]s exceeds the energy corresponding to ambient [[temperature]]s ({{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}). In the following table such degrees of freedom are disregarded because of their low effect on total energy. Then only the translational and rotational degrees of freedom contribute, in equal amounts, to the [[heat capacity ratio]].  This is why {{mvar|γ}}={{math|{{sfrac|5|3}}}} for [[monatomic]] gases and {{mvar|γ}}={{math|{{sfrac|7|5}}}} for [[diatomic]] gases at room temperature.

However, at very high temperatures, on the order of the vibrational temperature (Θ&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;), vibrational motion cannot be neglected.

Vibrational temperatures are between 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; K and 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Independent degrees of freedom==
The set of degrees of freedom {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of a system is independent if the energy associated with the set can be written in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^N E_i(X_i),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a function of the sole variable {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

example: if {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are two degrees of freedom, and {{mvar|E}} is the associated energy:
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^4 + X_2^4&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are independent.
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^4 + X_1 X_2 + X_2^4&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are ''not'' independent. The term involving the product of {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a coupling term, that describes an interaction between the two degrees of freedom.

For {{mvar|i}} from 1 to {{mvar|N}}, the value of the {{mvar|i}}th degree of freedom {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is distributed according to the [[Boltzmann distribution]]. Its [[probability density function]] is the following:
: &lt;math&gt;p_i(X_i) = \frac{e^{-\frac{E_i}{k_B T}}}{\int dX_i \, e^{-\frac{E_i}{k_B T}}}&lt;/math&gt;,

In this section, and throughout the article the brackets &lt;math&gt;\langle \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[mean]] of the quantity they enclose.

The [[internal energy]] of the system is the sum of the average energies associated with each of the degrees of freedom:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^N \langle E_i \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

==Quadratic degrees of freedom==
A degree of freedom {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is quadratic if the energy terms associated with this degree of freedom can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;E = \alpha_i\,\,X_i^2 + \beta_i \,\, X_i Y &lt;/math&gt;,

where {{mvar|Y}} is a [[linear combination]] of other quadratic degrees of freedom.

example: if {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are two degrees of freedom, and {{mvar|E}} is the associated energy:
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^4 + X_1^3 X_2 + X_2^4&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are not independent and non-quadratic.
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^4 + X_2^4&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are independent and non-quadratic.
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^2 + X_1 X_2 + 2X_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are not independent but are quadratic.
:* If &lt;math&gt;E = X_1^2 + 2X_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, then the two degrees of freedom are independent and quadratic.

For example, in [[Newtonian mechanics]], the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a system of quadratic degrees of freedom are controlled by a set of homogeneous [[linear differential equation]]s with [[constant coefficients]].

===Quadratic and independent degree of freedom===
{{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are quadratic and independent degrees of freedom if the energy associated with a microstate of the system they represent can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i X_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Equipartition theorem===
In the classical limit of [[statistical mechanics]], at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the [[internal energy]] of a system of {{mvar|N}} quadratic and independent degrees of freedom is:
: &lt;math&gt;U = \langle E \rangle = N\,\frac{k_B T}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the [[mean]] energy associated with a degree of freedom is:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_i \rangle = \int dX_i\,\,\alpha_i X_i^2\,\, p_i(X_i) = \frac{\int dX_i\,\,\alpha_i X_i^2\,\, e^{-\frac{\alpha_i X_i^2}{k_B T}}}{\int dX_i\,\, e^{-\frac{\alpha_i X_i^2}{k_B T}}} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_i \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{2}\frac{\int dx\,\,x^2\,\, e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}}{\int dx\,\, e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}} = \frac{k_B T}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the degrees of freedom are independent, the [[internal energy]] of the system is equal to the sum of the [[mean]] energy associated with each degree of freedom, which demonstrates the result.

==Generalizations==
The description of a system's state as a [[point (geometry)|point]] in its phase space, although mathematically convenient, is thought to be fundamentally inaccurate. In [[quantum mechanics]], the motion degrees of freedom are superseded with the concept of [[wave function]], and [[operator (physics)|operators]] which correspond to other degrees of freedom have [[point spectrum|discrete spectra]]. For example, [[angular momentum operator#Spin, orbital, and total angular momentum|intrinsic angular momentum]] operator (which corresponds to the rotational freedom) for an [[electron]] or [[photon]] has only two [[eigenvalue]]s. This discreteness becomes apparent when [[action (physics)|action]] has an [[order of magnitude]] of the [[Planck constant]], and individual degrees of freedom can be distinguished.

'''Delia Villegas Vorhauer''' (April 17 1940 – June 1, 1992) was an American [[Latina]] social worker, who successfully ran programs to assist the [[Hispanic]] communities in Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. She was awarded a presidential medal for her efforts in development. She founded Mujeres Unidas de Michigan as an advocacy group for Spanish-speaking women and as a result of their activism the group sent six delegates to the [[1977 National Women's Conference]], which was a part of the UN [[International Women's Year]] programs. Vorhauer served as vice chair of the delegation to the conference. She authored the ''Mason Miller Report'', an evaluation of minorities and higher education, which became the model for analyzing participation of minorities in colleges and universities throughout Michigan, leading to a state bi-lingual education law. When she lost her sight, due to [[diabetes]], Vorhauer became an advocate for the blind. She was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1990, the first Latina to be honored in the hall.

==Early life==
Delia Villegas was born on April 17, 1940 in [[El Paso, Texas]] to Consuelo (née Olivares) and Dr. Bernardo Villegas.{{sfn|''The Lansing State Journal''|1992|p=14}} Her father was an [[optometrist]], as had been his father, and the couple raised their two older sons and Delia, as well as their adopted daughter Rebecca in the traditions of their Mexican heritage.{{sfn|Burns|2006|pp=131–132}} Villegas attended Catholic school across the border in Juarez, Mexico. At the age of thirteen, based on the family history and her perusal of her father’s medical books, Villegas diagnosed herself with diabetes, which the family physician confirmed.{{sfn|Burns|2006|pp=132–133}} She attended [[El Paso High School]], becoming the editor of the school newspaper, ''The Tatler''.{{sfn|''The Lansing State Journal''|1992|p=14}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=133}} Upon her graduation, Villegas moved to [[Chicago]], where the family had relatives and enrolled [[Rosary College]], in nearby [[River Forest, Illinois]] in 1958. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in [[sociology]] in 1962.{{sfn|Burns|2006|pp=133–134}}

==Career==
Upon graduation, Villegas began her career as a [[social worker]] in the children's services department for Chicago working with adoptions and protective services. She also published a weekly column, ''Servicio Social'' in the local Spanish newspaper.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=134}} In 1964, when the [[Manpower Development and Training Act]] (MDTA) was expanded to include training and development programs for the non-English speaking population, Villegas was hired as a director of the program by the Archdiocesan Latin American Committee (ALAC) to help them implement services in the Chicago area. Besides giving [[vocational training]] and English lessons, the ALAC provided family and financial counseling services, as well as medical referral information.{{sfn|Pinkerton|April 27, 1967|p=109}} Special programs were also provided to target Chicago's [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] populations, providing them with adult language courses.{{sfn|Pinkerton|May 7, 1967|p=399}} In 1967, Villegas was one of five women out of fifty-two speakers called to testify before President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s Cabinet Commttee Hearing on all aspects of life, except the draft and women's issues, impacting the Hispanic community in the United States.{{sfn|Pycior|1997|p=208}}{{sfn|Inter-Agency Committee on Mexican American Affairs|1967|p=1}} That same year, she was recognized with a presidential medal for directing the most successful MDTA program in the United States.{{sfn|''The Lansing State Journal''|1992|p=14}}{{sfn|Unterburger|Delgado|Peck|1991|p=414}}

On June 22, 1968, Villegas married William Federico Vorhauer and the couple relocated to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where her husband was completing his graduate studies. Vorhauer to help put him through school,{{sfn|''The Lansing State Journal''|1992|p=14}}{{sfn|Unterburger|Delgado|Peck|1991|p=414}} as the director of the Hispanic Affairs Division of the Boston Community Development office.{{sfn|Unterburger|Delgado|Peck|1991|p=414}} She developed a store-front school for inner-city youth in Boston and coordinated the first "city-wide conference on Puerto Rican affairs".{{sfn|Westfall|March 24, 1978|p=17}} The following year, the couple moved to [[Bowling Green, Ohio]], where Vorhauer worked as the State Supervisor of the Migrant Reception Centers for the [[Ohio Department of Job and Family Services|Ohio Bureau of Employment Services]],{{sfn|Unterburger|Delgado|Peck|1991|p=414}}{{sfn|''The News-Messenger''|1971|p=2}} where she focused on migrants' relocation issues.{{sfn|Westfall|March 24, 1978|p=17}} In 1972, she returned to school to work on her master's degree and began working as the Director of the Mexican-American Project at [[Bowling Green State University]]. Completing her MA in sociology in 1974, she was hired by the [[Michigan Department of Education]] as a higher education consultant and the couple relocated to [[Lansing, Michigan]].{{sfn|Unterburger|Delgado|Peck|1991|p=414}}

In 1975, after attending a statewide conference for Latina women, Vorhauer founded Mujeres Unidas de Michigan (MUM) (United Women of Michigan) as an advocacy group to support women, and was elected its chair in 1978.{{sfn|Westfall|November 14, 1978|p=21}} That same year, she was appointed by Governor [[William Milliken]] to serve on the [[Michigan Women's Commission]],{{sfn|Lewis|2017|p=86}} becoming both a member of the planning committee for the [[United Nations]]' [[International Women's Year]] program and vice-chair of the Michigan delegation to the national conference.{{sfn|Westfall|1977|p=36}} As a result of their outreach to promote Latina women to leadership roles, MUM sent six members in the delegation of forty-eight Michigan women to attend the [[1977 National Women's Conference]] in [[Houston, Texas]].{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=137}} In 1976, Vorhauer authored the ''Mason Miller Report'', an evaluation of minorities and higher education, which became the model for analyzing participation of minorities in colleges and universities throughout Michigan.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=138}}{{sfn|Deiters|1990|p=15}}{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=8}}{{sfn|Love|2006|p=473}} The report became the basis of a bi-lingual education law passed by the Michigan state government in 1978, and garnered Vorhauer coverage as one of eleven women "Making It Happen" in the March 1978 issue of ''[[Redbook]]''.{{sfn|Westfall|March 24, 1978|p=17}}

Vorhauer had by that time lost 90% of her sight from diabetic complications. In 1980,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=138}}{{sfn|Collier|1990|p=51}} the same year she received a Diana Award in recognition of her community service dedication,{{sfn|Douglas|1980|p=3}} she underwent surgery in hopes of restoring some of her vision.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=138}}{{sfn|Collier|1990|p=51}} Though the surgery was unsuccessful, she returned to work as a program coordinator at the Michigan Rehabilitation Services, which assists citizens with disabilities in attaining self-sufficiency. Vorhauer traveled the state, establishing referral offices until 1988,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=139}} when [[kidney failure]] forced her into retirement and [[Hemodialysis|dialysis]].{{sfn|Collier|1990|p=51}} Within the year, she returned to work, accepting the vacated position of the chair of the Michigan Commission for the Blind,{{sfn|Deiters|1990|p=15}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=140}} the first Hispanic to hold the post.{{sfn|Love|2006|p=473}} Establishing a large-print newspaper, she also founded a support group for blind Catholics to attend Mass together,{{sfn|Collier|1990|p=51}} while heading the commission and over one hundred employees.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=140}} In 1990, Vorhauer was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]], the first Latina the organization had honored.{{sfn|Deiters|1990|p=15}}{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=8}} Soon after the recognition, she retired and moved with her husband to [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], where her brother lived.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=140}}

'''Dhṛti''' or '''Dhriti''' ({{lang-sa|धृति}}) means to 'act with determination' ([[Bhagavad Gita]] Sl. XVIII.26), 'patience' ([[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]]  Sl. V.v.10-13), 'firmness' (''Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya'' Sl. XXIV.11), and refers to 'perseverance' (Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya Sl. XXIV.174), 'wearing regularly' (''Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya''  XXIV.333) and to one of the eleven  ''Rudranis'' ([[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]] Sl.III.xii.13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dhrti|url= http://vedabase.net/d/dhrti}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no correct equivalent English word for  ''Dhrti'' which is derived from  ''dhr-'' meaning 'to bear'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|publisher=Penguin|page=432|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cy9B-U-OVCwC&amp;pg=PA432&amp;dq=dhrti+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UN4FU5vfEs-4hAeXyoCgBw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dhrti'' meaning 'fortitude' and 'determination' is defined as the subtle faculty in man that makes him strive continuously towards a goal. It provides courage, enthusiasm and perseverance to face and overcome all odds and obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Gita Ready Reference|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNNGYOGoibgC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic relevance==

''Dhrti'' is the name of a [[Vedic]] [[metre]] of the type 12.12.8|12.8|12.8., and is a variety of the  ''Atichandas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic metre in its historical development|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=249|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6-k8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=dhrti+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YOQFU9LJD8yBhAeCtoCoAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a yoga in [[Hindu Calendar]]. The [[Vedic]] [[Rishi]]s address their prayers to the [[Visvedevas]] just as they do the [[Adityas]] and the [[Maruts]]; who all as a group are the protectors of the ten [[Rta]]s including  ''Dhrti'' ('forebearance') which word represents an abstract idea like  ''Hri'' and  ''Kirti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Dharma: Introduction to Scriptures and Theology|author=Ashim Kumar Bhattacharya|publisher=iUniverse|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAcewrt08boC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=dhrti+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3ucFU4_8I5SShQfE6ICYBQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the performance of the ''[[Ashvamedha|Ashvamedha yajna]]'', as mentioned in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', ''Asvalayana-srauta-sutra'' and ''Sankhayana-srauta-sutra'', the ''[[Adhvaryu]]'' offered, for the safe movement of the Sacrificial Horse during day-time, three ''Istis'' daily to ''[[Savitr]]'' and at nightfall performed four ''Dhrti Homas'' for the safe sheltering of that horse during night-time. While the ''Dhrti Homas'' were in progress, a ''Rajanya'' (''[[Kshatriya]]'') lute-player (''veenagathi'') sang three songs (''[[Gatha]]'') made up of many verses in which he praised the royal-sacrificer with the mention of his heroic exploits, viz., the wars he waged, the battles he won, the conquests he made, so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas Vol.1|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons

==Puranic relevance==

The [[Purana]] Index lists ''Dhrti'', borne by ''Vijaya'', as one of the sons of ''[[Dharma]]'' who was the son of [[Brahma]], and who married all thirteen daughters of ''[[Daksha]]'', each of whom bore ''Dhrti'' a son. ''Dhrtavarta'' was the son of ''Dhrti'' and father of ''Satyakarma''. ''Nandi'' was a consort of ''Dhrti''. ''Niyama'' was a son of ''Dhrti''. And, ''Dhrti'' ('courage') is invoked in the ''Grahabalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Purana Index|author=V.R.Ramachandra Dikshitar|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=159, 179, 199, 243, 677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7bFwZhfSOsC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Stuti'' of ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana|Devi Bhagavatam]]'' (V.22.25-42), ''[[Shakti|Devi]]'', who is the Energy for the creation and destruction of the universe, has been praised as having many names and as residing in all in the form of ''[[shakti]]'' ('power and energy'), ''amrti'' ('memory'), ''dhrti'' ('steadfastness'), ''[[buddhi]] '' ('intelligence'), so on. According to the Puranas, ''[[Brahma]]'' is the creator, ''Mukunda'' (''[[Vishnu]] '') is the preserver and ''[[Hara (Hinduism)|Hara]]'' (''[[Rudra]]) is the destroyer but they themselves are created by Devi at the beginning of a [[yuga]], therefore, she is the mother of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Purana Vol.VIII|publisher=All-India Kashiraj Trust, Fort Ramnagar, Varanasi|url= https://archive.org/stream/puranavolviii015194mbp/puranavolviii015194mbp_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Implication==

''Dhrti'' meaning 'fortitude' and 'determination' is defined as the subtle faculty in man that makes him strive continuously towards a goal. It provides courage, enthusiasm and perseverance to face and overcome all odds and obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Gita Ready Reference|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNNGYOGoibgC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the three types of  ''Dhrtis'' mentioned in the Bhagavad [[Gita]], Swami Tejomayananda states that  ''Sattvic dhrti'' is the unswerving fortitude with which one works for a noble cause with enthusiasm and dedication, despite obstacles; ''Rajasic dhrti'' is the fortitude displayed for a while, in a part, place or under particular circumstances to achieve particular goals and may dissolve under different circumstances and situations, and  ''Tamasic dhrti'' is the stubbornness with which one holds on to the false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ponder Awhile|author=Swami Tejomayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbYR4Bw39ckC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two factors that supply the fuel and the motive force in all sustained endeavours are - ''buddhi'' ('understanding') and ''dhrti'' ('fortitude'), the former is 'the intellectual capacity to grasp what is happening' and the latter is 'the constancy of purpose and self-application'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Gita Ready Reference|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=433|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNNGYOGoibgC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abhinavagupta]] states that since everyone works therefore, everyone possesses  ''dhrti''; he holds  ''buddhi'' to mean 'resolution' and  ''dhrti'' to mean 'satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gitarthasangrha|author=Abhinavagupta|publisher=BRILL|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9oUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y2UFU4mjMtOShQeeu4CIAQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], four things viz. [[Śruti]] and [[Smriti]] which are society’s codes of ethics, ''sadacara'' which is good noble conduct accepted by society; and ''svasya ca priyam atmanah'' which is one’s own joy and pleasure, determine [[Dharma]]. The ''sanatana dharma'' is the eternal universal values to be followed by all people in life, and ''varnasrama dharma'' consists of specific duties given to each individual; Dharma means that holds everyone and everything together which leads to material prosperity and spiritual realization in this life itself. According to [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], ''Dhrti'' is one of the ten values necessary for all people at all times that characterize Dharma. ''Dhrti'' means fortitude; it means the capacity to hold on to something. It is the ''sattavic dhrti'' which is strength, force and ability that makes us hold on to noble values of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Culture|author=Swami Tejomayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=95–96|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5VZtNRl24fsC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sattavic dhrti'' and ''Sattvic buddhi'' are mutually related terms. [[Krishna]] explains to [[Arjuna]] ([[Bhagavad Gita]] Sl. XVIII.30):

:प्रवृति च निवृति च कार्याकार्ये भयाभये |
:बन्धं मोक्षं च या वेत्ति बुद्धिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ||

that "That which knows the paths of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation, that  'understanding' is  ''sattvic'' ('pure')." Which means the function of the intellect is discrimination, the faculty of 'right understanding ' (''buddhi'') which gives real joy, success and prosperity. With regard to sattvic dhrti he states ([[Bhagavad Gita]] l. XVIII.33):

:धृत्या यया धारयते मनः प्राणेन्द्रियकिर्याः |
:योगेनव्यभिचरिण्या धृतिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ||

that the unwavering 'fortitude' by which through [[Yoga]] the functions of the mind, the [[Prana]] and the senses are restrained, that 'fortitude', is ''sattvic'' ('pure').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimad Bhagavad Gita Chapter XVIII|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=67, 75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMX3-54zcYMC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his Bhasya on the Bhagavad Gita explains that 'action' (way of works) is movement leading to bondage and 'inaction' (renunciation) leads to liberation. The remote expression – unwavering or unfaltering or unbroken concentration, should be related to resolve or  ''dhrti''; the sense is that the functions of the mind and so forth, maintained through unfaltering resolve, are in fact maintained through concentration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=578-580|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/bhagavad-gita-bhashya-sankara/|quote=Bhagavad Gita Slokas XVIII.30-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogic relevance==

[[Patanjali]]’s [[Yoga Sutra]] II.28 reads:-

:योगाङगानुष्ठानादशुध्दिक्षये ज्ञानदीप्तिराविवेकख्यातेः |

:"From the consistent practice of the parts of the Yoga-process, on the elimination of the impurity, the radiant organ of perception becomes manifest, until there is a steady discriminative insight."

This means – as impurities are eliminated through the observance of the steps of [[yoga]], a gradual kindling of knowledge occurs up to the full illumination of discriminatory wisdom. Discriminatory wisdom as virtue is the cause of happiness, and both, Vyasa and Vijnanabhikshu in their commentaries list nine causes including as the ninth cause  ''Dhrti'' here meaning sustenance; and agree that the  ''yoga-angas'' eradicate the impurity in both tangible (''drshta'') and intangible (''adrshta'') ways i.e. the physical practices such as purification (''shaucha''), and through  ''japa''. Elimination means disappearance of the veil on the  ''sattva mind-field''. The body is the sustainer of the senses being their resort but the senses sustain the body by way of providing spiritual and material welfare. The gross elements are the sustainers of the body and also sustain each other; the diverse sub-human, human and celestial bodies are mutually the sustainers and the sustained. ''Dhrti'' also means patience, remaining true to duty even in calamities, and perfection in maintaining wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Sutras Of Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=445, 450, 465, 675, 677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA677&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaishno relevance==

Verse II.vi.145 of  ''Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu'' states – the steadiness of heart arising from attaining realization of the Lord, from absence of suffering in attaining the realization of the Lord, and from realizing  ''prema'' with the Lord is called  ''dhrti''; in this state there is no lamentation for things not attained or for things that have disappeared. ''Ksama'' ('tolerance') is included in  ''dhrti-bhava''. The three types of  ''rati'' ('relationship of love', 'attraction') are  ''priti'' ('affection'), '' sakhya'' ('friendship') and  ''vatsalya'', ''dhrti'' along with  ''vitarka'' ('conjecture'), '' mati'' ('scriptural conclusion'), ''nirveda'' ('self-disgust'), ''smrti '' ('remembrance'), ''harsa'' ('joy'), and the type of  ''bodha'' arising from destruction of ignorance become somewhat causes of  ''rati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu Part 1|publisher=David Bruce Hughes|page=279,293,295,317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuncDaOZSDkC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9156">[[File:Die Gedanken sind frei.png|thumb|upright=1.3|"{{Lang|de|Die Gedanken sind frei|italic=no}}". Hoffmann von Fallersleben, Ernst Heinrich Leopold Richter, ''Schlesische Volkslieder mit Melodien'', 1842]]
"'''{{Lang|de|Die Gedanken sind frei|italic=no}}'''" (Thoughts are free) is a German song about the [[freedom of thought]]. The original lyricist and the composer are unknown, though the most popular version was rendered by [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben|Hoffmann von Fallersleben]] in 1842.

==Text==
The idea represented in the title—that thoughts are free—was expressed as early as in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]: {{Lang|la|Liberae sunt}} (...) {{Lang|la|nostrae cogitationes}}, ("Free are our thoughts") ''[[Pro Milone]]'', XXIX. 79., 52 BC&lt;/ref&gt; and became prominent again in the [[Middle Ages]], when [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] (c.1170–1230) wrote: {{Lang|de|joch sint iedoch gedanke frî}} ("yet still thoughts are free").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/elib/index.php?title=Der_Keiser_als_Spileman_%28Walther_von_der_Vogelweide%29 "Der Keiser als Spileman"], Walther von der Vogelweide&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, it is thought that [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] [[minnesinger]] [[Dietmar von Aist]] composed the song "{{Lang|de|Gedanke die sint ledic vrî||italic=no}}" ("only thoughts are free"). About 1229, [[Freidank]] wrote: {{Lang|de|diu bant mac nieman vinden, diu mîne gedanke binden}} ("this band may no one twine, that will my thoughts confine").

The text as it first occurred on leaflets about 1780 originally had four [[strophe]]s, to which a fifth was later added. Today, their order may vary. An early version in the shape of a dialogue between a captive and his beloved was published under the title "{{Lang|de|Lied des Verfolgten im Thurm. Nach Schweizerliedern|italic=no}}" ("Song of the persecuted in the tower. After Swiss songs") in [[Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]]'s circa 1805 folk poetry collection {{Lang|de|[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]}}, Vol. III.

The text and the melody can be found in {{Lang|de|Lieder der Brienzer Mädchen}} (songs of the girls from [[Brienz]]), printed in [[Bern]], Switzerland, between 1810 and 1820. It was adopted by Hoffmann von Fallersleben in his {{Lang|de|Schlesische Volkslieder mit Melodien}} ([[Silesia]]n folk songs with melodies) collection published by [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] in 1842, who referred to it as "from [[Nowy Kościół|Neukirch bei Schönau]]".

== Lyrics ==
{|
|&lt;poem&gt;{{Lang|de|{{Noitalic|1.}} Die Gedanken sind frei, wer kann sie erraten,
sie fliegen vorbei wie nächtliche Schatten.
Kein Mensch kann sie wissen, kein Jäger sie schießen
mit Pulver und Blei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

{{Noitalic|2.}} Ich denke was ich will und was mich beglücket,
doch alles in der Still', und wie es sich schicket.
Mein Wunsch und Begehren kann niemand verwehren,
es bleibet dabei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

{{Noitalic|3.}} Und sperrt man mich ein im finsteren Kerker,
das alles sind rein vergebliche Werke.
Denn meine Gedanken zerreißen die Schranken
und Mauern entzwei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

{{Noitalic|4.}} Drum will ich auf immer den Sorgen entsagen
und will mich auch nimmer mit Grillen mehr plagen.
Man kann ja im Herzen stets lachen und scherzen
und denken dabei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

{{Noitalic|5.}} Ich liebe den Wein, mein Mädchen vor allen,
sie tut mir allein am besten gefallen.
Ich sitz nicht alleine bei meinem Glas Weine,
mein Mädchen dabei: Die Gedanken sind frei!}}&lt;/poem&gt;
|style="padding-left:2em;"|&lt;poem&gt;1. Thoughts are free, who can guess them?
They fly by like nocturnal shadows.
No person can know them, no hunter can shoot them
with powder and lead: Thoughts are free!

2. I think what I want, and what delights me,
still always reticent, and as it is suitable.
My wish and desire, no one can deny me
and so it will always be: Thoughts are free!

3. And if I am thrown into the darkest dungeon,
all these are futile works,
because my thoughts tear all gates
and walls apart: Thoughts are free!

4. So I will renounce my sorrows forever,
and never again will torture myself with whimsies.
In one's heart, one can always laugh and joke
and think at the same time: Thoughts are free!

5. I love wine, and my girl even more,
Only her I like best of all.
I'm not alone with my glass of wine,
my girl is with me: Thoughts are free!&lt;/poem&gt;

==Adaptations==
Since the days of the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] and the [[Age of Metternich]], "Die Gedanken sind frei" was a popular [[protest song]] against [[political repression]] and [[censorship]], especially among the banned [[Burschenschaft]]en student fraternities. In the aftermath of the failed [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 German Revolution]] the song was banned. The Achim/Brentano text was given a new musical setting for voice and orchestra by [[Gustav Mahler]] in his 1898 ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn (Mahler)|Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' collection.

The song was important to certain anti-Nazi [[German resistance|resistance]] movements in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Melon, Ruth Bernadette. ''Journey to the White Rose in Germany''. Dog Ear Publishing, 2007. {{ISBN|1-59858-249-6}}. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, [[Sophie Scholl]], a member of the [[White Rose]] resistance group, played the song on her flute outside the walls of [[Ulm]] prison, where her father Robert had been detained for calling the Nazi dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] a "scourge of God". Earlier, in 1935, the guards at the [[Lichtenburg (concentration camp)|Lichtenburg concentration camp]] had ordered prisoners to stage a performance in celebration of Hitler's 46th birthday; the imprisoned communist-friendly lawyer [[Hans Litten]] recited "Die Gedanken sind frei" in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hans Litten: The man who annoyed Adolf Hitler|author=Jon Kelly|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14572578|accessdate=19 August 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Weavers]] recorded the song at a live concert in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Pete Seeger]] also recorded the song, solo, back in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[The Limeliters]] recorded the song in 1962 on their ''Folk Matinee'' album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Pete Seeger recorded the song once more in his ''[[Dangerous Songs!?]]'' album in 1966. Norwegian composer [[Alf Cranner]] translated and recorded it as "{{Lang|no|Din tanke er fri|italic=no}}" in 1985.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Parts of the poem were also taken as the basis of a song by the [[Brazilian Girls]] on their [[Brazilian Girls (album)|self-titled 2005 album]].

==In popular culture==

"Die Gedanken sind frei" was used as the theme and was sung by the Allied prisoners of war in the 1971 TV movie ''[[The Birdmen]]'', which was a fictionalized dramatization of an attempt to escape from the German [[Oflag IV-C]] camp at [[Colditz Castle]] in World War II. It was featured in the 1998 German movie [[23 (film)|''23'']] about the hacker [[Karl Koch (hacker)|Karl Koch]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} This melody was played by a violinist in the film ''[[The Book Thief (film)|The Book Thief]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In Canadian author [[Jean Little]]'s 1972 book ''[[From Anna]]'' the song is used to represent the freedom the titular character's father craves for his children, and as such figures predominantly into the plot at the beginning of the novel.

"Die Gedanken sind frei" is a track by the German band [[Megaherz]] on their ''[[Wer Bist Du?]]'' album.

The text of "Die Gedanken sind frei" has been used in the video game [[Orwell (video game)|Orwell]] as a plot device.

It implements a combination of code [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscation]], [[Program optimization|optimization]], shrinking, and hardening technologies.

A free version of the .NET Obfuscator, called the Dotfuscator Community Edition, is distributed as part of Microsoft's [[Visual Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bethmassi/archive/2010/02/23/dotfuscator-gets-better-and-still-free-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx |title=Dotfuscator Gets Better and Still Free in Visual Studio | author=Beth Massi |date=23 February 2010 |work=msdn.com |publisher=Microsoft, Inc. |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

.NET executables can easily be [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] by free tools (such as dotPeek and JustDecompile), potentially exposing algorithms and [[intellectual property]] (trade secrets), licensing and security mechanisms. Also, code can be run through a debugger and its data inspected. Using a .NET obfuscator can make all of these things more difficult.

Dotfuscator was developed by PreEmptive Solutions and a version has been free inside Microsoft's [[Visual Studio]] since 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12995">In [[mathematics]], especially in applications of [[linear algebra]] to [[physics]], the '''Einstein notation''' or '''Einstein summation convention''' is a notational convention that implies summation over a set of indexed terms in a formula, thus achieving notational brevity. As part of mathematics it is a notational subset of [[Ricci calculus]]; however, it is often used in applications in physics that do not distinguish between [[Tangent space|tangent]] and [[cotangent space|cotangent]] spaces. It was introduced to physics by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1916.&lt;ref name=Ein1916&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |coauthors= |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=1916 |publisher= |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |format=[[PDF]] |id= |accessdate=2006-09-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

===Statement of convention===

According to this convention, when an index variable appears twice in a single term and is not otherwise defined (see [[free and bound variables]]), it implies summation of that term over all the values of the index. So where the indices can range over the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|{1, 2, 3}|}},

:&lt;math&gt;y = \sum_{i = 1}^3 c_i x^i = c_1 x^1 + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3&lt;/math&gt;

is simplified by the convention to:

:
&lt;math&gt;y = c_i x^i&lt;/math&gt;.

The upper indices are not [[Exponentiation|exponents]] but are indices of coordinates, [[coefficient]]s or [[basis vector]]s. That is, in this context {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} should be understood as the second component of {{math|'''x'''}} rather than the square of {{math|'''x'''}} (this can occasionally lead to ambiguity).  The upper index position in {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;}} is because, typically, an index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term (see 'Application' below).  And typically {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} would be equivalent to the traditional {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}.

In [[general relativity]], a common convention is that 
*the [[Greek alphabet]] is used for space and time components, where indices take on values 0, 1, 2, or 3 (frequently used letters are {{math|''μ'', ''ν'', ...}}), 
*the [[Latin alphabet]] is used for spatial components only, where indices take on values 1, 2, or 3 (frequently used letters are {{math|''i'', ''j'', ...}}),

In general, indices can range over any [[Indexed family|indexing set]], including an [[infinite set]]. This should not be confused with a typographically similar convention used to distinguish between [[tensor index notation]] and the closely related but distinct basis-independent [[abstract index notation]].

An index that is summed over is a ''summation index'', in this case "{{math|''i''}}". It is also called a [[bound variable|dummy index]] since any symbol can replace "{{math|''i''}}" without changing the meaning of the expression provided that it does not collide with index symbols in the same term.

An index that is not summed over is a [[free variable|''free index'']] and should appear only once per term.  If such an index does appear, it usually also appears in terms belonging to the same sum, with the exception of special values such as zero.

===Application===

Einstein notation can be applied in slightly different ways. Typically, each index occurs once in an upper (superscript) and once in a lower (subscript) position in a term; however, the convention can be applied more generally to any repeated indices within a term.&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EinsteinSummation.html |title=Einstein Summation|accessdate=13 April 2011 |last= |first= |year= |work= |publisher=Wolfram Mathworld }}&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant and contravariant]] vectors, where the position of an index also indicates the type of vector, the first case usually applies; a covariant vector can only be contracted with a contravariant vector, corresponding to summation of the products of coefficients. On the other hand, when there is a fixed coordinate basis (or when not considering coordinate vectors), one may choose to use only subscripts; see ''{{section link||Superscripts and subscripts versus only subscripts}}'' below.

==Vector representations==

=== Superscripts and subscripts versus only subscripts ===

In terms of [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]], 
* upper indices represent components of [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant vectors]] ([[coordinate vector|vector]]s), 
* lower indices represent components of [[covariant vector|covariant]] vectors ([[covector]]s).

They transform contravariantly or covariantly, respectively, with respect to change of basis.

In recognition of this fact, the following notation uses the same symbol both for a (co)vector and its ''components'', as in:
:&lt;math&gt;v = v^i e_i = \begin{bmatrix}e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; e_n\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}v^1 \\ v^2 \\ \vdots \\ v^n\end{bmatrix} \qquad w = w_i e^i = \begin{bmatrix}w_1 &amp; w_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; w_n\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}e^1 \\ e^2 \\ \vdots \\ e^n\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the vector and {{math|''v&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are its components (not the {{math|''i''}}th covector {{math|''v''}}), {{math|''w''}} is the covector and {{math|''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are its components.

In the presence of a non-degenerate form (an isomorphism {{math|''V'' → ''V''{{i sup|∗}}}}, for instance a [[Riemannian metric]] or [[Minkowski metric]]), one can [[raising and lowering indices|raise and lower indices]].

A basis gives such a form (via the [[dual basis]]), hence when working on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with a Euclidean metric and a fixed orthonormal basis, one has the option to work with only subscripts.

However, if one changes coordinates, the way that coefficients change depends on the variance of the object, and one cannot ignore the distinction; see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]].

===Mnemonics===

In the above example, vectors are represented as {{math|''n'' × 1}} matrices (column vectors), while covectors are represented as {{math|1 × ''n''}} matrices (row covectors).

When using the column vector convention

* "'''Up'''per indices go '''up''' to down; '''l'''ower indices go '''l'''eft to right."
* "'''Co'''variant tensors are '''row''' vectors that have indices that are bel'''ow''' ('''co-below-row''')."
* Covectors are row vectors:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}w_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; w_k\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence the lower index indicates which ''column'' you are in.
* Contravariant vectors are column vectors:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}v^1 \\ \vdots \\ v^k\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence the upper index indicates which ''row'' you are in.

=== Abstract description ===

The virtue of Einstein notation is that it represents the invariant quantities with a simple notation.

In physics, a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] is invariant under transformations of [[basis (mathematics)|basis]]. In particular, a [[Lorentz scalar]] is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. The individual terms in the sum are not. When the basis is changed, the ''components'' of a vector change by a linear transformation described by a matrix. This led Einstein to propose the convention that repeated indices imply the summation is to be done.

As for covectors, they change by the inverse matrix. This is designed to guarantee that the linear function associated with the covector, the sum above, is the same no matter what the basis is.

The value of the Einstein convention is that it applies to other vector spaces built from {{math|''V''}} using the [[tensor product]] and [[dual space|duality]]. For example, {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''V''}}, the tensor product of {{math|''V''}} with itself, has a basis consisting of tensors of the form {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Any tensor {{math|'''T'''}} in {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''V''}} can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T^{ij}\mathbf{e}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{math|''V''*}}, the dual of {{math|''V''}}, has a basis {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''}}&lt;/sup&gt; which obeys the rule
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i (\mathbf{e}_j) = \delta^i_j.&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Kronecker delta]]. As

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(V,W) = V^* \otimes W&lt;/math&gt;
the row/column coordinates on a matrix correspond to the upper/lower indices on the tensor product.

== Common operations in this notation ==

In Einstein notation, the usual element reference {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for the {{math|''m''}}th row and {{math|''n''}}th column of matrix {{math|'''A'''}} becomes {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. We can then write the following operations in Einstein notation as follows.

;[[Inner product]] (hence also [[vector dot product]])

Using an [[orthogonal basis]], the inner product is the sum of corresponding components multiplied together:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_j v^j &lt;/math&gt;

This can also be calculated by multiplying the covector on the vector.

;[[Vector cross product]]

Again using an orthogonal basis (in 3 dimensions) the cross product intrinsically involves summations over permutations of components:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}= \varepsilon^i{}_{jk}u^j v^k \mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^i{}_{jk}=\delta^{il}\varepsilon_{ljk}&lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], and {{math|''δ&lt;sup&gt;il&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the generalized [[Kronecker delta]]. Based on this definition of {{math|''ε''}}, there is no difference between {{math|''ε&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} but the position of indices.

;Matrix-Vector Multiplication

The product of a matrix {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with a column vector {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is :

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_{i} = (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v})_{i}  =\sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} v_{j}&lt;/math&gt;

equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;u^i = A^i{}_j v^j &lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of matrix multiplication.

;[[Matrix multiplication]]

The [[Matrix multiplication#matrix product|matrix product]] of two matrices {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}_{ik} = (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B})_{ik}  =\sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} B_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;

equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;C^i{}_k = A^i{}_j B^j{}_k &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Trace (linear algebra)|Trace]]

For a square matrix {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, hence the sum over a common index {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

;[[Outer product]]

The outer product of the column vector {{math|''u&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} by the row vector {{math|''v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} yields an {{math|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix {{math|'''A'''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;A^i{}_j = u^i v_j  = (u v)^i{}_j&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} represent two ''different'' indices, there is no summation and the indices are not eliminated by the multiplication.

;[[Raising and lowering indices]]

Given a tensor, one can raise an index or lower an index by contracting the tensor with the metric tensor, {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For example, take the tensor {{math|''T&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, one can raise an index:

&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\alpha} = g^{\mu\sigma} T_{\sigma}{}^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Or one can lower an index:

&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\beta} = g_{\mu\sigma} T^{\sigma}{}_{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

==Notes==

#{{note label|a}}This applies only for numerical indices. The situation is the opposite for [[abstract indices]]. Then, vectors themselves carry upper abstract indices and covectors carry lower abstract indices, as per the example in the [[#Introduction|introduction]] of this article. Elements of a basis of vectors may carry a lower ''numerical'' index and an upper ''abstract'' index.

In [[classical mechanics]], '''Euler's laws of motion''' are [[equations of motion]] which extend [[Newton's laws of motion]] for [[point particle]] to [[rigid body]] motion.&lt;ref name="McGillKing"&gt;{{cite book

==Overview==

===Euler's first law===
'''Euler's first law''' states that the [[Momentum#Linear momentum of a system of particles|linear momentum]] of a body, {{math|'''p'''}} (also denoted {{math|'''G'''}}) is equal to the product of the mass of the body {{math|''m''}} and the velocity of its [[center of mass]] {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;}}:&lt;ref name="McGillKing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookRags"&gt;{{cite web

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p =  m \mathbf v_{\rm cm}&lt;/math&gt;.

Internal forces between the particles that make up a body do not contribute to changing the total momentum of the body as there is an equal and opposite force resulting in no net effect.&lt;ref name = Gray&gt;{{cite book

|author2=Costanzo, Plesha
|publisher = McGraw-Hill
|year = 2010
|isbn = 978-0-07-282871-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is also stated as:&lt;ref name = Gray/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F =  m \mathbf a_{\rm cm}&lt;/math&gt;.
where {{math|'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''d'''''v'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}}}} is the acceleration of the centre of mass and {{math|'''F''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d'''''p'''|''dt''}}}} is the total applied force on the body. This is just the [[time derivative]] of the previous equation ({{math|''m''}} is a constant).

===Euler's second law===
'''Euler's second law''' states that the rate of change of [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} (sometimes denoted {{math|'''H'''}}) about a point that is fixed in an inertial reference frame (often the mass center of the body), is equal to the sum of the external moments of force ([[torques]]) acting on that body {{math|'''M'''}} (also denoted {{math|'''τ'''}} or {{math|'''Γ'''}}) about that point:&lt;ref name="McGillKing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookRags"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao"/&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M = {d\mathbf L \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the above formula holds only if both {{math|'''M'''}} and {{math|'''L'''}} are computed with respect to a fixed inertial frame or a frame parallel to the inertial frame but fixed on the center of mass.  
For rigid bodies translating and rotating in only 2D, this can be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M = \mathbf r_{\rm cm} \times \mathbf a_{\rm cm} m + I \boldsymbol{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the position vector of the center of mass with respect to the point about which moments are summed, {{math|'''α'''}} is the [[angular acceleration]] of the body about its center of mass, and {{math|''I''}} is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body about its center of mass.
See also [[Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)]].

==Explanation and derivation==

The distribution of internal forces in a deformable body are not necessarily equal throughout, i.e. the stresses vary from one point to the next. This variation of internal forces throughout the body is governed by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]] of conservation of [[linear momentum]] and [[angular momentum]], which for their simplest use are applied to a mass particle but are extended in [[continuum mechanics]] to a body of continuously distributed mass. For continuous bodies these laws are called '''Euler’s laws of motion'''. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton’s laws of motion, then Euler’s equations can be derived from Newton’s laws. Euler’s equations can, however, be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies, independently of any particle distribution.&lt;ref name=Lubliner&gt;{{Cite book

The total body force applied to a continuous body with mass {{math|''m''}}, [[mass density]] {{math|''ρ''}}, and volume {{math|''V''}}, is the [[volume integral]] integrated over the volume of the body:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_B=\int_V\mathbf b\,dm = \int_V\mathbf b\rho\,dV &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''b'''}} is the force acting on the body per unit mass ([[dimensional analysis|dimension]]s of acceleration, misleadingly called the "body force"), and {{math|''dm'' {{=}} ''ρ dV''}} is an infinitesimal mass element of the body.

Body forces and contact forces acting on the body lead to corresponding moments ([[torque]]s) of those forces relative to a given point. Thus, the total applied torque {{math|'''M'''}} about the origin is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M= \mathbf M_B + \mathbf M_C&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''M'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''M'''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;}} respectively indicate the moments caused by the body and contact forces.

Thus, the sum of all applied forces and torques (with respect to the origin of the coordinate system) acting on the body can be given as the sum of a volume and [[surface integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = \int_V \mathbf a\,dm = \int_V \mathbf a\rho\,dV = \int_S \mathbf{t} dS + \int_V \mathbf b\rho\,dV&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M = \mathbf M_B + \mathbf M_C = \int_S \mathbf r \times \mathbf t dS + \int_V \mathbf r \times \mathbf b\rho\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''t''' {{=}} '''t'''('''n''')}} is called the [[surface traction]], integrated over the surface of the body, in turn {{math|'''n'''}} denotes a [[unit vector]] normal and directed outwards to the surface {{math|''S''}}.

Let the coordinate system {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be an [[inertial frame of reference]], {{math|'''r'''}} be the position vector of a point particle in the continuous body with respect to the origin of the coordinate system, and {{math|'''v''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d'''''r'''|''dt''}}}} be the velocity vector of that point.

'''Euler’s first axiom or law''' (law of balance of linear momentum or balance of forces) states that in an inertial frame the time rate of change of linear momentum {{math|'''p'''}} of an arbitrary portion of a continuous body is equal to the total applied force {{math|'''F'''}} acting on that portion, and it is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf p}{dt} &amp;= \mathbf F \\
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho\mathbf v\,dV&amp;=\int_S \mathbf t dS + \int_V \mathbf b\rho \,dV. \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Euler’s second axiom or law''' (law of balance of angular momentum or balance of torques) states that in an inertial frame the time rate of change of angular momentum {{math|'''L'''}} of an arbitrary portion of a continuous body is equal to the total applied torque {{math|'''M'''}} acting on that portion, and it is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf L}{dt} &amp;= \mathbf M \\
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \mathbf r\times\rho\mathbf v\,dV&amp;=\int_S \mathbf r \times \mathbf t dS + \int_V \mathbf r \times \mathbf b\rho\,dV. \\\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v &lt;/math&gt; is the velocity, &lt;math&gt;V &lt;/math&gt; the volume, and the derivatives of {{math|'''p'''}} and {{math|'''L'''}} are [[material derivative]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4283">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[topological group]]s, '''an extension of topological groups''', or a '''topological extension''', is a  [[short exact sequence]] &lt;math&gt; 0\to H\stackrel{\imath}{\to} X \stackrel{\pi}{\to}G\to 0 &lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;H, X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are topological groups and  &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;  are  continuous homomorphisms which are also open onto their images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cabello Sánchez | first= Félix | title=Quasi-homomorphisms | zbl=1051.39032 | volume=178 | number=3 | pages=255–270 | year=2003 | journal=Fundam. Math. | doi=10.4064/fm178-3-5 | url=http://journals.impan.gov.pl/cgi-bin/fm/pdf?fm178-3-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every extension of topological groups is therefore  a [[group extension]].

==Classification of extensions of topological groups==
We say that the topological extensions  
:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; 
and  
:&lt;math&gt;0\to H\stackrel{i'}{\rightarrow} X'\stackrel{\pi'}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
are equivalent (or congruent) if there exists a topological isomorphism &lt;math&gt;T: X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; making [[Commutative diagram|commutative]] the diagram of Figure 1.

[[File:Extensions groups2.png|thumb|Figure 1]]

We say that the topological extension

:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is a ''split extension'' (or splits) if it is equivalent to the trivial extension

:&lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i_H}{\rightarrow} H\times G\stackrel{\pi_G}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i_H: H\to H\times G&lt;/math&gt; is the natural inclusion over the first factor and &lt;math&gt;\pi_G: H\times G\to  G&lt;/math&gt; is the natural projection over the second factor.

It is easy to prove that the topological extension  &lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; splits if and only if there is a continuous homomorphism &lt;math&gt;R: X \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R\circ i&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map on &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the topological extension &lt;math&gt;0 \rightarrow H\stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} X\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow} G\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; splits if and only if the subgroup &lt;math&gt;i(H)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Direct sum of topological groups|topological direct summand]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

* Take &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R &lt;/math&gt; the [[real numbers]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z &lt;/math&gt; the [[Integer|integer numbers]]. Take   &lt;math&gt;\imath &lt;/math&gt; the natural inclusion and &lt;math&gt;\pi &lt;/math&gt; the natural projection. Then

:: &lt;math&gt; 0\to \mathbb Z\stackrel{\imath}{\to} \mathbb R \stackrel{\pi}{\to}\mathbb R/\mathbb Z\to 0 &lt;/math&gt;

: is an extension of topological abelian groups. Indeed it is an example of a non-splitting extension.

==Extensions of locally compact abelian groups (LCA)==

An extension of topological abelian groups will be a  short exact sequence &lt;math&gt; 0\to H\stackrel{\imath}{\to} X \stackrel{\pi}{\to}G\to 0 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;H, X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are [[Locally compact group|locally compact abelian groups]] and  &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;  are relatively open continuous homomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fulp | first1=R.O. | last2=Griffith | first2=P.A. | title=Extensions of locally compact abelian groups.

Then the sequence

Importantly, feelings, thoughts and behaviors can have a number of functional and dysfunctional effects on individual and group life, depending on actual risk and people's subjective approaches to danger. On a negative side, they can erode public health and psychological well-being; they can alter routine activities and habits; they can contribute to some places turning into 'no-go' areas via a withdrawal from community; and they can drain community cohesion, trust and neighborhood stability.&lt;ref name="Hale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, M., Chandola, T., &amp; Marmot, M.

Fear of crime has had a profound impact on the U.S. incarceration rate, having inspired the "tough on crime" policies of the 1980s that led to Draconian sentences being widespread. It should be noted that crime rates started decreasing before the new sentencing policies were implemented. Also significant is how despite the decrease in crime, media coverage of crime increased by 600% between 1998 and 2008. The media's "[[culture of fear]]" has largely been dominated by frequent stories of crime and punishment.

==Affective aspects of fear of crime==
The core aspect of fear of crime is the range of emotions that is provoked in citizens by the possibility of victimization. While people may feel angry and outraged about the extent and prospect of crime, surveys typically ask people "who they are afraid of" and "how worried they are". Underlying the answers that people give are (more often than not) two dimensions of 'fear': (a) those everyday moments of worry that transpire when one feels personally threatened; and (b) some more diffuse or 'ambient' anxiety about risk. While standard measures of worry about crime regularly show between 30% and 50% of the population of England and Wales express some kind of worry about falling victim, probing reveals that few individuals actually worry for their own safety on an everyday basis.&lt;ref&gt;Farrall, S. &amp; Gadd, D. (2004). The frequency of the fear of crime. British Journal of Criminology, 44, 127-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, E., Jackson, J. and Farrall, S. (2008). Reassessing the Fear of Crime, European Journal of Criminology, 5, 3, 363-380.&lt;/ref&gt; One thus can distinguish between fear (an emotion, a feeling of alarm or dread caused by an awareness or expectation of danger) and some broader anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Warr, M. (2000). Fear of crime in the United States: Avenues for research and policy. Criminal Justice, 4: 451—489.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sacco, V. (2005). When Crime Waves, Sage Publications/Pine Forge Press, Thousand Oaks, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; However it should be noted that some people may be more willing to admit their worries and vulnerabilities than others.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. M., &amp; Farrall, S.D.  (2005). Gender, socially desirable responding and the fear of crime: Are women really more anxious about crime? British Journal of Criminology, 45, 212-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive aspects of fear of crime==
Concern about crime can be differentiated from perceptions of the risk of personal victimization (i.e. cognitive aspects of fear of crime). Concern about crime includes public assessments of the size of the crime problem&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. An example of a question that could be asked is whether crime has increased, decreased or stayed the same in a certain period (and/or in a certain area, for instance the respondents own neighborhood). Between 1972 and 2001, the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup Poll]] shows that American respondents think crime has decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderveen, G. (2006). Interpreting Fear, Crime, Risk and Unsafety. BJU Legal Publishers, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the cognitive side of fear of crime includes public perceptions of the likelihood of falling victim, public senses of control over the possibility, and public estimations of the seriousness of the consequences of crime. People who feel especially vulnerable to [[victimization]] are likely to feel that they are especially likely to be targeted by criminals (i.e. victimization is likely), that they are unable to control the possibility (i.e. they have low self-efficacy), and that the consequences would be especially severe.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. (2009). A Psychological Perspective on Vulnerability in the Fear of Crime. Psychology, Crime and Law, 15, 4, 365-390.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these three different components of risk perception may interact: the impact of perceived likelihood on subsequent emotional response (worry, fear, anxiety, etc.) is likely to be especially strong among those who feel that consequences are high and self-efficacy is low.&lt;ref&gt;Warr, M. (1987). Fear of victimisation and sensitivity to risk. Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 3, 29-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral aspects of fear of crime==
A third way to measure fear of crime is to ask people whether they ever avoid certain areas, protect certain objects or take preventive measures. This way, measuring fear of crime can become a relatively straightforward thing, because the questions asked tap into actual behavior and 'objective' facts, such as the amount of money spent on a burglar-alarm or extra locks. Although, some researchers such as Jesse Omoregie argue that measuring fear of crime can be problematic as there are various factors like social desirability effects, respondents downplaying or over-exaggerating their fear which can affect the reliability of data&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Some degree of 'fear' might be healthy for some people, creating a 'natural defence' against crime. In short, when the risk of crime is real, a specific level of 'fear' might actually be 'functional': worry about crime might stimulate precaution which then makes people feel safer and lowers their risk of crime. The fear of crime is a very important feature in criminology.

==The influence of public perceptions of neighborhood breakdown and stability==
Perhaps the biggest influence on fear of crime is public concern about neighbourhood disorder, social cohesion and collective efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. &amp; Taylor, R. (1996). Ecological assessments of community disorder: Their relationship to fear of crime and theoretical implications. American Journal of Community Psychology, 24, 63-107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wyant, B.R. (2008). Multilevel impacts of perceived incivilities and perceptions of crime risk on fear of crime isolating endogenous impacts. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 45, 39-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence and risk of crime has become linked with perceived problems of social stability, moral consensus, and the collective informal control processes that underpin the social order of a neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Bannister, J. (1993). Locating fear: Environmental and ontological security. In H. Jones (Ed.), Crime and the urban environment  (pp. 69-84). Aldershot: Avebury.&lt;/ref&gt; Such 'day-to-day' issues ('young people hanging around', 'poor community spirit', 'low levels of trust and cohesion') produce information about risk and generate a sense of unease, insecurity and distrust in the environment (incivilities signal a lack of conventional courtesies and low-level social order in public places).&lt;ref&gt;Innes, M. (2004) Signal crimes and signal disorders: Notes on deviance as communicative action. British Journal of Sociology, 55, 317-334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch, M. (2003). Combining classificatory and discursive methods: Consistency and variability in responses to the threat of crime. British Journal of Social Psychology, 42(3), 461-476.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1971) Relations in Public. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many people express through their fear of crime some broader concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of [[moral authority]], and the crumbling of civility and social capital.&lt;ref name="Girling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrall, S., Jackson, J. and Gray, E. (2009). 'Social Order and Fear of Crime in Contemporary Times', Oxford: Oxford University Press, Clarendon Studies in Criminology.&lt;/ref&gt;

People can come to different conclusions about the same social and physical environment: two individuals who live next door to each other and share the same neighbourhood can view local disorder quite differently.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho, I. &amp; Lewis, D. A. (2003). Beyond community:  Reactions to crime and disorder among inner-city residents. Criminology, 41, 779-812.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, R. J. and Raudenbush, S. W. (2004). Seeing Disorder: Neighborhood Stigma and the Social Construction of "Broken Windows". Social Psychology Quarterly 67: 319-342.&lt;/ref&gt; Why might people have different levels of tolerance or sensitivity to these potentially ambiguous cues? UK research has suggested that broader social anxieties about the pace and direction of social change may shift levels of tolerance to ambiguous stimuli in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. (2004) 'Experience and Expression: Social and Cultural Significance in the Fear of Crime.' British Journal of Criminology, 44, 6, 946-966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrall, S., Jackson, J. and Gray, E. (October 2009). 'Social Order and the Fear of Crime in Contemporary Times'. Oxford: Oxford University Press, Clarendon Studies in Criminology.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who hold more authoritarian views about law and order, and who are especially concerned about a long-term deterioration of community, may be more likely to perceive disorder in their environment (net of the actual conditions of that environment). They may also be more likely to link these physical cues to problems of social cohesion and consensus, of declining quality of social bonds and informal social control.

==Interpersonal communication and the mass media==
[[File:Black news day (14390694137).jpg|thumb|Full front pages of Japanese newspapers about a crime that left 3 injured]]
Hearing about events; knowing others who have been victimised– these are thought to raise perceptions of the risk of victimisation.&lt;ref name="Skogan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, T. R. (1984) 'Assessing the risk of crime victimization: The integration of personal victimization experience and socially transmitted information.' Journal of Social Issues, 40, 27-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, T.R. (1980) 'Impact of Directly and Indirectly Experienced Events: The Origin of Crime-related Judgements and Behaviours' Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 39:13-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Covington, J. and Taylor, R. B. (1991). "Fear of Crime in Urban Residential Neighbourhoods: Implications of Between- and Within- Neighborhood Sources for Current Models. The Sociological Quarterly, 32, 2, 231-249.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been described as a 'crime multiplier', or processes operating in the residential environment that would 'spread' the impacts of criminal events.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R. B. and Hale, M. (1986). "Testing Alternative Models of Fear of Crime". The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and Police Science, 77, 1, 151-189. (This Journal later changed its name to Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology)&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence exists that hearing of friends' or neighbours' victimisation increases anxiety that indirect experiences of crime may play a stronger role in anxieties about victimisation than direct experience. However, there is a cautionary note: '… many residents of a neighbourhood only know of [crime] indirectly via channels that may inflate, deflate, or garble the picture.'&lt;ref&gt;Skogan, W. (1986) '[http://www.skogan.org/files/Fear.of.Crime.and.Neighborhood.Change.1986.pdf Fear of crime and neighborhood change]'. Crime and Justice, 8, 203-229.&lt;/ref&gt; A subject's criminal risk perception is exaggerated by peer-communication on crime and only moderated by the own experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brain-gain.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59%3Aexperience-and-communication-as-factors-explaining-criminal-risk-perception&amp;catid=56%3Acat-crime-perception&amp;Itemid=92&amp;lang=de{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public perceptions of the risk of crime are no doubt also strongly shaped by mass media coverage. Individuals pick up from media and interpersonal communication circulating images of the criminal event - the perpetrators, victims, motive, and representations of consequential, uncontrollable, and sensational crimes. The notion of 'stimulus similarity' may be key: if the reader of a newspaper identifies with the described victim, or feels that their own neighbourhood bears resemblance to the one described, then the image of risk may be taken up, personalised and translated into personal safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Winkel, F. W. &amp; Vrij, A. (1990). Fear of crime and mass media crime reports: Testing similarity hypotheses. International Review of Victimology, 1, 251-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the relationship between fear of crime and [[mass media]] is unclear, at least in its causal ordering. To put the dilemma in simple terms: do people fear crime because a lot of crime is being shown on television, or does television just provide footage about crimes because people fear crime and want to see what's going on? The complex nature of crime could allow the media to exploit social naivety, covering crime not only selective, but also distorting the everyday world of crime.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, K. (1995). Fear of Crime, Interpreting Victimisation Risk. State University of New York press, Albany.&lt;/ref&gt; Some say the media contribute to the climate of fear that is created, because the actual frequency of victimisation is a tiny fraction of potential crime.{{ref label|Ferraro1995|2|a}}

With crime accounting for up to 25 per cent&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, M. Morgan, R. and Reiner, R. (1997). Oxford Handbook of Criminology. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; of news coverage, the quality and angle of the coverage becomes an issue. The media displays violent crime disproportionately, whilst neglecting minor crimes. The reality is violent crime has been declining in the past 10 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/violent-crime |title=FBI — Violent Crime |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profile of offenders in the media is distorted, causing misunderstanding of criminal offending.

Unfortunately, however, despite an abundant literature on media effects – particularly the 'mean world' hypothesis – little work has been done into how representations, imagery and symbols of crime circulate in society, transmitted and transformed by multiple actors with a wide array of effects, only to translate into personal fears about crime. Perhaps future work will take account of the transmission mechanisms through which representations, beliefs and attitudes about societal risks are propagated in different social and cultural contexts.

==Fear of crime as socially constructed==

Fear of crime can also be understood from a [[social constructionist]] perspective.&lt;ref name="Lee_a"&gt;Lee, M. (2007). Inventing Fear of Crime: Criminology and the Politics of Anxiety. Willan, Collumpton.&lt;/ref&gt; The term and concept of fear of crime did not, for example, enter the public or political lexicon until the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, M. (2001). The Genesis of Fear of Crime. Theoretical Criminology (5) 4&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say individuals did not fear crime victimization prior to this period, clearly they did at various points in history to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, G. (1983). Hooligan : A History of Respectable Fears. London: Macmillan Press Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chevalier, L. (1973). Labouring Classes and Dangerous Classes in Paris in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century. New York: Howard Festig.&lt;/ref&gt; However it demonstrates that fear of crime only became part of a political economy when researchers began to measure and analyse it under the auspice of The US President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice which reported in 1967 &lt;ref&gt;Ennis, P. (1967). Criminal Victimisation in the United States: A Report of a National Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biderman, A. D., Johnson, L. A., McIntyre, J. and Weir, A. W.  (1967).

The Fear of Crime and Self-Governance: Towards a Genealogy. The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology, 32(3), 227-246&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a 'fear of crime feedback loop' then allowed more citizens to be surveyed as fearful, more politicians to be able to use crime fear as a political issue, security products to be sold on the back of crime fear and so on in an ever-increasing spiral that popularised crime fear.&lt;ref name="Lee_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; Moreover, once citizens were seen as being motivated by concerns about crime fear of crime could be used as a responsibilising technique to activate citizens to conduct themeselves or consume products in ways that reduce their vulnerability to crime victimisation.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, D. (2001). Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society. Chicago: The Chicage University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, M. (2007). Inventing Fear of Crime:and the Politics of Anxiety. Willan, Collumpton.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to understanding fear of crime does not deny the experiences of individuals who fear crime victimisation but suggests that such experiences have to be understood as being intimately connected to broader socio-political contexts.

{{Feminism sidebar |Variants (general)}}
'''Feminism of the 99%''' ('''F99''') is a contemporary, [[grassroots]], [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] movement, which recognises [[intersectionality]] and advocates activism for and by all women - including those who have been overlooked by other feminist movements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was proposed by a collective of prominent American feminists in an appeal published in Viewpoint Magazine in February 2017, and built upon the mobilisation of women seen in [[2017 Women's March|the 2017 Women’s March]] in January. The appeal simultaneously called for an [[International Women's Strike|International Women’s Strike]] on 8 March 2017. It is a successor to the accumulated intellectual legacy of feminist movements such as [[radical feminism]], [[Marxist feminism]], [[Black feminism]] and [[Decolonial feminism|transnational/decolonial feminism]], and asserts that [[Oppression|gender oppression]] is not caused by a single factor, [[sexism]]. They insist that it is rather a multifaceted product of the intersections of [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[colonialism]] and [[capitalism]].

==Background==
The demand for a Feminism of the 99% was published in Viewpoint Magazine on the 3@th of February 2017. It was made in response to the mass mobilisation of women seen in the [[2017 Women's March|2017 Women’s March]]  – a worldwide protest on 21 January 2017, protesting the inauguration of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]] and advocating for [[Women's rights|women’s rights]]'','' [[human rights]] and policy reform. The authors cite the Argentinian movement [[Ni una menos|Ni Una Menos]] as their inspiration, as it too is a [[Fourth-wave feminism|fourth-wave]] [[grassroots]] movement which aims to address [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] issues.  Aiming to build on the momentum of the Women’s March, the authors call attention to what they see as the failures of contemporary feminist movements such as lean-in feminism, which they argue have failed the “overwhelming majority” of women who “do not have access to individual self-promotion and advancement and whose conditions of life can be improved only through policies that defend social reproduction, secure reproductive justice, and guarantee labor rights”. They further argue that the conditions of life of women have deteriorated over the last 30 years due to [[Corporate globalization|corporate globalisation]] and [[Capitalism|capitalist]] systems, especially those of colour, of [[working class]], of [[Migrant worker|migrant]] backgrounds or who are [[Unemployment|unemployed]].

== Key criticisms and demands ==
F99 criticises other contemporary feminist movements, such as lean-in feminism and corporate feminism, for only serving the privileged top 1% of women. It holds the logic that women are able to succeed in their career as long as they work to serve the benefit of the [[patriarchy]], and that this relies on these women having access to resources and opportunities that most women are unable to access. The authors of the appeal recognise the need for a feminist movement which serves the needs of the many, and calls attention to the women who are overlooked by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] feminism. However, they call for the movement to look beyond just issues of [[gender]], criticising a number of key issues and movements including: racialized gender violence, the failings of neoliberalism, attacks on [[Labor rights|labour rights]] and the undervaluing of labour; reproductive injustices; [[homophobia]]; [[transphobia]]; and [[xenophobia]]. The aim of the movement is to contribute to what its creators see as a “a new international feminist movement with an expanded agenda–at once [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]], [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], anti-heterosexist, and anti-neoliberal”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Related Movements==
Feminism of the 99% has ideological groundings consistent with different but distinct feminist groups. Best understood as a rejection of a perceived failure of mainstream [[liberal feminism]], Feminism of the 99% seeks to combine the positions of anti-racism, anti-sexism, and anti-neoliberalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/02/03/beyond-lean-in-for-a-feminism-of-the-99-and-a-militant-international-strike-on-march-8/|title=Beyond Lean-In: For a Feminism of the 99% and a Militant International Strike on March 8 - Viewpoint Magazine|date=3 February 2017|work=Viewpoint Magazine|access-date=24 October 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825212601/https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/02/03/beyond-lean-in-for-a-feminism-of-the-99-and-a-militant-international-strike-on-march-8/#|archive-date=25 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so Feminism of the 99% is linked very closely to existing feminist movements globally.

=== Intersectional Feminist Thought ===
[[Intersectionality#Feminist thought|Intersectional feminist thought]] holds that the lived experience of oppression cannot simply be observed through a single lens of identity: that it’s the combinations of identity expressions, and the kind of experience afforded together that provide a more accurate picture of the hierarchies under which one operates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Brittney|date=1 February 2016|title=Intersectionality|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199328581-e-20|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199328581-e-20|journal=|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903013507/http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199328581-e-20#|archive-date=3 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersectionality considers that various forms of [[social stratification]], such as class, race, sexual orientation, age, disability and gender, do not exist separately from each other but are interwoven together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Feminism for the 99% embraces this framework on a fundamental level, and purports that meaningful change must originate from those who experience it firsthand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Black Feminism ===
[[Black feminism]] is a school of thought stating that [[sexism]], [[class oppression]], gender identity and racism are inextricably bound together.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7459645|title=Women, race, &amp; class|last=1944-|first=Davis, Angela Y.

A point of difference between the two movement is that feminism for the 99% has a defined strategy for change, taking inspiration from ''[[Ni una menos|Ni Una Menos]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Socialist Feminism ===
[[Socialist feminism]] is feminism that focuses upon the interconnectivity of the [[patriarchy]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Elizabeth Lapovsky|date=2008|title=Socialist Feminism: What Difference Did It Make to the History of Women's Studies?|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20459218|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=34|issue=3|pages=497–525|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926133851/https://www.jstor.org/stable/20459218#|archive-date=26 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism of the 99% frequently parallels with Socialist Feminism given their similar critical assessments of capitalism,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the role of domestic work and social reproduction theory.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marxismocritico.com/2017/10/17/what-is-social-reproduction-theory/|title="What is social reproduction theory?": Tithi Bhattacharya|date=17 October 2017|access-date=24 October 2018|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela Davis]], as one of the keystone ideological sources of feminism for the 99%’s ideological perspective holds [[liberal feminism]] in contempt for its failure to address the concerns of women perceived to be betrayed by their class position: “If standards for feminism are created for those who have already ascended the economic hierarchies of feminism, how is this relevant to women at the bottom?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AfroMarxist|title=Angela Davis Criticizes "Mainstream Feminism" / Bourgeois  Feminism|date=8 January 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzQkVfO9ToQ|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318203818/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzQkVfO9ToQ#|archive-date=18 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words: Davis criticises liberal feminists for acting primarily in the interests of women privileged from race-based and class-based disadvantage.

[[Tithi Bhattacharya]], another key signatory of the feminism for the 99% manifesto, has expanded on [[social reproduction]] theory within the context of gender, providing a marxist analysis of gender disparate divisions of labor as an integral part of the capitalist [[mode of production]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, Bhattacharya suggests that the unpaid acts of childbirth, child-rearing, and domestic duties are themselves acts of productive labor, acted within an as exploitative context consistent with marxist [[Labor theory of value#Karl Marx|labor theory]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A key point, is that these acts are disparately the role of women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In stark contrast to Liberal Feminism, feminism for the 99% holds that effective and meaningful change comes from a non-reformist perspective: that revolutionary change necessitates a more utopian vision.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Feminism for the 99% holds that incremental adjustment of an existing unjust and oppressive hierarchy will never precipitate a just society. To this end, a change from the ground up is required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ni Una Menos ===
The Feminism of the 99% manifesto specifically cites [[Ni una menos|Ni Una Menos]] as a source of inspiration for the movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, the use of a mass strike of all women as the main form of political activism. On 8 March 2017 ([[International Women's Day|International Women’s Day]]), activists across the feminist continuum organised the International Women’s Strike (known in the US as  the Day Without Women),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/womens-strike-march-8.html|title=On March 8, Women Will Go on Strike|last=Evans|first=Dayna|work=The Cut|access-date=24 October 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325221418/https://www.thecut.com/2017/02/womens-strike-march-8.html#|archive-date=25 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2017 Women’s March.

A '''flour sack''' or '''flour bag''' is a cloth [[bag|sack]], usually made of cheap cotton, used to store [[flour]]. Flour sacks are often printed with simple designs and trademarks to indicate the [[miller]]s and companies making or selling the flour.

==Place names==
Various place names were named after flour sacks, since they were so ubiquitous in so many cultures. [[Blatobulgium]] in Scotland, and [[Pieniężno]] in Poland, for example, are possibly named after words for ''flour sack'' in different languages. The all-white tower in the old city of [[Ravensburg]] in Germany is called ''Mehlsack''.

==Reuel Colt Gridley==
[[File:Reuel Colt Gridley circa 1864.jpg|right|thumbnail|A photo of Reuel Colt Gridley, who became famous in the United States in 1864 by repeatedly selling a sack of flour to raise money for the "Sanitary Fund" (to help wounded U.S. Civil War veterans). This picture was reportedly published in ''Harper's Weekly'' in 1865.]]
[[Reuel Colt Gridley]] famously carried a 50-pound bag of flour on his shoulder after losing a political bet in [[Austin, Nevada]]. The sack of flour was later auctioned off, then re-donated, then re-auctioned again and again to raise money for the [[United States Sanitary Commission]] during the American Civil War. Auctioning this single flour sack eventually raised more than $250,000.

==Clothing==
[[File:Near East relief american flour sacks and the Armenians in syria.png|thumbnail|right|Children's clothing made from the Near East relief flour sacks is a common sight among Armenian refugees in Syria.]]
By the late 19th century, flour sacks were often printed in various colors and designs, and recycled for clothing and other purposes. "With feed sacks and flour bags, farmwomen took thriftiness to new heights of creativity, transforming the humble bags into dresses, underwear, towels, curtains, quilts, and other household necessities."{{attribution needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1105750 "Feedsack Dress"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because they came along with the purchase of essential flour, flour sacks were universally recycled and used by many cultures as a source of free textiles for clothing and other necessities. For refugees, the free cloth that came with flour helped replace worn-out and inadequate clothing.

===Chinese clothing===
During the early parts of the 20th century, Chinese workers made clothing from flour sacks, sometimes called "Hunger clothes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm15799.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll123/id/51801 Unidentified.

===Depression clothing===
During the Great Depression in the US, many families sewed clothing from discarded flour sacks. Often flour would be purchased according to the patterns printed on the bag.&lt;ref&gt;Banning, Jennifer Lynn. [http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-06232005-162008/ "Feed Sack Fashions in South Louisiana, 1949–1968: The Use of Commodity Bags in Garment Construction."] Baton Rouge, La.: Louisiana State University, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacks had so many uses, and the clothing made from them was so common, that flour sacks entered the local folklore. Kendra Brandes found that "as an element of material culture, the clothing and clothing practices of rural populations reflect the life and times of the era to the same extent as that of the general population. However, it is the activities of these farm wives, clothing their families in feed sacks, that offer a view of life that was unique to rural communities during this time period."&lt;ref&gt;Kendra Brandes. [https://dx.doi.org/10.4148/ojrrp.v4i1.59 "Feed Sack Fashion in Rural America: A Reflection of Culture."] ''Online Journal of Rural Research &amp; Policy''. Kansas State University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people from rural Virginia spoke about their clothes made from sacks during the depression. "Back then, feed was sold in sacks. I believe they held almost 100 pounds of seeds. A number of farmers who didn't sew returned the sacks for resale... I actually made hair bows, pants and dresses from the sacks." "Mama always sewed on a Singer treadle sewing machine and made our dresses from flour sacks. She made sure Dad would get two sacks just alike. That was what the pattern took to make the dresses right." "Mama made me pinafores out of flour sacks. Flour sacks were made of cotton with pretty prints." "Dresses made for my sister and me were sometimes made out of cotton feed bags (I guess my brothers were lucky)." "My mother made shirts out of feed sacks, which a lot of cow feed, came in."&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Todd, and Karen Garvey. ''Flour Sack Dresses and Victory Stamps: Tales from the Good Old Days in Roanoke and the New River Valley of Virginia: a Treasury of 20th Century Memories''. 2016. Pages 63, 117, 134, 161, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 3.5 million women and children wore flour sack clothing during the Great Depression. It just became a way of life, as times were very hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Flour Sack Towels - from 1800's to 1950's [sic]|url=https://www.floursacktowels.com/blogs/news/history-of-flour-sack-towels-from-1800s-to-1950s/|website=Mary's Kitchen flour sack towels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10023">In [[mathematics]], the '''gluing axiom''' is introduced to define what a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] ''F'' on a [[topological space]] ''X'' must satisfy, given that it is a [[presheaf]], which is by definition a [[contravariant functor]]

:''F'': ''O''(''X'') &amp;rarr; ''C''

to a category ''C'' which initially one takes to be the [[category of sets]]. Here ''O''(''X'') is the [[partial order]] of [[open set]]s of ''X'' ordered by [[inclusion map]]s; and considered as a category in the standard way, with a unique [[morphism]]

:''U'' &amp;rarr; ''V''

if ''U'' is a [[subset]] of ''V'', and none otherwise.

As phrased in the [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] article, there is a certain axiom that ''F'' must satisfy, for any [[open cover]] of an open set of ''X''. For example, given open sets ''U'' and ''V'' with [[union (set theory)|union]] ''X'' and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] ''W'', the required condition is that

:''F''(''X'') is the subset of ''F''(''U'')&amp;times;''F''(''V'') with equal image in ''F''(''W'').

In less formal language, a [[Section (category theory)|section]] ''s'' of ''F'' over ''X'' is equally well given by a pair of sections (''s''&amp;prime;,''s''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) on ''U'' and ''V'' respectively, which 'agree' in the sense that ''s''&amp;prime; and ''s''&amp;prime;&amp;prime; have a common image in ''F''(''W'') under the respective restriction maps

:''F''(''U'') &amp;rarr; ''F''(''W'')

and

:''F''(''V'') &amp;rarr; ''F''(''W'').

The first major hurdle in sheaf theory is to see that this ''gluing'' or ''patching'' axiom is a correct abstraction from the usual idea in geometric situations. For example, a [[vector field]] is a section of a [[tangent bundle]] on a [[smooth manifold]]; this says that a vector field on the union of two open sets is (no more and no less than) vector fields on the two sets that agree where they overlap.

Given this basic understanding, there are further issues in the theory, and some will be addressed here. A different direction is that of the [[Grothendieck topology]], and yet another is the logical status of 'local existence' (see [[Kripke–Joyal semantics]]).

==Removing restrictions on ''C''==
To rephrase this definition in a way that will work in any category ''C'' that has sufficient structure, we note that we can write the objects and morphisms involved in the definition above in a diagram which we will call (G), for "gluing":

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal F}(U)\rightarrow\prod_i{\mathcal F}(U_i){{{} \atop \longrightarrow}\atop{\longrightarrow \atop {}}}\prod_{i,j}{\mathcal F}(U_i\cap U_j)&lt;/math&gt;

Here the first map is the product of the restriction maps

:res&lt;sub&gt;''U'',''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',&lt;/sub&gt;:''F(U)''&amp;rarr;''F(U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)''

and each pair of arrows represents the two restrictions

:res&lt;sub&gt;''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;cap;''U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;:''F(U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)''&amp;rarr;''F(U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;cap;''U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)''

and

:res&lt;sub&gt;''U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'',''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;cap;''U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;:''F(U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)''&amp;rarr;''F(U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;cap;''U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)''.

It is worthwhile to note that these maps exhaust all of the possible restriction maps among ''U'', the ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''∩''U&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The condition for ''F'' to be a sheaf is exactly that ''F'' is the [[Limit (category theory)|limit]] of the diagram.  This suggests the correct form of the gluing axiom:

:A presheaf ''F'' is a sheaf if for any open set ''U'' and any collection of open sets {''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;isin;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; whose union is ''U'', ''F''(''U'') is the limit of the diagram (G) above.

One way of understanding the gluing axiom is to notice that "un-applying" ''F'' to (G) yields the following diagram:

:&lt;math&gt;\coprod_{i,j}U_i\cap U_j{{{} \atop \longrightarrow}\atop{\longrightarrow \atop {}}}\coprod_iU_i\rightarrow U&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''U'' is the [[colimit]] of this diagram. The gluing axiom says that ''F'' turns colimits of such diagrams into limits.

==Sheaves on a basis of open sets==
In some categories, it is possible to construct a sheaf by specifying only some of its sections.  Specifically, let ''X'' be a topological space with [[basis of a topological space|basis]] {''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;.  We can define a category ''O''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;(''X'') to be the full subcategory of ''O''(''X'') whose objects are the {''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}.  A '''B-sheaf''' on ''X'' with values in '''C''' is a contravariant functor

:''F'': ''O''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;(''X'') &amp;rarr; '''C'''

which satisfies the gluing axiom for sets in ''O''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;(''X'').  That is, on a selection of open sets of ''X'', ''F'' specifies all of the sections of a sheaf, and on the other open sets, it is undetermined.

B-sheaves are equivalent to sheaves (that is, the category of sheaves is equivalent to the category of B-sheaves).&lt;ref&gt;Vakil, [http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGjun1113public.pdf Math 216: Foundations of algebraic geometry], 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clearly a sheaf on ''X'' can be restricted to a B-sheaf.  In the other direction, given a B-sheaf ''F'' we must determine the sections of ''F'' on the other objects of ''O''(''X'').  To do this, note that for each open set ''U'', we can find a collection {''B''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; whose union is ''U''.  Categorically speaking, this choice makes ''U'' the colimit of the full subcategory of ''O''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;(''X'') whose objects are {''B''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since ''F'' is contravariant, we define ''F''&amp;prime;(''U'') to be the [[projective limit|limit]] of the {''F''(''B'')}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to the restriction maps.  (Here we must assume that this limit exists in '''C'''.)  If ''U'' is a basic open set, then ''U'' is a terminal object of the above subcategory of ''O''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;(''X''), and hence ''F''&amp;prime;(''U'') = ''F''(''U'').  Therefore, ''F''&amp;prime; extends ''F'' to a presheaf on ''X''.  It can be verified that ''F''&amp;prime; is a sheaf, essentially because every element of every open cover of ''X'' is a union of basis elements (by the definition of a basis), and every pairwise intersection of elements in an open cover of ''X'' is a union of basis elements (again by the definition of a basis).

==The logic of ''C''==
The first needs of sheaf theory were for sheaves of [[abelian group]]s; so taking the category ''C'' as the [[category of abelian groups]] was only natural. In applications to geometry, for example [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic geometry]], the idea of a ''sheaf of [[local ring]]s'' is central. This, however, is not quite the same thing; one speaks instead of a [[locally ringed space]], because it is not true, except in trite cases, that such a sheaf is a functor into a [[category of local rings]]. It is the ''stalks'' of the sheaf that are local rings, not the collections of ''sections'' (which are [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], but in general are not close to being ''local''). We can think of a locally ringed space ''X'' as a parametrised family of local rings, depending on ''x'' in ''X''.

A more careful discussion dispels any mystery here. One can speak freely of a sheaf of abelian groups, or rings, because those are [[algebraic structure]]s (defined, if one insists, by an explicit [[signature (logic)|signature]]). Any category ''C'' having [[product (category theory)|finite product]]s supports the idea of a [[group object]], which some prefer just to call a group ''in'' ''C''. In the case of this kind of purely algebraic structure, we can talk ''either'' of a sheaf having values in the category of abelian groups, or an ''abelian group in the category of sheaves of sets''; it really doesn't matter.

In the local ring case, it does matter. At a foundational level we must use the second style of definition, to describe what a local ring means in a category. This is a logical matter: axioms for a local ring require use of [[existential quantification]], in the form that for any ''r'' in the ring, one of ''r'' and 1 &amp;minus; ''r'' is [[invertible]]. This allows one to specify what a 'local ring in a category' should be, in the case that the category supports enough structure.

==Sheafification==
To turn a given presheaf ''P'' into a sheaf ''F'', there is a standard device called '''''sheafification''''' or '''''sheaving'''''. The rough intuition of what one should do, at least for a presheaf of sets, is to introduce an equivalence relation, which makes equivalent data given by different covers on the overlaps by refining the covers. One approach is therefore to go to the [[Stalk of a sheaf#Stalks of a sheaf|stalk]]s and recover the [[sheaf space]] of the ''best possible'' sheaf ''F'' produced from ''P''.

This use of language strongly suggests that we are dealing here with [[adjoint functors]]. Therefore, it makes sense to observe that the sheaves on ''X'' form a [[full subcategory]] of the presheaves on ''X''. Implicit in that is the statement that a [[morphism of sheaves]] is nothing more than a [[natural transformation]] of the sheaves, considered as functors. Therefore, we get an abstract characterisation of sheafification as [[left adjoint]] to the inclusion. In some applications, naturally, one does need a description.

In more abstract language, the sheaves on ''X'' form a [[reflective subcategory]] of the presheaves (Mac Lane–[[Ieke Moerdijk|Moerdijk]] ''Sheaves in Geometry and Logic'' p.&amp;nbsp;86). In [[topos theory]], for a [[Lawvere–Tierney topology]] and its sheaves, there is an analogous result (ibid. p.&amp;nbsp;227).

==Other gluing axioms==
The gluing axiom of sheaf theory is rather general. One can note that the [[Mayer–Vietoris axiom]] of [[homotopy theory]], for example, is a special case.

'''Grothendieck's relative point of view''' is a [[heuristic]] applied in certain abstract [[mathematical]] situations, with a rough meaning of taking for consideration families of 'objects' explicitly depending on [[parameter]]s, as the basic field of study, rather than a single such object. It is named after [[Alexander Grothendieck]], who made extensive use of it in treating foundational aspects of [[algebraic geometry]]. Outside that field, it has been influential particularly on [[category theory]] and [[categorical logic]].

In the usual formulation, the language of category theory is applied, to describe the point of view as treating, not [[object (category theory)|objects]] ''X''  of a given category ''C'' as such, but [[morphism]]s

:''f'': ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''S''

where ''S'' is a fixed object. This idea is made formal in the idea of the [[slice category]] of objects of ''C'' 'above' S. To move from one slice to another requires a '''base change'''; from a technical point of view base change becomes a major issue for the whole approach (see for example [[Beck–Chevalley conditions]]).

A base change 'along' a given morphism

:''g'': ''T'' &amp;rarr; ''S''

is typically given by the [[fiber product]], producing an object over ''T'' from one over ''S''. The 'fiber' terminology is significant: the underlying heuristic is that ''X'' over ''S'' is a family of fibers, one for each 'point' of ''S''; the fiber product is then the family on ''T'', which described by fibers is for each point of ''T'' the fiber at its image in ''S''. This set-theoretic language is too naïve to fit the required context, certainly, from algebraic geometry. It combines, though, with the use of the [[Yoneda lemma]] to replace the 'point' idea with that of treating an object, such as ''S'', as 'as good as' the [[representable functor]] it sets up.

The [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] from about 1956 is usually cited as the key moment for the introduction of this circle of ideas. The more classical types of [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] are recovered in the case where ''S'' is a single point (i.e. the [[final object]] in the working category ''C'').  Using other ''S'' is a way to have versions of theorems 'with parameters', i.e. allowing for continuous variation, for which the 'frozen' version reduces the parameters to [[Coefficient|constants]].

In other applications, this way of thinking has been used in [[topos theory]], to clarify the role of [[set theory]] in foundational matters. Assuming that we don’t have a commitment to one 'set theory' (all toposes are in some sense equally set theories for some [[intuitionistic logic]]) it is possible to state everything relative to some given set theory that acts as a base topos.

'''Harvey Luskin Molotch''' (born January 3, 1940) is an American [[sociologist]] known for studies that have reconceptualized power relations in interaction, the mass media, and the city.  He helped create the field of [[environmental sociology]] and has advanced [[qualitative methods]] in the [[social sciences]].  In recent years, Molotch helped develop a new field—the sociology of objects. He is currently a professor of [[Sociology]] and of Metropolitan Studies at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/faculty-highlights/harvey-molotch.html&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Introduction to Sociology'' is featured as one of NYU Open Education's courses available to stream freely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/coursesnew/intro-sociology.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other courses that he teaches include ''Approaches to Metropolitan Studies'' and ''Urban Objects''. He is also affiliated with the graduate program in Humanities and Social Thought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.draper.fas.nyu.edu/object/draper.people.mastersteachers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Molotch was born Harvey Luskin in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where his family was in the retail car business on one side and the [[Luskin's]] home appliance business on the other. His father, Paul Luskin, died in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in 1944 during [[World War II]].  His mother remarried to Nathan Molotch. He received a B.A. in Philosophy from the [[University of Michigan]] (1963), with a thesis on [[John Dewey]]. He received an M.A. (1966) and Ph.D. (1968) in Sociology from the [[University of Chicago]]. He served in the [[U.S. Army]], stationed in [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]], 1961-62.

He taught at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] from 1967 to 2003. He has also been a visiting professor at [[Stony Brook University]], the [[University of Essex]], and [[Northwestern University]]. In 1998-99  he was Centennial Professor at the [[London School of Economics]].

His 1964 marriage to Linda Molotch ended with her death, by car accident, in 1976. The couple had two children, Shana (born 1969), now with two children and living in Northern California; and Noah (born 1972), now with two children and living in Boulder Colorado where he is on faculty at University of Colorado as [[hydrology|hydrological]] scientist, as well as research scientist at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. Molotch has lived with his domestic partner, Glenn Wharton, a conservator at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and faculty member at New York University, since 1979.

==Ideas==
===Racial Segregation: Rethinking “White Flight”===

Molotch's early work on "[[white flight]]" overturned conventional wisdom on neighborhood change, showing that normal mobility makes neighborhood racial change possible. When blacks constitute the bulk of those who move into the vacancies that result, racial change is made inevitable. The implication of this finding, based on Molotch's systematic studies of matched neighborhoods (and since replicated by others on large data sets), was that it is the reluctance of whites to move into a changing neighborhood that makes racial integration so difficult to achieve. From a policy perspective, Molotch concluded that while stabilizing neighborhoods would not be easy, the focus needs to be on getting white people to replace the whites who are leaving, rather than talking people who are leaving into staying.

===The Santa Barbara Oil Spill and Environmental Sociology===

On January 28, 1969, there was a massive eruption of crude oil from Union Oil's Platform A in the [[Santa Barbara Channel]]--an eruption which was to cover much of the coast line of two counties with oil. Molotch saw in this disaster a research opportunity. His article "Oil in Santa Barbara and Power in America" became a founding document of the new field of [[environmental sociology]], and a key contribution to [[political sociology]].

Molotch argued that accident research at the local level might be capable of revealing what political scientists called the "second face of power." This is a dimension of power ordinarily ignored by traditional community studies which fail to concern themselves with the processes by which bias is mobilized and thus how issues rise and fall.

Molotch's findings highlighted the extraordinary intransigence of national institutions in the face of local dissent, but more importantly, pointed out the processes and tactics which undermine that dissent and frustrate and radicalize the dissenters. Molotch called for comparable studies of the agriculture industry, the banking industry, and for more accident research at the local level, which might bring to light the larger social arrangements which structure the parameters of such local debate.  In this way, research at the local level might serve as an avenue to knowledge about ''national'' power.  Molotch ended, "Sociologists should be ready when an accident hits in their neighborhood, and then go to work."

===The Mass Media and the Social Construction Framework===

Molotch helped introduce the [[social constructionism|social construction]] framework to the study of news media.  Whereas news accounts had been treated, however critically, as "failed" representations of a presumed reality, Molotch and Marilyn Lester held that every account is a product of the social organization that goes into its production.  In founding papers in the sociology of the mass media, Molotch and Lester applied the insights of ethnomethodology to the Santa Barbara oil spill and the way it was covered. They argued for an approach to the mass media which does not look for reality, but for practices of those having the power to determine the experience of others.

In addition, Molotch and Lester recognized that this social construction of the news had a crucial political component, a perspective later endorsed by such media sociologists as W. Lance Bennett. In normal times, Molotch and Lester said, the news is merely the ritualized presentation of the stories of powerful corporate and governmental organizations. Only in certain contexts does the veil of this ruling elite consensus get pushed aside to reveal other possible constructions of the facts. Molotch and Lester pointed to such disruptive contexts as scandals and accidents like the Santa Barbara Oil Spill, while Bennett pointed to significant social issues that break through the normally ritualized conflicts of the two political parties.

Molotch's work has inspired studies of the social construction of news, of the particular ways that the content of presentation is contingent on the social setting of its production, including the occupational workplace of news professionals as well as the larger societal setting.  His more recent work on mass media has included studies of war protest and the stock market.

===The City as a Growth Machine===

Molotch is probably best known for his book ''Urban Fortunes'' (1987, with John Logan), which won sociology's most prestigious prize for scholarship in 1990. Urban Fortunes builds on Molotch's 1976 classic paper, "The City as a Growth Machine."  In this body of work, Molotch took the dominant convention of studying urban land use and turned it on its head.  The field of [[urban sociology]] (as well as urban geography, planning, and economics) was dominated by the idea that cities were basically containers for human action, in which actors competed among themselves for the most strategic parcels of land, and the real estate market reflected the state of that competition.  Out of this competition were thought to come the shape of the city and the distribution of social types within it (e.g. banks in the center, affluent residents in the suburbs).  Long established notions such as central place theory and the sectoral hypothesis were claims that are more or less "natural" spatial geography evolved from competitive market activity.

Molotch helped reverse the course of [[urban theory]] by pointing out that land parcels were not empty fields awaiting human action, but were associated with specific interests—commercial, sentimental, and psychological.  Especially important in shaping cities were the real estate interests of those whose properties gain value when growth takes place.  These actors make up what Molotch termed "the local growth machine" -- a term now standard in the urban studies lexicon.  From this perspective, cities need to be studied (and compared) in terms of the organization, lobbying, manipulating, and structuring carried out by these actors.  The outcome—the shape of cities and the distribution of their peoples—is thus not due to an interpersonal market or geographic necessities, but to social actions, including opportunistic dealing. ''Urban Fortunes'' has influenced hundreds of national and international studies.  A twentieth anniversary edition was issued by the University of California Press in 2007 with a new preface.

===Other work===

Molotch has also conducted a series of studies in [[conversation analysis]] on mechanisms such as gaps and silences in human conversation that reveal the way power operates at the micro-interactional level. This work includes  a notable collaboration with Mitchell Duneier on talk between men on the street and women passersby. His research builds on writings of Don Zimmerman, [[Harvey Sacks]], [[Gail Jefferson]], and [[Emanuel Schegloff]]. Molotch was among the first to utilize ethnomethodology and conversation analysis in the study of traditional sociological topics, bridging what had been regarded as a highly esoteric and specialized approach to micro-sociology with mainstream, macro-level sociological issues such as hegemony and power.

More recently in ''Where Stuff Comes From'', Molotch builds on the work of [[Howard S. Becker]] and [[Bruno Latour]], to show how objects and physical artifacts are joint result of various types of actors, most particularly product designers operating within frameworks of technology, regulation, mass tastes, and corporate profits. While neo-Marxists and others have treated "[[commodity fetishism]]" as a signal of oppression, repression, and delusion, he uses goods to understand, in a more comprehensive way, just what makes production happen and how artifacts reveal larger social and cultural forces.

{{distinguish|text=the Hedgehog Concept from ''[[Good to Great]]''}}
The '''hedgehog's dilemma''', or sometimes the '''porcupine dilemma''', is a [[metaphor]] about the challenges of [[human intimacy]]. It describes a situation in which a group of [[hedgehog]]s seek to move close to one another to share heat during cold weather. They must remain apart, however, as they cannot avoid hurting one another with their sharp [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. Though they all share the intention of a close reciprocal relationship, this may not occur, for reasons they cannot avoid.

Both [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] have used this situation to describe what they feel is the state of the individual in relation to others in society. The hedgehog's dilemma suggests that despite goodwill, human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm, and what results is cautious behavior and weak relationships. With the hedgehog's dilemma, one is recommended to use moderation in affairs with others both because of self-interest, as well as out of consideration for others. The hedgehog's dilemma is used to explain [[introversion]] and self-imposed [[Social isolation|isolation]].

==Schopenhauer==
The concept originates in the following parable from the German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[Parerga und Paralipomena]]'', Volume II, Chapter XXXI, Section 396:&lt;ref name="illusion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/26/prochnik.php |title=The Porcupine Illusion |publisher=Cabinetmagazine.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A number of porcupines huddled together for warmth on a cold day in winter; but, as they began to prick one another with their quills, they were obliged to disperse. However the cold drove them together again, when just the same thing happened. At last, after many turns of huddling and dispersing, they discovered that they would be best off by remaining at a little distance from one another. In the same way the need of society drives the human porcupines together, only to be mutually repelled by the many prickly and disagreeable qualities of their nature. The moderate distance which they at last discover to be the only tolerable condition of intercourse, is the code of politeness and fine manners; and those who transgress it are roughly told—in the English phrase—to keep their distance. By this arrangement the mutual need of warmth is only very moderately satisfied; but then people do not get pricked. A man who has some heat in himself prefers to remain outside, where he will neither prick other people nor get pricked himself.}}

==Freud==
It entered the realm of [[psychology]] after the tale was discovered and adopted by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Schopenhauer's tale was quoted by Freud in a footnote to his 1921 work ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' ({{lang-de|Massenpsychologie und Ich-Analyse}}). Freud stated that his trip to the United States in 1919 was because: "I am going to the USA to catch sight of a wild [[porcupine]] and to give some lectures."&lt;ref name="illusion"/&gt;&lt;!--cf. http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=pct.008.0515a--&gt;

==Social psychological research==
The dilemma has received empirical attention within the contemporary [[psychological sciences]]. Jon Maner and his colleagues (Nathan DeWall, [[Roy Baumeister]], and [[Mark Schaller]]) referred to Schopenhauer's "porcupine problem" when interpreting results from experiments examining how people respond to [[ostracism]] and other forms of [[social rejection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Maner2007.pdf |title=Maner, J.K., DeWall, C.N., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Schaller, M. (2007). Does social exclusion motivate interpersonal reconnection? Resolving the 'porcupine problem.' '&amp;#39;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'&amp;#39;, 92, 42–55. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their results revealed that, for people who are chronically anxious, the experience of rejection led people to be relatively unsociable; but among people with more optimistic dispositions, the experience of rejection led to intensified efforts to get close to others. They concluded,
{{quote|This last point is worth remembering when one considers the answer that Schopenhauer himself supplied to the porcupine problem. Schopenhauer suggested that people ultimately feel compelled to retain a safe distance from each other. "By this arrangement," he wrote, "the mutual need for warmth is only very moderately satisfied; but then people do not get pricked" (1851/1964, p. 226). Of course, Schopenhauer was known for his sour temperament&amp;nbsp;– "It is hard to find in his life evidences of any virtue except kindness to animals... In all other respects he was completely selfish" (Russell, 1945, p. 758)&amp;nbsp;– and his philosophy was famous for its pessimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Maner2007.pdf |title= Maner, J.K. ''et al.'' (2007), p. 54. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In Popular Culture==
The parable of the hedgehog's dilemma has been the basis of numerous works of media, including [[Hedgehog's Dilemma (Neon Genesis Evangelion episode)|an episode]] of the show [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]. The award-winning short film [[Henry (2015 film)|''Henry'']] is a modernist version of the hedgehog's dilemma: in this story, the hedgehog eventually finds social comfort through a turtle, that is, a fellow social creature who is invulnerable to the hedgehog's spines. In the context of the original dilemma, this can be taken to represent the need for variability in human social preferences.

In engineering, a '''housing''' is an exterior case or enclosure used to protect an interior mechanism, including integrated fittings or brackets to keep internal components in place. The housing prevents the interior mechanism from being fouled by outside debris or to contain the internal components. Housing may be the body of the device, vital to its function.

==Description==
Housing is an exterior case or enclosure used to protect an interior mechanism. The housing prevents the interior mechanism from being fouled by outside debris. It may also have integrated fittings or brackets to keep internal components in place; sometimes a housing is the body of the device, vital to its function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnE1DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303&amp;lpg=PA303&amp;dq=engine+housing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q0q1aNEfKn&amp;sig=5IFaYJuc-Y2SFB0uRRt744WjgfI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitr5iy8brWAhVCLFAKHWAGCf44ChDoAQhTMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=engine%20housing&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of Automotive Technology|last=Vangelder|first=|date=2017-02-24|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=|isbn=9781284109955|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Basic Components of the Rotary Engine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Housings are most commonly made of metal or plastic.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The design of housing is specific to the item and its use. Housing may provide a number of functions.
===Contamination control===
Housing prevents the interior mechanism from being fouled by outside debris. Housings are sometimes made watertight, especially when the interior mechanisms contain [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=DE | number=3612975C2 |status=grant |title=Watertight housing, especially for the encapsulation of electrical and electronic components |gdate=1989-11-02 |fdate=| pridate=1985-04-29 |invent1=Friedhelm Rose |assign1=Friedhelm Rose |class=| url=https://patents.google.com/patent/DE3612975C2/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Containment===

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Hypermodernity''' ('''supermodernity''') is a type, mode, or stage of [[society]] that reflects an inversion of [[modernity]] in which the function of an object has its reference point in the form of an object rather than function being the reference point for form.  Hypermodernism stipulates a world in which the object has been replaced by the attributes of the object.  The new attribute-driven world is driven by the rise of [[technology]] and aspires to a convergence between technology and [[biology]] and more importantly information and matter.  Hypermodernism finds its validation in [[Technocentrism|emphasis on the value of new technology]] to overcome natural limitations and emphasizes a dismissal of an object-driven past in favor of a flexible, attribute-driven heuristic. 

==Hypermodernity==
Hypermodernity emphasizes a hyperbolic separation between past and present due to the fact that:
# The past oriented attributes and their functions around objects 
# Objects that do exist in the present are only extant due to some useful attribute in the hypermodern era.

Hypermodernity inverts [[Modernity]] to allow the attributes of an object to provide even more individuality than modernism. Modernity trapped form within the bounds of limited function; hypermodernity posits that function is now evolving so rapidly, it must take its reference point from form itself.  Both positive and negative societal changes occur due to hyper-individualism and increased personal choice. 

[[Postmodernity]] rejected the idea of the past as a reference point and curated objects from the past for the sole purpose of freeing form from function.  In postmodernism, truth was ephemeral as the focus was to avoid non-falsifiable tenets. Postmodernity described a total collapse of Modernity and its faith in progress and improvement in empowering the individual.

==Supermodernity==
If distinguished from hypermodernity, '''supermodernity''' is a step beyond the ontological emptiness of [[postmodernism]] and relies upon plausible heuristic truths.  Whereas [[modernism]] focused upon the creation of great truths (or what [[Lyotard]] called "[[master narrative]]s" or "[[metanarrative]]s"), and postmodernity was intent upon their destruction ([[deconstruction]]); supermodernity operates extraneously of meta-truth.  Instead, attributes are extracted from objects of the past based on their present relevance.  Since attributes are both true and false, a  [[truth value]] is not necessary including falsifiability.  Supermodernity curates useful attributes from modern and postmodern objects in order to escape nihilistic postmodern [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].  The touchscreen phone is an excellent example of supermodernism in action. Related authors are [[Terry Eagleton]] ''After Theory'', and [[Marc Augé]] ''Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity''.

'''Proposition:''' If &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; has all equalizers then the &lt;math&gt; e&lt;/math&gt; in the factorization &lt;math&gt; f= m\, e&lt;/math&gt; of ''(1)'' is an [[epimorphism]].

{{Math proof|
Let  &lt;math&gt; \alpha,\, \beta&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt; \alpha\, e =\beta\, e&lt;/math&gt;, one needs to show that  &lt;math&gt; \alpha=\beta&lt;/math&gt;. Since the equalizer of &lt;math&gt; (\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; exists, &lt;math&gt; e&lt;/math&gt; factorizes as &lt;math&gt; e= q\, e'&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; q&lt;/math&gt; monic. But then &lt;math&gt; f= (m\, q)\, e'&lt;/math&gt; is a factorization of &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; (m\, q)&lt;/math&gt; monomorphism. Hence by the universal property of the image there exists a unique arrow &lt;math&gt; v: I \to Eq_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt; m = m\,q\, v&lt;/math&gt; and since  &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; is monic &lt;math&gt;  \text{id}_I = q\, v&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, one has &lt;math&gt; m\, q = (m q v)\,q &lt;/math&gt; and by the monomorphism property of &lt;math&gt; mq&lt;/math&gt; one obtains &lt;math&gt; \text{id}_{Eq_{\alpha,\beta}}= v\, q&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Image:E epimorphism.png|300px|center]]
This means that &lt;math&gt; I \equiv Eq_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and thus that &lt;math&gt; \text{id}_I = q\, v&lt;/math&gt; equalizes &lt;math&gt; (\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;, whence &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \beta&lt;/math&gt;.

== Second definition ==
In a category &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; with all finite [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[colimits]], the '''image''' is defined as the [[Equaliser (mathematics)#In category theory|equalizer]] &lt;math&gt;(Im,m)&lt;/math&gt; of the so-called '''cokernel pair''' &lt;math&gt; (Y \sqcup_X Y, i_1, i_2)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Image, Equalizer of the cokernel pair.png|500px|center]]

'''Remarks:''' 
# Finite bicompleteness of the category ensures that pushouts and equalizers exist.
# &lt;math&gt;(Im,m)&lt;/math&gt; can be called '''regular image''' as &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a [[regular monomorphism]], i.e. the equalizer of a pair of morphism. (Recall also that an equalizer is automatically a monomorphism).
# In an abelian category, the cokernel pair property can be written &lt;math&gt;i_1\, f = i_2\, f\ \Leftrightarrow\ (i_1 - i_2)\, f = 0 = 0\, f &lt;/math&gt; and the equalizer condition &lt;math&gt; i_1\, m = i_2\, m\ \Leftrightarrow\ (i_1 - i_2)\, m = 0 \, m&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, all monomorphisms are regular.

{{Math theorem|If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; always factorizes through regular monomorphisms, then the two definitions coincide.

{{Math proof|

'''First definition implies the second:''' Assume that ''(1)'' holds with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; regular monomorphism.
   &lt;!-- I got the proof from this site, dual statement
   https://qchu.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/regular-and-effective-monomorphisms-and-epimorphisms/
   "Proposition: Let f : a \to b be a morphism with a kernel pair a \times_b a. Then f is a regular epimorphism if and only if it is an effective epimorphism."
   --&gt;
* '''Equalization:''' one needs to show that &lt;math&gt; i_1\, m= i_2\, m&lt;/math&gt; . As the cokernel pair of &lt;math&gt;f,\ i_1\, f= i_2\, f&lt;/math&gt; and by previous proposition, since &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has all equalizers, the arrow &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; in the factorization &lt;math&gt; f= m\, e&lt;/math&gt; is an [[epimorphism]], hence &lt;math&gt; i_1\, f= i_2\, f\ \Rightarrow \ i_1\, m= i_2\, m&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Universality:''' in a category with all colimits (or at least all pushouts) &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; itself admits a cokernel pair &lt;math&gt; (Y \sqcup_{I}Y, c_1, c_2) &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Cokernel pair m.png|450px|center]]
:Moreover, as a regular monomorphism, &lt;math&gt;(I,m)&lt;/math&gt; is the equalizer of a pair of morphisms &lt;math&gt; b_1, b_2: Y \longrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; but we claim here that it is also the equalizer of &lt;math&gt; c_1, c_2: Y \longrightarrow Y \sqcup_{I}Y&lt;/math&gt;. 
:Indeed, by construction &lt;math&gt; b_1\, m = b_2\, m&lt;/math&gt; thus the "cokernel pair" diagram for &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; yields a unique morphism &lt;math&gt; u': Y \sqcup_{I}Y \longrightarrow B &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; b_1 = u'\, c_1,\ b_2 = u'\, c_2&lt;/math&gt;. Now, a map &lt;math&gt; m': I'\longrightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; which equalizes &lt;math&gt; (c_1, c_2)&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies &lt;math&gt; b_1\, m'= u'\, c_1 \, m'= u'\, c_2\, m'= b_2\, m'&lt;/math&gt;, hence by the equalizer diagram for  &lt;math&gt; (b_1, b_2)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique map &lt;math&gt; h': I'\to I &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; m'= m\, h'&lt;/math&gt;.
:Finally, use the cokernel pair diagram (of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;j_1 := c_1,\ j_2 := c_2,\ Z:= Y\sqcup_I Y&lt;/math&gt; : there exists a unique &lt;math&gt; u: Y \sqcup_{X}Y \longrightarrow Y\sqcup_I Y &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; c_1 = u\, i_1,\ c_2 = u\, i_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, any map &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; which equalizes &lt;math&gt; (i_1, i_2)&lt;/math&gt; also equalizes &lt;math&gt; (c_1, c_2)&lt;/math&gt; and thus uniquely factorizes as &lt;math&gt;g= m\, h' &lt;/math&gt;. This exactly means that &lt;math&gt; (I,m) &lt;/math&gt; is the equalizer of &lt;math&gt; (i_1, i_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Second definition implies the first:'''
    &lt;!-- Again, I dualized the proof from
    http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1783932/regular-coimages-in-a-finitely-complete-and-finitely-cocomplete-category --&gt;
* '''Factorization:''' taking &lt;math&gt; m' := f&lt;/math&gt; in the equalizer diagram (&lt;math&gt; m' &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt;), one obtains the factorization &lt;math&gt; f = m\, h &lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Universality:''' let &lt;math&gt; f = m'\, e' &lt;/math&gt; be a factorization with &lt;math&gt;m' &lt;/math&gt; regular monomorphism, i.e. the equalizer of some pair &lt;math&gt; (d_1, d_2) &lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Equalizerd1d2.png|450px|center]]

:Then  &lt;math&gt; d_1\, m'= d_2\, m'\ \Rightarrow \ d_1\, f=d_1\, m'\, e= d_2\, m'\, e= d_2\, f&lt;/math&gt; so that by the "cokernel pair" diagram (of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;), with &lt;math&gt;j_1 := d_1,\ j_2 := d_2,\ Z:= D&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique &lt;math&gt; u'': Y \sqcup_{X}Y \longrightarrow D &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; d_1 = u''\, i_1,\ d_2 = u''\, i_2&lt;/math&gt;.
:Now, from &lt;math&gt; i_1\, m= i_2\, m&lt;/math&gt; (''m'' from the equalizer of (''i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'') diagram), one obtains &lt;math&gt; d_1\, m= u''\, i_1\, m = u''\, i_2\, m = d_2\, m&lt;/math&gt;, hence by the universality in the (equalizer of (''d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'') diagram, with ''f'' replaced by ''m''), there exists a unique &lt;math&gt; v: Im \longrightarrow I'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; m = m'\, v&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
 
In the [[category of sets]] the image of a morphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion from the ordinary [[image (mathematics)|image]] &lt;math&gt;\{f(x) ~|~ x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. In many [[Concrete category|concrete categories]] such as [[Category of groups|groups]], [[Category of abelian groups|abelian groups]] and (left- or right) [[Module (mathematics)|modules]], the image of a morphism is the image of the correspondent morphism in the category of sets.

In any [[normal category]] with a [[zero object]] and [[Kernel (category theory)|kernels]] and [[Cokernel (category theory)|cokernels]] for every morphism, the image of a morphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as follows:
 
:im ''f'' = ker coker ''f''
  
In an [[abelian category]] (which is in particular binormal), if ''f'' is a monomorphism then ''f'' = ker coker ''f'', and so ''f'' = im ''f''.

[[File:Infinite.svg|thumb|200px|right|The [[infinity symbol]]]]
'''Infinity''' (symbol: {{math|∞|size=150%}}) is a concept describing something without any bound or larger than any [[natural number]]. Philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite, for example [[Zeno of Elea]], who proposed many [[paradox]]es involving infinity, and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his [[method of exhaustion]]. Modern mathematics uses the general concept of infinity in the solution of many practical and theoretical problems, such as in [[calculus]] and [[set theory]], and the idea is also used in [[physics]] and the other sciences.

In mathematics, "infinity" is often treated as a [[number]] (i.e., it counts or measures things: "an infinite number of terms") but it is not the same sort of number as either a [[natural number|natural]] or a [[real number|real]] number.

[[Georg Cantor]] formalized many ideas related to infinity and [[infinite set]]s during the late&amp;nbsp;19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets of different sizes (called [[cardinality|cardinalities]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the set of [[integer]]s is [[Countable set|countably infinite]], while the infinite set of real numbers is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=pp. 113 –117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Infinity (philosophy)}}
Ancient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The [[Maurya Empire|ancient Indians]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept.

===Early Greek===
The earliest recorded idea of infinity comes from [[Anaximander]], a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher who lived in [[Miletus]]. He used the word [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]] which means infinite or limitless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallace|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from [[Zeno of Elea]] (born {{circa|490 BCE}}), a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher of southern Italy and member of the [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] School founded by [[Parmenides]]. [[Aristotle]] called him the inventor of the [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name="Zeno's paradoxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/ |title=Zeno's Paradoxes | author= |date=October 15, 2010 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/|title=Zeno of Elea| author= |date=January 5, 2017 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]],&lt;ref name="Zeno's paradoxes" /&gt; described by [[Bertrand Russell]] as "immeasurably subtle and profound".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the traditional view of Aristotle, the [[Hellenistic]] Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the [[actual infinity]]; for example, instead of saying that there are an infinity of primes, [[Euclid]] prefers instead to say that there are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid. [[Euclid's Elements]], Book&amp;nbsp;IX, Proposition&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent readings of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] have found that [[Archimedes]] had an understanding about actual infinite quantities. According to ''Nonlinear Dynamic Systems and Controls'', Archimedes has been found to be "the first to rigorously address the science of infinity with infinitely large sets using precise mathematical proofs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wassim M. Haddad|author2=VijaySekhar Chellaboina|title=Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Control: A Lyapunov-Based Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8rRb33X-E8C&amp;pg=PAxxv|date=February 17, 2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-13329-8|page=xxv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404054122/https://books.google.com/books?id=F8rRb33X-E8C&amp;pg=PAxxv|archivedate=April 4, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Indian===
The [[Indian mathematics|Jain mathematical]] text [[Sūryaprajapti|Surya Prajnapti]] (c. 4th–3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: [[enumerable]], innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Stewart|title=Infinity: a Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iewwDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|date=March 23, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-875523-4|page=117|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403200429/https://books.google.com/books?id=iewwDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|archivedate=April 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enumerable: lowest, intermediate, and highest
* Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable, and innumerably innumerable
* Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite

In this work, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and [[Ontology|ontological]] grounds, a distinction was made between [[Asaṃkhyeya|{{IAST|''asaṃkhyāta''}}]] ("countless, innumerable") and ''[[Ananta (infinite)|ananta]]'' ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutta|first1=Bidyarthi|title=Ranganathan's elucidation of subject in the light of 'Infinity (∞)'|journal=Annals of Library and Information Studies|date=December 2015|volume=62 |pages=255–264 |url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/ALIS/article/view/11415/0|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
European mathematicians started using infinite numbers and expressions in a systematic fashion in the 17th century. In 1655 [[John Wallis]] first used the notation &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for such a number in his ''De sectionibus conicis'' and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into [[infinitesimal]] strips of width on the order of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\infty}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Sec. 421, Vol. II, pg. 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in ''Arithmetica infinitorum'' (1655 also) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending "&amp;c." For example, "1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Sec. 435, Vol. II, pg. 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1699 [[Isaac Newton]] wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work ''[[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640-1940 |first1=Ivor |last1=Grattan-Guinness |publisher=Elsevier |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-08-045744-4 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603085825/https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&amp;pg=PA62 Extract of page 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinity symbol===
{{main|Infinity symbol}}
The infinity symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes called the [[lemniscate]]) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in [[Unicode]] at {{unichar|221E|infinity|html=}} and in [[LaTeX]] as &lt;code&gt;\infty&lt;/code&gt;.

===Calculus===

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], one of the co-inventors of [[infinitesimal calculus]], speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics.

In [[real analysis]], the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, called "infinity", is used to denote an unbounded [[limit of a function|limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1955|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that&amp;nbsp;''x'' grows without bound, and &lt;math&gt;x \to -\infty&lt;/math&gt; means that &amp;nbsp;''x'' decreases without bound. If ''f''(''t'') ≥ 0 for every&amp;nbsp;''t'', then&lt;ref&gt;These uses of infinity for integrals and series can be found in any standard calculus text, such as, {{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|pp=468–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(t)\, dt = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that ''f''(''t'') does not bound a finite area from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, dt = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the area under ''f''(''t'') is infinite.
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, dt = a&lt;/math&gt; means that the total area under ''f''(''t'') is finite, and equals &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;

Infinity is also used to describe [[infinite series]]:
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(i) = a&lt;/math&gt; means that the sum of the infinite series [[convergent series|converges]] to some real value &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(i) = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the sum of the infinite series [[divergent series|diverges]] in the specific sense that the partial sums grow without bound.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Infinity can be used not only to define a limit but as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; can be added to the [[topological space]] of the real numbers, producing the two-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the [[extended real number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; We can also treat &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the [[real projective line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gemignani|1990|loc=p. 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Projective geometry]] also refers to a [[line at infinity]] in plane geometry, a [[plane at infinity]] in three-dimensional space, and a [[hyperplane at infinity]] for general [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]], each consisting of [[Point at infinity|points at infinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Albrecht|last1=Beutelspacher|first2=Ute|last2=Rosenbaum|title=Projective Geometry / from foundations to applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48364-3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex analysis====
[[File:Riemann sphere1.svg|thumb|right|250px|By [[stereographic projection]], the complex plane can be "wrapped" onto a sphere, with the top point of the sphere corresponding to infinity. This is called the [[Riemann sphere]].]]

In [[complex analysis]] the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, called "infinity", denotes an unsigned infinite [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]. &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the magnitude&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;''x'' grows beyond any assigned value. A [[point at infinity|point labeled &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;]] can be added to the complex plane as a [[topological space]] giving the one-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional [[complex manifold]], or [[Riemann surface]], called the extended complex plane or the [[Riemann sphere]]. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (therefore one exception is that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely &lt;math&gt;z/0 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; for any nonzero complex number&amp;nbsp;''z''. In this context it is often useful to consider [[meromorphic function]]s as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Nonstandard analysis===
[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)]]

The original formulation of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] used [[infinitesimal]] quantities. In the twentieth century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various [[logical system]]s, including [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] and [[nonstandard analysis]]. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]]; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian [[transfinite number|transfinites]]. For example, if&amp;nbsp;H is an infinite number, then H&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;H&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2H and H&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to [[non-standard calculus]] is fully developed in {{harvtxt|Keisler|1986}}.

===Set theory===
{{Main|Cardinality|Ordinal number}}

[[File:Infinity paradoxon - one-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset.gif|thumb|One-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset]]

A different form of "infinity" are the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] and [[cardinal number|cardinal]] infinities of set theory. [[Georg Cantor]] developed a system of [[transfinite number]]s, in which the first transfinite cardinal is [[aleph-null]] (&lt;span style="font-family:'Cambria Math';"&gt;&lt;big&gt;ℵ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--&lt;math&gt;(\aleph_0)&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;), the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late nineteenth century from work by Cantor, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others, using the idea of collections, or sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Dedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]] as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (which derived from [[Euclid]]) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see [[Galileo's paradox]] where he concludes that positive integers which are squares and all positive integers are the same size). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its [[proper subset|proper]] parts; this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. The diagram gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. "size".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Cantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers. Ordinal numbers may be identified with [[well-ordered]] sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and the ordinary infinite [[sequence]]s which are maps from the positive [[integers]] leads to [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]] from ordinal numbers, and transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is [[countable set|countably infinite]]. If a set is too large to be put in one to one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called ''uncountable''. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2014}}  Certain extended number systems, such as the [[hyperreal number]]s, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Cardinality of the continuum====
{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}

One of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf c&lt;/math&gt; is greater than that of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;; that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than natural numbers '''N'''. Namely, Cantor showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = 2^{\aleph_0} &gt; {\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dauben

The [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there is no [[cardinal number]] between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \aleph_1 = \beth_1 &lt;/math&gt;  (see [[Beth number#Beth one|Beth one]]).  This hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], even assuming the [[Axiom of Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1963|p=1143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cardinal arithmetic]] can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [[real number line]] is equal to the number of points in any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any [[finite-dimensional]] space.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[File:Peanocurve.svg|thumb|The first three steps of a fractal construction whose limit is a [[space-filling curve]], showing that there are as many points in a one-dimensional line as in a two-dimensional square.]]
The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] function, which provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (−π/2, π/2) and&amp;nbsp;'''R''' (see also [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]). The second result was proved by Cantor in&amp;nbsp;1878, but only became intuitively apparent in&amp;nbsp;1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or [[cube]], or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|1994|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry and topology===
{{Main|Dimension (vector space)}}

Infinite-[[dimension]]al spaces are widely used in [[geometry]] and [[topology]], particularly as [[classifying space]]s, such as [[Eilenberg−MacLane space]]s. Common examples are the infinite-dimensional [[complex projective space]] [[K(Z,2)]] and the infinite-dimensional [[real projective space]] K(Z/2Z,1).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Fractals===
The structure of a [[fractal]] object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming "smooth"; they have infinite perimeters—some with infinite, and others with finite surface areas. One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the [[Koch snowflake]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Mathematics without infinity===
[[Leopold Kronecker]] was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] called [[finitism]], an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of [[Mathematical constructivism|constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=1197–1198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==

In [[physics]], approximations of [[real number]]s are used for [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] measurements and [[natural number]]s are used for [[countable|discrete]] measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no [[observable|measurable quantity]] could have an infinite value, {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} for instance by taking an infinite value in an [[extended real number line|extended real number]] system, or by requiring the counting of an infinite number of events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have infinite mass or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite [[plane wave]] exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf Doric Lenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124011604/http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }} – Application Note – Axicons – 2. Intensity Distribution. Retrieved 7 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical applications of physical infinity===
The practice of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities does not come from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations {{Disputed inline|date=November 2015}} {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

This point of view does not mean that infinity cannot be used in physics. For convenience's sake, calculations, equations, theories and approximations often use [[infinite series]], unbounded [[function (mathematics)|functions]], etc., and may involve infinite quantities. Physicists however require that the end result be physically meaningful. In [[quantum field theory]] infinities arise which need to be interpreted in such a way as to lead to a physically meaningful result, a process called [[renormalization]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

However, there are some theoretical circumstances where the end result is infinity. One example is the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] in the description of [[black holes]]. Some solutions of the equations of the [[general theory of relativity]] allow for finite mass distributions of zero size, and thus infinite density. This is an example of what is called a [[mathematical singularity]], or a point where a physical theory breaks down. This does not necessarily mean that physical infinities exist; it may mean simply that the theory is incapable of describing the situation properly. Two other examples occur in inverse-square force laws of the gravitational force equation of [[Newtonian gravity]] and [[Coulomb's law]] of electrostatics. At&amp;nbsp;r=0 these equations evaluate to infinities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Cosmology===
The first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin (2009), ''In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality'', {{isbn|9780470613528}}. p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer [[Giordano Bruno]] proposed an unbounded universe in ''On the Infinite Universe and Worlds'': "Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alien Life Imagined: Communicating the Science and Culture of Astrobiology |edition=illustrated |first1=Mark |last1=Brake |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-49129-7 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWGqzfL0snEC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=sWGqzfL0snEC&amp;pg=PA63 Extract of page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmology|Cosmologists]] have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical [[universe]]: Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space [[Shape of the universe|"go on forever"]]? This is an open question of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar [[topology]]. If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Quest of the Universe |edition=illustrated |first1=Theo |last1=Koupelis |first2=Karl F. |last2=Kuhn |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7637-4387-1 |page=553 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTttN4ZdyoC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTttN4ZdyoC&amp;pg=PA553 Extract of page 553]&lt;/ref&gt;

The curvature of the universe can be measured through [[multipole moments]] in the spectrum of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic background radiation]]. As to date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the [[WMAP]] spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe.&lt;ref name="NASA_Shape"&gt;{{cite web| title=Will the Universe expand forever?| url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| publisher=NASA| date=24 January 2014| accessdate=16 March 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601032707/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| archivedate=1 June 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi_Flat"&gt;{{cite web| title=Our universe is Flat| url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| publisher=FermiLab/SLAC| date=7 April 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410200411/http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| archivedate=10 April 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unexpected connections|author=Marcus Y. Yoo|journal=Engineering &amp; Science|publisher=[[Caltech]]|volume=LXXIV1|date=2011|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Jeffrey|title=The Shape of Space|date=December 12, 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0824707095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of infinity also extends to the [[multiverse]] hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as [[Michio Kaku]], posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.&lt;ref&gt;Kaku, M. (2006). Parallel worlds. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
In [[logic]] an [[infinite regress]] argument is "a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form&amp;nbsp;A) no such series exists or (form&amp;nbsp;B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;of justification) that it is supposed to play."&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Second Edition, p.&amp;nbsp;429&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computing==
The [[IEEE&amp;nbsp;floating-point]] standard (IEEE 754) specifies the positive and negative infinity values (and also [[NaN|indefinite]] values). These are defined as the result of [[arithmetic overflow]], [[division by zero]], and other exceptional operations.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolution''' is the process of change in all forms of [[life]] over generations, and [[evolutionary biology]] is the study of how [[evolution]] occurs. Biological [[population]]s evolve through [[genetics|genetic]] changes that correspond to changes in the [[organism]]s' [[phenotypic trait|observable traits]]. Genetic changes include [[mutations]], which are caused by damage or replication errors in organisms' [[DNA]]. As the [[genetic variation]] of a population [[genetic drift|drifts]] randomly over generations, [[natural selection]] gradually leads traits to become more or less common based on the relative [[reproductive success]] of organisms with those traits.

Evolution does not attempt to explain the origin of [[life]] (covered instead by [[abiogenesis]]), but it does explain how  early lifeforms evolved into the complex ecosystem that we see today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/misconceptions_faq.php#a1 |title=Misconceptions about evolution |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the similarities between all present-day organisms, all life on [[Earth]] is assumed to have originated through [[common descent]] from a [[last universal ancestor]] from which all known [[species]] have diverged through the process of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt; All individuals have hereditary material in the form of [[gene]]s received from their parents, which they pass on to any offspring. Among offspring there are variations of genes due to the introduction of new genes via random changes called mutations or via reshuffling of existing genes during [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory09"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=T.

If those differences are helpful, the offspring is more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that more offspring in the next generation will have that helpful difference and individuals will not have equal chances of [[reproduction|reproductive]] success. In this way, traits that result in organisms being better [[adaptation|adapted]] to their living conditions become more common in descendant populations.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory09" /&gt; These differences accumulate resulting in changes within the population. This process is responsible for the many diverse life forms in the world.

The forces of evolution are most [[Scientific evidence|evident]] when [[population]]s become isolated, either through geographic distance or by other mechanisms that prevent [[Genetics|genetic]] exchange. Over time, isolated populations can branch off into [[speciation|new species]].&lt;ref name="berk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_01 |title=Welcome to Evolution 101! |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavalier-Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cavalier-Smith |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Cavalier-Smith |date=June 29, 2006 |title=Cell evolution and Earth history: stasis and revolution |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=969–1006 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1842 |pmc=1578732 |pmid=16754610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of genetic mutations neither assist, change the appearance of, nor bring harm to individuals. Through the process of genetic drift, these mutated genes are neutrally sorted among populations and survive across generations by chance alone. In contrast to genetic drift, natural selection is not a random process because it acts on traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction.&lt;ref name="Garvin08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garvin-Doxas |first1=Kathy |last2=Klymkowsky |first2=Michael W. |date=Summer 2008 |editor-last=Alberts |editor-first=Bruce |editor-link=Bruce Alberts |title=Understanding Randomness and its Impact on Student Learning: Lessons Learned from Building the Biology Concept Inventory (BCI)|journal=[[CBE- Life Sciences Education|CBE—Life Sciences Education]] |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=227–233 |doi=10.1187/cbe.07-08-0063 |pmc=2424310 |pmid=18519614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection and random genetic drift are constant and dynamic parts of life and over time this has shaped the branching structure in the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raup|1992|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern understanding of evolution began with the 1859 publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. In addition, [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work with plants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="gegme"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Gregor_Mendel.php |title=Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) |last=Rhee |first=Seung Yon |website=Access Excellence |publisher=National Health Museum |location=Atlanta, GA |accessdate=2015-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227004122/http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Gregor_Mendel.php |archivedate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossil discoveries in [[paleontology]], advances in [[population genetics]] and a global network of scientific research have provided further details into the mechanisms of evolution. Scientists now have a good understanding of the origin of new species ([[speciation]]) and have observed the speciation process in the laboratory and in the wild. Evolution is the principal [[scientific theory]] that [[biologist]]s use to understand life and is used in many disciplines, including [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[conservation biology]], [[anthropology]], [[Forensic science|forensics]], [[agriculture]] and other [[Sociocultural evolution|social-cultural]] applications.

== Simple overview ==
The main ideas of [[evolution]] may be summarized as follows:

* [[Life]] forms [[reproduction|reproduce]] and therefore have a tendency to become more numerous.
* Factors such as [[predation]] and [[competition (biology)|competition]] work against the survival of individuals.
* Each offspring differs from their parent(s) in minor, random ways.
* If these differences are beneficial, the offspring is more likely to survive and reproduce.
* This makes it likely that more offspring in the next generation will have beneficial differences and fewer will have detrimental differences.
* These differences accumulate over generations, resulting in changes within the population.
* Over time, populations can split or branch off into new species.
* These processes, collectively known as evolution, are responsible for the many diverse life forms seen in the world.

== Natural selection ==
[[File:Charles_Darwin_by_G._Richmond.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Darwin]] proposed the theory of evolution by [[natural selection]].]]
{{main|Natural selection}}

In the 19th century, [[natural history]] collections and museums were popular. The [[Europe]]an expansion and naval expeditions employed [[Natural history|naturalist]]s, while [[curator]]s of grand museums showcased preserved and live specimens of the varieties of life. Charles Darwin was an [[England|English]] graduate educated and trained in the disciplines of natural history. Such natural historians would collect, catalogue, describe and study the vast collections of specimens stored and managed by curators at these museums. Darwin served as a ship's naturalist on board [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], assigned to a five-year research expedition around the world. During his voyage, he observed and collected an abundance of organisms, being very interested in the diverse forms of life along the coasts of [[South America]] and the neighboring [[Galápagos Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farber|2000|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haeckel Orchidae.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Darwin noted that [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]s have complex [[adaptation]]s to ensure pollination, all derived from basic floral parts.]]

Darwin gained extensive experience as he collected and studied the natural history of life forms from distant places. Through his studies, he formulated the idea that each species had developed from ancestors with similar features. In 1838, he described how a process he called natural selection would make this happen.&lt;ref name="Confessions"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eldredge |first=Niles |authorlink=Niles Eldredge |date=Spring 2006 |title=Confessions of a Darwinist |url=http://www.vqronline.org/vqr-portfolio/confessions-darwinist |journal=[[Virginia Quarterly Review]] |location=Charlottesville, VA |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=32–53 |accessdate=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of a population depends on how much and how many resources are able to support it. For the population to remain the same size year after year, there must be an equilibrium, or balance between the population size and available resources. Since organisms produce more offspring than their environment can support, not all individuals can survive out of each generation. There must be a competitive struggle for resources that aid in survival. As a result, Darwin realised that it was not chance alone that determined survival. Instead, survival of an organism depends on the differences of each individual organism, or "traits," that aid or hinder survival and reproduction. Well-adapted individuals are likely to leave more offspring than their less well-adapted competitors. Traits that hinder survival and reproduction would ''disappear'' over generations. Traits that help an organism survive and reproduce would ''accumulate'' over generations. Darwin realised that the unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce could cause gradual changes in the population and used the term ''natural selection'' to describe this process.&lt;ref name="Geographic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wyhe" /&gt;

Observations of variations in [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s formed the basis of the theory of natural selection. For example, Darwin observed that [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[insect]]s have a close relationship that allows the [[pollination]] of the plants. He noted that orchids have a variety of structures that attract insects, so that [[pollen]] from the [[flower]]s gets stuck to the insects' bodies. In this way, insects transport the pollen from a male to a female orchid. In spite of the elaborate appearance of orchids, these specialised parts are made from the same basic structures that make up other flowers. In his book, ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' (1862), Darwin proposed that the orchid flowers were adapted from pre-existing parts, through natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_FertilisationofOrchids.html |title=Fertilisation of Orchids |last=van Wyhe |first=John |year=2002 |work=The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online |oclc=74272908 |accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was still researching and experimenting with his ideas on natural selection when he received a letter from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] describing a theory very similar to his own. This led to an immediate joint publication of both theories. Both Wallace and Darwin saw the history of life like a [[family tree]], with each fork in the tree’s limbs being a common ancestor. The tips of the limbs represented modern species and the branches represented the common ancestors that are shared amongst many different species. To explain these relationships, Darwin said that all living things were related, and this meant that all life must be descended from a few forms, or even from a single common ancestor. He called this process ''descent with modification''.&lt;ref name="wyhe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/darwin.html |title=Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist |last=van Wyhe |first=John |authorlink=John van Wyhe |year=2002 |work=[[The Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online]] |oclc=74272908 |accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859.{{sfn|Darwin|1859}} His theory means that all life, including [[human]]ity, is a product of continuing natural processes. The implication that all life on Earth has a common ancestor has met with [[Objections to evolution|objections]] from some [[Creation–evolution controversy|religious groups]]. Their objections are in contrast to the level of support for the theory by [[level of support for evolution|more than 99 percent]] of those within the [[scientific community]] today.&lt;ref name="delgado"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delgado |first=Cynthia |date=July 28, 2006 |title=Finding the Evolution in Medicine |url=http://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |journal=NIH Record  |volume=58 |issue=15 |pages=1, 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural selection is commonly equated with ''survival of the fittest'', but this expression originated in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Biology'' in 1864, five years after Charles Darwin published his original works. ''Survival of the fittest'' describes the process of natural selection incorrectly, because natural selection is not only about survival and it is not always the fittest that survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005b|pp=93–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

== Source of variation ==

Darwins theory of natural selection laid the groundwork for modern evolutionary theory, and his experiments and observations showed that the organisms in populations varied from each other, that some of these variations were inherited, and that these differences could be acted on by natural selection. However, he could not explain the source of these variations. Like many of his predecessors, Darwin mistakenly thought that heritable traits were a product of use and disuse, and that features acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring. He looked for examples, such as large ground feeding [[bird]]s getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.&lt;ref name=toos&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108]}}, "Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection"&lt;/ref&gt; This misunderstanding was called the [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|inheritance of acquired characters]] and was part of the theory of [[transmutation of species]] put forward in 1809 by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. In the late 19th century this theory became known as [[Lamarckism]]. Darwin produced an unsuccessful theory he called [[pangenesis]] to try to explain how acquired characteristics could be inherited. In the 1880s [[August Weismann]]'s experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse could not be inherited, and Lamarckism gradually fell from favor.&lt;ref name="ImaginaryLamarck"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |date=September–October 1994 |title=The Imaginary Lamarck: A Look at Bogus 'History' in Schoolbooks |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |journal=The Textbook Letter |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=The Textbook League |oclc=23228649 |accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missing information needed to help explain how new features could pass from a parent to its offspring was provided by the pioneering genetics work of [[Gregor Mendel]]. Mendel's experiments with several generations of pea plants demonstrated that inheritance works by separating and reshuffling hereditary information during the formation of sex cells and recombining that information during fertilisation. This is like mixing different hands of [[playing cards]], with an organism getting a random mix of half of the cards from one parent, and half of the cards from the other. Mendel called the information ''factors''; however, they later became known as genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity in living organisms. They contain the information that directs the physical development and behavior of organisms.

Genes are made of [[DNA]]. DNA is a long [[molecule]] made up of individual molecules called [[nucleotide]]s. Genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides, that make up the DNA, just as the sequence of the letters in words carries information on a page. The genes are like short instructions built up of the "letters" of the DNA alphabet. Put together, the entire set of these genes gives enough information to serve as an "instruction manual" of how to build and run an organism. The instructions spelled out by this DNA alphabet can be changed, however, by mutations, and this may alter the instructions carried within the genes. Within the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], the genes are carried in [[chromosome]]s, which are packages for carrying the DNA. It is the reshuffling of the chromosomes that results in unique combinations of genes in offspring. Since genes interact with one another during the development of an organism, novel combinations of genes produced by sexual reproduction can increase the genetic variability of the population even without new mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_22 |title=Sex and genetic shuffling |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic variability of a population can also increase when members of that population [[hybrid (biology)|interbreed]] with individuals from a different population causing [[gene flow]] between the populations. This can introduce genes into a population that were not present before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_21 |title=Gene flow |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution is not a random process. Although mutations in DNA are random, natural selection is not a process of chance: the environment determines the probability of reproductive success. Evolution is an inevitable result of imperfectly copying, self-replicating organisms reproducing over billions of years under the selective pressure of the environment. The outcome of evolution is not a perfectly designed organism. The end products of natural selection are organisms that are adapted to their present environments. Natural selection does not involve [[orthogenesis|progress towards an ultimate goal]]. Evolution does not strive for [[Evolution of biological complexity|more advanced]], more intelligent, or more sophisticated life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1980|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[flea]]s (wingless parasites) are descended from a winged, ancestral [[Mecoptera|scorpionfly]], and [[snake]]s are [[lizard]]s that no longer require limbs—although [[Python (genus)|python]]s still grow tiny structures that are the remains of their ancestor's hind legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bejder |first1=Lars |last2=Hall |first2=Brian K. |authorlink2=Brian K.

== Genetic drift ==
{{Further|Genetic drift}}
Genetic drift is a cause of allelic frequency change within populations of a species. [[Allele]]s are different variations of specific genes. They determine things like [[Human hair color|hair color]], [[Human skin color|skin tone]], [[eye color]] and [[blood type]]; in other words, all the genetic traits that vary between individuals. Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles to a population, but it can reduce variation within a population by removing an allele from the gene pool. Genetic drift is caused by random sampling of alleles. A truly random sample is a sample in which no outside forces affect what is selected. It is like pulling marbles of the same size and weight but of different colors from a brown paper bag. In any offspring, the alleles present are samples of the previous generations alleles, and chance plays a role in whether an individual survives to reproduce and to pass a sample of their generation onward to the next. The allelic frequency of a population is the ratio of the copies of one specific allele that share the same form compared to the number of all forms of the allele present in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|1998|p=Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic drift affects smaller populations more than it affects larger populations.&lt;ref name="Ellstrand1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellstrand |first1=Norman C. |last2=Elam |first2=Diane R. |date=November 1993 |title=Population Genetic Consequences of Small Population Size: Implications for Plant Conservation |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |location=Palo Alto, CA |publisher=[[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] |volume=24 |pages=217–242 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.24.110193.001245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hardy–Weinberg principle ===
The [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]] states that a large population in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium will have no change in the frequency of alleles as generations pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ewens|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible for a population of any considerable size to reach this equilibrium because of the five requirements that must be met. A population must be infinite in size. There must be a zero percent mutation rate between generations, because mutations can alter existing alleles or create new ones. There can be no [[immigration]] or [[emigration]] in the population, because individuals arriving and leaving directly change allelic frequencies. There can be no selective pressures of any kind on the population, meaning that no individual is more likely than any other to survive and reproduce. Finally, mating must be totally random, with all males (or females in some cases) being equally desirable mates. This ensures a true random mixing of alleles.&lt;ref name="Campbell2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|Reece|2002|pp=445–463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A population that is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium is analogous to a [[Standard 52-card deck|deck of cards]]; no matter how many times the deck is shuffled, no new cards are added and no old ones are taken away. Cards in the deck represent alleles in a population’s gene pool.

=== Population bottleneck ===
[[File:Population bottleneck.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Model of population bottleneck illustrates how [[allele]]s can be lost]]

A [[population bottleneck]] occurs when the population of a species is reduced drastically over a short period of time due to external forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Robinson |editor-first=Richard |encyclopedia=Genetics |title=Population Bottleneck |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/population-bottleneck-gen-03/ |accessdate=2011-04-07 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Macmillan Reference USA]] |location=New York |isbn=0-02-865606-7 |lccn=2002003560 |oclc=49278650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a true population bottleneck, the reduction does not favor any combination of alleles; it is totally random chance which individuals survive. A bottleneck can reduce or eliminate genetic variation from a population. Further drift events after the bottleneck event can also reduce the population's [[genetic diversity]]. The lack of diversity created can make the population at risk to other selective pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|1998|pp=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example of a population bottleneck is the [[Northern elephant seal]]. Due to excessive hunting throughout the 19th century, the population of the northern elephant seal was reduced to 30 individuals or less. They have made a full recovery, with the total number of individuals at around 100,000 and growing. The effects of the bottleneck are visible, however. The seals are more likely to have serious problems with disease or genetic disorders, because there is almost no diversity in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoelzel |first1=A. Rus |last2=Fleischer |first2=Robert C. |last3=Campagna |first3=Claudio |last4=Le Boeuf |first4=Bernard J. |last5=Alvord |first5=W. Gregory |date=July 2002 |title=Impact of a population bottleneck on symmetry and genetic diversity in the northern elephant seal |journal=[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the [[European Society for Evolutionary Biology]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=567–575 |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00419.x |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founder effect ===
[[File:Founder effect.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In the [[founder effect]], small new populations contain different allele frequencies from the parent population.]]

The [[founder effect]] occurs when a small group from one population splits off and forms a new population, often through geographic isolation. This new population's allelic frequency is probably different from the original population's, and will change how common certain alleles are in the populations. The founders of the population will determine the genetic makeup, and potentially the survival, of the new population for generations.&lt;ref name="Campbell2002" /&gt;

One example of the founder effect is found in the [[Amish]] migration to [[Pennsylvania]] in 1744. Two of the founders of the colony in Pennsylvania carried the recessive allele for [[Ellis–van Creveld syndrome]]. Because the Amish tend to be religious isolates, they interbreed, and through generations of this practice the frequency of Ellis–van Creveld syndrome in the Amish people is much higher than the frequency in the general population.&lt;ref name="PBS_Evolution_founder"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/06/3/l_063_03.html |title=Genetic Drift and the Founder Effect |year=2001 |website=Evolution Library |series=Evolution |publisher=[[WGBH Educational Foundation]]; Clear Blue Sky Productions, Inc. |location=Boston, MA |type=Web resource |oclc=48165595 |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern synthesis ==
{{Further|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}
The modern evolutionary synthesis is based on the concept that populations of organisms have significant genetic variation caused by mutation and by the recombination of genes during sexual reproduction. It defines evolution as the change in allelic frequencies within a population caused by genetic drift, gene flow between sub populations, and natural selection. Natural selection is emphasised as the most important mechanism of evolution; large changes are the result of the gradual accumulation of small changes over long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Larson231"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/modern-synthesis.html |title=The Modern Synthesis of Genetics and Evolution |date=January 22, 1993 |last=Moran |first=Laurance |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern evolutionary synthesis is the outcome of a merger of several different scientific fields to produce a more cohesive understanding of evolutionary theory. In the 1920s, [[Ronald Fisher]], [[J.B.S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]] combined Darwin's theory of natural selection with statistical models of [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]], founding the discipline of population genetics. In the 1930s and 1940s, efforts were made to merge population genetics, the observations of field naturalists on the distribution of species and sub species, and analysis of the fossil record into a unified explanatory model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=325–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the principles of genetics to naturally occurring populations, by scientists such as [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and [[Ernst Mayr]], advanced the understanding of the processes of evolution. Dobzhansky's 1937 work ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' helped bridge the gap between genetics and field [[biology]] by presenting the mathematical work of the population geneticists in a form more useful to field biologists, and by showing that wild populations had much more genetic variability with geographically isolated subspecies and reservoirs of genetic diversity in recessive genes than the models of the early population geneticists had allowed for. Mayr, on the basis of an understanding of genes and direct observations of evolutionary processes from field research, introduced the biological species concept, which defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from all other populations. Both Dobzhansky and Mayr emphasised the importance of subspecies reproductively isolated by geographical barriers in the emergence of new species. The paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] helped to incorporate [[paleontology]] with a statistical analysis of the fossil record that showed a pattern consistent with the branching and non-directional pathway of evolution of organisms predicted by the modern synthesis.&lt;ref name="Larson231" /&gt; {{clear}}

== Evidence for evolution ==
[[File:Glyptodon-Armadillo.jpg|thumb|During the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']], naturalist Charles Darwin collected fossils in [[South America]], and found fragments of armor which he thought were like giant versions of the scales on the modern [[armadillo]]s living nearby. On his return, the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] showed him that the fragments were from gigantic extinct [[glyptodon]]s, related to the armadillos. This was one of the patterns of distribution that helped Darwin to [[Inception of Darwin's theory#Geological début, species related to places|develop his theory]].&lt;ref name="Confessions" /&gt;]]

{{Further|Evidence of common descent}}

[[Scientific evidence]] for evolution comes from many aspects of biology and includes [[fossil]]s, [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] structures, and molecular similarities between species' DNA.

=== Fossil record ===
Research in the field of [[paleontology]], the study of fossils, supports the idea that all living organisms are related. Fossils provide evidence that accumulated changes in organisms over long periods of time have led to the diverse forms of life we see today. A fossil itself reveals the organism's structure and the relationships between present and extinct species, allowing paleontologists to construct a family tree for all of the life forms on Earth.&lt;ref name="Virtual"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fossilmuseum.net/fossilrecord.htm |title=The Fossil Record - Life's Epic |work=The Virtual Fossil Museum |publisher=Roger Perkins |accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern paleontology began with the work of [[Georges Cuvier]]. Cuvier noted that, in [[sedimentary rock]], each layer contained a specific group of fossils. The deeper layers, which he proposed to be older, contained simpler life forms. He noted that many forms of life from the past are no longer present today. One of Cuvier’s successful contributions to the understanding of the fossil record was establishing extinction as a fact. In an attempt to explain extinction, Cuvier proposed the idea of "revolutions" or [[catastrophism]] in which he speculated that geological catastrophes had occurred throughout the Earth’s history, wiping out large numbers of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tattersall|1995|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier's theory of revolutions was later replaced by uniformitarian theories, notably those of [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]] who proposed that the Earth’s geological changes were gradual and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyell|1830|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current evidence in the fossil record supports the concept of mass extinctions. As a result, the general idea of catastrophism has re-emerged as a valid hypothesis for at least some of the rapid changes in life forms that appear in the fossil records.

A very large number of fossils have now been discovered and identified. These fossils serve as a chronological record of evolution. The fossil record provides examples of [[Transitional fossil|transitional species]] that demonstrate ancestral links between past and present life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=22 p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; One such transitional fossil is ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', an ancient organism that had the distinct characteristics of a [[reptile]] (such as a long, bony [[tail]] and conical [[Tooth|teeth]]) yet also had characteristics of birds (such as [[feather]]s and a [[Furcula|wishbone]]). The implication from such a find is that modern reptiles and birds arose from a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1995|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparative anatomy ===
{{Further|Convergent evolution|Divergent evolution}}
The comparison of similarities between organisms of their form or appearance of parts, called their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], has long been a way to classify life into closely related groups. This can be done by comparing the structure of adult organisms in different species or by comparing the patterns of how cells grow, divide and even migrate during an organism's development.

==== Taxonomy ====
[[Taxonomy (biology)#Alpha taxonomy|Taxonomy]] is the branch of biology that names and classifies all living things. Scientists use morphological and genetic similarities to assist them in categorising life forms based on ancestral relationships. For example, [[orangutan]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, and [[human]]s all belong to the same taxonomic grouping referred to as a family—in this case the family called [[Hominidae]]. These animals are grouped together because of similarities in morphology that come from common ancestry (called ''[[Homology (biology)|homology]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|1992|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Square-townsend-fledermaus.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[bat]] is a [[mammal]] and its forearm bones have been adapted for flight.]]
Strong evidence for evolution comes from the analysis of homologous structures: structures in different species that no longer perform the same task but which share a similar structure.&lt;ref name="PBS_Evolution_glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/glossary/index.html |title=Glossary |year=2001 |website=Evolution Library |series=Evolution |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation; Clear Blue Sky Productions, Inc. |location=Boston, MA |type=Web resource |oclc=48165595 |accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the case of the forelimbs of [[mammal]]s. The forelimbs of a human, [[Felidae|cat]], [[whale]], and [[bat]] all have strikingly similar bone structures. However, each of these four species' forelimbs performs a different task. The same bones that construct a bat's wings, which are used for flight, also construct a whale's flippers, which are used for swimming. Such a "design" makes little sense if they are unrelated and uniquely constructed for their particular tasks. The theory of evolution explains these homologous structures: all four animals shared a common ancestor, and each has undergone change over many generations. These changes in structure have produced forelimbs adapted for different tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|2001|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Captive Red-tailed Hawk at Bacara.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[bird wing|bird]] and the bat wing are examples of [[convergent evolution]].]]
However, anatomical comparisons can be misleading, as not all anatomical similarities indicate a close relationship. Organisms that share similar environments will often develop similar physical features, a process known as ''[[convergent evolution]]''. Both [[shark]]s and [[dolphin]]s have similar body forms, yet are only distantly related—sharks are [[fish]] and dolphins are mammals. Such similarities are a result of both populations being exposed to the same [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]]. Within both groups, changes that aid swimming have been favored. Thus, over time, they developed similar appearances (morphology), even though they are not closely related.&lt;ref name="Johnson_Convergent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txtwriter.com/backgrounders/Evolution/EVpage14.html |title=Convergent and Divergent Evolution |last=Johnson |first=George B |authorlink=George B.

==== Embryology ====
In some cases, anatomical comparison of structures in the [[embryo]]s of two or more species provides evidence for a shared ancestor that may not be obvious in the adult forms. As the embryo develops, these homologies can be lost to view, and the structures can take on different functions. Part of the basis of classifying the [[vertebrate]] group (which includes humans), is the presence of a tail (extending beyond the [[anus]]) and [[pharyngeal slit]]s. Both structures appear during some stage of embryonic development but are not always obvious in the adult form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weichert|Presch|1975|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the morphological similarities present in embryos of different species during development, it was once assumed that organisms re-enact their evolutionary history as an embryo. It was thought that human embryos passed through an [[amphibian]] then a [[Reptile|reptilian]] stage before completing their development as mammals. Such a reenactment, often called ''[[recapitulation theory]]'', is not supported by scientific evidence. What does occur, however, is that the first stages of development are similar in broad groups of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/embryos/Haeckel.html |title=Haeckel and his Embryos: A Note on Textbooks |last1=Miller |first1=Kenneth R. |authorlink1=Kenneth R. Miller |last2=Levine |first2=Joseph |year=1997 |work=Evolution Resources |publisher=Miller And Levine Biology |location=Rehoboth, MA |accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[pharyngula|very early]] stages, for instance, all vertebrates appear extremely similar, but do not exactly resemble any ancestral species. As development continues, specific features emerge from this basic pattern.

==== Vestigial structures ====
Homology includes a unique group of shared structures referred to as ''[[Vestigiality|vestigial structures]]''. ''Vestigial'' refers to anatomical parts that are of minimal, if any, value to the organism that possesses them. These apparently illogical structures are remnants of organs that played an important role in ancestral forms. Such is the case in whales, which have small vestigial bones that appear to be remnants of the leg bones of [[Evolution of cetaceans|their ancestors]] which walked on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/pdf/comdesc.pdf |title=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution |last=Theobald |first=Douglas |year=2004 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |at=Part 2: "Whales with hindlimbs" |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans also have vestigial structures, including the [[Outer ear#Intrinsic muscles|ear muscles]], the [[Wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]], the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[Coccyx|tail bone]], [[Androgenic hair|body hair]] (including [[goose bumps]]), and the [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|semilunar fold]] in the corner of the [[eye]].&lt;ref name="Johnson_Vestigial"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txtwriter.com/backgrounders/Evolution/EVpage12.html |title=Vestigial Structures |last=Johnson |first=George B. |website=Dr. George Johnson's Backgrounders |publisher=Txtwriter, Inc. |location=St. Louis, MO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310041049/http://txtwriter.com/Backgrounders/Evolution/EVpage12.html |archivedate=2008-03-10 |accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biogeography ===
[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Four of the [[Darwin's finches|Galápagos finch]] species, produced by an [[adaptive radiation]] that diversified their [[beak]]s for different food sources]]
[[Biogeography]] is the study of the geographical distribution of species. Evidence from biogeography, especially from the [[Insular biogeography|biogeography of oceanic islands]], played a key role in convincing both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace that species evolved with a branching pattern of common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=150–151,174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islands often contain endemic species, species not found anywhere else, but those species are often related to species found on the nearest continent. Furthermore, islands often contain clusters of closely related species that have very different [[ecological niche]]s, that is have different ways of making a living in the environment. Such clusters form through a process of [[adaptive radiation]] where a single ancestral species colonises an island that has a variety of open ecological niches and then diversifies by evolving into different species adapted to fill those empty niches. Well-studied examples include [[Darwin's finches]], a group of 13 finch species endemic to the Galápagos Islands, and the [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s, a group of birds that once, before extinctions caused by humans, numbered 60 species filling diverse ecological roles, all descended from a single finch like ancestor that arrived on the [[Hawaiian Islands]] some 4 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coyne|2009|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[Silversword alliance]], a group of perennial plant species, also endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, that inhabit a variety of habitats and come in a variety of shapes and sizes that include trees, shrubs, and ground hugging mats, but which can be hybridised with one another and with certain [[Madieae|tarweed]] species found on the west coast of [[North America]]; it appears that one of those tarweeds colonised Hawaii in the past, and gave rise to the entire Silversword alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/carr/radiation.htm |title=Adaptive Radiation and Hybridization in the Hawaiian Silversword Alliance |last=Carr |first=Gerald D. |publisher=[[University of Hawaii]] Botany Department |location=Honolulu, HI |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular biology ===
[[File:DNA Overview.png|thumb|upright=0.5|A section of [[DNA]]]]

Every living organism (with the possible exception of [[RNA]] [[virus]]es) contains molecules of DNA, which carries genetic information. Genes are the pieces of DNA that carry this information, and they influence the properties of an organism. Genes determine an individual's general appearance and to some extent their behavior. If two organisms are closely related, their DNA will be very similar.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;[[#NAS 1998|NAS 1998]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5787&amp;page=27 "Evolution and the Nature of Science"]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the more distantly related two organisms are, the more differences they will have. For example, brothers are closely related and have very similar DNA, while cousins share a more distant relationship and have far more differences in their DNA. Similarities in DNA are used to determine the relationships between species in much the same manner as they are used to show relationships between individuals. For example, comparing chimpanzees with gorillas and humans shows that there is as much as a 96&amp;nbsp;percent similarity between the DNA of humans and chimps. Comparisons of DNA indicate that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related to each other than either species is to gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovgren |first=Stefan |date=August 31, 2005 |title=Chimps, Humans 96 Percent the Same, Gene Study Finds |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0831_050831_chimp_genes.html |work=National Geographic News |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carroll|Grenier|Weatherbee|2005|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&amp;g=cons46way |title=Cons 46-Way Track Settings |website=[[UCSC Genome Browser|UCSC Genome Bioinformatics]] |location=Santa Cruz, CA |publisher=[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular systematics]] focuses on measuring the similarities in these molecules and using this information to work out how different types of organisms are related through evolution. These comparisons have allowed biologists to build a ''relationship tree'' of the evolution of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ciccarelli |first1=Francesca D. |last2=Doerks |first2=Tobias |last3=von Mering |first3=Christian |last4=Creevey |first4=Christopher J. |last5=Snel |first5=Berend |last6=Bork |first6=Peer |authorlink6=Peer Bork |date=March 3, 2006 |title=Toward Automatic Reconstruction of a Highly Resolved Tree of Life |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5765 |pages=1283–1287 |bibcode=2006Sci...311.1283C |doi=10.1126/science.1123061 |pmid=16513982 |display-authors=3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have even allowed scientists to unravel the relationships between organisms whose common ancestors lived such a long time ago that no real similarities remain in the appearance of the organisms.

=== Artificial selection ===
[[File:Big and little dog 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The results of [[Selective breeding|artificial selection]]: a [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] [[mixed-breed dog|mix]] and a [[Great Dane]]]]

''[[Selective breeding|Artificial selection]]'' is the controlled breeding of domestic plants and animals. Humans determine which animal or plant will reproduce and which of the offspring will survive; thus, they determine which genes will be passed on to future generations. The process of artificial selection has had a significant impact on the evolution of domestic animals. For example, people have produced different types of [[dog]]s by controlled breeding. The differences in size between the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] and the [[Great Dane]] are the result of artificial selection. Despite their dramatically different physical appearance, they and all other dogs evolved from a few [[Gray wolf|wolves]] domesticated by humans in what is now [[China]] less than 15,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McGourty |first=Christine |date=November 22, 2002 |title=Origin of dogs traced |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2498669.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial selection has produced a wide variety of plants. In the case of [[maize]] (corn), recent genetic evidence suggests that domestication occurred 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago in central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Hardy |date=November 7, 2005 |title=Transgene Escape: Are Traditional Corn Varieties In Mexico Threatened by Transgenic Corn Crops |url=http://www.scq.ubc.ca/transgene-escape-are-traditional-corn-varieties-in-mexico-threatened-by-transgenic-corn-crops/? |journal=The Scientific Creative Quarterly |location=Vancouver and Kelowna, BC |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2015}} Prior to domestication, the edible portion of the wild form was small and difficult to collect. Today ''The Maize Genetics Cooperation • Stock Center'' maintains a collection of more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;genetic variations of maize that have arisen by random mutations and chromosomal variations from the original wild type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/mgc-info.php |title=Maize COOP Information |date=November 23, 2010 |work=[[National Plant Germplasm System]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]; [[Agricultural Research Service]] |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In artificial selection the new breed or variety that emerges is the one with random mutations attractive to humans, while in natural selection the surviving species is the one with random mutations useful to it in its non-human environment. In both natural and artificial selection the variations are a result of random mutations, and the underlying genetic processes are essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverman |first=David |year=2002 |chapter=Better Books by Trial and Error |chapterurl=http://home.comcast.net/~lifebook/evolve.html |title=Life's Big Instruction Book |url=http://home.comcast.net/~lifebook/preface.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150117235742/http://home.comcast.net/~lifebook/preface.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-01-17 |accessdate=2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin carefully observed the outcomes of artificial selection in animals and plants to form many of his arguments in support of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilner |first=Eduardo |date=March 2006 |title=Darwin's artificial selection as an experiment |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |location=Amsterdam, the Netherlands |publisher=Elsevier |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=26–40 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2005.12.002 |pmid=16473266 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his book ''On the Origin of Species'' was based on these observations of the many varieties of [[domestic pigeon]]s arising from artificial selection. Darwin proposed that if humans could achieve dramatic changes in domestic animals in short periods, then natural selection, given millions of years, could produce the differences seen in living things today.

== Coevolution ==
{{Main|Coevolution}}
Coevolution is a process in which two or more species influence the evolution of each other. All organisms are influenced by life around them; however, in coevolution there is evidence that genetically determined traits in each species directly resulted from the interaction between the two organisms.&lt;ref name="NAS" /&gt;

An extensively documented case of coevolution is the relationship between ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'', a type of [[ant]], and the ''[[acacia]]'', a plant that the ant uses for food and shelter. The relationship between the two is so intimate that it has led to the evolution of special structures and behaviors in both organisms. The ant defends the acacia against [[herbivore]]s and clears the forest floor of the [[seed]]s from competing plants. In response, the plant has evolved swollen thorns that the ants use as shelter and special flower parts that the ants eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janzen |first=Daniel H. |authorlink=Daniel H. Janzen |year=1974 |title=Swollen-Thorn Acacias of Central America |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Botany/pdf_hi/sctb-0013.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Smithsonian Contributions and Studies Series|Smithsonian Contributions to Botany]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution Press]] |volume=13 |oclc=248582653 |accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such coevolution does not imply that the ants and the tree choose to behave in an [[altruism|altruistic]] manner. Rather, across a population small genetic changes in both ant and tree benefited each. The benefit gave a slightly higher chance of the characteristic being passed on to the next generation. Over time, successive mutations created the relationship we observe today.

== Speciation ==
{{main|Speciation}}
[[File:Aulonocara hansbaenschi RB3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|There are numerous species of [[cichlid]]s that demonstrate dramatic variations in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].]]

Given the right circumstances, and enough time, evolution leads to the emergence of new species. Scientists have struggled to find a precise and all-inclusive definition of ''species''. Ernst Mayr defined a species as a population or group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed naturally with one another to produce viable, fertile offspring. (The members of a species cannot produce viable, fertile offspring with members of ''other'' species).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|2001|pp=165–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr's definition has gained wide acceptance among biologists, but does not apply to organisms such as [[bacteria]], which reproduce [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]].

Speciation is the lineage-splitting event that results in two separate species forming from a single common ancestral population.&lt;ref name="Geographic" /&gt; A widely accepted method of speciation is called ''[[allopatric speciation]]''. Allopatric speciation begins when a population becomes geographically separated.&lt;ref name="PBS_Evolution_glossary" /&gt; Geological processes, such as the emergence of mountain ranges, the formation of canyons, or the flooding of land bridges by changes in sea level may result in separate populations. For speciation to occur, separation must be substantial, so that genetic exchange between the two populations is completely disrupted. In their separate environments, the genetically isolated groups follow their own unique evolutionary pathways. Each group will accumulate different mutations as well as be subjected to different selective pressures. The accumulated genetic changes may result in separated populations that can no longer interbreed if they are reunited.&lt;ref name="Geographic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quammen |first=David |authorlink=David Quammen |date=November 2004 |title=Was Darwin Wrong? |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0411/feature1/fulltext.html |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |type=Online extra |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barriers that prevent interbreeding are either ''prezygotic'' (prevent mating or fertilisation) or ''postzygotic'' (barriers that occur after fertilisation).

Usually the process of speciation is slow, occurring over very long time spans; thus direct observations within human life-spans are rare. However speciation has been observed in present-day organisms, and past speciation events are recorded in fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jiggins |first1=Chris D. |last2=Bridle |first2=Jon R. |date=March 2004 |title=Speciation in the apple maggot fly: a blend of vintages? |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Cell Press |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=111–114 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2003.12.008 |pmid=16701238 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html |title=Observed Instances of Speciation |last=Boxhorn |first=Joseph |date=September 1, 1995 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weinberg |first1=James R. |last2=Starczak |first2=Victoria R. |last3=Jörg |first3=Daniele |date=August 1992 |title=Evidence for Rapid Speciation Following a Founder Event in the Laboratory |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] on behalf of the [[Society for the Study of Evolution]] |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=1214–1220 |doi=10.2307/2409766 |jstor=2409766 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have documented the formation of five new species of cichlid fishes from a single common ancestor that was isolated fewer than 5,000&amp;nbsp;years ago from the parent stock in Lake Nagubago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1970|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for speciation in this case was morphology (physical appearance) and lack of natural interbreeding.

== Mechanism ==
The theory of evolution is widely accepted among the scientific community, serving to link the diverse specialty areas of biology.&lt;ref name="delgado" /&gt; Evolution provides the field of biology with a solid scientific base. The significance of evolutionary theory is summarised by Theodosius Dobzhansky as "[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution|nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dobzhansky |first=Theodosius |authorlink=Theodosius Dobzhansky |date=March 1973 |title=Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution |journal=The American Biology Teacher |location=McLean, VA |publisher=[[National Association of Biology Teachers]] |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=125–129 |doi=10.2307/4444260 |ref=harv|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.525.3586&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncseweb.org/evolution/education/cans-cants-teaching-evolution |title=Cans and Can'ts of Teaching Evolution |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |date=October 17, 2008 |origyear=Originally published on [[PBS]] Online, May 2000 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |location=Berkeley, CA |type=Blog |accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the theory of evolution is not static. There is much discussion within the scientific community concerning the mechanisms behind the evolutionary process. For example, the rate at which evolution occurs is still under discussion. In addition, there are conflicting opinions as to which is the primary unit of evolutionary change—the organism or the gene.

=== Rate of change ===
Darwin and his contemporaries viewed evolution as a slow and gradual process. Evolutionary trees are based on the idea that profound differences in species are the result of many small changes that accumulate over long periods.

[[Gradualism]] had its basis in the works of the geologists James Hutton and Charles Lyell. Hutton's view suggests that profound geological change was the cumulative product of a relatively slow continuing operation of processes which can still be seen in operation today, as opposed to catastrophism which promoted the idea that sudden changes had causes which can no longer be seen at work. A uniformitarian perspective was adopted for biological changes. Such a view can seem to contradict the fossil record, which often shows evidence of new species appearing suddenly, then persisting in that form for long periods. In the 1970s paleontologists [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] developed a theoretical model that suggests that evolution, although a slow process in human terms, undergoes periods of relatively rapid change (ranging between 50,000 and 100,000 years)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ayala |first=Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J. Ayala |year=2005 |title=''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'': on Stephen Jay Gould's Monumental Masterpiece |doi=10.1080/14746700500039800 |journal=[[Theology and Science]] |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; alternating with long periods of relative stability. Their theory is called ''[[punctuated equilibrium]]'' and explains the fossil record without contradicting Darwin's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=August 1991 |title=Opus 200 |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pbierman/classes/gradsem/2005fall/Gould.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=Natural History Magazine, Inc. |volume=100 |issue=8 |pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unit of change ===
[[File:Richard dawkins.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Richard Dawkins]]]]
A common [[unit of selection]] in evolution is the organism. Natural selection occurs when the reproductive success of an individual is improved or reduced by an inherited characteristic, and reproductive success is measured by the number of an individual's surviving offspring. The organism view has been challenged by a variety of biologists as well as philosophers. [[Richard Dawkins]] proposes that much insight can be gained if we look at evolution from the gene's point of view; that is, that natural selection operates as an evolutionary mechanism on genes as well as organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |title=Genic and Organismic Selection |journal=Evolution |volume=34 |issue=5 |date=September 1980 |pages=825–843 |jstor=2407990|doi=10.2307/2407990|publisher=The Society for the Study of Evolution|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1976 book, ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', he explains:
{{cquote|Individuals are not stable things, they are fleeting. Chromosomes too are shuffled to oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But the cards themselves survive the shuffling. The cards are the genes. The genes are not destroyed by crossing-over, they merely change partners and march on. Of course they march on. That is their business. They are the replicators and we are their survival machines. When we have served our purpose we are cast aside. But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1976|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others view selection working on many levels, not just at a single level of organism or gene; for example, Stephen Jay Gould called for a hierarchical perspective on selection.&lt;ref name="pmid10518549"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |last2=Lloyd |first2=Elisabeth A. |authorlink2=Elisabeth Lloyd |date=October 12, 1999 |title=Individuality and adaptation across levels of selection: How shall we name and generalise the unit of Darwinism? |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

'''Jon Kabat-Zinn''' (born '''Jon Kabat''', June 5, 1944) is an [[United States|American]] professor emeritus of medicine and the creator of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]]. Kabat-Zinn was a student of [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachers such as [[Philip Kapleau]], [[Nhat Hanh|Thich Nhat Hanh]] and [[Seung Sahn]] and a founding member of [[Cambridge Zen Center]]. His practice of [[yoga]] and studies with Buddhist teachers led him to integrate their teachings with scientific findings. He teaches [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], which he says can help people cope with stress, anxiety, pain, and illness. The stress reduction program created by Kabat-Zinn, [[mindfulness-based stress reduction|mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)]], is offered by medical centers, hospitals, and health maintenance organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horstman |first=Judith |title=The Scientific American Brave New Brain  |date=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=San Francisco, Calif. |isbn=0470376244 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Kabat-Zinn was born in New York City in 1944 as the youngest of nine children to [[Elvin Kabat]], a biomedical scientist, and Sally Kabat, a painter. He graduated from [[Haverford College]] in 1964 and went on to earn a Ph.D. in [[molecular biology]] in 1971 from [[MIT]], where he studied under [[Salvador Luria]], [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]] in medicine.

While at MIT, Kabat-Zinn was a leading campaigner against military research at the university as well as a campaigner against the Vietnam war.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tech'', [http://tech.mit.edu/V89/PDF/V89-N34.pdf 7/10/69 p2-3] and [http://tech.mit.edu/V89/PDF/V89-N42.pdf 5/11/69 p1,3,4] and [http://tech.mit.edu/V89/PDF/V89-N43.pdf 7/11/69 p1,3,5] and [http://tech.mit.edu/V90/PDF/V90-N11.pdf 17/3/70 p1] and [http://tech.mit.edu/V90/PDF/V90-N23.pdf 5/5/70 p6 and 6/5/70 p1]; [http://mitscienceforthepeople.weebly.com/uploads/4/0/9/8/40982869/review_panel_on_speciallaboratories_-_final_report_-_oct_1969.pdf ''MIT Review Panel on Special Laboratories Final Report'']; J. Kabat-Zinn, ''Coming to Our Senses'' p556-9.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he pondered his life's purpose, which he called his "karmic assignment."&lt;ref name=origins&gt;https://www.umassmed.edu/uploadedFiles/cfm2/training/JKZ_paper_Contemporary_Buddhism_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Kabat-Zinn was first introduced to meditation by [[Philip Kapleau]], a Zen missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student. Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Buddhist teachers such as [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] and [[Seungsahn]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Wilson |title=Mindful America: The Mutual Transformation of Buddhist Meditation and American Culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at the [[Insight Meditation Society]] and eventually taught there.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; In 1979 he founded the Stress Reduction Clinic at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]], where he adapted the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness and developed the Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program. He subsequently renamed the structured eight-week course [[Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR). He removed the Buddhist framework and any connection between mindfulness and Buddhism, instead putting MBSR in a scientific context.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; He subsequently also founded the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. His secular technique, which combines meditation and [[Hatha yoga]], has since spread worldwide.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; The course aims to help patients cope with stress, pain, and illness by using what is called "moment-to-moment awareness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx |title=What is the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Course? |publisher=Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2012/0410/1224314560853.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Sylvia | last=Thompson | title=The Father of Mindfulness | date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kabat-Zinn's MBSR began to get increasing notice with the publication of his first book, ''Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness'' (Delta, 1991), which gave detailed instructions for the practice. Then, in 1993, his work in the Stress Reduction Clinic was featured in [[Bill Moyers]]'s PBS special ''Healing and the Mind'', spurring wide interest in MBSR and helping to make Kabat-Zinn nationally famous.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; In 1994 Kabat-Zinn's second book, titled ''Wherever You Go, There You Are'', became a national bestseller.&lt;ref name=Shambhala&gt;{{cite journal |first=Barry |last=Boyce |title=Jon Kabat-Zinn: The Man Who Prescribes the Medicine of the Moment |magazine=Shambhala Sun |date=May 2005 |url=https://www.lionsroar.com/jon-kabat-zinn-the-man-who-prescribes-the-medicine-of-the-moment/ |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter part of the 1990s, many MBSR clinics were opened, either as standalone centers or as part of a hospital's holistic medicine program.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

Research by Kabat-Zinn includes the effect of MBSR on [[psoriasis]], pain, anxiety, brain function, and immune function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jon Kabat-Zinn: Selected Publications |publisher=UMass Profiles |url=http://profiles.umassmed.edu/profiles/display/130749 |accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBSR has been adapted for use by the US military to improve combatants' "operational effectiveness," apparently with Kabat-Zinn's approval, which has provoked some controversy among mindfulness practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Titmuss, [http://christophertitmussblog.org/are-buddhist-mindfulness-practices-used-to-support-international-war-crimes 'Are Buddhist Mindfulness Practices used to support International War Crimes?']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Purser, [http://www.inquiringmind.com/Articles/MilitarizationOfMindfulness.html 'The Militarization of Mindfulness'], ''Inquiring Mind'', Spring 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.army.mil/article/92410/Dr__Kabat__Zinn_talks_about_Mindfulness_Program_in_Camp_Zama/ 'Dr. Kabat- Zinn talks about Mindfulness Program in Camp Zama'].&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the integration of narratives into mindfulness practice, Kabat-Zinn has said, "''the map... can occlude... the territory.''' &lt;ref name=origins/&gt;{{explain|date=July 2017}}

Kabat-Zinn is Professor of Medicine Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.&lt;ref name=Cochran/&gt;

==Personal life==
Kabat-Zinn is married to Myla Zinn, the daughter of Roslyn and [[Howard Zinn]]. They have three grown children.&lt;ref&gt;''Gesund durch Meditation'' p330 and 331 the German translation of ''Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain and Illness''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Map symbolization''' is the [[character (symbol)|character]]s, [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s, or similar [[graphic]] representations used on a [[map]] to indicate an object or characteristic in the real world.

==Cognitive issues==
In [[cartography]], the principles of [[cognition]] are important since they explain why certain map symbols work.&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=J. M.|year=1979|title=Cognitive Cartographic Experimentation|journal=The Canadian Cartographer|volume=16|pages=34-44|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, mapmakers did not care why they worked. This [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] view treats the human brain like a black box.  Modern cartographers are curious why certain symbols are the most effective. This should help develop a theoretical basis for how brains recognize [[symbols]] and, in turn, provide a platform for creating new symbols.

==Topographic maps==
[[Topographic map]]s show the shape of Earth’s surface by using [[contour line]]s, the lines on the map that join points of equal elevation. They are among the most well-known symbols on modern maps as they are self-explanatory and accurately represent their phenomena. They make it possible to the depict height, depth, and even [[slope]]. Contour lines will be closer together or spaced apart to show the steepness of the area. If the line is spaced closer together, it means that there is a steeper slope. If they are farther apart, the area has a low slope. An area of low slope generally uses [[contour interval]]s of 10 feet or less. Areas that contain mountain or other high slope can use an interval of 100 feet.&lt;ref name=topographic&gt;{{cite web |title= Topographic Map Symbols |year= April 28, 2005 |accessdate= May 4, 2011 |publisher= U.S. Geological Survey |url= http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from showing just [[contour lines]], [[topographic maps]] also use a lot of map symbols to represent its features. Features are represented by using point, line, and area symbols. Individual features, such as houses, are shown as point symbols like a small dot or square. However, a cluster of houses or neighborhood can be shown as a shaded area or polygon. Areas of importance or [[landmarks]] may receive special symbols that represent what they are. For instance, a [[Church (building)|church]] may be symbolized as a picture of a little church or [[cross]] or the [[town hall]] may have a special color or symbol.

==Shape and color of topographic symbols==
Many of the symbol feature on maps of the earth will be shown by straight, curved, dashed, or solid lines. They may also be colored to represent different classes of information. The typical color standard for topographic maps depicts contours in brown, bodies of water in blue, boundaries in black, and grids and roads in red. Topographic maps may use different colors to represent [[Geographical feature|area features]]. Most topographic maps will use green for vegetation or national parks and wildlife management areas. They will also use blue for rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water. Red may also be used to represent areas of significant importance.&lt;ref name=topographic /&gt;

A map is a smaller representation of an area on the earth’s surface; therefore, map symbols are used to represent real objects. Without symbols, maps would not be possible.&lt;ref name=symbols /&gt; Both shapes and colors can be used for symbols on maps. A small circle may mean a point of interest, with a brown circle meaning [[recreation]], red circle meaning services, and green circle meaning rest stop. Colors may cover larger areas of a map, such as green representing forested land and blue representing waterways. To ensure that a person can correctly read a map, a map legend{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} is a key to all the symbols used on a map. It is like a dictionary so you can understand the meaning of what the map represents/&lt;ref name=symbols&gt;{{cite web |title= Map Symbols |date= n.d. |accessdate= May 4, 2011 |work= Compass Dude |url=  http://www.compassdude.com/map-symbols.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules to follow==
There are certain rules to follow with map symbols. The representative symbols should always be placed on the left and defined to the right. This allows for the reader to view the symbol first, then its definition, which is customary in English dictionaries. In most cases, representative symbols should be vertically displayed and the symbols should be horizontally centred. The symbols should be vertically centred with the definitions. The definitions are supposed to be horizontally centred to the left.

==Representing spatial phenomena==
Symbols are used to represent geographic phenomena. Most phenomena can be represented by using point, line, or area symbols.&lt;ref name=krygier&gt;{{cite book |last1= Krygier |first1= J. |last2= Wood |first2= D. |lastauthoramp =yes |year= 2005 |title= Making Maps: A Visual Guide to Map Design for GIS |location= New York |publisher= Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to consider the spatial arrangement of the phenomena to determine what kind of symbolization it will require. Discrete phenomena occur at isolated points, whereas continuous phenomena occur everywhere. Both of these can also be broken down into either smooth or abrupt. For example, rainfall and taxes for states are both continuous in nature, but rainfall is smooth because it does not vary at state boundaries, leaving the tax to be considered abrupt. It is important to distinguish between real world and the data we use to represent it.
There are basically five types of spatial dimensions that are used to classify phenomena for map symbolization. Point phenomena are assumed to have no spatial extent and are said to be zero-dimensional. These use point symbols on a map to indicate their location. An example of these would be fire hydrants or trees in a park. Linear phenomena are one-dimensional and have a length. This would include any line feature on a map like roads or sidewalks. Areal phenomena are 2-D that has both a length and a width.  The best example of this would be a lake or other body of water. When volume comes into consideration, it is broken down into two types, 2 ½ dimensions and 3-D. A good example of 2 ½ D would be the elevation of a place above sea level, while 3-D being any three-dimensional objects.

==Ranking==
An important factor in map symbols is the order in which they are ranked according to their relative importance. This is known as intellectual hierarchy. The most important hierarchy is the thematic symbols and type labels that are directly related to the theme. Next comes the title, subtitle, and [[Legend_(map)#Map_symbology|legend]].&lt;ref name=krygier /&gt; The map must also contain base information, such as boundaries, roads, and place names. Data source and notes should be on all maps. Lastly, the scale, neat lines, and north arrow are the least important of the hierarchy of the map. From this we see that the symbols are the single most important thing to build a good [[visual hierarchy]] that shows proper graphical representation. When producing a map with good visual hierarchy, thematic symbols should be graphically emphasized. A map with a visual hierarchy that is effective attracts the map user’s eyes to the symbols with the most important aspects of the map first and to the symbols with the lesser importance later.

The legend of the map also contains important information and all of the thematic symbols of the map. Symbol that need no explanation, or do not coincide with the theme of the map, are normally omitted from the map legend. Thematic symbols directly represent the maps theme and should stand out.&lt;ref name=symbols /&gt;

==Choropleth maps==
[[Choropleth map]]ping is commonly used to show data for counties, states, or other enumeration units. Data collected for choropleth maps is usually grouped into separate classes based on attributes or other forms of classification. The classes are given a specific color or shading based on their values and what they are trying to portray. Choropleth maps are most effective when the data or classes change abruptly at each enumerated boundary.&lt;ref name=slocum&gt;{{cite book |last1= Slocum |first1= T. A. |last2= McMaster |first2= R. B. |last3= Kessler |first3= F. C.  |last4= Howard |first4= H. H.  |lastauthoramp =yes |year= 2005 |title= Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization |location= Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proportional symbol map is better than choropleth maps for showing raw data totals. A proportional symbols map uses symbols that are proportional to the data that they are representing with point locations. These symbols can be true points or conceptual points. True points represent real objects or the exact location of a tangible object. This could be an oil well or fire hydrant. A conceptual point represents the center of the [[Enumeration|enumeration unit]], such as a corn field. The raw data on proportional symbol maps go hand in hand with the data shown on choropleth maps.&lt;ref name=slocum /&gt;

==Isopleth maps==
Isopleth maps use [[Contour_line#Isopleths|isolines]] that connect points of equal values. A good example of isolines is connecting areas with similar temperatures. As with choropleth maps, Isopleth maps require standardized data to be appropriately contoured.

==Dot maps==
[[Dot distribution map|Dot maps]] use one single dot to represent where a single phenomenon is the most likely to occur. The total amount of dots can cover a single area or multiple areas. The [[density]] of the dots is interpreted by the user as areas of high value. This method is more accurate than proportional and Isopleth maps.&lt;ref name=slocum /&gt;

'''Music without sound''' can refer to music that falls outside the range of human hearing (typically 20&amp;nbsp;Hz–20&amp;nbsp;kHz) or to compositions, such as [[visual music]], that are analogous to or suggestive of conventional music but in media other than sound, such as color, shape, position, motion and literature (see Discursive music below). It is commonly taken for granted that music is wont to be performed or recorded, but some sound works simply won't fit on a disc or on stage, being either extremely discreet (like Robin Minard's ''Silent Music'') or incomplete (Varèse's Unfinished music). Additionally, silence can be regarded as the [[via negativa]] of music and has induced long lasting fascination to music composers of all kinds. A composer deals with the absence of sound as much as they deal with sounds. Therefore, this article includes several examples of [[apophasis]] in music (like Algorithmic music or Gesture Music). 
{{cquote|''"It seems to me that the most radical redefinition of music would be one that defines 'music' without reference to sound."''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Ashley]], 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nyman, ''Experimental Music'', 1974, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Gesture music==
'''Sofia Gubaidulina'''&lt;br /&gt;
Silence in music happens when the music stops during a performance. It is sometimes replaced by gesture music. In his Sofia Gubaidulina biography,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurtz ''Sofia Gubaidulina: A Biography'', p 184, english translation Indiana University Press, 2007 (written 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kurtz mentions the ''silent solo performance by the conductor'' included in ''...Stimmenn... verstummen...'', an orchestral work from 1986.
{{cquote|''The symphony is notable for its careful and innovative use of silence. Though the eighth movement has the largest proportions of the work, the climax actually takes place in the ninth movement when the conductor motions before a silent orchestra. The motions the conductor makes are meant to make his hands move increasingly farther apart from each other according to the Fibonacci sequence. This "conductor solo" is repeated at the end of the work, when after the last note is sounded the conductor continues to motion for several minutes.''&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia [[Stimmen Verstummen|...Stimmenn... verstummen...]] article}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Knizak-snowstorm.jpg|right|thumb|Milan Knizak's 1965 Snowstorm N°1]] --&gt;
'''Milan Knizak'''&lt;br /&gt;
From 1960, the International [[Fluxus]] Movement created a number of Events or Verbal Pieces, whose temporal structures were typically vague so as to be sometimes without beginning nor end, with or without sound, with or without music. A remarkable example is that of Czech artist Milan Knizak's 1965 Snowstorm N°1 whose score states: ''Paper gliders are distributed to an idle and waiting audience.''
{{cquote|''Another Event, by Czech Fluxus artist Milan Knizak, is called Snowstorm N°1 (1965) and simply instructs that ‘Paper gliders are distributed to an idle and waiting audience’. What results is a snowstorm of quietly gliding paper airplanes as the audience returns them back and forth and so on. The exchange of sheets is experimentaly beautiful, like the caring gesture toward the instrument as tended by Brecht.''&lt;br /&gt;[From ''Not the Other Avant-garde''].&lt;ref&gt;James Martin Harding and John Rouse (editors) ''Not the Other Avant-Garde: The Transnational Foundations of Avant-Garde Performance'', University of Michigan Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-472-06931-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-472-06931-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;br /&gt;'''Helmut Lachenmann'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Lachenmann]] composed ''Salut Für Caldwell'' for 2 guitars in 1977. The piece includes silent moments when ''« the players silent motions and gestures created a space of unheard music »''
[Michael Kurtz&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurtz ''Sofia Gubaidulina: A Biography'', p 192, english translation Indiana University Press, 2007 (written 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;]

&lt;br /&gt;'''Takehisa Kosugi'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 1963 [[Takehisa Kosugi]] composed for ''Fluxus 1'' a musical piece called ''Theatre Music'' in the form of a rectangle of cardstock that bore the trace of a spiral of moving feet. This was paired with the instructions: "Keep walking intently".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mereweather ed., ''Art Anti-Art Non-Art'', Getty Research Institute, 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;'''Juan María Solare'''&lt;br /&gt;
* His work ''[[Gestenstücke]]'' (2008) is a collection of five pieces for 4 performers in which a musical structure is used to put order in non-sounding elements, concretely gestures. For instance, the first piece of the cycle is a canon of gestures. Premiere: University Bremen, Ensemble Neues Musiktheater, June 12, 2008.
* Another non-sounding piece is his conceptual work called ''Tense Atmosphere'' a graphic score which consists of a silence with a sforzato sign (2013).

== Algorithmic music ==
[[File:Stadler -579180303.jpg|right|thumb|Maximilian Stadler (1748-1833)]]
''A sequence of finite instructions'' according to Wikipedia, an [[algorithm]] relates to computation, which ultimately relates to music. Eighteenth century algorithmic music is a contemporary of [[automaton]] machines, like [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]'s duck or [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]]'s chess player, or [[Ada Lovelace]] and [[Charles Babbage]]'s 1822 difference engine. In 1787, [[W.A. Mozart]] (1756–1791) devised an aleatoric system called ''[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]'' (''Musical Dice'')&lt;ref&gt;Musikalisches Würfelspiel (Musical Dice Game), K.516f in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart’s music&lt;/ref&gt; published 1793 by J.J. Hummel in Berlin-Amsterdam, to compose waltzes with a pair of dice and a set of written bars on paper cards.&lt;ref&gt;See Hideo Noguchi's [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~rb5h-ngc/e/k516f.htm article]: ''Mozart Musical Game in C K. 516f'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of all the 16 cards and transitions, of which there are theoretically &lt;math&gt;10^{29}&lt;/math&gt; combinations, constitutes a minuet.&lt;ref&gt;Computation from John Chuang in a 1995 [http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/Mozart/dice/ article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian composer Maximilian Johann Karl Dominik Stadler, also known as [[Maximilian Stadler]] (1748–1833), created a table to compose [[minuet]]s and trios with a pair of dice. In the case of the minuet version, there are 16 cards with one bar each and preconceived transitions between certain musical measures. Mathematical games columnist Martin Gardner once remarked in an article about automated music composition. ''"If you fail to preserve it, it will be a waltz that will probably never be heard again."''&lt;ref&gt;See Ivars Peterson's [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/1956/title/Mozarts_Melody_Machine article] ''Mozart's Melody Machine'' on Science News&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of pure [[aleatoric music]] was used in the twentieth century by US composer [[Lejaren Hiller]].

== The optophonic piano&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Opto-disc.jpg|right|thumb| Optophonic disc, paint on glass, diameter: 40cms, ca. 1920-24]] --&gt; ==
[[Wladimir Baranoff-Rossiné]]&lt;ref&gt;See Baranoff-Rossiné's official web [http://www.baranoffrossine.com/museum/optophonicpiano/ page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627175122/http://www.baranoffrossine.com/museum/optophonicpiano/ |date=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started building his [[optophonic piano]] in the 1915s. A set of painted glass discs are rotated via the small keyboard. Light is projected through the discs onto the wall. The player can control intensity of light and speed of rotation. 6 or 8 keys of the 3-octaves keyboard are devoted to colored discs. It is not clear what kind of sound the keyboard is able to produce. Oscillator frequencies (as stated in some articles) are rather unlikely between 1915-1920. More probably the light show was performed with piano accompaniment, maybe performed on the reduced keyboard of the Optosonic Piano, akin to a toy piano.

== Unfinished/aborted music ==
At one point, the music exists in the composer's mind. In 1928, [[Edgar Varèse]] started working on an opera called ''L'Astronome'' based on North American Indian legends, a project he never completed and destroyed the drafts. In 1932, he asked [[Antonin Artaud]] to write the libretto of a large scale oratorio, ''Il n'ya plus de firmament'' (There is no longer any firmament). In his book ''Phantasmatic Radio'' '''Allen S. Weiss''' translates the beginning of Artaud's text:
{{cquote|''Darkness. Explosions in this darkness. Harmonies suddenly broken off. Harsh sounds. Depressurized soundings. The music will give the impression of a distant cataclysm and will fill the room, falling as from vertiginous heights. Chords will originate in the sky and then deteriorate, going from one extreme to the other. Sounds will fall as if from very high, then suddenly stop and spread out in bursts, forming vaults and parasols. Tiers of sounds...'' [in ''Phantasmatic Radio''&lt;ref&gt;Allen S. Weiss, ''Phantasmatic Radio'', Duke University Press, 1995, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;]}}
The piece was never completed and Varèse turned to other projects, including a radiophonic work involving various synchronised choirs located in different places of the world. He never found the technology for it. In 1948, Artaud insisted on having noise sounds included in his ''Pour en finir avec le judgement de Dieu'' (To have done with the judgment of God). This was done in the Radiodiffusion Television Française studios where [[Pierre Schaeffer]] was working at the time.

== Silent music ==
''Silent Music'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Schulz (editor) ''Silent Music - zwischen Klangkunst und Akustikdesign/Between Sound Art and Acoustic Design'', book+CD, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is an installation work by Canadian artist [[Robin Minard]] (b1953) with several hundred wall-mounted piezo loudspeakers and four-channel audio. The miniature loudspeakers are displayed in plant-like shapes on the walls of public spaces. They reproduce the minuscule ambient sounds of the public space where they are installed or play random synthetic sounds at barely audible volume. Minard deals with remote sounds best suited to intimate listening. In 2006 he created 'A voir en silence', a small artist book with loudspeakers and hand-written text.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Meinhardt ''Silent Music/Adelaide Festival'' DVD, Australia, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discursive music ==
'''Marcel Proust'''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Vinteuil Sonata]] (French: [[:fr:Sonate de Vinteuil|''Sonate de Vinteuil'']]) is an imaginary violin and piano sonata by fictitious composer Vinteuil recurring several times in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''), particularly in ''[[Un amour de Swann|Un Amour De Swann]]'' (1913). In the latter volume, Charles Swann associates strong emotions and memories to the melody composed by Vinteuil. The French composer [[Reynaldo Hahn]] noticed how much Marcel Proust ''"vivait la musique de son temps"'' (experienced contemporary music).&lt;ref&gt;See Adrien De Vries' [http://www.classiquenews.com/applaudir/lire_article.aspx?article=1012&amp;identifiant=20074159EEHR4OOD1ZQH7CEC61RFTMS8 article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205112508/http://www.classiquenews.com/applaudir/lire_article.aspx?article=1012&amp;identifiant=20074159EEHR4OOD1ZQH7CEC61RFTMS8 |date=2008-12-05 }}: ''Sources de la Sonate de Vinteuil'', April 2007 (in french)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Proust immediately praised and enjoyed [[Debussy]]'s 1902 ''[[Pelléas_et_Mélisande_(opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande ]]'' opera. Critics disagree on which composer inspired the Sonata. Possibly [[Gabriel Fauré]]&lt;ref&gt;See Margaret Hunter and Abigail Al-Doory's [http://www.french.pomona.edu/MSAIGAL/CLASSES/FR185/FALL96/aaldoory-mhunter/ article]: ''L'homme et la Musique Dans Un Amour de Swann'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; or [[César Franck]]. In [[:fr:Les Plaisirs et les Jours|Les Plaisirs et les Jours]] (1896), Proust focusses on [[Hans Sachs]]'s monologue from [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', Act II. In ''[[Jean Santeuil]]'' (1952), a [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] Sonata for Violin and Piano (op. 75, 1885) plays a key role and is presumably the model for the Sonate de Vinteuil. In ''Un Amour De Swann'', the Vinteuil Sonata is played during evenings at the Verdurins' by pianist Dechambre. The main character's emotions are mirrored by Proust's musical reminiscences. 

'''Walter Marchetti'''
&lt;br /&gt;A good example of imaginary music can be found in a Walter Marchetti poem where he mentions a Juan Hidalgo imaginary composition (both Hidalgo and Marchetti were members of the Spanish [[Zaj]] Group of Madrid in the late 1950s).
{{cquote|''Eat an iced popsicle and thus perform his free''&lt;br /&gt;''transcription, for only one performer, of''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Music For Five Dogs, an iced'''''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Popsicle and Six Male Performers'''''&lt;br /&gt;''by Juan Hidalgo.''&lt;br /&gt;Walter Marchetti in ''A Zaj Sampler''&lt;ref&gt;Something Else Press, New York, 1967, reissued by Great Bear Pamphlets&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nāmarūpa''' is a [[dvandva]] compound in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli|Pali]] meaning "name ('''nāma''')  and form ('''rūpa''')".

==Nāmarūpa in Buddhism==
{{Nidanas|float=right}}
{{main|Skandha}}
This term is used in Buddhism to refer to constituent processes of the human being: '''nāma''' is typically considered to refer to psychological elements of the human person, while '''[[rūpa]]''' refers to the physical.  The Buddhist ''nāma'' and ''rūpa'' are mutually dependent, and not separable; as ''nāmarūpa'', they designate an individual being.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 350, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:2860.pali entry for "Nāma"] (retrieved 2007-06-20), states:
:"nāma as metaphysical term is opposed to rūpa, &amp; comprises the 4 immaterial factors of an individual ({{IAST|arūpino khandhā, viz. vedanā saññā sankhāra viññāṇa}}...). These as the noëtic principle comb[ine]d with the material principle make up the individual as it is distinguished by 'name &amp; body' from other individuals. Thus nāmarūpa= individuality, individual being. These two are inseparable...."&lt;/ref&gt; Namarupa are also referred to as the [[Skandha|five skandhas]], "the psycho-physical organism", “mind-and-matter,” and “mentality-and-materiality”.

===Psychobio constituents===

In the [[Pali Canon]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] describes ''nāmarūpa'' in this manner (English on left, [[Pali]] on right):
{| cellpadding=10
|"And what [monks] is name-&amp;-form? [[Vedana|Feeling]], [[samjna|perception]], intention, [[Phassa|contact]], &amp; attention: This is called name. The four [[mahābhūta|great elements]], and the form dependent on the four great elements: This is called [[Rūpa|form]]. This name &amp; this form are, [monks], called name-&amp;-form."&lt;ref&gt;From [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.2 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997)].&lt;/ref&gt;
||
''{{IAST|Katamañca [[Bhikkhu|bhikkhave]] nāmarūpaṃ? [[Vedana|Vedanā]] [[Samjna|saññā]] cetanā [[Phassa|phasso]] manasikāro, idaṃ vuccati nāmaṃ. Cattāro ca [[Mahābhūta|mahābhūtā]], catunnaṃ ca mahābhūtānaṃ upādāyarūpaṃ, idaṃ vuccati [[rūpa]]ṃ. Iti idañca nāmaṃ, idañca rūpaṃ, idaṃ vuccati bhikkhave, nāmarūpaṃ.}}''&lt;ref&gt;SLTP (n.d.), 1.1.2, ''{{IAST|Vibhańgasuttaṃ}}''.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Elsewhere in the [[Pali Canon]], ''nāmarūpa'' is used synonymously with the five [[skandha|aggregates]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, ''op cit''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empty of self===

In keeping with the doctrine of [[anatman|anātman]]/[[anatta]], "the absence of an (enduring, essential) self", '''nāma''' and '''rūpa''' are held to be constantly in a state of flux, with only the continuity of experience (itself a product of dependent origination) providing an experience of any sort of conventional 'self'.

===Part of the cycle of suffering===

Nāmarūpa is the fourth of the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Nidānas]], preceded by consciousness (Pali: ''[[Vijnana|viññāna]]''; Skt.: ''vijñana'') and followed by the six sense bases (Pali: ''[[Sadayatana|{{IAST|saḷāyatana}}]]''; Skt: ''{{IAST|ṣaḍāyatana}}'').  Thus, in the [[Sutta Nipata]], the Buddha explains to the Ven. Ajita how [[samsara|samsaric]] [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] ceases:
:[Ven. Ajita:]
::...name &amp; form, dear sir:
::Tell me, when asked this,
:::where are they brought to a halt?
:
:[The Buddha:]
::This question you've asked, Ajita,
::I'll answer it for you — 
::where name &amp; form
:::are brought to a halt
:::without trace:
::With the cessation of consciousness
:::they're brought
:::to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.5.01.than.html Thanissaro (1994).] In explaining this specific exchange between Ven. Ajita and the Buddha, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.5.01.irel.html#n-2 Ireland (1983, 1994), ''n''. 2] states:
:This question and answer refers to the doctrine of dependent-arising (''[[paticca-samuppada]]''). Where rebirth-consciousness (''pati-sandhi-[[vijnana|vinnana]]'') does not arise there is no establishment of an individual (mind-and-body, ''namarupa'') in a realm of existence, nor the consequent appearance of [[Jaramarana|old age and death]] and the other [[dukkha|sufferings]] inherent in life.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nāmarūpa in Hinduism ==
The term ''nāmarūpa'' is used in [[Hindu]] thought, ''nāma'' describing the spiritual or essential properties of an object or being, and ''rūpa'' the physical presence that it manifests. These terms are used similarly to the way that '[[essence]]' and '[[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]' are used in [[Catholic]] [[theology]] to describe [[transubstantiation]]. The distinction between nāma and rūpa in Hindu thought explains the ability of spiritual powers to manifest through inadequate or inanimate vessels - as observed in possession and oracular phenomena, as well as in the presence of the divine in images that are worshiped through [[Puja (Hinduism)|pūja]].

Nāma Rupatmak Vishva is the Vedanta (a school of [[Sanatana Dharma]]/[[Hinduism]]) term for the manifest Universe, viz. The World as we know it. Since every object in this World has a Nāma and Rupa,the World is called Nāma Rupatmak Vishva. The Paramātma (or Creator) is not manifest in this Nāma Rupatmak Vishva but is realized by a Sādhaka(student) by means of Bhakti (devotion), Karma (duty), Jnana (knowledge), [[Yoga]] (Union, a Hindu school), or a combination of all of these methodologies.{{see also|Hiranyagarbha}}

E. Nisbett, &amp; B. Weiner (Eds.), ''Attribution: Perceiving the causes of behavior.'' Morristown, NJ: General Learning Press.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''negativity effect''', is the notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things.&lt;ref name="Baumeister et al. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bad is stronger than good |journal=Review of General Psychology |year=2001 |last=Baumeister |first=Roy F. |authorlink=Roy Baumeister |last2=Finkenauer |first2=Catrin |last3=Vohs |first3=Kathleen D. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=323–370 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.5.4.323 |url=http://assets.csom.umn.edu/assets/71516.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lewicka et al. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Positive-negative asymmetry or "When the heart needs a reason" |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=1992 |last=Lewicka |first=Maria |last2=Czapinski |first2=Janusz |authorlink2=Janusz Czapiński |last3=Peeters |first3=Guido |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=425–434 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420220502 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420220502/abstract;jsessionid=E2B5E1A2FAB285E54D8187CF7445F528.f03t03 |accessdate=2014-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rozin &amp; Royzman 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Negativity bias, negativity dominance, and contagion |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |year=2001 |last=Rozin |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Rozin |last2=Royzman |first2=Edward B. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=296–320 |doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2 |url=http://psr.sagepub.com/content/5/4/296.refs |accessdate=2014-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a person's behavior and cognition than something equally emotional but negative.  The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the [[impression formation|formation of impressions]] and general evaluations; attention, learning, and memory; and [[decision-making]] and risk considerations.

==Explanations==
[[Paul Rozin]] and Edward Royzman proposed four elements of the negativity bias in order to explain its manifestation: negative potency, steeper negative gradients, negativity dominance, and negative differentiation.&lt;ref name = "Rozin &amp; Royzman 2001" /&gt;

'''Negative potency''' refers to the notion that, while possibly of equal magnitude or emotionality, negative and positive items/events/etc. are not equally salient.  Rozin and Royzman note that this characteristic of the negativity bias is only empirically demonstrable in situations with inherent measurability, such as comparing how positively or negatively a change in temperature is interpreted.

With respect to positive and negative gradients, it appears to be the case that negative events are thought to be perceived as increasingly more negative than positive events are increasingly positive the closer one gets (spatially or temporally) to the [[affect (psychology)|affective]] event itself.  In other words, there is a '''steeper negative gradient''' than positive gradient.  For example, the negative experience of an impending dental surgery is perceived as increasingly more negative the closer one gets to the date of surgery than the positive experience of an impending party is perceived as increasingly more positive the closer one gets to the date of celebration  (assuming for the sake of this example that these events are equally positive and negative).  Rozin and Royzman argue that this characteristic is distinct from that of negative potency because there appears to be evidence of steeper negative slopes relative to positive slopes even when potency itself is low.

'''Negativity dominance''' describes the tendency for the combination of positive and negative items/events/etc. to skew towards an overall more negative interpretation than would be suggested by the summation of the individual positive and negative components.  Phrasing in more [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]]-friendly terms, the whole is more negative than the sum of its parts.

'''Negative differentiation''' is consistent with evidence suggesting that the conceptualization of negativity is more elaborate and complex than that of positivity.  For instance, research indicates that negative vocabulary is more richly descriptive of the affective experience than that of positive vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Peeters 1971"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The positive-negative asymmetry: On cognitive consistency and positivity bias |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=1971 |last=Peeters |first=Guido |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=455–474 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420010405 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420010405/abstract |accessdate=2014-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, there appear to be more terms employed to indicate negative emotions than positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Averill, J. R., (1980). On the paucity of positive emotions. In K. R. Blankstein, P. Pliner, &amp; J. Polivy (Eds.), ''Advances in the study of communication and affect, Vol. 6'' (p. 745). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The affective tone of psychology |journal=Journal of General Psychology |year=1966 |last=Carlson |first=Earl R. |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=65–78 |doi=10.1080/00221309.1966.9710350 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221309.1966.9710350?journalCode=vgen20#.VG0UdItR7oE |accessdate=2014-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of negative differentiation is consistent with the mobilization-minimization hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Taylor, S. E. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Asymmetrical effects of positive and negative events: The mobilization-minimization hypothesis |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=1991 |last=Taylor |first=Shelley E. |authorlink=Shelley E.

==Evidence==

===Social judgments and impression formation===
Most of the early evidence suggesting a negativity bias stems from research on social judgments and impression formation, in which it became clear that negative information was typically more heavily weighted when participants were tasked with forming comprehensive evaluations and impressions of other target individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Linguistic bases of social perception. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |year=1997 |last=Berry |first=Diane S. |last2=Hiller |first2=Wendy S. |last3=Mueller |first3=Jennifer S. |last4=Pennebaker |first4=James W. |authorlink4=James W.

As an example, a famous study by [[Leon Festinger]] and colleagues investigated critical factors in predicting friendship formation; the researchers concluded that whether or not people became friends was most strongly predicted by their proximity to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L., Schacter, S., &amp; Back, K. (1950). ''Social pressures in informal groups: A study of a housing community.'' Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ebbesen, Kjos, and Konecni, however, demonstrated that proximity itself does not predict friendship formation; rather, proximity serves to amplify the information that is relevant to the decision of either forming or not forming a friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Spatial ecology: Its effects on the choice of friends and enemies |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |year=1976 |last=Ebbesen |first=Ebbe B. |last2=Kjos |first2=Glenn L. |last3=Konecni |first3=Vladimir J. |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=505–518 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(76)90030-5 |url=http://konecni.ucsd.edu/pdf/1976%20JESP%20Spatial%20Ecology.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Negative information is just as amplified as positive information by proximity.  As negative information tends to outweigh positive information, proximity may predict a failure to form friendships even more so than successful friendship formation.&lt;ref name = "Baumeister et al. 2001" /&gt;

One explanation that has been put forth as to why such a negativity bias is demonstrated in social judgments is that people may generally consider negative information to be more diagnostic of an individual's character than positive information, that it is more useful than positive information in forming an overall impression.&lt;ref name = "Hamilton &amp; Huffman 1971"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Generality of impression formation processes for evaluative and nonevaluative judgments |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1971 |last=Hamilton |first=David L. |last2=Huffman |first2=Leroy J. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=200–207 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1972-06714-001 |accessdate=2014-11-19 |doi=10.1037/h0031698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is supported by indications of higher confidence in the accuracy of one's formed impression when it was formed more on the basis of negative traits than positive traits.&lt;ref name = "Baumeister et al. 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton &amp; Zanna 1972"/&gt;  People consider negative information to be more important to impression formation and, when it is available to them, they are subsequently more confident.

An oft-cited paradox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Negativity and positivity effects in person perception and inference: Ability versus morality. |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=1992 |last=Martijn |first=Carolien |last2=Spears |first2=Russell |last3=van der Pligt |first3=Joop |last4=Jakobs |first4=Esther |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=453–463 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420220504 |url=http://joopvanderpligt.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/martijn-ejsp-1992.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Caught in the act: When impressions based on highly diagnostic behaviors are resistant to contradiction. |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=1992 |last=Skowronski |first=John J. |last2=Carlston |first2=Donal E. |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=435–452 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420220503 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420220503/abstract |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a dishonest person can sometimes act honestly while still being considered to be predominantly dishonest; on the other hand, an honest person who sometimes does dishonest things will likely be reclassified as a dishonest person.  It is expected that a dishonest person will occasionally be honest, but this honesty will not counteract the prior demonstrations of dishonesty. Honesty is considered more easily tarnished by acts of dishonesty. Honesty itself would then be not diagnostic of an honest nature, only the absence of dishonesty.

The presumption that negative information has greater diagnostic accuracy is also evident in voting patterns.  Voting behaviors have been shown to be more affected or motivated by negative information than positive: people tend to be more motivated to vote against a candidate because of negative information than they are to vote for a candidate because of positive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Negativity effects in impression formation: A test in the political arena |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |year=1991 |last=Klein |first=Jill G. |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=412–418 |issn=0146-1672 |doi=10.1177/0146167291174009 |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/69102 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Klein 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Negativity in intradimensional judgments of presidential candidates |journal=Advances in Consumer Research |year=1998 |last=Klein |first=Jill G. |volume=25 |pages=574–577 |url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=8213 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted by researcher Jill Klein, "character weaknesses were more important than strengths in determining...the ultimate vote".&lt;ref name = "Klein 1998" /&gt;

This diagnostic preference for negative traits over positive traits is thought to be a consequence of behavioral expectations: there is a general expectation that, owing to social requirements and regulations, people will generally behave positively and exhibit positive traits. Contrastingly, negative behaviors/traits are more unexpected and, thus, more salient when they are exhibited.&lt;ref name = "Kanouse &amp; Hanson 1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Baumeister et al. 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fiske 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hamilton &amp; Huffman 1971" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Boucher &amp; Osgood"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Pollyanna hypothesis |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning &amp; Verbal Behavior |year=1969 |last=Boucher |first=Jerry |last2=Osgood |first2=Charles E. |authorlink2=Charles E.

====Attribution of Intentions====
Studies reported in a paper in the ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General'' by Carey Morewedge (2009) found that people exhibit a '''''negativity bias''''' '''''in attribution of external agency''''', such that they are more likely to attribute negative outcomes to the intentions of another person than similar neutral and positive outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Negativity bias in attribution of external agency|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0016796|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|pages = 535–545|volume = 138|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/a0016796|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|year = 2009|pmid=19883135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory experiments, Morewedge found that participants were more likely to believe that a partner had influenced the outcome of a gamble in when the participants lost money than won money, even when the probability of winning and losing money was held even. This bias is not limited to adults. Children also appear to be more likely to attribute negative events to intentional causes than similarly positive events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Agency Attribution in Infancy: Evidence for a Negativity Bias|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096112|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-05-06|pmc = 4011708|pmid = 24801144|pages = e96112|volume = 9|issue = 5|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0096112|first = J.

===Cognition===
As addressed by negative differentiation,&lt;ref name = "Rozin &amp; Royzman 2001" /&gt; negative information seems to require greater information processing resources and activity than does positive information; people tend to think and reason more about negative events than positive events.&lt;ref name="Taylor, S. E. 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thinking about thinking: Causal, evaluative and finalistic cognitions about social situations |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=1985 |last=Abele |first=Andrea |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=315–332 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420150306 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420150306/abstract |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurological differences also point to greater processing of negative information: participants exhibit greater event-related potentials when reading about, or viewing photographs of, people performing negative acts that were incongruent with their traits than when reading about incongruent positive acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Temporal course of emotional negativity bias: An ERP study |journal=Neuroscience Letters |year=2006 |last=Huanga |first=Yu-Xia |last2=Luoa |first2=Yue-Jia |volume=398 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–96 |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2005.12.074 |pmid=16446031 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394005014618 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electrophysiological evidence of implicit and explicit categorization processes |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |year=2000 |last=Ito |first=Tiffany A. |last2=Cacioppo |first2=John T. |authorlink2=John Cacioppo |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=660–676 |doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1430 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103100914306 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Negative information weighs more heavily on the brain: The negativity bias in evaluative categorizations |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1998 |last=Ito |first=Tiffany A. |last2=Larsen |first2=Jeff T. |last3=Smith |first3=N.

====Attention====
A number of studies have suggested that negativity is essentially an attention magnet. For example, when tasked with forming an impression of presented target individuals, participants spent longer looking at negative photographs than they did looking at positive photographs.&lt;ref name = "Fiske 1980" /&gt; Similarly, participants registered more eye blinks when studying negative words than positive words&lt;ref name = "Ohira et al., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of stimulus valence on recognition memory and endogenous eyeblinks: Further evidence for positive-negative asymmetry |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |year=1998 |last=Ohira |first=Hideki |last2=Winton |first2=Ward M. |last3=Oyama |first3=Makiko |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=986–993 |doi=10.1177/0146167298249006 |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/24/9/986.abstract |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (blinking rate has been positively linked to cognitive activity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eye movements and blinks: Their relationship to higher cognitive processes |journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology |year=1989 |last=Fogarty |first=Christine |last2=Stern |first2=John A. |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=35–42 |doi=10.1016/0167-8760(89)90017-2 |pmid=2584081 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1990-11678-001 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eyeblink activity in a word-naming task as a function of semantic priming and cognitive load |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |year=1996 |last=Ohira |first=Hideki |volume=82 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=835–842 |doi=10.2466/pms.1996.82.3.835 |pmid=8774018 |url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.1996.82.3.835?journalCode=pms |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Importantly, this preferential attendance to negative information is evident even when the affective nature of the stimuli is irrelevant to the task itself.  Drs. Felicia Pratto and Oliver P. John administered a modified [[Stroop effect|Stroop task]] to participants in an effort to investigate the automatic vigilance hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Pratto &amp; John 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Automatic vigilance: The attention-grabbing power of negative social information |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1991 |last=Pratto |first=Felicia |last2=Oliver |first2=John P. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=380–391 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1992-04165-001 |accessdate=2014-11-20 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.3.380|pmid=1941510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants were presented with a series of positive and negative personality traits in several different colors; as each trait appeared on the screen, participants were to name the color as quickly as possible.  Even though the positive and negative elements of the words were immaterial to the color-naming task, participants were slower to name the color of negative traits than they were positive traits.  This difference in response latencies indicates that greater attention was devoted to processing the trait itself when it was negative.

Aside from studies of eye blinks and color naming, Baumeister and colleagues noted in their review of "bad events" versus "good events"&lt;ref name = "Baumeister et al. 2001" /&gt; that there is also easily accessible, real-world evidence for this attentional bias: bad news sells more papers and the bulk of successful novels are full of negative events and turmoil. When taken in conjunction with the laboratory-based experiments, there is strong support for the notion that negative information generally has a stronger pull on attention than does positive information.

====Learning and memory====
Learning and memory are direct consequences of attentional processing: the more attention is directed or devoted toward something, the more likely it is that it will be later learned and remembered.  Research concerning the effects of punishment and reward on learning suggests that punishment for incorrect responses is more effective in enhancing learning than are rewards for correct responses—learning occurs more quickly following bad events than good events.&lt;ref name = "Costantini &amp; Hoving 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The effectiveness of reward and punishment contingencies on response inhibition |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |year=1973 |last=Costantini |first=Arthur F. |last2=Hoving |first2=Kenneth L. |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=484–494 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(73)90009-X |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002209657390009X |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Children's discrimination learning as a function of reward and punishment |journal=Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology |year=1961 |last=Penney |first=Ronald K. |last2=Lupton |first2=A.

Drs. Pratto and John addressed the effects of [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] information on incidental memory as well as attention using their modified Stroop paradigm (see section concerning "Attention").  Not only were participants slower to name the colors of negative traits, they also exhibited better incidental memory for the presented negative traits than they did for the positive traits, regardless of the proportion of negative to positive traits in the stimuli set.&lt;ref name = "Pratto &amp; John 1991" /&gt;

Intentional memory is also impacted by the stimuli's negative or positive quality.  When studying both positive and negative behaviors, participants tend to recall more negative behaviors during a later memory test than they do positive behaviors, even after controlling for serial position effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The independence of evaluative and item information: Impression and recall order effects in behavior-based impression formation |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1979 |last=Dreben |first=Elizabeth K. |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |authorlink2=Susan Fiske |last3=Hastie |first3=Reid |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=1758–1768 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1758 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayrecord&amp;uid=1981-01262-001 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social judgment and social memory: The role of cue diagnosticity in negativity, positivity, and extremity biases |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1987 |last=Skowronski |first=John J. |last2=Carlston |first2=Donal E. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=689–699 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.4.689 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1987-21920-001 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that people exhibit better [[recognition memory]] and source memory for negative information.&lt;ref name = "Ohira et al., 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The role of conscious recollection in recognition of affective material: Evidence for positive-negative asymmetry |journal= The Journal of General Psychology |year=1996 |last=Robinson-Riegler |first=Gregory L. |last2=Winton |first2=Ward M. |volume=123 |issue=2 |pages=93–104 |doi=10.1080/00221309.1996.9921263 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221309.1996.9921263#preview |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked to recall a recent emotional event, people tend to report negative events more often than they report positive events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Socially shared emotional experiences vs. emotional experiences kept secret: Differential characteristics and consequences |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |year=1998 |last=Finkenauer |first=Catrin |last2=Rimé |first2=Bernard |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=295–318 |doi=10.1521/jscp.1998.17.3.295 |url=http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1998.17.3.295 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is thought to be because these negative memories are more salient than are the positive memories.  People also tend to underestimate how frequently they experience positive affect, in that they more often forget the positively emotional experiences than they forget negatively emotional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Memory accuracy in the recall of emotions |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1990 |last=Thomas |first=David L. |last2=Diener |first2=Ed |authorlink2=Ed Diener |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=291–297 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.291 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayrecord&amp;uid=1991-00334-001 |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making===
Studies of the negativity bias have also been related to research within the domain of [[decision-making]], specifically as it relates to [[risk aversion (psychology)|risk aversion]] or [[loss aversion]].  When presented with a situation in which a person stands to either gain something or lose something depending on the outcome, potential costs are more heavily considered than potential gains.&lt;ref name = "Kanouse &amp; Hanson 1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Costantini &amp; Hoving 1973" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=When it rains, it pours: The greater impact of resource loss compared to gain on psychological distress |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |year=1999 |last=Wells |first=Jennifer D. |last2=Hobfoll |first2=Stevan E. |last3=Lavin |first3=Justin |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=1172–1182 |doi=10.1177/01461672992512010 |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/25/9/1172.short |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater consideration of losses (i.e. negative outcomes) is in line with the principle of negative potency as proposed by Rozin and Royzman.&lt;ref name = "Rozin &amp; Royzman 2001" /&gt; This issue of negativity and loss aversion as it relates to decision-making is most notable addressed by Drs. [[Daniel Kahneman|Daniel Kahneman's]] and [[Amos Tversky|Amos Tversky's]] [[prospect theory]].

====Politics====
Research points to a correlation between political affiliation and negativity bias &lt;ref&gt;Hibbing, J. R., Smith, K. B. and Alford, J. R. (2014) “Differences in negativity bias underlie variations in political ideology,” Behavioral and Brain Sciences. Cambridge University Press, 37(3), pp. 297–307. doi: 10.1017/S0140525X13001192.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Tritt, S, Peterson, J, Page-Gould, E, &amp; Inzlicht, M 2016, 'Ideological reactivity: Political conservatism and brain responsivity to emotional and neutral stimuli', Emotion, 16, 8, pp. 1172-1185, PsycARTICLES, EBSCOhost, viewed 9 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;, where conservatives are more sensitive to negative stimuli and therefore tend to lean towards right-leaning ideology which considers threat reduction and social-order to be its main focus.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S. H. (2014) “Negativity bias and basic values,” Behavioral and Brain Sciences. Cambridge University Press, 37(3), pp. 328–329. doi: 10.1017/S0140525X13002720.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Individuals with lower negativity bias tend to lean towards liberal political policies such as pluralism and are accepting of diverse social groups which by proxy could threaten social structure and cause greater risk of unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Caprara, G. V., Schwartz, S., Capanna, C., Vecchione, M. and Barbaranelli, C. (2006), Personality and Politics: Values, Traits, and Political Choice.

==Lifespan development==

===Infancy===
Although most of the research concerning the negativity bias has been conducted with adults (particularly undergraduate students), there have been a small number of infant studies also suggesting negativity biases.

Infants are thought to interpret ambiguous situations on the basis of how others around them react. When an adult (e.g. experimenter, mother) displays reactions of happiness, fear, or neutrality towards target toys, infants tend to approach the toy associated with the negative reaction significantly less than the neutral and positive toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Emotion regulation via maternal touch |journal=Infancy |year=2001 |last=Hertenstein |first=Matthew J. |last2=Campos |first2=Joseph J. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=549–566 |doi=10.1207/S15327078IN0204_09 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/S15327078IN0204_09/abstract |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The infant as onlooker: Learning from emotional reactions observed in a television scenario |journal=[[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] |year=2003 |last=Mumme |first=Donna L. |last2=Fernald |first2=Anne |authorlink2=Anne Fernald |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=221–237 |url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~babylab/pdfs/Mumme%26Fernald.CD.2003.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-11-20 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00532}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Infants' responses to facial and vocal emotional signals in a social referencing paradigm |journal=Child Development |year=1996 |last=Mumme |first=Donna L. |last2=Fernald |first2=Anne |authorlink2=Anne Fernald |last3=Herrera |first3=Carla |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=3219–3237 |doi=10.2307/1131775 |pmid=9071778 |url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~babylab/pdfs/Mumme%20Fernald%20Herrera%201996.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaish et al"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Not all emotions are created equal: The negativity bias in social-emotional development |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=2008 |last=Vaish |first=Amrisha |last2=Grossmann |first2=Tobias |last3=Woodward |first3=Amanda |authorlink3=Amanda Woodward |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=383–403 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.3.383 |pmid=18444702 |pmc=3652533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there was greater evidence of neural activity when the infants were shown pictures of the "negative" toy than when shown the "positive" and "neutral" toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=12-month-old infants allocate increased neural resources to stimuli associated with negative adult emotion |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2007 |last=Carver |first=Leslie J. |last2=Vaccaro |first2=Brenda G. |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=54–69 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.1.54 |pmid=17201508 |pmc=3593093}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although recent work with 3-month-olds suggests a negativity bias in social evaluations, as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=3-month-olds show a negativity bias in their social evaluations |journal=Developmental Science |last=Hamlin |first=J.

Amrisha Vaish, Tobias Grossman, and Amanda Woodward suggests the negativity bias may emerge during the second half of an infant's first year, although the authors also note that research on the negativity bias and affective information has been woefully neglected within the developmental literature.&lt;ref name = "Vaish et al" /&gt;

===Aging and older adults===
Some research indicates that older adults may display, at least in certain situations, a [[Pollyanna principle|positivity bias]] or [[positivity effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sending memorable messages to the old: Age differences in preferences and memory for advertisements |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2003 |last=Fung |first=Helene H. |last2=Carstensen |first2=Laura L. |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=163–178 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.1.163 |pmid=12872892 |url=http://50plus.kro.nl/data/media/db_download/27_d5ecf7.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aging and motivated cognition: The positivity effect in attention and memory |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2005 |last=Mather |first=Mara |authorlink=Mara Mather |last2=Carstensen |first2=Laura L. |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=496–502 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.005 |url=http://www.matherlab.com/s/MatherCarstensen2005.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=16154382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The negativity bias is eliminated in older adults: Age-related reduction in event-related brain potentials associated with evaluative categorization |journal=Psychology and Aging |year=2006 |last=Wood |first=Stacey |last2=Kisley |first2=Michael A. |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=815–820 |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.21.4.815 |pmid=17201501 |url=http://www.uccs.edu/Documents/humanneurophysiologylab/05%20Wood%20and%20Kisley%202006.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proposed by Dr. Laura Carstensen and colleagues, the [[socioemotional selectivity theory]] outlines a shift in goals and emotion regulation tendencies with advancing age, resulting in a preference for positive information over negative information.  Aside from the evidence in favor of a positivity bias, though, there have still been many documented cases of older adults displaying a negativity bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Younger, middle-aged, and older adults' memories for the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election |journal=Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition |year=2012 |last=Holland |first=Alisha C. |last2=Kensinger |first2=Elizabeth A. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=163–170 |doi=10.1016/j.jarmac.2012.06.001 |pmid=23264932 |pmc=3524976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naveh-Benjamin, M., &amp; Ohta, N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5585">As in the [[Danish unit|case of the Danes]] the [[Norway|Norwegians']] earliest standards of measure can be derived from their [[ship burial]]s. The {{convert|60|ft|2|adj=mid|-long [[Kvalsund boat]]}} was built ca. 700 AD and differs from the [[Denmark|Danish]] boats less than it does from the [[Oseberg ship|Oseberg]], [[Gokstad ship|Gokstad]] and [[Tune ship|Tune]] ships which all date from ca. 800 AD. Thwarts are typically spaced about 3 feet apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.se/~m10354/publ/land&amp;sea.htm ...] rast&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1541, an ''alen'' in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] was defined by law to be the [[Sjælland]] ''alen''. Subsequently, the ''alen'' was defined by law as 2 Rhine feet from 1683. From 1824, the basic unit was defined as a ''fot'' being derived from [[astronomy]] as the length of a one-second pendulum times 12/38 at a [[latitude]] of 45°. The [[metric system]] was introduced in 1887.

== Length ==

* ''skrupel'' &amp;ndash; scruple, 1/12 ''linje'' or approx. 0.18&amp;nbsp;mm.
* ''linje'' &amp;ndash; line, 1/12 ''tomme'' or approx. 2.18&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''tomme'' &amp;ndash; thumb (inch), 1/12 ''fot'', approx. 26.1&amp;nbsp;mm. This unit was commonly used for measuring timber until the 1970s. Nowadays, the word refers invariably to the [[English units|English]] [[inch]], 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm.
* ''kvarter'' &amp;ndash; quarter, 1/4 ''alen''.
* ''fot'' &amp;ndash; foot, 1/2 ''alen''. From 1824, 313.74&amp;nbsp;mm.
* ''[[Alen (unit of length)|alen]]'' &amp;ndash; forearm or [[ell]], 627.48&amp;nbsp;mm from 1824, 627.5&amp;nbsp;mm from 1683, 632.6&amp;nbsp;mm from 1541. Before that, local variants.
* ''favn'' &amp;ndash; [[fathom]] (pl. ''favner''), 3 ''alen'', 1.882 [[metre|m]].
* ''stang'' &amp;ndash; rod, 5 ''alen'' or 3.1374 m
* ''lås'' &amp;ndash; 15 ''favner'', 28.2 m
* ''fjerdingsvei'' &amp;ndash; quarter mile, alt. ''fjerding'', 1/4 ''mil'', i.e. 2.82&amp;nbsp;km.
* ''mil'' or ''landmil'' &amp;ndash; [[Scandinavian mile|Norwegian mile]], spelled ''miil'' prior to 1862, 18,000 ''alen'' (36,000 feet, 7.018 miles or 11.295&amp;nbsp;km). Before 1683, a ''mil'' was defined as 17600 ''alen'' or 11.13&amp;nbsp;km. Another old land-mile, 11.824&amp;nbsp;km. The unit survives to this day, but in a [[metric system|metric]] 10&amp;nbsp;km adaptation
* ''rast'' &amp;ndash;lit. "rest", the old name of the ''mil''. A suitable distance between rests when walking. Believed to be approx. 9&amp;nbsp;km before 1541.
* ''Kaffekok'', a similar term to ''rast'' used in the north by the indigenous [[Sami people]].
* ''steinkast'' &amp;ndash; stone's throw, perhaps 25 ''favner'', used to this day as a very approximate measure of a short distance.

=== Nautical ===
* ''favn'' &amp;ndash; fathom (pl. ''favner''), 3 ''alen'', 1.85 m
* ''kabellengde'' &amp;ndash; [[cable length]], 100 ''favner'', 185,2 m, or 1/10 international nautical mile, 185.2 m
* ''kvartmil'' &amp;ndash; quarter mile, 10 ''kabellengder'', 1852 m. Kvartmil was a quarter of a Sjømil.
* ''sjømil'' &amp;ndash; sea mile, now often (but wrongly) the international nautical mile, 1.852&amp;nbsp;km, but  also used for other nautical miles and the ''geografisk mil''. Sjømil was 3950 fathoms.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.tvu.nu/color/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=188&amp;Itemid=20 Skipsside - Sjømil]&lt;sup&gt;in Norwegian&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''geografisk mil'' &amp;ndash; 7421 m or 4.007 nautical miles,&lt;!--not 7,408 m, that is 4 international nautical miles--&gt; defined as 1/15 Equatorial degree or 4 minutes of arc.

== Area ==
* ''mål'' &amp;ndash; 100 ''kvadrat rode'', 984 m². The unit survives to this day, but in a 1000 m² adaptation, synonym for the metric [[decare]] (''dekar'' in Norwegian).
* ''kvadrat rode'' &amp;ndash; square ''stang'', 9.84 m²
* ''tønneland'' &amp;ndash; "barrel of land", 4 ''mål''

== Volume ==
* ''favn'' &amp;ndash; 1 ''alen'' by 1 ''favn'' by 1 ''favn'', 2.232 m³, used for measuring firewood to this day.
* ''skjeppe'' &amp;ndash; 1/8 ''tønne'', i.e. 17.4 [[l]].
* ''[[Tønne (unit)|tønne]]'' &amp;ndash; barrel, 4.5 ''fot''³, 138.9 [[l]].

* ''laup'' &amp;ndash; used for butter, 17.93&amp;nbsp;kg (approx. 16.2 l). 1 ''laup'' is 36 ''pund'' or 4 ''spann'' or 72 ''merker''.
* ''spann'' &amp;ndash; Same as ''laup'', for other commodities such as grain
* ''bismerpund'' &amp;ndash; 12 ''pund'', 5.981&amp;nbsp;kg
* ''vette'' &amp;ndash; 28.8 ''mark'' or 6.2985&amp;nbsp;kg.
* ''[[våg]]'' &amp;ndash; 1/8 ''skippund'', 17.9424&amp;nbsp;kg.

[[Image:Nova planta Catalunya 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cover of the Nueva Planta decrees of Catalonia]]

The '''Nueva Planta decrees''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Decretos de Nueva Planta}}, {{lang-ca|Decrets de Nova Planta}}) were a number of [[decree]]s signed between 1707 and 1716 by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]—the first [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[King of Spain]]—during and shortly after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]].

Angered by what he saw as [[sedition]] by the Aragonese and taking his native [[Kingdom of France|France]] as a model of a centralised state, King Felipe V suppressed the institutions, privileges, and the ancient [[fuero|charters]] (Spanish: ''fueros'', Catalan: ''furs'') of almost all the areas that were formerly part of the [[Crown of Aragon]] ([[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and the [[Kingdom of Majorca|Balearic Islands]]). The decrees ruled that all the territories in the Crown of Aragon except the [[Aran Valley]] were to be ruled by the laws of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] ("the most praiseworthy in all the Universe" according to the 1707 decree), embedding these regions in a new, and nearly uniformly administered, centralised Spain.

The other historic territories&amp;mdash;[[Navarre]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|other Basque territories]]&amp;mdash;supported Felipe V initially, whom they saw as belonging to the lineage of [[Henry III of Navarre]], but after Felipe V's military [[History of the Basques#A Basque trade area|campaign to crush the Basque uprising]], he backed down on his intent to suppress [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|home rule]].

The acts abolishing the charters were promulgated in 1707 in Valencia and Aragon,&lt;ref name="payne_bourbon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne16.htm|work=A History of Spain and Portugal - Vol. 2|title=Chapter 16, The Eighteenth-Century Bourbon Regime in Spain|author=Stanley G. Payne|accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1715 in [[Majorca]] and the other Balearic Islands (with the exception of [[Menorca]], a possession of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] at the time), and finally in Catalonia on 16 January 1716.&lt;ref name="payne_bourbon" /&gt;

The decrees effectively created a Spanish citizenship or nationality, that judicially did not distinguish between Castilian and Aragonese anymore, both with respect to rights and law. They abolished internal borders and customs except for the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque territory]], giving grant to all Spaniards to trade with American colonies (not only Castilians, as before).

[[Felipe V of Spain|Felipe of Bourbon]] won the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and imposed unification policies over the [[Crown of Aragon]], which had supported the claim of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Karl of Austria]]. These acts constituted the first successful realisation of Spain as a centralised state and were meant both as a modernising element, in line with other European countries where their monarchs were increasing their powers, and also as a punishment on these territories which had fought against Felipe V in the War of Succession. Henceforth, top civil servants were appointed directly from [[Madrid]], the King's court city, and  most institutions in these territories were abolished. Court cases could only be presented and argued in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], which became the sole language of government, displacing [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and other [[Spanish languages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19192">The '''peak–end rule''' is a [[psychological heuristic]] in which people judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense point) and at its end, rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience. The effect occurs regardless of whether the experience is pleasant or unpleasant. According to the heuristic, other information aside from that of the peak and end of the experience is not lost, but it is not used. This includes net pleasantness or unpleasantness and how long the experience lasted. The peak–end rule is thereby a specific form of the more general [[extension neglect]] and [[duration neglect]].

==Overview==
The peak–end rule is an elaboration on the snapshot model of remembered utility proposed by [[Barbara Fredrickson]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]]. This model dictates that an event is not judged by the entirety of an experience, but by prototypical moments (or ''snapshots'')  as a result of the [[representativeness heuristic]].&lt;ref name="duration_neglect" /&gt; The remembered value of snapshots dominates the actual value of an experience. Fredrickson and Kahneman theorized that these snapshots are actually the average of the most affectively intense moment of an experience and the feeling experienced at the end.&lt;ref name="by_moments" /&gt; The effects of the duration of an experience upon retrospective evaluation are extremely slight. Fredrickson and Kahneman labeled this phenomenon ''duration neglect''.&lt;ref name="duration_neglect" /&gt; The peak–end rule is applicable only when an experience has definite beginning and end periods.

==Research and examples==

A 1993 study titled "When More Pain Is Preferred to Less: Adding a Better End" by Kahneman, Fredrickson, Charles Schreiber, and Donald Redelmeier provided groundbreaking evidence for the peak–end rule. Participants were subjected to two different versions of a single unpleasant experience. The first trial had subjects submerge a hand in 14&amp;nbsp;°C water for 60 seconds. The second trial had subjects submerge the other hand in 14&amp;nbsp;°C water for 60 seconds, but then keep their hand submerged for an additional 30 seconds, during which the temperature was raised to 15&amp;nbsp;°C. Subjects were then offered the option of which trial to repeat. Against the law of [[temporal monotonicity]], subjects were more willing to repeat the second trial, despite a prolonged exposure to uncomfortable temperatures. Kahneman et al. concluded that "subjects chose the long trial simply because they liked the memory of it better than the alternative (or disliked it less)."&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt;

Similarly, a 1996 study by Kahneman and Redelmeier assessed patients' appraisals of uncomfortable [[colonoscopy]] or [[lithotripsy]] procedures and correlated the remembered experience with real-time findings. They found that patients consistently evaluated the discomfort of the experience based on the intensity of pain at the worst (peak) and final (end) moments. This occurred regardless of length or variation in intensity of pain within the procedure.&lt;ref name=pain /&gt;

Another study by Kahneman and [[Ziv Carmon]] identified a boundary condition for the peak–end rule. Participants interacted with a computer program that had them wait to be served, while assessing their satisfaction as they were waiting. Kahneman and Carmon found that how participants felt at the final moment of the experience was a good predictor of their responses when they were asked to retrospectively evaluate their experiences. For example, participants who felt very dissatisfied during much of the experience but were satisfied in the final few seconds (because the waiting line moved faster than expected toward the end) summarized the experience as satisfying. Kahneman and Carmon concluded that real time experiences that are based on expectations are discounted after the fact if those expectations are unfulfilled.&lt;ref name="simulated_queues" /&gt;

A third study by Kahneman, Redelmeier, and Joel Katz corroborated and expanded upon the discoveries made in the 1996 study. Colonoscopy patients were randomly divided into two groups. One underwent a colonoscopy procedure wherein the scope was left in for three extra minutes, but not moved, creating a sensation that was uncomfortable, but not painful. The other group underwent a typical colonoscopy procedure. Kahneman et al. found that, when asked to retrospectively evaluate their experiences, patients who underwent the longer procedure rated their experience as less unpleasant than patients who underwent the typical procedure. Moreover, the patients in the prolonged discomfort group were far more likely to return for subsequent procedures because a less painful end led them to evaluate the procedure more positively than those who faced a shorter procedure.&lt;ref name="memories_of_colonoscopy" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Memory bias for more emotional events (i.e., why the peak is memorable) ===
People exhibit better memory for more intensely emotional events than less intensely emotional events. The precise cause of this is unclear, but it has been demonstrated, for decades, across a wide variety of surveys and experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Retention of affective material: Effects of intensity of affect on retrieval.|url = |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 64–80|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/h0032790|first = Satrajit|last = Dutta|first2 = Rabindra N.|last2 = Kanungo|first3 = Vaira|last3 = Freibergs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ochsner2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ochsner|first1=Kevin N.|title=Are affective events richly recollected or simply familiar?

This failure to correct for the atypicality of extreme memories can lead people to believe those extreme moments are representative of the "set" being judged. [[Boston Red Sox]] fans asked to recall any one game they saw when the Red Sox won, for example, tended to recall the best game they could remember. They only realized this game was unrepresentative of past winning games by the Red Sox if they were explicitly asked to recall the best game they could remember, as evidenced by their subsequent [[Affective forecasting|''affective forecasts'']].&lt;ref name="Morewedge2005" /&gt; This bias for more intense emotional experiences is evident in ''[[Nostalgia|nostalgic preferences]]''. People asked to recall a television show or movie from the past tend to recall the most enjoyable show or movie that they can remember, and use this extreme example to rate all shows from its era unless they are also able to spontaneously recall shows or movies that are worse than the first show or movie they remember.&lt;ref name=Morewedge2013&gt;{{Cite journal|title = It Was a Most Unusual Time: How Memory Bias Engenders Nostalgic Preferences|url = |journal = Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date = 2013|pages = 319–326|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/bdm.1767|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recency bias in memory (i.e., why the end is memorable) ===
People exhibit serial position effects such that they have better memory for ''both'' the beginning and end of sequences, phenomena known as [[Primacy effect|primacy bias]] and [[recency bias]], respectively. A paper by Garbinsky, Morewedge, and Shiv (2014) found evidence that for extended hedonic experiences, better memory for the end of the experience than the beginning (recency &gt; primacy) can be attributed to memory [[Interference theory|interference effects]].&lt;ref name=Garbinsky2014&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Interference of the End Why Recency Bias in Memory Determines When a Food Is Consumed Again|url = |journal = Psychological Science|date = 2014|pmid = 24894582|pages = 1466–1474|volume = 25|issue = 7|doi = 10.1177/0956797614534268|first = Emily N.|last = Garbinsky|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Baba|last3 = Shiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a person eats potato chips, for example, the formation of a new memory of the most recently eaten chip makes it harder for them to recall how the previously eaten chips tasted. Garbinsky and colleagues found that (1) recency effects better predicted recalled enjoyment of a small meal (e.g., eating 5 or 15 chips) than did primacy effects, (2) that people had a worse memory for the first bite of the meal than the last bite of the meal, but (3) providing people with their ratings of the first bite lead them to use their enjoyment of that first bite as much as their enjoyment of the last bite when rating their overall enjoyment of the meal.

==Applications==

===Business===
Since most consumer interactions have set beginnings and ends, they fit the peak–end model. As a consequence, negative occurrences in any consumer interaction can be counteracted by establishing a firmly positive peak and end. This can be accomplished through playing music customers enjoy, giving out free samples, or paying a clerk to hold the door for patrons as they leave. As Scott Stratten has suggested, "A really great salesperson who helps with an exchange can erase negative experiences along the way. The long wait in line and the bad music in the changing room are forgotten".&lt;ref name="StrattenKramer2012" /&gt; However, as research by Talya Miron-Shatz suggests, retrospective evaluations of day-long experiences do not appear to follow the peak–end rule, which brings into question the applicability of this rule to approximately day-length consumer–business interactions, such as hotel stays.&lt;ref name="boundary_conditions" /&gt;

===Vacations===
In 2006, a study was carried out at the [[University of Canterbury]] in Christchurch, New Zealand, analyzing the implications of the peak–end rule on the perceived happiness experienced on vacations. The study found that participants' remembered overall happiness was approximately predicted by the peak–end rule, although it was actually better predicted by their happiness during the "most memorable or most unusual 24-h period".&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006 /&gt; Still, the duration of a vacation appeared to have negligible effects on remembered happiness.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; The results of the study could be applied to choosing more economical durations for vacations.

===Medical procedures===
The peak–end rule is particularly salient in regard to medical procedures, since it suggests that it is preferable to have longer procedures that include a period of decreased discomfort than to have shorter procedures.&lt;ref name="boundary_conditions" /&gt; In particular, the rule "suggests that the memory of a painful medical treatment is likely to be less aversive if relief from the pain is gradual than if relief is abrupt".&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt; Furthermore, the quality of a remembered procedure can drastically influence medical futures. If people recall necessary but onerous procedures more positively, then they are more likely to return for repeat procedures later in life.
However, factoring the effect of the peak–end rule upon evaluations of medical procedures is problematic, since adding a period of decreasing pain to a procedure is still added pain.  Even though this certainly yields a better memory of the process, the patient still endures more pain than is strictly necessary.&lt;ref name="memories_of_colonoscopy" /&gt; Doctors and patients are forced to confront the choice between objectively less painful forms of treatment and forms of treatment that will be remembered more favorably. Kahneman claims that "it is safe to assume that few patients will agree to expose themselves to pain for the sole purpose of improving a future memory".&lt;ref name=more_pain /&gt;

==Criticism==
Critiques of the peak–end rule typically derive from its conflation of a complex mental evaluation into a simplistic framework. A 2008 study found some support for the peak–end rule, but also found that it was "not an outstandingly good predictor" of remembered experiential value, and that the happiness of the most memorable part of an experience predicted remembered happiness better than did the happiness of the peak or of the end.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; Additionally, the extreme effect of peaks fades more rapidly over time, causing peaks to be recalled less positively and troughs recalled less negatively over time. [[Episodic memory]] endures for only a few weeks; at some point, mental accounting shifts over to [[semantic memory]], leading to potential over-valuation of the "end" and diminished weighting of the peak.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Additionally, memories that are available for evaluation may change due to the fading affect associated with memory or differing goals in recall.&lt;ref name=KempBurtFurneaux2006/&gt; Goal orientation or initial expectations can also affect the weighting of a peak or an end, causing an end to be over-weighted as the culmination of a goal.&lt;ref name="by_moments" /&gt; Finally, Ariely and Carmon have theorized that evaluations of past events are affected by feelings at the time of evaluation.&lt;ref name=ArielyCarmon2000/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10958">In [[complex analysis]], the '''Phragmén–Lindelöf principle''' (or '''method'''), first formulated by [[Lars Edvard Phragmén]] (1863–1937) and [[Ernst Leonard Lindelöf]] (1870-1946) in 1908, is a technique which employs an auxiliary, parameterized function to prove the boundedness of a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (i.e, &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;M\ \ (z\in \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;) on an unbounded domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; when an additional (usually mild) condition constraining the growth of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is given.  It is a generalization of the [[maximum modulus principle]], which is only applicable to bounded domains.

==Background==

In the theory of complex functions, it is known that the [[Absolute value|modulus]] (absolute value) of a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] (complex differentiable) function in the interior of a ''[[Bounded set|'''bounded''']]'' region is bounded by its modulus on the boundary of the region.  More precisely, if a non-constant function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is holomorphic in a bounded region&lt;ref&gt;The term ''region'' is not uniformly employed in the literature; here, a ''region'' is taken to mean a nonempty connected open subset of the complex plane.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and [[continuous function|continuous]] on its closure &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}=\Omega\cup\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|f(z_0)|&lt;\sup_{z\in \partial \Omega} |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z_0\in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. This is known as the ''maximum modulus principle.'' (In fact, since &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; is compact and &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, there actually exists some &lt;math&gt;w_0\in\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|f(w_0)|=\sup_{z\in \partial \Omega} |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt;.)  The maximum modulus principle is generally used to conclude that a holomorphic function is bounded in a region after showing that it is bounded on its boundary.

However, the maximum modulus principle cannot be applied to an unbounded region of the complex plane.  As a concrete example, let us examine the behavior of the holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \exp(\exp(z))&lt;/math&gt; in the unbounded strip

:&lt;math&gt;S = \Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big)\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Although &lt;math&gt;|f(x\pm \pi i/2)|=1&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is bounded on boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; grows rapidly without bound when &lt;math&gt;|z|\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; along the positive real axis.  The difficulty here stems from the extremely fast growth of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; along the positive real axis.  If the growth rate of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is guaranteed to not be "too fast," as specified by an appropriate growth condition, the ''Phragmén–Lindelöf principle'' can be applied to show that boundedness of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on the region's boundary implies that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in fact bounded in the whole region, effectively extending the maximum modulus principle to unbounded regions.

''The technique:'' Suppose we are given a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and an unbounded region &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  In a typical Phragmén–Lindelöf argument, we introduce a certain multiplicative factor &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} h_\epsilon= 1&lt;/math&gt; to "subdue" the growth of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|&lt;M&lt;/math&gt; on the boundary of a bounded subregion &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}\subset S&lt;/math&gt;. This allows us to apply the maximum modulus principle to &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and conclude that it is bounded on &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  We then argue that the subregion could be expanded so as to encompass all points in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, establishing the boundedness of &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, we let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon\to f&lt;/math&gt; in order to conclude that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must also be bounded on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

In the literature of complex analysis, there are many examples of the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle applied to unbounded regions of differing types, and also a version of this principle may be applied in a similar fashion to [[subharmonic function|subharmonic]] and superharmonic functions.

== Example of application ==
To continue the example above, we can impose a growth condition on a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that prevents it from "blowing up" and allows the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle to be applied.   To this end, we now include the condition that 

:&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;\exp\big(A\exp(c\cdot|\Re(z)|)\big)&lt;/math&gt;

for some real constants &lt;math&gt;c&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  It can then be shown that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; in fact holds for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, we have the following proposition:

'''Proposition.''' ''Let'' 

:'''''&lt;math&gt;S=\Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big)\Big\},\quad \overline{S}=\Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big]\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;'''''.

''Let'' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''be holomorphic on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;'' ''and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose there exist real constants  &lt;math&gt;c&lt;1,\ A&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;'' ''such that''
:'''''&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;\exp\big(A\exp(c\cdot|\Re(z)|)\big)&lt;/math&gt;'''''

''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;'' ''and &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\overline{S}\setminus S=\partial S&lt;/math&gt;.  Then'' ''&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;'' ''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;''.

Note that this conclusion fails when &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt;, precisely as the motivating counterexample in the previous section demonstrates.  The proof of this statement employs a typical Phragmén–Lindelöf argument:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/RudinW.RealAndComplexAnalysis3e1987|title=Real and Complex Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1987|isbn=0070542341|location=New York|pages=257–259|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sketch of Proof:'' We fix &lt;math&gt;b\in(c,1)&lt;/math&gt;, define for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the auxiliary function &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h_\epsilon(z)=e^{-\epsilon(e^{b z}+e^{-b z})}&lt;/math&gt;, and consider the function &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  The growth properties of &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; allow us to find an &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq1&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;z\in\overline{S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\Re(z)|\geq x_0&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the open rectangle in the complex plane defined by the vertices &lt;math&gt;\{x_0\pm i\pi/2,-x_0\pm i\pi/2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Because &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;is a bounded region, the maximum modulus principle implies that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  But since &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrarily large, this result extends to all of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, since &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon\to 1&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude that &lt;math&gt;|f|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

== Phragmén–Lindelöf principle for a sector in the complex plane ==
A particularly useful statement proved using the Phragmén–Lindelöf  principle bounds holomorphic functions on a sector of the complex plane if it is bounded on its boundary.  This statement can be used to give a complex analytic proof of the [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy's]] [[Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]], which states that a function and its Fourier transform cannot both decay faster than exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/hardys-uncertainty-principle/#more-1716|title=Hardy's Uncertainty Principle|last=Tao|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Tao|date=2009-02-18|website=Updates on my research and expository papers, discussion of open problems, and other maths-related topics. By Terence Tao|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Proposition.'''  ''Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a function that is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in a [[Circular sector|sector]]''

:''&lt;math&gt; S = \left\{ z \, \big| \, \alpha &lt; \arg z &lt; \beta \right\} &lt;/math&gt;''

''of central angle &lt;math&gt;\beta-\alpha=\pi/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and continuous on its boundary. If''

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|F(z)| \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

''for &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S&lt;/math&gt;, and''

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|F(z)| \leq e^{C |z|^\rho}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
 
''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho\in[0,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then ({{EquationNote|1}}) holds also for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.''

===Remarks===
* The condition ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be relaxed to

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{r \to \infty} \sup_{\alpha &lt; \theta &lt; \beta} \frac{\log|F(re^{i\theta})|}{r^\rho} = 0 \quad \text{for some} \quad 0 \leq \rho &lt; \lambda~,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

with the same conclusion.

== Special cases ==
In practice the point 0 is often transformed into the point ∞ of the [[Riemann sphere]]. This gives a version of the principle that applies to strips, for example bounded by two lines of constant [[real part]] in the complex plane. This special case is sometimes known as [[Lindelöf's theorem]].

[[Carlson's theorem]] is an application of the principle to functions bounded on the imaginary axis.

[[File:Man pilos Louvre MNE1330.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Red figure pottery|red-figure]] plate from [[Apulia]], third quarter of the 4th century BC, [[Louvre]] ]]

The '''pileus''' ({{Lang-gr|πῖλος}} – ''pilos'', also '''pilleus''' or '''pilleum''' in [[Latin]]) was a brimless, [[felt]] cap worn in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460407/pileus Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounding regions, later also introduced in [[Ancient Rome]]. The Greek {{lang|grc|πιλίδιον}} (''pilidion'') and Latin ''pilleolus'' were smaller versions, similar to a skullcap.

==History==
[[File:Peasant basket Louvre Myr330.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ancient Greek]] terracotta statuette of a peasant wearing a pilos, 1st century BC]]

===Greece===
The '''''pilos''''' (Greek: πῖλος, ''felt''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpi%3Dlos2 πῖλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) was a common conical travelling hat in [[Illyria]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. The pilos is the brimless version of the ''[[petasos]]''. It could be made of felt or leather. Pilos caps often identify the mythical twins, or [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux]], as represented in sculptures, bas-reliefs and on ancient ceramics. Their caps were supposedly the remnants of the egg from which they hatched.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron'', noted by [[Karl Kerenyi]]'s ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959:107 note 584.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilos appears on [[Votive object|votive figurines]] of boys at the sanctuary of the [[Cabeiri]] at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], the ''Cabeirion''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]]. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:281.&lt;/ref&gt;

In warfare, the pilos type helmet was often worn by the [[peltast]] light infantry, in conjunction with the [[exomis]], but it was also worn by the heavy infantry.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

The '''pilos helmet''' was made of bronze in the same shape as the pilos which was presumably sometimes worn under the helmet for comfort, giving rise to the helmet's conical shape.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Sekunda,''The Spartan Army'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt; The first widespread adoption of the pilos helmet occurred in Sparta towards the end of the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Obert, ''A Brief History of Greek Helmets'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
[[File:Eid Mar.jpg|thumb|left|Pileus between two daggers, on the [[obverse|reverse]] of a [[denarius]] issued by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] to commemorate the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] on the [[Ides of March]]]]
In Ancient Rome, a slave was freed in a ceremony in which a [[praetor]] touched the slave with a rod called a ''vindicta'' and pronounced him to be free. The slave's head was shaved and a pileus was placed upon it. Both the ''vindicta'' and the cap were considered symbols of [[Libertas]], the goddess representing liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=T.R.R.|authorlink=Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb|page=285, 285n2|title=An inquiry into the law of Negro slavery in the United States of America|place=Philadelphia|year=1858|publisher=T. &amp; J.W. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a form of extra-legal manumission (the ''manumissio minus justa'') considered less legally sound than manumission in a court of law.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

One 19th century dictionary of classical antiquity states that, "Among the Romans the cap of felt was the emblem of liberty. When a slave obtained his freedom he had his head shaved, and wore instead of his hair an undyed pileus."&lt;ref&gt;πίλεον λευκόν, [[Diodorus Siculus]] Exc. Leg. 22 p. 625, ed. Wess.; [[Plautus|Plaut.]] Amphit. I.1.306; [[Persius]], V.82&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the phrase ''servos ad pileum vocare'' is a summons to liberty, by which slaves were frequently called upon to take up arms with a promise of liberty ([[Livy|Liv.]] XXIV.32). The figure of Liberty on some of the coins of [[Antoninus Pius]], struck A.D. 145, holds this cap in the right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, James. Entry "Pileus" in William Smith's ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' ([[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], London, 1875).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Jewish priests wore a ''pilos'' (conical cap), mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|28:40|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Costume |volume=7 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11589">In [[psychology]] and [[logic]], '''rationalization''' or '''rationalisation''' (also known as '''making excuses'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/02/17/rationalization-as-manipulation-tactic/ Understanding Rationalization: Making Excuses as an Effective Manipulation Tactic]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[defense mechanism]] in which controversial behaviors or feelings are justified and explained in a seemingly rational or logical manner to avoid the true explanation, and are made consciously tolerable—or even admirable and superior—by plausible means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of rationalization|url=http://depression.about.com/od/glossary/g/rationalization.htm|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[informal fallacy]] of [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IEP|first=Bradley |last=Dowden|url-id=fallacy#Rationalization|title=Fallacy § Rationalization|archive-url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20141031180537/http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#Rationalization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rationalization happens in two steps:
# A decision, action, judgement is made for a given reason, or no (known) reason at all.
# A rationalization is performed, constructing a seemingly good or logical reason, as an attempt to justify the act after the fact (for oneself or others).

Rationalization encourages irrational or unacceptable behavior, motives, or feelings and often involves [[ad hoc hypothesizing]]. This process ranges from fully [[conscious]] (e.g. to present an external defense against ridicule from others) to mostly [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] (e.g. to create a block against internal feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[shame]]). People rationalize for various reasons—sometimes when we think we know ourselves [[Introspection illusion|better than we do]]. Rationalization may differentiate the original deterministic explanation of the behavior or feeling in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/ss/defensemech_6.htm |title=Defense Mechanisms – Rationalization |accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=Kendra Van Wagner |publisher=[[About.com]]: Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/counseling/defenses.html |title=Defenses |publisher=www.psychpage.com |accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Quintilian]] and classical [[rhetoric]] used the term ''color'' for the presenting of an action in the most favourable possible perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green trans., ''Juvenal: The Sixteen Satires'' "Middlesex 1982) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Sterne]] in the eighteenth century took up the point, arguing that, were a man to consider his actions, "he will soon find, that such of them, as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit, are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties [color] which, a soft and flattering hand can give them".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Sterne, ''Tristram Shandy'' (Middlesex 1976) p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM definition==
According to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]], rationalization occurs "when the individual deals with emotional conflict or internal or external stressors by concealing the true motivations for his or her own thoughts, actions, or feelings through the elaboration of reassuring or self serving but incorrect explanations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Association|first1=published by the American Psychiatric|title=DSM-IV-TR : diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.|date=2000|publisher=AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC)|location=United States|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6|page=812|edition=4TH ED.|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Individual===
* Rationalization can be used to avoid admitting disappointment: ''"I didn't get the job that I applied for,  [[The Fox and the Grapes|but I really didn't want it in the first place]]."''

Egregious rationalizations intended to deflect blame can also take the form of [[ad hominem]] attacks or [[Denial#DARVO|DARVO]].
Some rationalizations take the form of a comparison. Commonly this is done to lessen the perception of an action's negative effects, to justify an action, or to excuse culpability: 
* ''"At least [what occurred] [[Counterfactual thinking|is not as bad as]] [a worse outcome]."''
* In response to an accusation: ''"At least I didn't [worse action than accused action]."''
* As a form of [[false choice]]: ''"Doing [undesirable action] is a lot better than [a worse action]."''
* In response to unfair or abusive behaviour: ''"I must have done something wrong if they treat me like this."''
Based on anecdotal and survey evidence, John Banja states that the medical field features a disproportionate amount of rationalization invoked in the "[[cover up|covering up]]" of [[Medical errors|mistakes]].&lt;ref name="banja1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Banja |first=John |title=Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism |year=2004 |location=Sudbury |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |isbn=0-7637-8361-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common excuses made are:

*"Why disclose the error? The patient was going to die anyway."
*"Telling the family about the error will only make them feel worse."
*"It was the patient's fault. If he wasn't so (sick etc), this error wouldn't have caused so much harm."
*"Well, we did our best. These things happen."
*"If we're not totally and absolutely certain the error caused the harm, we don't have to tell."
*"They're dead anyway, no point in blaming."

===Collective===

*Collective rationalizations are regularly [[Social constructivism|constructed]] for acts of [[aggression]],{{sfn|Smith|Mackie|2007|p=513}} based on exaltation of the in-group and demonization of the opposite side: as [[Fritz Perls]] put it, "Our own soldiers take care of the poor families; the enemy rapes them".&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Perls, ''Gestalt Theory Verbatim'' (Bantam 1971) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Celebrity culture]] can be seen as rationalizing the gap between rich and poor, powerful and powerless, by offering participation to both dominant and [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] views of reality.&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Marshall, ''Celebrity and Power'' (1997) pp. 48–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some scientists criticize the notion that brains are wired to rationalize irrational decisions, arguing that evolution would select against spending more nutrients at mental processes that do not contribute to the improvement of decisions such as rationalization of decisions that would have been taken anyway. These scientists argue that learning from mistakes would be decreased rather than increased by rationalization, and criticize the hypothesis that rationalization evolved as a means of social manipulation by noting that if rational arguments were deceptive there would be no evolutionary chance for breeding individuals that responded to the arguments and therefore making them ineffective and not capable of being selected for by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Pfeifer and Josh Bongard ''How the Body Shapes the Way We Think. A New View of Intelligence'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalysis==
{{Main|Psychoanalysis}}
[[Ernest Jones]] introduced the term "rationalization" to psychoanalysis in 1908, defining it as "the inventing of a reason for an attitude or action the motive of which is not recognized"'&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;—an explanation which (though false) could seem plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Maddox, ''Freud's Wizard'' (London 2006) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The term (''Rationalisierung'' in [[German language|German]]) was taken up almost immediately by [[Sigmund Freud]] to account for the explanations offered by patients for their own neurotic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Psychoanalytische Bemerkungen über einen autobiographisch beschriebenen Fall von Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)", 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

As psychoanalysts continued to explore the glossed of unconscious motives, [[Otto Fenichel]] distinguished different sorts of rationalization—both the justifying of irrational instinctive actions on the grounds that they were reasonable or normatively validated, and the rationalizing of defensive structures, whose purpose is unknown on the grounds that they have some quite different but somehow logical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 485–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Later psychoanalysts are divided between a positive view of rationalization as a stepping-stone on the way to maturity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bateman|first1=Anthony|last2=Holmes|first2=Jeremy|title=Introduction to Psychoanalysis: Contemporary Theory and Practice|date=1995|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415107396|pages=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mo2r2_aBeDIC&amp;pg=PA92|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a more destructive view of it as [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] feeling from thought, and so undermining the powers of reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Symington|first1=Neville|title=Narcissism: A New Theory|date=1993|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9781781811252|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZPHA4grXMMC&amp;pg=PA119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive dissonance==
{{Main|Cognitive dissonance}}
[[Leon Festinger]] highlighted in 1957 the discomfort caused people by awareness of inconsistent thought.{{sfn|Smith|Mackie|2007|pp=277–8}} Rationalization can reduce such discomfort by explaining away the discrepancy in question, as when people who take up smoking after previously quitting decide that the evidence for it being harmful is less than they previously thought.{{sfn|Smith|Mackie|2007|pp=280–4}}

'''Reverse speech''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific topic]]&lt;ref name="demon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="darkecho"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.darkecho.com/skepticalbeliever/reverse.html | accessdate=6 February 2009 | last=Shirley | first=John | title=Reverse Speech | work=The Skeptical Believer | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129080431/http://darkecho.com/skepticalbeliever/reverse.html | archivedate=29 January 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; first advocated by David John Oates which gained publicity when it was mentioned on [[Art Bell]]'s nightly [[Coast to Coast AM]] radio talk show.&lt;ref&gt;May 23rd 1997 Coast to Coast AM broadcast with [[Sean David Morton]] and "Victor".&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that during [[spoken language]] [[Language production|production]], human speakers [[subconscious]]ly produce [[hidden message]]s that give insights into their innermost thoughts. Oates claims that it has applications in [[psychotherapy]], [[criminology]] and business [[negotiation]].  Its claims have been rejected, however, by mainstream science and [[academia]].

==Claims==
{{Listen|filename=Neil Armstrong, small step for man (reversed).ogg|title="small step for [a] man", followed by the same phrase reversed|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Oates' claim is that, on average, once in every 15–20 seconds of casual [[conversation]] a person produces two related sentences—a "forward-spoken" message that is heard consciously, and a "backwards" message unconsciously embedded in the person's speech. These two modes of speech, forward and backward, are supposedly dependent upon each other and form an integral part of human communication. In the dynamics of interpersonal communication both modes of speech combine to communicate the total psyche of the person, conscious as well as unconscious. Oates claims that backward speech is always honest and reveals the truth about the speaker's intentions and motivations.&lt;ref name="oates"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.reversespeech.com/article0903.htm | last=Oates | first=David | accessdate=6 February 2009 | title=Reverse Speech – Voices From The Unconscious | publisher=reversespeech.com | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224145854/http://www.reversespeech.com/article0903.htm | archivedate=24 February 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous recording that allegedly demonstrates this is the speech given by [[Neil Armstrong]] at the time of the first manned [[lunar landing]] on 20 July 1969. If played backwards, the words "small step for man" sound somewhat like "Man will space walk."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reversespeech.com/Simple_Examples.htm Reverse Speech Technologies · Examples]&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for this phenomenon is [[pareidolia]], the tendency of the human brain to perceive meaningful patterns in random noise. Pareidolia is even more likely to occur when a person consciously tries to detect a pattern, as is the case for someone listening for intelligible phrases in backwards speech. The power of [[suggestion]] is then used to nudge the listener to hear what the presenter wants him to hear. David John Oates, for example, almost always tells the listener in advance what he should expect to hear, thereby planting a suggestion that would make the listener more likely to actually "hear" that phrase. A study has shown that when listening to the same clips without being told in advance what to expect, the results have a higher variation.&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;

==Rejection by the scientific community==
Most academics in the field of [[linguistics]] have not paid attention to Oates' work,&lt;ref name="advertiser"&gt;{{Cite web| work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] | url=http://www.reversespeech.com/imgs/advertiser2.jpg | title=Play that back | last=Duffy | first=Michael | accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been called a pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="demon"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/demon-haunted_sentence_a_skeptical_analysis_of_reverse_speech1/ | title=The Demon-Haunted Sentence: A Skeptical Analysis of Reverse Speech | first=Tom | last=Byrne |author2=Matthew Normand  | accessdate=2010-09-27 | year=2000 | work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;  For the most part, universities and research institutes have refused to test Oates' theories because of a lack of theoretical basis to make his predictions even worth testing, and the fact that many of his claims are untestable,&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="darkecho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;{{Cite web| work=[[Skeptic's Dictionary]] | url=http://skepdic.com/reversespeech.html | title=reverse speech | accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one of the few scientific experiments to evaluate Oates' claims did not support his findings.&lt;ref name="advertiser"/&gt;  Others have criticized "reverse speech" as lacking a rigorous [[methodology]] and not being informed by an understanding of issues in linguistics,&lt;ref name="newbrook"&gt;Newbrook, Mark, and Jane Curtain (1997). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980207000019/http://www.skeptics.com.au/journal/revspeech1.htm |date=7 February 1998 |title="Oates' Theory of Reverse Speech." }} ''[[Australian Skeptics]]'' '''17'''(3).  Retrieved on 22 March 2009. Archived from [http://www.skeptics.com.au/journal/revspeech1.htm the original] on 7 February 1998. [http://www.skeptics.com.au/journal/1997/3.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized Oates as "more interested in making a profit than educating others," pointing out the large amount of merchandise and services his website sells.&lt;ref name="demon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt;  Reverse speech has been compared to the controversial field (labelled a pseudoscience by some) of [[neuro-linguistic programming]].&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt;  Because of the "dogmatic" tone of Oates' material, reverse speech has been compared to "fringe literature."&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;

Oates' own claims about the applications of reverse speech have also been challenged.  One report has questioned whether reverse speech was ever really used in police work, as Oates claimed.&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt;  Likewise, his claim that reverse speech has applications in [[psychology]] and psychotherapy is not supported by mainstream research in those fields.&lt;ref name="newbrook"/&gt; Oates' work has been described as "dangerous" because of its potential for misuse and the likelihood of leading to [[false accusations]] of people in criminal courts, similarly to the controversial practice of [[facilitated communication]].&lt;ref name="demon"/&gt;

The CIA recently declassified documents&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00792r000500380002-0&lt;/ref&gt; on reverse speech.

RosettaNet is a consortium of major Computer and Consumer Electronics, Electronic Components, Semiconductor Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Logistics companies working to create and implement industry-wide, open e-business process standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Adams, Susie |author2=Hardas, Dilip |author3=Iossein, Aktar |author4=Kaiman, Charles  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2002|title=BizTalk Unleashed|publisher=Sams Publishing|location=Indianapolis,  Indiana|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZRxqBqA2soC&amp;pg=PA966 966]|isbn=978-0-672-32176-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards form a common e-business language, aligning processes between supply chain partners on a global basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume = 50| issue = 12| pages = 57–62| last = Boh| first = W.

RosettaNet is a subsidiary of [[GS1 US]], formerly the Uniform Code Council, Inc. (UCC).  It was formed mainly through the efforts of [[Fadi Chehade]],&lt;ref name="Chehade"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Jesdanun, Anick|date=23 June 2012|title=Internet group picks little-known executive as CEO|newspaper=The Austin Statesman|location=Austin, Texas|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/internet-group-picks-little-known-executive-as-ceo-2402558.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623163622/http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/internet-group-picks-little-known-executive-as-ceo-2402558.html|archivedate=23 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; its first CEO. RosettaNet's 500 members come from companies around the world. The consortium has a presence in USA, Malaysia, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, China, Singapore, Thailand and Australia.

RosettaNet has several local user groups. The European User Group is called EDIFICE.

==The RosettaNet standard==
The RosettaNet standard is based on [[XML]] and defines message guidelines, interfaces for business processes, and implementation frameworks for interactions between companies.  Mostly addressed is the [[supply chain]] area, but also manufacturing, product and material data and service processes are in scope.

The standard is widely spread in the global semiconductor industry, but also in electronic components, consumer electronics, telecommunication and logistics. RosettaNet originated in the USA and is widely used there, but it is also well accepted and even supported by governments in Asia. Due to the widespread use of [[EDIFACT]] in Europe, RosettaNet is used less, but it is growing.{{Citation needed|reason=need reliable source to indicate use is growing|date=May 2014}}

The RosettaNet Automated Enablement standard (RAE) uses the [[Office Open XML]] document standard.&lt;ref&gt;''an international open document standard called ECMA Open XML'' {{Cite web|author=Lin, Woon Wu|date=June 2007|title=RosettaNet Malaysia introduces new biz standard for local SMIs|url=http://www.rosettanet.org.my/news_231007(1).aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020251/http://www.rosettanet.org.my/news_231007%281%29.aspx|archivedate=25 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RosettaNet Technical Dictionary (RNTD) is the reference model for the classification and characterization of the products in the supply chains that use RosettaNet for their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RosettaNet|title=Purpose|url=http://www.rosettanet.org/dnn_rose/Standards/RosettaNetPrograms/FoundationalPrograms/CompletedFoundationalPrograms/RNTDDevelopment/Purpose/tabid/1756/Default.aspx|publisher=RosettaNet|date=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7663">The '''Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project''', one of the [[Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects]], is dedicated to social movements and [[Labor history (discipline)|labor history]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It is directed by Professor James N. Gregory of the [[University of Washington]]. The project represents a unique collaboration between community organizations and University faculty, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Teaching a City about Its Civil Rights History: A Public History Success Story|journal=Perspectives|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0704/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become a model of public history across the US and has been credited with changing the discussion of race and civil rights in the Seattle area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffey|first=Trevor|title=Rethinking Race and Place: The Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|journal=OAH Magazine of History|date=January 2012|volume=26|issue=1|pages=47–50|url=http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/47.full?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=IeFmtkRZYTKf7CO|doi=10.1093/oahmag/oar049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The site provides over 70 oral history interviews with short video excerpts and brief biographies, as well as a listing of historic Civil Rights organizations, a page on Seattle's ethnic press, a resource with lesson plans for teachers, films and slidewhows, and a page with in-depth historical essays that explore various issues, incidents and people. Each fully illustrated with photos and newspaper articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor History Project: an Online Video Oral History Collection|journal=Northwest Oral History Association Newsletter|date=Spring 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr3/pdf/NOHA%20Spring%2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special sections==
Also in the project is a special sections area featuring nine different sections which showcase comprehensive reports, oral histories, photo collections, and documents about many of the prominent movements and organizations involved in Seattle's rich history of Civil Rights and Labor activism. The sections detail farm workers in Washington State, the Ku Klux Klan in Washington, the Seattle Black Panther Party, Filipino Cannery Unions, the Washington Chicano movement, the 1907 Bellingham anti-Asian riots, the Congress of Racial Equality in Seattle, the Black Student Union at the University of Washington, and the United Construction Workers Association. A section on the history of housing segregation in Seattle attracted media attention and spurred changes in State law that allowed neighborhood associations to remove racially restrictive clauses from their covenants with greater ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnbull|first=Lornet|title=Homeowners find records still hold blot of racism|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002297312_covenants03m.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=June 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=James|title=Stain of racism still haunts Seattle neighborhoods|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2002913362_jamesgregory06.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational Outreach==
The Project includes nine full lesson plans for middle school and high school students, ranging from single class periods to longer units, created by Washington educators. The lesson plans are designed to encourage critical thinking and fulfill State requirements. Examples include ‘Martin Luther King’s Controversial Visit to Seattle’ and ‘Document Based Question: School Segregation in Seattle.’

==Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project==
The Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project is a multimedia resource on the history of Chicano activism that includes first-hand oral histories, primary documents and academic research.  It traces the development of the movement in the Yakima Valley and the University of Washington in Seattle. The Project is an initiative of the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project at the University of Washington, alongside the Farm Workers in Washington State History Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosales-Castaneda|first=Oscar|title=Writing Chicana/o History with the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|journal=Writing History in the Digital Age|date=Spring 2012|url=http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu/public-history/rosales-castaneda-2012-spring/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
The Project focuses on several organizations including United Mexican American Students (UMAS), [[Brown Berets|the Brown Berets]], [[MEChA|Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana/o de Aztlan]] (MEChA), United Farmworker Cooperative, El Teatro del Piojo, El Centro de la Raza, the Concilio for Spanish Speaking, SEAMAR Community Health Centers, and radio station KDNA. The histories of these organizations are bolstered by video oral histories, photographs from several personal collections and digitized copies of pamphlets and other documents. An in-depth timeline covers the years 1960-1985, and an illustrated essay details the period from the coalescing of the movement in 1967 to the [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|2006 immigration mobilizations]]. In addition, the site contains a database of more than 300 digitized newspaper articles that originally appeared between 1968 and 1979. Like other sections of the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project, the site contains model lesson plans for middle school and high school teachers using the available materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Teaching a City about Its Civil Rights History: A Public History Success Story|journal=Perspectives|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0704/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor History Project: an Online Video Oral History Collection|journal=Northwest Oral History Association Newsletter|date=Spring 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr3/pdf/NOHA%20Spring%2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{buddhism-simple}}
{{bodhipakkhiyadhamma}}
In [[Buddhism]], the '''Seven Factors of Awakening''' ([[Pali]]: ''satta bojjha{{IAST|ṅ}}gā'' or ''satta sambojjha{{IAST|ṅ}}gā''; [[Sanskrit|Skt.]]: ''sapta bodhyanga'') are:

* '''Mindfulness''' (''[[mindfulness (Buddhism)|sati]]''). To maintain awareness of reality ([[dhamma|''dharma'']]).
* '''Investigation''' of the nature of reality (''[[dhamma vicaya]]'').
* '''Energy''' (''[[Vīrya|viriya]]'') also determination, effort
* '''Joy''' or '''rapture''' (''[[pīti]]'')
* '''Relaxation''' or '''tranquility''' (''[[passaddhi]]'') of both body and mind
* '''Concentration''', clear awareness (''[[samādhi (Buddhism)|sam&amp;#x101;dhi]]'') a calm, one-pointed state of concentration of mind,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,  Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), entry for "Samādhi," retrieved 3 Feb. 2011 from "U.Chicago" at  {{cite web |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709035335/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali |archivedate=2012-07-09 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; or clear awareness
* '''Equanimity''' (''[[upekkha]]''). To accept reality as-it-is (''yatha-bhuta'') without craving or aversion.

This evaluation of seven awakening factors is one of the "Seven Sets" of "Awakening-related states" (''[[bodhipakkhiyadhamma]]'').

The Pali word ''bojjhanga'' is a compound of ''[[bodhi]]'' ("awakening," "enlightenment") and ''anga'' ("factor").&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 490, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3371.pali entry for "Bojjhanga" (retrieved 10 Jul 2007).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Satta sambojjha{{IAST|ṅ}}gā:

==Pali literature==
In the [[Sutta Pitaka]]'s [[Samyutta Nikaya]], the bojjhangas refer to wholesome, mundane factors ''leading to'' enlightenment.  In the [[Abhidhamma]] and [[Pali literature|Pali commentaries]], the bojjhangas tend to refer to supramundane factors ''concurrent with'' enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 1499.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sutta Pitaka===
According to one discourse in the Samyutta Nikaya entitled "Bhikkhu Sutta" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.5):
:[Bhikkhu:] "Venerable sir, it is said, 'factors of enlightenment, factors of enlightenment.' In what sense are they called factors of enlightenment?"
:[Buddha:] "They lead to enlightenment, bhikkhu, therefore they are called factors of enlightenment...."&lt;ref&gt;''Bhikkhu Sutta'' (SN 46.5), trans. Bodhi (2000), p. 1574.  See also Walshe (1985), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#n-265 n. 265.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], one may contemplate the seven Factors of Enlightenment as well as on their antithesis, the [[Five Hindrances]] ([[kama|sensual pleasure]], ill-will, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry, doubt).&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a discourse that includes the juxtaposition of these two sets of phenomena, see the [[Satipatthana Sutta]].  For a group of discourses in which these two sets of phenomena are juxtaposed, see [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.31 to 46.40 (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1501, 1589-94).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, one Samyutta Nikaya sutta identifies developing each of the enlightenment factors accompanied by each of the four [[brahmavihara|brahma vihara]]s ([[metta|lovingkindness]], [[Karuṇā|compassion]], [[mudita|sympathetic joy]], [[upekkha|equanimity]]).&lt;ref&gt;SN 46.54, variously known as the ''Mettaasahagata Sutta'' (CSCD) or ''Metta Sutta'' (SLTP) or ''Metta.m Sutta'' (PTS Feer).  See Bodhi (2000), pp. 1607-11; Walshe (1985), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-59 sutta 59], pp. 71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Samyutta Nikaya's "Fire Discourse," the Buddha identifies that mindfulness is "always useful" (''sabbatthika''); while, when one's mind is sluggish, one should develop the enlightenment factors of investigation, energy and joy; and, when one's mind is excited, one should develop the enlightenment factors of tranquility, concentration and equanimity.&lt;ref name="aggi sutta"&gt;"Fire Discourse" (''Aggi Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.53) (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1605-7; Walshe, 1985, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-58 sutta 58], pp. 69-70).&lt;/ref&gt;

Again according to the Samyutta Nikaya, once when the Buddha was gravely ill he asked Venerable Mahacunda to recite the seven Factors of Enlightenment to him. In such a way the Buddha was cured of his illness.&lt;ref&gt;''Gilana Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.16) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn46/sn46.016.piya.html (Piyadassi, 1999;] [http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bp_sut14.htm Piyadassi, n.d.).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abhidhamma and commentarial literature===
In the [[Visuddhimagga]], in a section discussing skills needed for the attainment and maintenance of absorption (''[[jhana]]''), [[Buddhaghosa]] identifies the bojjhangas in the following fashion:
* "Strong mindfulness ... is needed in all instances...."
* "When his mind is slack with over-laxness of energy, etc., then ... he should develop those [three enlightenment factors] beginning with investigation-of-states..." (i.e., ''dhamma vicaya, viriya, piti'').
* "When his mind is agitated through over-energeticness, etc., then ... he should develop those [three enlightenment factors] beginning with tranquility..." (i.e., ''passaddhi, samadhi, upekkha'').&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa &amp; {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1999), pp. 129, 131.  Note that Buddhaghosa clearly references the last six ''bojjhangas'' in the last two cited statements.  The first statement about ''sati'' (mindfulness), while immediately preceding mention of the ''bojjhangas'', is technically in reference to the five spiritual faculties (''[[indriya]]'').  See also SN 46.53 (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1605-7; Walshe, 1985, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-58 sutta 58], pp. 69-70).&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven factors of awakening are closely related to the practice of ''dhyana'', resembling the various factors that are part of the four dhyanas.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin, ''Tha Buddhis Path to Awakening'', chapter five; Arbel (2017), ''Early Buddhist Meditation''&lt;/ref&gt;

In meditation everyone most likely experiences two of the [[five hindrances]] (Pāli: pañca nīvaraṇāni). They are '''sloth and torpor''' (Pāli: thīna-middha), which is half-hearted action with little or no collectedness, and '''restlessness and worry''' (uddhacca-kukkucca), which is the inability to calm the mind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

As indicated above, in the "Fire Discourse" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.53), it is recommended that joy or rapture, investigation, and energy are to be developed when experiencing sloth and torpor. Relaxation, concentration, and equanimity are to be developed when experiencing restlessness or worry. Mindfulness should be constantly present to remain aware of physical change as well as mental change in either skillful or unskillful direction.&lt;ref name="aggi sutta" /&gt;

[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|Depiction from the 15th century]]

The '''square of opposition''' is a diagram representing the relations between the four basic [[categorical proposition]]s.
The origin of the square can be traced back to [[Aristotle]] making the distinction between two oppositions: [[contradiction]] and [[contrariety]].
But Aristotle did not draw any diagram. This was done several centuries later by [[Apuleius]] and [[Boethius]].

== Summary ==
In traditional logic, a proposition (Latin: ''propositio'') is a spoken assertion (''oratio enunciativa''), not the meaning of an assertion, as in modern philosophy of language and logic. A ''categorical proposition'' is a simple proposition containing two terms, subject and predicate, in which the predicate is either asserted or denied of the subject.

Every categorical proposition can be reduced to one of four [[logical form]]s. These are:
* The so-called 'A' proposition, the universal affirmative (''universalis affirmativa''), whose form in Latin is 'omne S est P', usually translated as 'every S is a P'.
* The 'E' proposition, the universal negative (''universalis negativa''), Latin form 'nullum S est P', usually translated as 'no S are P'.
* The 'I' proposition, the particular affirmative (''particularis affirmativa''), Latin 'quoddam S est P', usually translated as 'some S are P'.
* The 'O' proposition, the particular negative (''particularis negativa''), Latin 'quoddam S non est P', usually translated as 'some S are not P'.

In tabular form:

'''*'''While the standard form "No S is P" is unambiguous, the form "All S is not P" '''is ambiguous'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=David|title=The Art of Reasoning: An Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking|date=2014|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93078-8|page=150|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so is not a standard form: because it can be either an E or O proposition, it requires a context to determine the form.

Aristotle states (in chapters six and seven of the ''Peri hermaneias'' (Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας, Latin ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', English 'On Interpretation')), that there are certain logical relationships between these four kinds of proposition. He says that to every affirmation there corresponds exactly one negation, and that every affirmation and its negation are 'opposed' such that always one of them must be true, and the other false. A pair of affirmative and negative statements he calls a 'contradiction' (in medieval Latin, ''contradictio''). Examples of contradictories are 'every man is white' and 'not every man is white' (also read as 'some men are not white'), 'no man is white' and 'some man is white'.

'Contrary' (medieval: ''contrariae'') statements, are such that both cannot at the same time be true. Examples of these are the universal affirmative 'every man is white', and the universal negative 'no man is white'. These cannot be true at the same time. However, these are not contradictories because both of them may be false. For example, it is false that every man is white, since some men are not white. Yet it is also false that no man is white, since there are some white men.

Since every statement has a contradictory opposite, and since a contradictory is true when its opposite is false, it follows that the opposites of contraries (which the medievals called subcontraries, ''subcontrariae'') can both be true, but they cannot both be false. Since subcontraries are negations of universal statements, they were called 'particular' statements by the medieval logicians.

Another logical opposition implied by this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (''alternatio''), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal statement of the same quality such that the particular is implied by the other.  The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every man is white' is true, its contrary 'no man is white' is false. Therefore, the contradictory 'some man is white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no man is white' implies the particular 'not every man is white'.&lt;ref&gt;Parry &amp; Hacker, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Sg84H6B-m4C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Aristotelian Logic]'' (SUNY Press, 1990), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen &amp; Nagel, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U09MjwDSZ0kC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Introduction to Logic]'' Second Edition (Hackett Publishing, 1993), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary:
* Universal statements are contraries: 'every man is just' and 'no man is just' cannot be true together, although one may be true and the other false, and also both may be false (if at least one man is just, and at least one man is not just).
* Particular statements are subcontraries. 'Some man is just' and 'some man is not just' cannot be false together.
* The particular statement of one quality is the subaltern of the universal statement of that same quality, which is the superaltern of the particular statement because in Aristotelian semantics 'every A is B' implies 'some A is B' and 'no A is B' implies 'some A is not B'. Note that modern formal interpretations of English sentences interpret 'every A is B' as 'for any x, x is A implies x is B', which does ''not'' imply 'some x is A'. This is a matter of semantic interpretation, however, and does not mean, as is sometimes claimed, that Aristotelian logic is 'wrong'.
* The universal affirmative and the particular negative are contradictories. If some A is not B, not every A is B. Conversely, though this is not the case in modern semantics, it was thought that if every A is not B, some A is not B. This interpretation has caused difficulties (see below). While Aristotle's Greek does not represent the particular negative as 'some A is not B', but as 'not every A is B', someone in his commentary on the ''Peri hermaneias'', renders the particular negative as 'quoddam A non est B', literally 'a certain A is not a B', and in all medieval writing on logic it is customary to represent the particular proposition in this way.

These relationships became the basis of a diagram originating with Boethius and used by medieval logicians to classify the logical relationships. The propositions are placed in the four corners of a square, and the relations represented as lines drawn between them, whence the name 'The Square of Opposition'.

== The problem of [[existential import]] ==
Subcontraries, which medieval logicians represented in the form 'quoddam A est B' (some particular A is B) and 'quoddam A non est B' (some particular A is not B) cannot both be false, since their universal contradictory statements (every A is B / no A is B) cannot both be true. This leads to a difficulty that was first identified by [[Peter Abelard]]. 'Some A is B' seems to imply 'something is A'. For example, 'Some man is white' seems to imply that at least one thing is a man, namely the man who has to be white, if 'some man is white' is true. But, 'some man is not white' also implies that something is a man, namely the man who is not white, if the statement 'some man is not white' is true. But Aristotelian logic requires that necessarily one of these statements is true. Both cannot be false. Therefore, (since both imply that something is a man) it follows that necessarily something is a man, i.e. men exist. But (as Abelard points out, in the Dialectica) surely men might not exist?&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Dialectica'', and in his commentary on the ''Perihermaneias''&lt;/ref&gt;

: For with absolutely no man existing, neither the proposition 'every man is a man' is true nor 'some man is not a man'.&lt;ref&gt;''Re enim hominis prorsus non existente neque ea vera est quae ait: omnis homo est homo, nec ea quae proponit: quidam homo non est homo''&lt;/ref&gt;

Abelard also points out that subcontraries containing subject terms denoting nothing, such as 'a man who is a stone', are both false.

: If 'every stone-man is a stone' is true, also its conversion ''per accidens'' is true ('some stones are stone-men'). But no stone is a stone-man, because neither this man nor that man etc. is a stone. But also this 'a certain stone-man is not a stone' is false by necessity, since it is impossible to suppose it is true.&lt;ref&gt;''Si enim vera est: Omnis homo qui lapis est, est lapis, et eius conversa per accidens vera est: Quidam lapis est homo qui est lapis. Sed nullus lapis est homo qui est lapis, quia neque hic neque ille etc. Sed et illam: Quidam homo qui est lapis, non est lapis, falsam esse necesse est, cum impossibile ponat''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terence Parsons]] argues that ancient philosophers did not experience the problem of existential import as only the A and I forms had existential import.

: Affirmatives have existential import, and negatives do not. The ancients thus did not see the incoherence of the square as formulated by [[Aristotle]] because there was no incoherence to see.&lt;ref&gt;in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/#AriForOFor ''The Traditional Square of Opposition''] in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

He goes on to cite medieval philosopher [[William of Moerbeke]]
:In affirmative propositions a term is always asserted to supposit for something. Thus, if it supposits for nothing the proposition is false. However, in negative propositions the assertion is either that the term does not supposit for something or that it supposits for something of which the predicate is truly denied. Thus a negative proposition has two causes of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/notes.html#6 (SL I.72) Loux 1974, 206]&lt;/ref&gt;

And points to [[Boethius]]' translation of Aristotle's work as giving rise to the mistaken notion that the O form has existential import.

:But when Boethius comments on this text he illustrates Aristotle's doctrine with the now-famous diagram, and he uses the wording 'Some man is not just'.  So this must have seemed to him to be a natural equivalent in Latin. It looks odd to us in English, but he wasn't bothered by it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/#RewOFor ''The Traditional Square of Opposition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern squares of opposition==
[[Image:Frege-gegensätze.png|thumb|200px|Frege's square of opposition&lt;br&gt; The ''conträr'' below is an erratum:&lt;br&gt; It should read ''subconträr'']]
In the 19th century, [[George Boole]] argued for requiring existential import on both terms in particular claims (I and O), but allowing all terms of universal claims (A and E) to lack existential import. This decision made [[Venn diagram]]s particularly easy to use for term logic. The square of opposition, under this Boolean set of assumptions, is often called the modern Square of opposition. In the modern square of opposition, A and O claims are contradictories, as are E and I, but all other forms of opposition cease to hold; there are no contraries, subcontraries, or subalterns. Thus, from a modern point of view, it often makes sense to talk about 'the' opposition of a claim, rather than insisting as older logicians did that a claim has several different opposites, which are in different kinds of opposition with the claim.

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' also presents a square of oppositions, organised in an almost identical manner to the classical square, showing the contradictories, subalternates and contraries between four formulae constructed from universal quantification, negation and implication.

[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]]' [[semiotic square]] was derived from Aristotle's work.

The traditional square of opposition is now often compared with squares based on inner- and outer-negation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.165900.1391710462!/menu/standard/file/2012%20Squares.pdf Westerståhl, 'Classical vs. modern squares of opposition, and beyond'],  in Beziau and Payette (eds.), The Square of Opposition: A General Framework for Cognition, Peter Lang, Bern, 195-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical hexagons and other bi-simplexes ==
{{Main|Logical hexagon}}

The square of opposition has been extended to a logical hexagon which includes the relationships of six statements. It was discovered independently by both [[Augustin Sesmat]] and [[Robert Blanché]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alessiomoretti.perso.sfr.fr/NOTLogicalHexagon.html N-Opposition Theory ''Logical hexagon'']&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a "[[logical cube]]", belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called "logical bi-simplexes of dimension n." The pattern also goes even beyond this.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Pellissier&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Square of opposition (or logical square) and modal logic  ==

The logical square, also called square of opposition or square of [[Apuleius]] has its origin in the four marked sentences to be employed in syllogistic reasoning: Every man is bad, the universal affirmative and its negation Not every man is bad (or Some men are not bad), the particular negative on the one hand, Some men are bad, the particular affirmative and its negation No man is bad, the universal negative on the other. [[Robert Blanché]] published with Vrin his Structures intellectuelles in 1966 and since then many scholars think that the logical square or square of opposition representing four values should be replaced by the [[logical hexagon]] which by representing six values is a more potent figure because it has the power to explain more things about logic and natural language.

'''[[Curvilinear coordinates]]''' can be formulated in [[tensor calculus]], with important applications in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], particularly for describing transportation of physical quantities and deformation of matter in [[fluid mechanics]] and [[continuum mechanics]].

==Vector and tensor algebra in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates==

Elementary vector and tensor algebra in curvilinear coordinates is used in some of the older scientific literature in [[mechanics]] and [[physics]] and can be indispensable to understanding work from the early and mid 1900s, for example the text by Green and Zerna.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book | last1=Green | first1=A. E. | last2=Zerna | first2=W. | year=1968 | title=Theoretical Elasticity | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-853486-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some useful relations in the algebra of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section.

=== Coordinate transformations ===
Consider two coordinate systems with coordinate variables &lt;math&gt;(Z^1 , Z^2 ,Z^3 )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Z^\acute{1} , Z^\acute{2} ,Z^\acute{3} )&lt;/math&gt;,  which we shall represent in short as just &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; respectively and always assume our index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; runs from 1 through 3. We shall assume that  these coordinates systems are embedded in the three-dimensional euclidean space. Coordinates  &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; may be used to explain each other, because as we move along the coordinate line in one coordinate system we can use the other to describe our position. In this way Coordinates  &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of each other

&lt;math&gt;Z^i= f^{i}(Z^\acute{1} , Z^\acute{2} ,Z^\acute{3} ) &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as

&lt;math&gt;Z^i= Z^{i}(Z^\acute{1} , Z^\acute{2} ,Z^\acute{3} )= Z^{i}(Z^\acute{i}) &lt;/math&gt;  for &lt;math&gt;\acute{i},i=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;

These three equations together are also called a coordinate transformation from &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; to  &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt;.Let us denote this transformation by &lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt;. We will therefore represent the transformation from the coordinate system with coordinate variables &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; to the coordinate system with coordinates &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt;Z= T(\acute{z}) &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly we can represent &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}= g^{\acute{i}}(Z^{1}, Z^{2} ,Z^{3} )  &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\acute{i}=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;

similarly we can write the free equations more compactly as

&lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}= Z^\acute{i}(Z^{1} , Z^{2} ,Z^{3} )= Z^\acute{i}(Z^{i})  &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\acute{i},i=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;

These three equations together are also called a coordinate transformation from &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Let us denote this transformation by &lt;math&gt;S &lt;/math&gt;. We will represent the transformation from the coordinate system with coordinate variables &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; to the coordinate system with coordinates &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt;\acute{z}= S(z) &lt;/math&gt;

If the transformation &lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt; is bijective then we call the image of the transformation,namely &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt;, a set of '''admissible coordinates for''' &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt; is linear the coordinate system &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; will be called an '''affine coordinate system''' ,otherwise &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''curvilinear coordinate system'''

==== The Jacobian ====
As we now see that the Coordinates  &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of each other, we can take the derivative of the coordinate variable &lt;math&gt;Z^i &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the coordinate variable &lt;math&gt;Z^\acute{i}&lt;/math&gt;

consider

&lt;math&gt;\partial{Z^i} \over \partial{Z^\acute{i}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;J_\acute{i}^i &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\acute{i},i=1,2,3 &lt;/math&gt;, these derivatives can be arranged in a matrix, say &lt;math&gt;J &lt;/math&gt;,in which &lt;math&gt;J_\acute{i}^i &lt;/math&gt; is the element in the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}  &lt;/math&gt;row and &lt;math&gt;\acute{i}^{th} &lt;/math&gt;column

&lt;math&gt;J &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} J_\acute{1}^{1}  &amp; J_\acute{2}^{1} &amp; J_\acute{3}^{1} \\ J_\acute{1}^{2} &amp; J_\acute{2}^{2}&amp; J_\acute{3}^{2} \\ J_\acute{1}^{3}&amp; J_\acute{2}^{3}&amp; J_\acute{3}^{3}  \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}  {\partial{Z^1} \over \partial{Z^\acute{1}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^1} \over \partial{Z^\acute{2}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^1} \over \partial{Z^\acute{3}}}\\ {\partial{Z^2} \over \partial{Z^\acute{1}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^2} \over \partial{Z^\acute{2}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^2} \over \partial{Z^\acute{3}}}\\{\partial{Z^3} \over \partial{Z^\acute{1}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^3} \over \partial{Z^\acute{2}}} &amp; {\partial{Z^3} \over \partial{Z^\acute{3}}} \end{pmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;

The resultant matrix is called the Jacobian matrix.

===Vectors in curvilinear coordinates===
Let ('''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be an arbitrary basis for three-dimensional Euclidean space.  In general, the basis vectors are '''neither unit vectors nor mutually orthogonal'''.  However, they are required to be linearly independent.  Then a vector '''v''' can be expressed as&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|page=27}}
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{v} = v^k\,\mathbf{b}_k
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components ''v&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' are the '''contravariant''' components of the vector '''v'''.

The '''reciprocal basis''' ('''b'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is defined by the relation &lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|pages=28–29}}
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}^i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j = \delta^i_j
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''δ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]].

The vector '''v''' can also be expressed in terms of the reciprocal basis:
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{v} = v_k~\mathbf{b}^k
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the '''covariant''' components of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates===
A second-order tensor can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{S} = S^{ij}~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = S^{i}_{~j}~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j = S_{i}^{~j}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = S_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components ''S&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;'' are called the '''contravariant''' components, ''S&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' the '''mixed right-covariant''' components, ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' the '''mixed left-covariant''' components, and ''S&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' the '''covariant''' components of the second-order tensor.

====Metric tensor and relations between components====
The quantities ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;'' are defined as&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|page=39}}

:&lt;math&gt;
    g_{ij} = \mathbf{b}_i \cdot \mathbf{b}_j = g_{ji} ~;~~ g^{ij} = \mathbf{b}^i \cdot \mathbf{b}^j = g^{ji}
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the above equations we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   v^i = g^{ik}~v_k ~;~~ v_i = g_{ik}~v^k ~;~~ \mathbf{b}^i = g^{ij}~\mathbf{b}_j ~;~~ \mathbf{b}_i = g_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;

The components of a vector are related by&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|pages=30–32}}
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v^k~\mathbf{b}_k\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v^k~\delta^i_k = v^i &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v_k~\mathbf{b}^k\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v_k~\delta_i^k = v_i &lt;/math&gt;
Also,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v^k~\mathbf{b}_k\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = g_{ki}~v^k &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v_k~\mathbf{b}^k\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = g^{ki}~v_k
 &lt;/math&gt;

The components of the second-order tensor are related by
:&lt;math&gt;
   S^{ij} = g^{ik}~S_k^{~j} = g^{jk}~S^i_{~k} = g^{ik}~g^{jl}~S_{kl}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===The alternating tensor===
In an orthonormal right-handed basis, the third-order [[Levi-Civita symbol|alternating tensor]] is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} = \varepsilon_{ijk}~\mathbf{e}^i\otimes\mathbf{e}^j\otimes\mathbf{e}^k
&lt;/math&gt;
In a general curvilinear basis the same tensor may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} = \mathcal{E}_{ijk}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
   = \mathcal{E}^{ijk}~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j\otimes\mathbf{b}_k
&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{E}_{ijk} = \left[\mathbf{b}_i,\mathbf{b}_j,\mathbf{b}_k\right] =(\mathbf{b}_i\times\mathbf{b}_j)\cdot\mathbf{b}_k ~;~~
  \mathcal{E}^{ijk} = \left[\mathbf{b}^i,\mathbf{b}^j,\mathbf{b}^k\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}_i\times\mathbf{b}_j = J~\varepsilon_{ijp}~\mathbf{b}^p = \sqrt{g}~\varepsilon_{ijp}~\mathbf{b}^p
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{E}_{ijk} = J~\varepsilon_{ijk} = \sqrt{g}~\varepsilon_{ijk}
&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, we can show that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{E}^{ijk} = \cfrac{1}{J}~\varepsilon^{ijk} = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}~\varepsilon^{ijk}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector operations===

#'''Identity map'''
#:The identity map '''I''' defined by &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{I}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|page=39}}

   \mathsf{I} = g^{ij}~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = g_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j = \mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^i = \mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}_i

&lt;/math&gt;
#:where ε&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]] and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Cartesian basis vector.  In curvilinear coordinates, the equivalent expression is
#::&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v} = [(\mathbf{b}_m\times\mathbf{b}_n)\cdot\mathbf{b}_s]~u^m~v^n~\mathbf{b}^s
    = \mathcal{E}_{smn}~u^m~v^n~\mathbf{b}^s

&lt;/math&gt;
#:where ε&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt; is a Cartesian basis vector.  Therefore,
#::&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{e}_p\times\mathbf{e}_q = \varepsilon_{ipq}~\mathbf{e}_i
&lt;/math&gt;
#:and
#::&lt;math&gt;

&amp; = \frac{\partial x_p}{\partial q^m}~\frac{\partial x_q}{\partial q^n}~\mathbf{e}_p\times\mathbf{e}_q
    = \varepsilon_{ipq}~\frac{\partial x_p}{\partial q^m}~\frac{\partial x_q}{\partial q^n}~\mathbf{e}_i
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
#:Hence,

&lt;/math&gt;
#:Returning to the vector product and using the relations

#:gives us

&lt;/math&gt;

===Tensor operations===

#::&lt;math&gt;
   \mathsf{I} = g^{ij}\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = g_{ij}\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j = \mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^i = \mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}_i
 &lt;/math&gt;
#'''Action of a second-order tensor on a vector:'''
#:The action &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{S}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in curvilinear coordinates as
#::&lt;math&gt;
   v^i\mathbf{b}_i = S^{ij}u_j\mathbf{b}_i = S^i_{j}u^j\mathbf{b}_i ;\qquad v_i\mathbf{b}^i = S_{ij}u^i\mathbf{b}^i = S_{i}^{j}u_j\mathbf{b}^i

#'''[[Inner product]] of two second-order tensors:'''
#:The inner product of two second-order tensors &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{U} = \boldsymbol{S}\cdot\boldsymbol{T}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in curvilinear coordinates as

#'''[[Determinant]] of a second-order tensor:'''

#:where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary vectors and
#::&lt;math&gt;
  \left[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\right] := \mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{w}).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relations between curvilinear and Cartesian basis vectors===
Let ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be the usual Cartesian basis vectors for the Euclidean space of interest and let
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}_i = \boldsymbol{F}\cdot\mathbf{e}_i
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''F'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a second-order transformation tensor that maps '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_i = (\boldsymbol{F}\cdot\mathbf{e}_i)\otimes\mathbf{e}_i = \boldsymbol{F}\cdot(\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_i) = \boldsymbol{F}~.
&lt;/math&gt;
From this relation we can show that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}^i = \boldsymbol{F}^{-\rm{T}}\cdot\mathbf{e}^i ~;~~ g^{ij} = [\boldsymbol{F}^{-\rm{1}}\cdot\boldsymbol{F}^{-\rm{T}}]_{ij} ~;~~ g_{ij} = [g^{ij}]^{-1} = [\boldsymbol{F}^{\rm{T}}\cdot\boldsymbol{F}]_{ij}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;J := \det\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; be the Jacobian of the transformation.  Then, from the definition of the determinant,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left[\mathbf{b}_1,\mathbf{b}_2,\mathbf{b}_3\right] = \det\boldsymbol{F}\left[\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{e}_3\right] ~.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left[\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{e}_3\right] = 1 
&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  J = \det\boldsymbol{F} = \left[\mathbf{b}_1,\mathbf{b}_2,\mathbf{b}_3\right] = \mathbf{b}_1\cdot(\mathbf{b}_2\times\mathbf{b}_3)
&lt;/math&gt;
A number of interesting results can be derived using the above relations.

First, consider
:&lt;math&gt;
   g := \det[g_{ij}]
&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
   g = \det[\boldsymbol{F}^{\rm{T}}]\cdot\det[\boldsymbol{F}] = J\cdot J = J^2
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, we can show that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \det[g^{ij}] = \cfrac{1}{J^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, using the fact that &lt;math&gt;[g^{ij}] = [g_{ij}]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial g}{\partial g_{ij}} = 2~J~\cfrac{\partial J}{\partial g_{ij}} = g~g^{ij}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Another interesting relation is derived below.  Recall that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}^i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j = \delta^i_j \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{b}^1\cdot\mathbf{b}_1 = 1,~\mathbf{b}^1\cdot\mathbf{b}_2=\mathbf{b}^1\cdot\mathbf{b}_3=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{b}^1 = A~(\mathbf{b}_2\times\mathbf{b}_3)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is a, yet undetermined, constant.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}^1\cdot\mathbf{b}_1 =  A~\mathbf{b}_1\cdot(\mathbf{b}_2\times\mathbf{b}_3) = AJ = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = \cfrac{1}{J}
&lt;/math&gt;
This observation leads to the relations
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}^1 = \cfrac{1}{J}(\mathbf{b}_2\times\mathbf{b}_3) ~;~~
  \mathbf{b}^2 = \cfrac{1}{J}(\mathbf{b}_3\times\mathbf{b}_1) ~;~~
  \mathbf{b}^3 = \cfrac{1}{J}(\mathbf{b}_1\times\mathbf{b}_2)
&lt;/math&gt;
In index notation,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \varepsilon_{ijk}~\mathbf{b}^k = \cfrac{1}{J}(\mathbf{b}_i\times\mathbf{b}_j) = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}(\mathbf{b}_i\times\mathbf{b}_j)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the usual [[permutation symbol]].

We have not identified an explicit expression for the transformation tensor '''''F''''' because an alternative form of the mapping between curvilinear and Cartesian bases is more useful.  Assuming a sufficient degree of smoothness in the mapping (and a bit of abuse of notation), we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}_i = \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i} =  \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial x_j}~\cfrac{\partial x_j}{\partial q^i} = \mathbf{e}_j~\cfrac{\partial x_j}{\partial q^i} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{e}_i = \mathbf{b}_j~\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial x_i}
 &lt;/math&gt;
From these results we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{e}^k\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = \frac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^i} \quad \Rightarrow \quad
  \frac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^i}~\mathbf{b}^i = \mathbf{e}^k\cdot(\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^i) = \mathbf{e}^k
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{b}^k = \frac{\partial q^k}{\partial x_i}~\mathbf{e}^i
&lt;/math&gt;

Some useful relations in the calculus of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section.  The notation and contents are primarily from Ogden,&lt;ref name=Ogden00/&gt; Simmonds,&lt;ref name=Simmonds /&gt; Green and Zerna,&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;  Basar and Weichert,&lt;ref name=Basar/&gt; and Ciarlet.&lt;ref name=Ciarlet/&gt;

===Basic definitions===
Let the position of a point in space be characterized by three coordinate variables &lt;math&gt;(q^1, q^2, q^3)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[coordinate curve]] ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; represents a curve on which ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are constant.  Let '''x''' be the [[position vector]] of the point relative to some origin.  Then, assuming that such a mapping and its inverse exist and are continuous, we can write &lt;ref name=Ogden00&gt;{{cite book | last=Ogden | first=R. W. | year=2000 | title=Nonlinear elastic deformations | publisher=Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=55}}
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(q^1, q^2, q^3) ~;~~ q^i = \psi^i(\mathbf{x}) = [\boldsymbol{\varphi}^{-1}(\mathbf{x})]^i
 &lt;/math&gt;
The fields ψ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''') are called the '''curvilinear coordinate functions''' of the '''curvilinear coordinate system''' '''ψ'''('''x''') = '''ψ'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''').

The ''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' '''coordinate curves''' are defined by the one-parameter family of functions given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x}_i(\alpha) = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(\alpha, q^j, q^k) ~,~~ i\ne j \ne k
 &lt;/math&gt;
with ''q&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;, q&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' fixed.

===Tangent vector to coordinate curves===
The '''tangent vector''' to the curve '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; at the point '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(α) (or to the coordinate curve ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' at the point '''x''') is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\rm{d}\mathbf{x}_i}{\rm{d}\alpha} \equiv \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Gradient===

====Scalar field====
Let ''f''('''x''') be a scalar field in space.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;
   f(\mathbf{x}) = f[\boldsymbol{\varphi}(q^1,q^2,q^3)] = f_\varphi(q^1,q^2,q^3)
 &lt;/math&gt;
The gradient of the field ''f'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}f(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\rm{d}}{\rm{d}\alpha} f(\mathbf{x}+\alpha\mathbf{c})\biggr|_{\alpha=0}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where '''c''' is an arbitrary constant vector.  If we define the components ''c&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' of '''c''' are such that
:&lt;math&gt;
   q^i + \alpha~c^i = \psi^i(\mathbf{x} + \alpha~\mathbf{c})
 &lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}f(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\rm{d}}{\rm{d}\alpha} f_\varphi(q^1 + \alpha~c^1, q^2 + \alpha~c^2, q^3 + \alpha~c^3)\biggr|_{\alpha=0} = \cfrac{\partial f_\varphi}{\partial q^i}~c^i = \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}~c^i
 &lt;/math&gt;

If we set &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = \psi^i(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, then since &lt;math&gt;q^i = \psi^i(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi^i(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\partial \psi^i}{\partial q^j}~c^j = c^i
 &lt;/math&gt;
which provides a means of extracting the contravariant component of a vector '''c'''.

If '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the covariant (or natural) basis at a point, and if '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is the contravariant (or reciprocal) basis at that point, then
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}f(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}~c^i = \left(\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}~\mathbf{b}^i\right)
   \left(c^i~\mathbf{b}_i\right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boldsymbol{\nabla}f(\mathbf{x}) = \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial q^i}~\mathbf{b}^i
 &lt;/math&gt;
A brief rationale for this choice of basis is given in the next section.

====Vector field====
A similar process can be used to arrive at the gradient of a vector field '''f'''('''x''').  The gradient is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   [\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})]\cdot\mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial q^i}~c^i
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we consider the gradient of the position vector field '''r'''('''x''') = '''x''', then we can show that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{c} = \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}~c^i = \mathbf{b}_i(\mathbf{x})~c^i ~;~~ \mathbf{b}_i(\mathbf{x}) := \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The vector field '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is tangent to the ''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' coordinate curve and forms a '''natural basis''' at each point on the curve.  This basis, as discussed at the beginning of this article, is also called the '''covariant''' curvilinear basis.  We can also define a '''reciprocal basis''', or '''contravariant''' curvilinear basis, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;.  All the algebraic relations between the basis vectors, as discussed in the section on tensor algebra, apply for the natural basis and its reciprocal at each point '''x'''.

Since '''c''' is arbitrary, we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial q^i}\otimes\mathbf{b}^i
 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the contravariant basis vector '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is perpendicular to the surface of constant ψ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}^i = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi^i
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Christoffel symbols of the first kind====
The [[Christoffel symbols]] of the first kind are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}_{i,j} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j} := \Gamma_{ijk}~\mathbf{b}^k \quad \Rightarrow \quad
   \mathbf{b}_{i,j} \cdot \mathbf{b}_l = \Gamma_{ijl}
&lt;/math&gt;
To express Γ&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' we note that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     g_{ij,k} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j)_{,k} = \mathbf{b}_{i,k}\cdot\mathbf{b}_j + \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_{j,k} 
        = \Gamma_{ikj} + \Gamma_{jki}\\
     g_{ik,j} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,j} = \mathbf{b}_{i,j}\cdot\mathbf{b}_k + \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_{k,j} 
        = \Gamma_{ijk} + \Gamma_{kji}\\
     g_{jk,i} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,i} = \mathbf{b}_{j,i}\cdot\mathbf{b}_k + \mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_{k,i}
        = \Gamma_{jik} + \Gamma_{kij} 
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i,j''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''j,i''&lt;/sub&gt; we have Γ&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; = Γ&lt;sub&gt;''jik''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Using these to rearrange the above relations gives
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{ijk} = \frac{1}{2}(g_{ik,j} + g_{jk,i} - g_{ij,k})
      = \frac{1}{2}[(\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,j} + (\mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,i} - (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j)_{,k}]
&lt;/math&gt;

====Christoffel symbols of the second kind====
The [[Christoffel symbol]]s of the second kind are defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{ij}^k = \Gamma_{ji}^k &lt;/math&gt;
in which

:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j} = \Gamma_{ij}^k~\mathbf{b}_k
 &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{ij}^k = \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j}\cdot\mathbf{b}^k = -\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}^k}{\partial q^j}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Other relations that follow are
:&lt;math&gt;
     \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}^i}{\partial q^j} = -\Gamma^i_{jk}~\mathbf{b}^k ~;~~
     \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{b}_i = \Gamma_{ij}^k~\mathbf{b}_k\otimes\mathbf{b}^j ~;~~
     \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{b}^i = -\Gamma_{jk}^i~\mathbf{b}^k\otimes\mathbf{b}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;

Another particularly useful relation, which shows that the Christoffel symbol depends only on the metric tensor and its derivatives, is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{g^{km}}{2}\left(\frac{\partial g_{mi}}{\partial q^j} + \frac{\partial g_{mj}}{\partial q^i} - \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial q^m} \right)
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Explicit expression for the gradient of a vector field====
The following expressions for the gradient of a vector field in curvilinear coordinates are quite useful.
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^k} + \Gamma^i_{lk}~v^l\right]~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^k \\[8pt]
    &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ki}~v_l\right]~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Representing a physical vector field====
The vector field '''v''' can be represented as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{v} = v_i~\mathbf{b}^i = \hat{v}_i~\hat{\mathbf{b}}^i 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; are the covariant components of the field, &lt;math&gt;\hat{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; are the physical components, and (no [[Einstein notation|summation]])
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{\mathbf{b}}^i = \cfrac{\mathbf{b}^i}{\sqrt{g^{ii}}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
is the normalized contravariant basis vector.

===Second-order tensor field===
The gradient of a second order tensor field can similarly be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{S} = \cfrac{\partial \boldsymbol{S}}{\partial q^i}\otimes\mathbf{b}^i
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Explicit expressions for the gradient====
If we consider the expression for the tensor in terms of a contravariant basis, then
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{S} = \cfrac{\partial}{\partial q^k}[S_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j]\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
   = \left[\cfrac{\partial S_{ij}}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ki}~S_{lj} - \Gamma^l_{kj}~S_{il}\right]~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
 &lt;/math&gt;
We may also write
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{S} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S^{ij}}{\partial q^k} + \Gamma^i_{kl}~S^{lj} + \Gamma^j_{kl}~S^{il}\right]~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S^i_{~j}}{\partial q^k} + \Gamma^i_{kl}~S^l_{~j} - \Gamma^l_{kj}~S^i_{~l}\right]~\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S_i^{~j}}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ik}~S_l^{~j} + \Gamma^j_{kl}~S_i^{~l}\right]~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Representing a physical second-order tensor field====
The physical components of a second-order tensor field can be obtained by using a normalized contravariant basis, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{S} = S_{ij}~\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j = \hat{S}_{ij}~\hat{\mathbf{b}}^i\otimes\hat{\mathbf{b}}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the hatted basis vectors have been normalized.  This implies that (again no summation)

:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{S}_{ij} = S_{ij}~\sqrt{g^{ii}~g^{jj}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence===

====Vector field====
The [[divergence]] of a vector field (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;)is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \operatorname{div}~\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v})
 &lt;/math&gt;
In terms of components with respect to a curvilinear basis
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \cfrac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} + \Gamma^i_{\ell i}~v^\ell
    = \left[\cfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial q^j} - \Gamma^\ell_{ji}~v_\ell\right]~g^{ij}
 &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative equation for the divergence of a vector field is frequently used.  To derive this relation recall that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} + \Gamma_{\ell i}^i~v^\ell
&lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \Gamma_{\ell i}^i = \Gamma_{i\ell}^i = \cfrac{g^{mi}}{2}\left[\frac{\partial g_{im}}{\partial q^\ell} + 
    \frac{\partial g_{\ell m}}{\partial q^i} - \frac{\partial g_{il}}{\partial q^m}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
Noting that, due to the symmetry of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{g}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
  g^{mi}~\frac{\partial g_{\ell m}}{\partial q^i}  = g^{mi}~ \frac{\partial g_{i\ell}}{\partial q^m}
&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} +  \cfrac{g^{mi}}{2}~\frac{\partial g_{im}}{\partial q^\ell}~v^\ell
&lt;/math&gt;
Recall that if [''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''] is the matrix whose components are ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the inverse of the matrix is &lt;math&gt;[g_{ij}]^{-1} = [g^{ij}]&lt;/math&gt;.  The inverse of the matrix is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   [g^{ij}] = [g_{ij}]^{-1} = \cfrac{A^{ij}}{g} ~;~~ g := \det([g_{ij}]) = \det\boldsymbol{g}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;'' are the [[Cofactor matrix]] of the components ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''.  From matrix algebra we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  g = \det([g_{ij}]) = \sum_i g_{ij}~A^{ij} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
  \frac{\partial g}{\partial g_{ij}} = A^{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
   [g^{ij}] = \cfrac{1}{g}~\frac{\partial g}{\partial g_{ij}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging this relation into the expression for the divergence gives
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} +  \cfrac{1}{2g}~\frac{\partial g}{\partial g_{mi}}~\frac{\partial g_{im}}{\partial q^\ell}~v^\ell = \frac{\partial v^i}{\partial q^i} +  \cfrac{1}{2g}~\frac{\partial g}{\partial q^\ell}~v^\ell
&lt;/math&gt;
A little manipulation leads to the more compact form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}~\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}(v^i~\sqrt{g})
&lt;/math&gt;

====Second-order tensor field====

The [[divergence]] of a second-order tensor field is defined using
:&lt;math&gt;
   (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{S})\cdot\mathbf{a} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot(\boldsymbol{S}\cdot\mathbf{a})
 &lt;/math&gt;
where '''a''' is an arbitrary constant vector.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Elasticity/Tensors#The_divergence_of_a_tensor_field | publisher=[[Wikiversity]] | work=Introduction to Elasticity/Tensors | title=The divergence of a tensor field | accessdate=2010-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In curvilinear coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{S} &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S_{ij}}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ki}~S_{lj} - \Gamma^l_{kj}~S_{il}\right]~g^{ik}~\mathbf{b}^j \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S^{ij}}{\partial q^i} + \Gamma^i_{il}~S^{lj} + \Gamma^j_{il}~S^{il}\right]~\mathbf{b}_j \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S^i_{~j}}{\partial q^i} + \Gamma^i_{il}~S^l_{~j} - \Gamma^l_{ij}~S^i_{~l}\right]~\mathbf{b}^j \\[8pt]
   &amp; = \left[\cfrac{\partial S_i^{~j}}{\partial q^k} - \Gamma^l_{ik}~S_l^{~j} + \Gamma^j_{kl}~S_i^{~l}\right]~g^{ik}~\mathbf{b}_j
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Laplacian ===

====Scalar field====
The Laplacian of a scalar field φ('''x''') is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla^2 \varphi := \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi)
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the alternative expression for the divergence of a vector field gives us
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla^2 \varphi =  \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}~\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}([\boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi]^i~\sqrt{g})
&lt;/math&gt;
Now
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l}~\mathbf{b}^l = g^{li}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l}~\mathbf{b}_i
  \quad \Rightarrow \quad
  [\boldsymbol{\nabla} \varphi]^i = g^{li}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla^2 \varphi =  \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{g}}~\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}\left(g^{li}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l}
~\sqrt{g}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

===Curl of a vector field===
The curl of a vector field '''v''' in covariant curvilinear coordinates can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{v} = \mathcal{E}^{rst} v_{s|r}~ \mathbf{b}_t
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
   v_{s|r} = v_{s,r} - \Gamma^i_{sr}~v_i
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Orthogonal curvilinear coordinates==
Assume, for the purposes of this section, that the curvilinear coordinate system is [[orthogonal]], i.e.,
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j = 
   \begin{cases} g_{ii} &amp; \text{if } i = j \\
                0 &amp; \text{if } i \ne j,
   \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently,
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}^i\cdot\mathbf{b}^j = 
   \begin{cases} g^{ii} &amp; \text{if } i = j \\
                0 &amp; \text{if } i \ne j,
   \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g^{ii} = g_{ii}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. As before, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_i, \mathbf{b}_j&lt;/math&gt; are covariant basis vectors and '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; are contravariant basis vectors.  Also, let ('''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) be a background, fixed, [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] basis.  A list of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates is given below.

===Metric tensor in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates===
{{Main article|Metric tensor}}

Let '''r'''('''x''') be the [[position vector]] of the point '''x''' with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.  The notation can be simplified by noting that '''x''' = '''r'''('''x''').  At each point we can construct a small line element d'''x'''.  The square of the length of the line element is the scalar product d'''x''' • d'''x''' and is called the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] of the [[space]].  Recall that the space of interest is assumed to be [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] when we talk of curvilinear coordinates. Let us express the position vector in terms of the background, fixed, Cartesian basis, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^3 x_i~\mathbf{e}_i
 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[chain rule]], we can then express d'''x''' in terms of three-dimensional orthogonal curvilinear coordinates (''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \left(\cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^j}~\mathbf{e}_i\right)\mathrm{d}q^j
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the metric is given by
:&lt;math&gt; 
  \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \sum_{k=1}^3 \cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^j}~\cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^k}~\mathrm{d}q^j~\mathrm{d}q^k
 &lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric quantity
:&lt;math&gt;
  g_{ij}(q^i,q^j) = \sum_{k=1}^3 \cfrac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^i}~\cfrac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^j} = \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j
&lt;/math&gt;
is called the [[metric tensor|fundamental (or metric) tensor]] of the [[Euclidean space]] in curvilinear coordinates.

Note also that
:&lt;math&gt;
   g_{ij} = \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}\cdot\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^j}
          = \left(\sum_{k} h_{ki}~\mathbf{e}_k\right)\cdot\left(\sum_{m} h_{mj}~\mathbf{e}_m\right)
          = \sum_{k} h_{ki}~h_{kj}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''h&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the Lamé coefficients.

If we define the scale factors, ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',  using
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = g_{ii} = \sum_{k} h_{ki}^2 =: h_i^2
   \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left|\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}\right| = \left|\mathbf{b}_i\right| = \sqrt{g_{ii}} = h_i
 &lt;/math&gt;
we get a relation between the fundamental tensor and the Lamé coefficients.

====Example: Polar coordinates====
If we consider polar coordinates for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, note that
: &lt;math&gt; (x, y)=(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
(r, θ) are the curvilinear coordinates, and the Jacobian determinant of the transformation (''r'',θ) → (''r'' cos θ, ''r'' sin θ) is ''r''.

The [[orthogonal]] basis vectors are '''''b'''''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = (cos θ, sin θ), '''''b'''''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; = (−''r'' sin θ, ''r'' cos θ).  The normalized basis vectors are '''''e'''''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = (cos θ, sin θ), '''''e'''''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; = (−sin θ, cos θ) and the scale factors are ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;= ''r''. The fundamental tensor is ''g''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; =1, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; =''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; =0.

===Line and surface integrals===
If we wish to use curvilinear coordinates for [[vector calculus]] calculations, adjustments need to be made in the calculation of line, surface and volume integrals.  For simplicity, we again restrict the discussion to three dimensions and orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.  However, the same arguments apply for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional problems though there are some additional terms in the expressions when the coordinate system is not orthogonal.

====Line integrals====
Normally in the calculation of [[line integral]]s we are interested in calculating
: &lt;math&gt; \int_C f \,ds = \int_a^b f(\mathbf{x}(t))\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right|\; dt&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''x'''''(''t'') parametrizes C in Cartesian coordinates.
In curvilinear coordinates, the term
: &lt;math&gt; \left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| = \left| \sum_{i=1}^3 {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i}{\partial q^i \over \partial t}\right|&lt;/math&gt;
by the [[chain rule]].  And from the definition of the Lamé coefficients,
: &lt;math&gt; {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i} = \sum_{k} h_{ki}~ \mathbf{e}_{k} &lt;/math&gt;
and thus
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| &amp; = \left| \sum_k\left(\sum_i h_{ki}~\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\right)\mathbf{e}_k\right| \\[8pt]
&amp; = \sqrt{\sum_i\sum_j\sum_k h_{ki}~h_{kj}\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial t}} = \sqrt{\sum_i\sum_j g_{ij}~\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial t}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Now, since &lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = 0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt; i \ne j &lt;/math&gt;, we have
: &lt;math&gt; 
\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| =  \sqrt{\sum_i g_{ii}~\left(\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_i h_{i}^2~\left(\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial t}\right)^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;
and we can proceed normally.

====Surface integrals====
Likewise, if we are interested in a [[surface integral]], the relevant calculation, with the parameterization of the surface in Cartesian coordinates is:
: &lt;math&gt;\int_S f \,dS = \iint_T f(\mathbf{x}(s, t)) \left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial s}\times {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| \, ds \, dt&lt;/math&gt;
Again, in curvilinear coordinates, we have
: &lt;math&gt;
\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial s}\times {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right| = \left|\left(\sum_i {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i}{\partial q^i \over \partial s}\right) \times \left(\sum_j {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^j}{\partial q^j \over \partial t}\right)\right|
&lt;/math&gt;
and we make use of the definition of curvilinear coordinates again to yield
: &lt;math&gt;
{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i}{\partial q^i \over \partial s} = \sum_k \left(\sum_{i=1}^3 h_{ki}~{\partial q^i \over \partial s}\right) \mathbf{e}_k ~;~~ 
{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^j}{\partial q^j \over \partial t} = \sum_m \left(\sum_{j=1}^3 h_{mj}~{\partial q^j \over \partial t}\right) \mathbf{e}_{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
\left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial s}\times {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial t}\right|
  &amp; = \left|
     \sum_k \sum_m \left(\sum_{i=1}^3 h_{ki}~{\partial q^i \over \partial s}\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^3 h_{mj}~{\partial q^j \over \partial t}\right) \mathbf{e}_k\times\mathbf{e}_m
    \right| \\[8pt]
  &amp; = \left|\sum_p \sum_k \sum_m \mathcal{E}_{kmp}\left(\sum_{i=1}^3 h_{ki}~{\partial q^i \over \partial s}\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^3 h_{mj}~{\partial q^j \over \partial t}\right) \mathbf{e}_p \right|
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]].

In determinant form,  the cross product in terms of curvilinear coordinates will be:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} 
\mathbf{e}_1                    &amp; \mathbf{e}_2                    &amp; \mathbf{e}_3 \\
 &amp;&amp; \\
\sum_i h_{1i} {\partial q^i \over \partial s} &amp; \sum_i h_{2i} {\partial q^i \over \partial s} &amp; \sum_i h_{3i} {\partial q^i \over \partial s} \\
&amp;&amp; \\
\sum_j h_{1j} {\partial q^j \over \partial t} &amp; \sum_j h_{2j} {\partial q^j \over \partial t} &amp; \sum_j h_{3j} {\partial q^j \over \partial t} \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Grad, curl, div, Laplacian===

In [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] curvilinear coordinates of 3 dimensions, where
: &lt;math&gt;
        \mathbf{b}^i = \sum_k g^{ik}~\mathbf{b}_k ~;~~ g^{ii} = \cfrac{1}{g_{ii}} = \cfrac{1}{h_i^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
one can express the [[gradient]] of a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] or [[vector field]] as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \nabla\varphi = \sum_{i} {\partial\varphi \over \partial q^i}~ \mathbf{b}^i = \sum_{i} \sum_j {\partial\varphi \over \partial q^i}~ g^{ij}~\mathbf{b}_j = \sum_i \cfrac{1}{h_i^2}~{\partial f \over \partial q^i}~\mathbf{b}_i ~;~~
   \nabla\mathbf{v} = \sum_i \cfrac{1}{h_i^2}~{\partial \mathbf{v} \over \partial q^i}\otimes\mathbf{b}_i
 &lt;/math&gt;
For an orthogonal basis
:&lt;math&gt;
   g = g_{11}~g_{22}~g_{33} = h_1^2~h_2^2~h_3^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{g} = h_1 h_2 h_3
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[divergence]] of a vector field can then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cfrac{1}{h_1 h_2 h_3}~\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}(h_1 h_2 h_3~v^i)
&lt;/math&gt;
Also,
:&lt;math&gt;
  v^i = g^{ik}~v_k \quad \Rightarrow v^1 = g^{11}~v_1 = \cfrac{v_1}{h_1^2} ~;~~ v^2 = g^{22}~v_2  = \cfrac{v_2}{h_2^2}~;~~ v^3 = g^{33}~v_3 = \cfrac{v_3}{h_3^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cfrac{1}{h_1 h_2 h_3}~\sum_i \frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}\left(\cfrac{h_1 h_2 h_3}{h_i^2}~v_i\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
We can get an expression for the [[Laplacian]] in a similar manner by noting that
:&lt;math&gt;
  g^{li}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^l} = 
   \left\{ g^{11}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^1}, g^{22}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^2}, 
    g^{33}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^3} \right\} = 
   \left\{ \cfrac{1}{h_1^2}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^1}, \cfrac{1}{h_2^2}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^2}, 
    \cfrac{1}{h_3^2}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^3} \right\} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Then we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla^2 \varphi =  \cfrac{1}{h_1 h_2 h_3}~\sum_i\frac{\partial }{\partial q^i}\left(\cfrac{h_1 h_2 h_3}{h_i^2}~\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial q^i}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
The expressions for the gradient, divergence, and Laplacian can be directly extended to ''n''-dimensions.

The [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] is given by
: &lt;math&gt; 
     \nabla\times\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{h_1h_2h_3} \sum_{i=1}^n  \mathbf{e}_i
\sum_{jk} \varepsilon_{ijk} h_i \frac{\partial (h_k v_k)}{\partial q^j}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ε&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]].

==Example: Cylindrical polar coordinates==
For [[cylindrical coordinate]]s we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   (x_1, x_2, x_3) = \mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(q^1, q^2, q^3) = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(r, \theta, z)
     = \{r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta, z\}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \{\psi^1(\mathbf{x}), \psi^2(\mathbf{x}), \psi^3(\mathbf{x})\} = (q^1, q^2, q^3) \equiv (r, \theta, z) 
   = \{ \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}, \tan^{-1}(x_2/x_1), x_3\}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
0 &lt; r &lt; \infty ~, ~~ 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 2\pi ~,~~ -\infty &lt; z &lt; \infty
 &lt;/math&gt;

Then the covariant and contravariant basis vectors are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  \mathbf{b}_1 &amp; = \mathbf{e}_r = \mathbf{b}^1 \\
  \mathbf{b}_2 &amp; = r~\mathbf{e}_\theta = r^2~\mathbf{b}^2 \\
  \mathbf{b}_3 &amp; = \mathbf{e}_z = \mathbf{b}^3
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_r, \mathbf{e}_\theta, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; are the unit vectors in the &lt;math&gt;r, \theta, z&lt;/math&gt; directions.

Note that the components of the metric tensor are such that
:&lt;math&gt;
    g^{ij} = g_{ij} = 0 (i \ne j) ~;~~ \sqrt{g^{11}} = 1,~\sqrt{g^{22}} = \cfrac{1}{r},~\sqrt{g^{33}}=1
 &lt;/math&gt;
which shows that the basis is orthogonal.

The non-zero components of the Christoffel symbol of the second kind are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{12}^2 = \Gamma_{21}^2 = \cfrac{1}{r} ~;~~ \Gamma_{22}^1 = -r
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Representing a physical vector field===
The normalized contravariant basis vectors in cylindrical polar coordinates are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{\mathbf{b}}^1 = \mathbf{e}_r ~;~~\hat{\mathbf{b}}^2 = \mathbf{e}_\theta ~;~~\hat{\mathbf{b}}^3 = \mathbf{e}_z
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the physical components of a vector '''v''' are
:&lt;math&gt;
   (\hat{v}_1, \hat{v}_2, \hat{v}_3) = (v_1, v_2/r, v_3) =: (v_r, v_\theta, v_z)
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Gradient of a scalar field===
The gradient of a scalar field, ''f''('''x'''), in cylindrical coordinates can now be computed from the general expression in curvilinear coordinates and has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}f = \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta +  \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Gradient of a vector field===
Similarly, the gradient of a vector field, '''v'''('''x'''), in cylindrical coordinates can be shown to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial \theta} - v_\theta\right)~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_r \right)~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z
   \end{align} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence of a vector field===
Using the equation for the divergence of a vector field in curvilinear coordinates, the divergence in cylindrical coordinates can be shown to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial r} + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_r \right)
 + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}
   \end{align} 
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Laplacian of a scalar field===
The Laplacian is more easily computed by noting that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 f = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}f&lt;/math&gt;.  In cylindrical polar coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}f = \left[v_r~~ v_\theta~~ v_z\right] = \left[\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial r}~~  \cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}~~ \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 f = \cfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial r^2} + 
     \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial^2f}{\partial \theta^2} + \cfrac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right)
 + \cfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}
   = \cfrac{1}{r}\left[\cfrac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\cfrac{\partial f}{\partial r}\right)\right] + \cfrac{1}{r^2}\cfrac{\partial^2f}{\partial \theta^2} + \cfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Representing a physical second-order tensor field===
The physical components of a second-order tensor field are those obtained when the tensor is expressed in terms of a normalized contravariant basis.  In cylindrical polar coordinates these components are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   \hat{S}_{11} &amp; = S_{11} =: S_{rr} ~;~~\hat{S}_{12} = \cfrac{S_{12}}{r} =: S_{r\theta} ~;~~ \hat{S}_{13} &amp; = S_{13} =: S_{rz} \\
    \hat{S}_{21} &amp; = \cfrac{S_{11}}{r} =: S_{\theta r} ~;~~\hat{S}_{22} = \cfrac{S_{22}}{r^2} =: S_{\theta\theta} ~;~~ \hat{S}_{23} &amp; = \cfrac{S_{23}}{r} =: S_{\theta z} \\
    \hat{S}_{31} &amp; = S_{31} =: S_{zr} ~;~~\hat{S}_{32} = \cfrac{S_{32}}{r} =: S_{z\theta} ~;~~ \hat{S}_{33} &amp; = S_{33} =: S_{zz}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Gradient of a second-order tensor field===
Using the above definitions we can show that the gradient of a second-order tensor field in cylindrical polar coordinates can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{S} &amp; = \frac{\partial S_{rr}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{rr}}{\partial \theta} - (S_{\theta r}+S_{r\theta})\right]~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{rr}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{r\theta}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{r\theta}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{rr}-S_{\theta\theta})\right]~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{r\theta}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{rz}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{rz}}{\partial \theta} -S_{\theta z}\right]~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{rz}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{\theta r}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta r}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{rr}-S_{\theta\theta})\right]~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{\theta r}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{\theta\theta}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta\theta}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{r\theta}+S_{\theta r})\right]~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{\theta\theta}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{\theta z}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta z}}{\partial \theta} + S_{rz}\right]~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{\theta z}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{zr}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{zr}}{\partial \theta} - S_{z\theta}\right]~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{zr}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{z\theta}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{z\theta}}{\partial \theta} + S_{zr}\right]~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{z\theta}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta\otimes\mathbf{e}_z \\[8pt]
 &amp; + \frac{\partial S_{zz}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_r +
\cfrac{1}{r}~\frac{\partial S_{zz}}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{zz}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z\otimes\mathbf{e}_z
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence of a second-order tensor field===
The divergence of a second-order tensor field in cylindrical polar coordinates can be obtained from the expression for the gradient by collecting terms where the scalar product of the two outer vectors in the dyadic products is nonzero.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \boldsymbol{S} &amp; = \frac{\partial S_{rr}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r 
   + \frac{\partial S_{r\theta}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_\theta
   + \frac{\partial S_{rz}}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_z  \\[8pt]
 &amp;  + \cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta r}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{rr}-S_{\theta\theta})\right]~\mathbf{e}_r  +
\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta\theta}}{\partial \theta} + (S_{r\theta}+S_{\theta r})\right]~\mathbf{e}_\theta   +\cfrac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial S_{\theta z}}{\partial \theta} + S_{rz}\right]~\mathbf{e}_z  \\[8pt]
 &amp;  +
\frac{\partial S_{zr}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_r +
\frac{\partial S_{z\theta}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_\theta +
\frac{\partial S_{zz}}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28561">Due to the convenience, affordability, and broad reach of [[social media]] platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], [[terrorist]] groups have increasingly used social media to further their goals and spread their message. Attempts have been made by various governments and agencies to thwart the use of social media by terrorist organizations.

==Traditional media==

Many authors have proposed that media attention increases perceptions of risk of fear of terrorism and crime and relates to how much attention the person pays to the news.&lt;ref&gt;Nellis and Savage (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between terrorism and the media has long been noted.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Paul|title=The media and terrorism:  a reassessment|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|year=1997|volume=9|issue=2|pages=51–64|doi=10.1080/09546559708427402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist organizations depend on the open media systems of democratic countries to further their message and goals.In order to garner publicity towards their cause, terrorist organizations resort to acts of violence and aggression that deliberately target civilians.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt; This method has proven to be effective in gathering attention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot be denied that although terrorism has proved remarkably ineffective as the major weapon for taking down governments and capturing political power, it has been a remarkably successful means of publicizing a political cause and relaying the terrorist threat to a wider audience, particularly in the open and pluralistic countries of the West. When one says 'terrorism' in a democratic society, one also says 'media'.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While a media organization may not support the goals of terrorist organizations, it is their job to report current events and issues. In the fiercely competitive media environment, when a terrorist attack occurs, media outlets scramble to cover the event. In doing so the media help to further the message of terrorist organizations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To summarise briefly on the symbiotic nature of the relationship between terrorists and the media, the recent history of terrorism in many democratic countries vividly demonstrates that terrorists do thrive on the oxygen of publicity, and it is foolish to deny this. This does not mean that the established democratic media share the values of the terrorists. It does demonstrate, however, that the free media in an open society are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation by ruthless terrorist organisations.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One notable example of the  relationship between terror groups and the media was the release of the [[Osama bin Laden tapes|Osama bin Laden audio and video recordings]].  These tapes were sent directly to mainstream Arabic television networks including [[Al-Jazeera]].

Media can often be the source of discontent for terrorist groups. [[Irene Khan|Irene Kahn]] says,&lt;blockquote&gt;New seeds of social discord and insecurity are sprouting between citizens and noncitizens. Racism and xenophobia are latent in all societies, but in some European countries they feature blatantly as some politicians exploit people's fears and prejudices for short-term electoral gains. Some aspects of the media have played into this strategy, dehumanizing and demonizing foreigners, foreign-born citizens, refugees, and asylum seekers. They are pointed out as a source of danger and become an easy target for hate speech and violence. Those who need their rights protected the most have become the ones most at risk of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, I. (2013). A Human Rights Agenda for Global Security. In CAHILL K. (Ed.), ''History and Hope: The International Humanitarian Reader'' (pp. 112-122). Fordham University Press. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c1d.15&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Most terrorist groups use social media as a means to bypass the traditional media and spread their propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2016.1157402&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media surveillance==

[[Michel Foucault]]'s theory of surveillance, [[panopticism]], describes a networks of power, where all parties are transfixed by the actions of the others in the network. This model can be transposed on the network of power that media-outlet consumers and producers enter. In a network of power that includes consumers and producers, both parties have fixed gazes' on each other. The consumers transfix their gazes' on the stories that media outlets produce. And, the needs of the consumers, which is in this case their need to be updated regularly, becomes the producers gaze. The producers or media outlets are in competition with other media outlets to supply their constituents with the most up-to-date information. This network of fixed gazes' is both "privileged and imperative" for the system to satisfy the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmelzer|first=Mary|title=Panopticism in the Postmodern Pedagogy|year=1993|publisher=University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State UP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This network is especially imperative when major events in the world occur, which is usually the case with terrorism. Consumers looks to media outlets to provide news on terrorism. If consumers believe terrorism is a threat to their safety, they want to be informed of the threats against them. Media outlets fulfill their viewers' needs, and portray terrorism as a threat because of the cycle that surveillance engenders. As terrorism flourishes as a prominent discourse of fear, consumers want information faster because they feel their safe being is in peril. The idea of total surveillance, as prescribed by Foucault, becomes a cycle where the disruption of power causes scrutiny by various players in system. If the media-outlets are not constantly looking for stories that fulfill consumer needs, then they are scrutinized. In addition to the surveillance aspect of news dissemination, therein is the notion that "needs" drive the network of power: both the media outlets and consumers have needs that are fulfilled by broadcasting the news. It is this idea expressed in the uses and gratifications theory. It stipulates that the active audience and the terrorist "seek to satisfy their various needs" through media transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=B.|title=Inside Terrorism|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; While media outlets know the stories they show have astounding effects on the political and sociological perspective in society, the impetus on economic gains is of greater importance.

==Use of social media==
In a study by [[Gabriel Weimann]] from the [[University of Haifa]], Weimann found that nearly 90% of organized terrorism on the internet takes place via social media.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|last=CBC|title=Terrorist groups recruiting through social media|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/01/10/tech-terrorist-social-media.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=CBC News|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weimann, terror groups use social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and internet forums to spread their messages, recruit members and gather intelligence.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt;

Terror groups take to social media because social media tools are cheap and accessible, facilitate quick, broad dissemination of messages, and allow for unfettered communication with an audience without the filter or "selectivity" of mainstream news outlets.&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dark|first=Calvin|title=Social Media and Social Menacing…|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2011/12/20/social-media-and-social-menacing/|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Foreign Policy Association|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, social media platforms allow terror groups to engage with their networks. Whereas previously terror groups would release messages via intermediaries, social media platforms allow terror groups to release messages directly to their intended audience and converse with their audience in real time:&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Oremus|first=Will|title=Twitter of Terror|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technocracy/2011/12/al_shabaab_twitter_a_somali_militant_group_unveils_a_new_social_media_strategy_for_terrorists_.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Slate Magazine|date=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weimann also mentions in "Theater of Terror", that terrorists use the media to promote the theatrical like nature of the premeditated terror.

&lt;blockquote&gt;HSMPress is using Twitter the way social media experts have always advised- not just broadcasting, but engaging in conversation. Spend some time following the account, and you realize that you're dealing with a real human being with real ideas—albeit boastful, hypocritical, violent ideas.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Terror groups using social media===

[[Al-Qaeda]] has been noted as being one of the terror groups that uses social media the most extensively.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Brian|title=Is Al Qaeda's Internet Strategy Working?|url=http://homeland.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-jihadist-use-social-media-how-prevent-terrorism-and-preserve-innovation|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Jenkins, senior advisor for the [[Rand Corporation]], commented on Al-Qaeda's dominant presence on the web:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While almost all terrorist organizations have websites, al Qaeda is the first to fully exploit the internet. This reflects al Qaeda's unique characteristics.  It regards itself as a global movement and therefore depends on a global communications network to reach its perceived constituents. It sees its mission as not simply creating terror among its foes but awakening the Muslim community. Its leaders view communications as 90 percent of the struggle. Despite the risks imposed by intense manhunts, its leaders communicate regularly with video and audio messages, which are posted on its websites and disseminated on the Internet. The number of websites devoted to the al Qaeda-inspired movement has grown from a handful to reportedly thousands, although many of these are ephemeral.&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Isis-viceo 2941899c.jpg|thumb|Islamic State Propaganda Video]]
Known terrorist group the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], also translated to [[ISIS]], uses the widespread of news over social media to their advantage when releasing threatening videos of beheadings. As of November 16, 2014, following the beheading of former [[U.S. Army Ranger]] [[Peter Kassig]], there have now been five recorded executions of Westerners taken captive in Syria.&lt;ref name="markthompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3589350/peter-kassigs-powerful-silence-before-isis-beheaded-him/|title=Peter Kassig Bravely Said Nothing Before His Execution|author=Mark Thompson|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]], [[David Cawthorne Haines]], [[Alan Henning]], and [[Steven Sotloff]] are also among the men kidnapped and executed by ISIS. The videos of the brutal beheadings are both posted online by ISIS, where they can be viewed by anyone using their own discretion, and sent to government officials as threats. Posting the executions online allows the terrorist groups the power to manipulate and cause havoc among the population viewing them,&lt;ref&gt;http://numun.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BOP-Syria-Committee-Dossier.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the videos have the ability to instill fear within the Western world. The videos are typically high production quality and generally show the entirety of the gruesome act, with the hostage speaking a few words before they are killed on camera.

In the case of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig, his video did not show the actual beheading act and he did not speak any final words before the execution.&lt;ref name="markthompson"/&gt; His silence and the fact that the actual execution was not included in the video raised question about his video was different than the rest.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;http://time.com/3587620/isis-us-aid-worker-peter-kassig/?xid=time_readnext&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Kassig's beheading, his family expressed their wish that news media avoid doing what the group wants by refraining from publishing or distributing the video.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; By refusing to circulate the video of the beheading, it therefore loses the ability to manipulate Americans or further the cause of the terrorist group.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;
   
The [[Taliban]] has been active on Twitter since May 2011, and has more than 7,000 followers. Tweeting under the handle @alemarahweb, the Taliban tweets frequently, on some days nearly hourly. This account is currently suspended.&lt;ref name=taliban&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=Twitter page of the Taliban|url=https://twitter.com/alemarahweb|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In December 2011, it was discovered that the [[Somalia]]-based terror cell [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabab]] was using a Twitter account under the name @HSMPress.&lt;ref name=shabab&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=Twitter page of Al-Shabab|url=https://twitter.com/HSMPress|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since opening on December 7, 2011, the account has amassed tens of thousands of followers and tweets frequently.&lt;ref name=shabab/&gt;

Shortly after a series of coordinated [[Christmas]] bombings in [[Kono, Nigeria|Kono]], [[Nigeria]], in 2011, the Nigerian-based terror group Boko Haram released a video statement defending their actions to YouTube.&lt;ref name="Boko Haram"&gt;{{cite web|author=BBC|title=Boko Haram: Nigerian Islamist leader defends attacks|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16510929|publisher=BBC|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AQAP and Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/DAESH)'''

[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] has emerged as one of the most potent users of social media. In many respects, Islamic State learned their propaganda craft from al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). However, IS quickly eclipsed its mentor, deploying a whole range of narratives, images and political proselytizing through various social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jeff Lewis (2015/6) Media, Culture and Human Violence, Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Berger and Morgan estimated that at least 46,000 Twitter accounts were used by ISIS supporters between September and December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/03/isis-twitter-census-berger-morgan|title=Defining and describing the population of ISIS supporters on Twitter|last=Berger, Morgan|date=2015-03-05|website=The Brookings Institution|language=en|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as ISIS supporters regularly get suspended and then easily create new, duplicate accounts,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; counting ISIS Twitter accounts over a few months can overestimate the number of unique people represented by 20–30%.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

However, as the November 2015 attacks in Paris demonstrate, IS also uses old-fashioned methods of communication and propaganda. Lewis notes that the attacks in Paris represent the sort of 'propaganda in action' which was a method developed by the 19th century [[anarchists]] in Europe. The November 2015 IS attacks were perpetrated without prior warning, largely because the operatives met face-to-face and used other non-digital means of communication.

==Attempts to thwart the use of social media by terror groups==
Some U.S. government officials have urged social media companies to stop hosting content from terror groups.  In particular, [[Joe Lieberman]] has been especially vocal in demanding that social media companies not permit terror groups to use their tools.&lt;ref name=Liberman&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Lieberman, Would-Be Censor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/opinion/25sun1.html?_r=2|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Lieberman and the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] issued a report titled "Violent Islamist Extremism, the Internet, and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat". The report stated that the internet is one of the "primary drivers" of the terrorist threat to the United States.&lt;ref name=Liberman/&gt;
  
In response to the news that Al-Shabab was using Twitter, U.S. officials have called for the company to shut down the account. Twitter executives have not complied with these demands and have declined to comment on the case.&lt;ref name=FP&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Uri|title=U.S. officials may take action again al-Shabab's Twitter account|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/12/20/us_officials_may_take_action_again_al_shababs_twitter_account|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Twitter announced changes to their censorship policy, stating that they would now be censoring tweets in certain countries when the tweets risked breaking the local laws of that country.&lt;ref name=twitter&gt;{{cite web|title=Tweets still must flow|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2012/01/tweets-still-must-flow.html|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind the move was stated on their website as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we continue to grow internationally, we will enter countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression. Some differ so much from our ideas that we will not be able to exist there. Others are similar but, for historical or cultural reasons, restrict certain types of content, such as France or Germany, which ban pro-Nazi content.Until now, the only way we could take account of those countries' limits was to remove content globally. Starting today, we give ourselves the ability to reactively withhold content from users in a specific country — while keeping it available in the rest of the world. We have also built in a way to communicate transparently to users when content is withheld, and why.&lt;ref name=twitter/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The move drew criticism from many Twitter users who said the move was an affront to free speech.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web|last=El Akkad|first=Omar|title=Why Twitter's censorship plan is better than you think|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/digital-culture/social-networking/why-twitters-censorship-plan-is-better-than-you-think/article2320773/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the users threatened to quit tweeting if the policy was not rescinded, including Chinese artist and activist [[Ai Weiwei]].&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

In December 2010, in response to growing demands that YouTube pull video content from terrorist groups from its servers, the company added a "promotes terrorism" option under the "violent or repulsive content" category that viewers can select to "flag" offensive content.&lt;ref name=Huffpo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanalley|first=Craig|title=YouTube Gives Users Ability To Flag Content That Promotes Terrorism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/13/youtube-terrorism-flag_n_796128.html|accessdate=April 5, 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By limiting the terrorists access to conventional mass media and censoring news coverage of terrorist acts and their perpertrators and also minimising the terrorists allowance to manipulate mass media, the mass fear impact that is usually created will decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Weimann,1999&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Effectiveness of suspension ===
Western governments have been actively trying to surveil and censor IS social media sites. As [[Jeff Lewis (professor)|Jeff Lewis]] explains, as quickly as platform managers close down accounts, IS and its supporters continually create new IDs which they then use to resurge back with new accounts and sites for propaganda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A case study of an al Shabaab account&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ISIS: The state of terror.|last=Stern, Berger|first=|publisher=William Collins|year=2015|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[George Washington University]] [[white paper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger, Perez|first=|date=2016|title=Occasional Paper The Islamic State's Diminishing Returns on Twitter How suspensions are limiting the social networks of English-speaking ISIS supporters.|url=https://cchs.gwu.edu/sites/cchs.gwu.edu/files/downloads/Berger_Occasional%20Paper.pdf|journal=GW Program on Extremism|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that accounts that resurged did not regain the high number of followers they had had originally. However this picture is complicated as a May 2016 article in the Journal of Terrorism Research found that resurgent accounts acquire an average ([[median]]) of 43.8 followers per day, while regular jihadist accounts accrue only 8.37 followers on average per day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Shaun|last2=Denney|first2=David|last3=Pinkerton|first3=Alasdair|last4=Jansen|first4=Vincent A.A.|last5=Bryden|first5=John|date=2016-05-17|title=Resurgent Insurgents: Quantitative Research Into Jihadists Who Get Suspended but Return on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.15664/jtr.1213|journal=Journal of Terrorism Research|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.15664/jtr.1213|issn=2049-7040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free speech and terrorism ===
U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, has said that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to terrorists and that they have given up their rights to free speech. He cited a Supreme Court ruling that anyone providing "material support" to a terrorist organization is guilty of a crime, even if that support only involves speaking and association. He also cited terrorist speech as being like child pornography in that it does harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISIS getting social media megaphone (Opinion) - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/25/opinion/poe-terrorism-social-media/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeland security subcommittee==
On December 6, 2011 the US Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence held a hearing entitled "Jihadist Use of Social Media - How to Prevent Terrorism and Preserve Innovation."

At the hearing, members heard testimony from [[William McCants]], an analyst for the Center for Naval Analyses, Aaron Weisburd, director of the [[Society for Internet Research]], Brian Jenkins, senior advisor for the Rand Corporation and Evan Kohlmann, senior partner from [[Flashpoint Global Partners]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins/&gt;
  
McCants stated that while terror groups were actively using social media platforms to further their goals, research did not support the notion that the social media strategies they adopted were proving effective:&lt;ref name=McCants&gt;{{cite web|last=McCants|first=William|title=McCants Testimony|url=https://homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20McCants.pdf|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are talking about a relatively small number of people.  Because the number of people is so small, it is difficult to say why some become active supporters of al-Qaeda and others do not. What we can say is that the vast majority of people who watch and read al-Qaeda propaganda will never act violently because of it.  Put metaphorically, the material may be incendiary but nearly everyone is fireproof.  Since that is the case, it is better to spend our resources putting out the fires and issuing warnings about the dangers of fire rather than trying to fireproof everyone or remove incendiary material.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
McCants added that he did not believe that closing online user accounts would  be effective in stopping radicalization and stated that closing online accounts could even disadvantage US security and intelligence forces:&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;  
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not put much stock in closing online user accounts that do not violate our laws.  I also do not put much stock in intervening with well-meaning outreach programs or removing propaganda.  There are too many downsides to these approaches.  They are also unnecessary.  The FBI and local law enforcement in the United States have done an excellent job in finding al-Qaeda supporters online and arresting them before they hurt anyone.  They have gotten very good at following the smoke trails and putting out fires.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCants stressed that not enough research has been conducted on this topic and he would be willing to change his opinion on the matter if there was empirical evidence that proved that social media has a major role in radicalizing youth.&lt;ref name=McCants/&gt;

Weisburd stated that any organization that played a part in producing and distributing media for terrorist organizations were in fact supporting terrorism:&lt;ref name=Weisburd&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisburd|first=Aaron|title=How to Prevent Terrorism and Preserve Innovation|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Weisburd%20testimony.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would argue that a service provider who knowingly assists in the distribution of terrorist media is also culpable.  While it is in no one's interest to prosecute internet service providers, they must be made to realize that they can neither turn a blind eye to the use of their services by terrorist organizations, nor can they continue to put the onus of identifying and removing terrorist media on private citizens.&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Weisburd argued that social media lends an air of legitimacy to content produced by terror organizations and provides terrorist organizations an opportunity to brand their content: "Branding in terrorist media is a sign of authenticity, and terrorist media is readily identifiable as such due to the presence of trademarks known to be associated with particular organizations."&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt; He concluded that the goal of intelligence and security forces should not be to drive all terrorist media offline, but rather to deprive terror groups from the branding power gleaned from social media.&lt;ref name=Weisburd/&gt;  
 
Jenkins stated that the risks associated with al Qaeda's online campaign do not justify an attempt to impose controls on content distributors.  Any attempted controls would be costly and would deprive the intelligence officials of a valuable source of information.&lt;ref name="Jenkinstwo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Brian|title=Is Al Qaeda's Internet Strategy Working?|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20Jenkins%20.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins also stated that there was no evidence that attempts to control online content would be possible:&lt;ref name=Jenkinstwo/&gt;  
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even China, which has devoted immense resources to controlling social media networks with far fewer concerns about freedom of speech, has been unable to block the micro blogs that flourish on the web.  Faced with the shutdown of one site, jihadist communicators merely change names and move to another, dragging authorities into a frustrating game of Whac-a-mole and depriving them of intelligence while they look for the new site.  Is this, then the best way to address the problem?"&lt;ref name=Jenkinstwo/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Kohlmann stated US government officials must do more to pressure social media groups like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to remove content produced by terror groups:&lt;ref name=Kohlmann&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohlmann|first=Evan|title=The Antisocial Network: Countering the Use of Online Social Networking Technologies by Foreign Terrorist Organizations|url=http://homeland.house.gov/sites/homeland.house.gov/files/Testimony%20Kohlmann%5B1%5D.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, current U.S. law gives few incentives for companies like YouTube for volunteering information on illicit activity, or even cooperating when requested by U.S. law enforcement. If such companies are to be trusted to self-police their own professed commitments to fighting hate speech, then they must be held to a public standard which reflects the importance of that not unsubstantial responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kohlmann/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was performed and broadcast live as a Halloween episode at 8 p.m. on Sunday, October 30, 1938 over the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] radio network. The episode became famous for causing panic among its listening audience, but the scale of that panic is disputed, as the program had relatively few listeners.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pooley|first1=Jefferson|last2=Socolow|first2=Michael|title=The Myth of the ''War of the Worlds'' Panic|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/history/2013/10/orson_welles_war_of_the_worlds_panic_myth_the_infamous_radio_broadcast_did.single.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one-hour program began with the theme music for the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' and an announcement that the evening's show was an adaption of ''The War of the Worlds''. This was followed by a prologue read by Orson Welles which was closely based on the opening of H.G. Wells' novel. The next half hour of the broadcast was presented as typical evening of radio programming which was interrupted by a series of news bulletins. The first few bulletins interrupt a program of dance music and describe a series of odd explosions observed on Mars. This is followed by a seemingly unrelated report of an unusual object falling on a farm in [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]]. Another brief musical interlude is interrupted by a live report from Grover's Mill, where police officials and a crowd of curious onlookers have surrounded the strange cylindrical object. The situation quickly escalates when Martians emerge from the cylinder and attack using a heat-ray, abruptly cutting off the panicked reporter at the scene. This is followed by a rapid series of increasingly alarming news updates detailing a devastating alien invasion taking place around the world. This portion of the show climaxes with another live report describing giant Martian war machines releasing clouds of poisonous smoke in New York City, after which the program took its first break. During the second half of the show, the program shifts to a more conventional radio drama format and follows a survivor dealing with the aftermath of the invasion and Martian occupation of Earth. As in the original novel, the story ends with the discovery that the Martians have been defeated by microbes rather than by humans.

The illusion of realism was furthered because the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes after the introduction. Popular legend holds that some of the radio audience may have been listening to [[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]] with [[Edgar Bergen]] and tuned in to "The War of the Worlds" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction that the show was a drama; however, contemporary research suggests that this happened only in rare instances.&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=A.

==Production==
"The War of the Worlds" was the 17th episode of the CBS Radio series ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]],'' which was broadcast at 8&amp;nbsp;pm ET on Sunday, October 30, 1938.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Houseman |first=John |authorlink=John Houseman |title=Run-Through: A Memoir |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |date=1972 |isbn=0-671-21034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|390, 394}} [[The War of the Worlds|H. G. Wells' original novel]] tells the story of a Martian invasion of Earth. The novel was adapted for radio by [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]], who changed the primary setting from 19th-century England to the contemporary United States, with the landing point of the first Martian spacecraft changed to rural [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey|Grover's Mill]], an unincorporated village in [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]].

The program's format was a simulated live newscast of developing events.  The first two-thirds of the hour-long play is a contemporary retelling of events of the novel, presented as news bulletins interrupting programs of dance music. "I had conceived the idea of doing a radio broadcast in such a manner that a crisis would actually seem to be happening," Welles later said, "and would be broadcast in such a dramatized form as to appear to be a real event taking place at that time, rather than a mere radio play."&lt;ref name="Schwartz Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=A.

He was also influenced by the ''[[Columbia Workshop]]'' presentations "[[The Fall of the City]]", a 1937 radio play in which Welles played the role of an omniscient announcer, and "Air Raid", a vibrant as-it-happens drama starring [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] that aired October 27, 1938.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|159, 165–166}} Welles had previously used a newscast format for "Julius Caesar" (September 11, 1938), with [[H.

Welles discussed his fake newscast idea with producer [[John Houseman]] and associate producer [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]]; together, they decided to adapt a work of science fiction. They considered adapting [[M. P.

Howard Koch had written the first drafts for the Mercury Theatre broadcasts "Hell on Ice" (October 9), "Seventeen" (October 16),&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|164}} and "Around the World in 80 Days" (October 23).&lt;ref name="Bret Wood"&gt;[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography.''

Tuesday night, 36 hours before rehearsals were to begin, Koch telephoned Houseman in what the producer characterized as "deep distress". Koch said he could not make ''The War of the Worlds'' interesting or credible as a radio play, a conviction echoed by his secretary [[Anne Froelick]], a typist and aspiring writer whom Houseman had hired to assist him. With only his own abandoned script for ''[[Lorna Doone]]'' to fall back on, Houseman told Koch to continue adapting the Wells fantasy. He joined Koch and Froelick and they worked on the script throughout the night. On Wednesday night, the first draft was finished on schedule.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT" /&gt;{{Rp|392–393}}

On Thursday, associate producer Paul Stewart held a cast reading of the script, with Koch and Houseman making necessary changes. That afternoon, Stewart made an acetate recording, with no music or sound effects. Welles, immersed in rehearsing the Mercury stage production of ''[[Danton's Death]]'' scheduled to open the following week, played the record at an editorial meeting that night in his suite at [[the St. Regis Hotel]]. After hearing "Air Raid" on the ''Columbia Workshop'' earlier that same evening, Welles viewed the script as dull. He stressed the importance of inserting news flashes and eyewitness accounts into the script to create a sense of urgency and excitement.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|166}}

Houseman, Koch, and Stewart reworked the script that night,&lt;ref name="Houseman RT" /&gt;{{Rp|393}} increasing the number of news bulletins and using the names of real places and people whenever possible. Friday afternoon, the script was sent to Davidson Taylor, executive producer for CBS, and the network legal department. Their response was that the script was 'too' credible and its realism had to be toned down.  As using the names of actual institutions could be [[actionable]], CBS insisted upon some 28 changes in phrasing.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;{{Rp|167}}

===Plot summary===
"The War of the Worlds" begins with a paraphrase of [[s:The War of the Worlds/Book 1/Chapter 1|the beginning of the novel]], updated to contemporary times. The announcer introduces Orson Welles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We know now that in the early years of the 20th century, this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own. We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood which by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the 39th year of the 20th century came the great disillusionment. It was near the end of October. Business was better. The [[timeline of events preceding World War II|war scare]] was over. More men were back at work. Sales were picking up. On this particular evening, October 30th, the [[Crossley ratings|Crossley service]] estimated that 32 million people were listening in on radios…&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|394–395}}&lt;ref name=WellesNet/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The radio program begins as a simulation of a normal evening radio broadcast featuring a weather report and music by "Ramon Raquello and His Orchestra" live from a local hotel ballroom. After a few minutes, the music begins to be interrupted by several [[news flash]]es about strange gas explosions on [[Mars]]. An interview is arranged with reporter Carl Phillips and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]-based Professor of [[Astronomy]] Richard Pierson, who dismisses speculation about life on Mars. The musical program returns temporarily but is interrupted again by news of a strange meteorite landing in [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]]. Phillips and Pierson are dispatched to the site, where a large crowd has gathered. Philips describes the chaotic atmosphere around the strange cylindrical object, and Pierson admits that he does not know exactly what it is, but that it seems to be made of an extraterrestrial metal. The cylinder unscrews, and Phillips describes the tentacled, horrific "monster" that emerges from inside. Police officers approach the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]] waving a [[flag of truce]], but the invaders respond by firing a [[Heat-Ray|heat ray]], which incinerates the delegation and ignites the nearby woods and cars as the crowd screams. Phillips's shouts about incoming flames are cut off mid-sentence, and after a moment of [[dead air]], an announcer explains that the remote broadcast was interrupted due to "some difficulty with our field transmission."

After a brief "piano interlude", regular programming breaks down as the studio struggles with casualty and fire-fighting updates. A shaken Pierson speculates about Martian technology. The New Jersey [[National Guard of the United States|state militia]] declares [[martial law]] and attacks the cylinder; a captain from their field headquarters lectures about the overwhelming force of properly-equipped infantry and the helplessness of the Martians, until a [[Tripod (The War of the Worlds)|tripod]] rises from the pit. The tripod obliterates the militia, and the studio returns, now describing the Martians as an invading army. Emergency response bulletins give way to damage and evacuation reports as thousands of refugees clog the highways. Three Martian tripods from the cylinder destroy power stations and uproot bridges and railroads, reinforced by three others from a second cylinder that landed in the [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|Great Swamp]] near [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], as gas explosions continue. The [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] addresses the nation.

A live connection is established to a [[field artillery]] battery in the [[Watchung Mountains]]. Its gun crew damages a machine, resulting in a release of poisonous [[black smoke]], before fading into the sound of coughing. The lead plane of a wing of bombers from [[Langley Field|Langham Field]] broadcasts its approach and remains on the air as their engines are burned by the heat ray and the plane dives on the invaders. Radio operators go active and fall silent. Although the bombers manage to destroy one machine, the remaining five are spreading black smoke across the [[New Jersey Meadowlands|Jersey Marshes]] into [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].

Eventually, a news reporter, broadcasting from atop the [[CBS Building|Broadcasting Building]], describes the Martian invasion of New York City – "five great machines" wading the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] "like [men] wading through a brook", black smoke drifting over the city, people diving into the [[East River]] "like rats", others in [[Times Square]] "falling like flies". He reads a final bulletin stating that Martian cylinders have fallen all over the country, then describes the smoke approaching down the street until he has a coughing fit and falls silent, leaving only the sounds of the city under attack in the background. Finally, a [[ham radio]] operator is heard calling, "2X2L calling CQ, New York. Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there... anyone?"

After a period of silence comes the voice of announcer Dan Seymour:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are listening to a CBS presentation of Orson Welles and the ''Mercury Theatre of the Air'', in an original dramatization of ''The War of the Worlds'' by H. G. Wells. The performance will continue after a brief intermission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last third of the program is a monologue and dialogue. Professor Pierson, having survived the attack on Grover's Mill, attempts to make contact with other humans. In Newark, he encounters an opportunistic militiaman who holds fascist ideals in regards to man's relationship with the Martians, and intends to use Martian weaponry to take control of both species. Declaring that he wants no part of "his world", Pierson leaves the stranger with his delusions. His journey takes him to the ruins of New York, where he discovers that the Martians have died – as with the novel, they fell victim to earthly [[pathogenic]] [[Microorganism|germs]], to which they had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Life eventually returns to normal, and Pierson finishes writing his recollections of the invasion and its aftermath.

After the conclusion of the play, Welles reassumed his role as host and told listeners that the broadcast was a Halloween concoction: the equivalent, he says, "of dressing up in a sheet, jumping out of a bush and saying, 'Boo!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Koch | first=Howard | year=1970 | title=The Panic Broadcast: Portrait of an Event| location= Boston | publisher=Little, Brown and Company | isbn=0-316-50060-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular mythology holds the disclaimer was hastily added to the broadcast at the insistence of CBS executives, as they became aware of panic inspired by the program.

===Announcements===

Radio programming charts in Sunday newspapers listed the CBS drama, "The War of the Worlds". ''The New York Times'' for October 30, 1938, also included the show in its "Leading Events of the Week" ("Tonight – Play: H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'") and published a photograph of Welles with some of the Mercury players, captioned, "Tonight's show is H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'".&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|169}}

Announcements that "The War of the Worlds" is a dramatization of a work of fiction were made on the full CBS network at four points during the broadcast October 30, 1938: at the beginning, before the middle break, after the middle break, and at the end.&lt;ref name="Cantril"/&gt;{{Rp|43}} The middle break was delayed 10 minutes to accommodate the dramatic content.&lt;ref name="Bret Wood"/&gt;{{Rp|94}}

Another announcement was repeated on the full CBS network that same evening at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm, 11:30&amp;nbsp;pm, and midnight: "For those listeners who tuned in to Orson Welles's ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' broadcast from 8 to 9 pm Eastern Standard Time tonight and did not realize that the program was merely a modernized adaptation of H. G. Wells' famous novel ''War of the Worlds'', we are repeating the fact which was made clear four times on the program, that, while the names of some American cities were used, as in all novels and dramatizations, the entire story and all of its incidents were fictitious."&lt;ref name="Cantril"&gt;[[Hadley Cantril|Cantril, Hadley]], Hazel Gaudet, and [[Herta Herzog]], ''The Invasion from Mars: A Study in the Psychology of Panic: with the Complete Script of the Famous Orson Welles Broadcast''.

Producer John Houseman noticed that at about 8:32&amp;nbsp;pm. ET, CBS supervisor Davidson Taylor received a telephone call in the control room. Creasing his lips, Taylor left the studio and returned four minutes later, "pale as death", as he had been ordered to interrupt "The War of the Worlds" broadcast immediately with an announcement of the program's fictional content. However, by the time the order was given, the program was already less than a minute away from its first scheduled break, and the fictional news reporter played by actor [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] was choking on poison gas as the Martians overwhelmed New York.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|404}}

Actor [[Stefan Schnabel]] recalled sitting in the anteroom after finishing his on-air performance. "A few policemen trickled in, then a few more.

During the signoff theme, the phone began ringing. Houseman picked it up and the furious caller announced he was mayor of a Midwestern town, where mobs were in the streets.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The following hours were a nightmare. The building was suddenly full of people and dark-blue uniforms.

Finally, the Press was let loose upon us, ravening for horror. How many deaths had ''we'' heard of? (Implying they knew of thousands.) What did ''we'' know of the fatal stampede in a Jersey hall?

Because of the crowd of newspaper reporters, photographers, and police, the cast left the CBS building by the rear entrance. Aware of the sensation the broadcast had made, but not its extent, Welles went to the Mercury Theatre where an all-night rehearsal of ''Danton's Death'' was in progress.

Welles continued with the rehearsal of ''Danton's Death'' (scheduled to open November 2), leaving shortly after dawn October 31. He was operating on three hours of sleep when CBS called him to a press conference. He read a statement that was later printed in newspapers nationwide and took questions from reporters:&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|173, 176}}

:Question: Were you aware of the terror such a broadcast would stir up?&lt;br&gt;Welles: Definitely not. The technique I used was not original with me. It was not even new. I anticipated nothing unusual.

:Question: Why was the story changed to put in names of American cities and government officers?&lt;br&gt;Welles: H. G.

In its editions of October 31, 1938, the ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'' reported that three Arizona affiliates of CBS ([[KFYI|KOY]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[KTUC]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and KSUN in [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]]) had originally scheduled a delayed broadcast of "The War of the Worlds" that night; CBS had shifted ''The Mercury Theater on the Air'' from Monday nights to Sunday nights on September 11, but the three affiliates preferred to keep the series in its original Monday slot so that it would not compete with NBC's top-rated ''[[Chase and Sanborn Hour]]''. However, late on that Sunday night, CBS contacted KOY and KTUC owner Burridge Butler and instructed him not to air the program the following night.&lt;ref&gt;''Tucson Citizen'', edition of October 31, 1938, accessed on microfilm at the Tucson Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
[[File:WOTW-Cartoon-Callan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Radio Digest'' reprinted the script of "The War of the Worlds" "as a commentary on the nervous state of our nation after the [[Munich Agreement|Pact of Munich]]" – prefaced by an editorial cartoon by Les Callan of ''The Toronto Star'' (February 1939)]]

Later studies indicate that many missed the repeated notices about the broadcast being fictional, partly because ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', an unsponsored CBS cultural program with a relatively small audience, ran at the same time as the NBC [[Red Network]]'s popular ''[[Chase and Sanborn Hour]]'' featuring ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]]. At the time, many Americans assumed that a significant number of ''Chase and Sanborn'' listeners changed stations when the first comic sketch ended and a musical number by [[Nelson Eddy]] began and then tuned in "The War of the Worlds" after the opening announcements, but historian A. Brad Schwartz, after studying hundreds of letters from people who heard "The War of the Worlds", as well as contemporary audience surveys, concluded that very few people frightened by Welles's broadcast had tuned out Bergen's program. "All the hard evidence suggests that ''The Chase &amp; Sanborn Hour'' was only a minor contributing factor to the Martian hysteria," he wrote. "...in truth, there was no mass exodus from [[Charlie McCarthy]] to Orson Welles that night."&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH" /&gt;{{Rp|67–69}} Because the broadcast was unsponsored, Welles and company could schedule breaks at will, rather than arranging them around advertisements. As a result, the only notices that the broadcast was fictional came at the start of the broadcast and about 40 and 55 minutes into it.

A study by the [[Radio Project]] discovered that fewer than one third of frightened listeners understood the invaders to be aliens; most thought that they were listening to reports of a German invasion or of a natural catastrophe.&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH" /&gt;{{Rp|180, 191}}&lt;ref name="GIW"/&gt; "People were on edge", wrote Welles biographer [[Frank Brady (writer)|Frank Brady]]. "For the entire month prior to 'The War of the Worlds', radio had kept the American public alert to the ominous happenings throughout the world. The [[Munich Agreement|Munich crisis]] was at its height.... For the first time in history, the public could tune into their radios every night and hear, boot by boot, accusation by accusation, threat by threat, the rumblings that seemed inevitably leading to a world war."&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;[[Frank Brady (writer)|Brady, Frank]], ''Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1989  {{ISBN|0-385-26759-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|164–165}}

CBS News chief Paul White wrote that he was convinced that the panic induced by the broadcast was a result of the public suspense generated before the Munich Pact. "Radio listeners had had their emotions played upon for days.... Thus they believed the Welles production even though it was specifically stated that the whole thing was fiction".&lt;ref name="News on the Air"/&gt;{{Rp|47|date=May 2014}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically immeasurable on the night of the broadcast. ... Radio had siphoned off advertising revenue from print during the Depression, badly damaging the newspaper industry. So the papers seized the opportunity presented by Welles’ program to discredit radio as a source of news. The newspaper industry sensationalized the panic to prove to advertisers, and regulators, that radio management was irresponsible and not to be trusted."&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Extent===
Historical research suggests the panic was far less widespread than newspapers had indicated at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Conover]]'s [[Adam Ruins Everything]] episode [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6719452/?ref_=fn_ep_tt_1 Adam Ruins Halloween]&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he panic and mass hysteria so readily associated with 'The War of the Worlds' did not occur on anything approaching a nationwide dimension", [[American University]] media historian W. Joseph Campbell wrote in 2003. He quotes Robert E. Bartholomew, an authority on mass panic outbreaks, as having said that "there is a growing consensus among sociologists that the extent of the panic... was greatly exaggerated".&lt;ref name=GIW /&gt;

That position is supported by contemporary accounts. "In the first place, most people didn't hear [the show]," said [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], later president of CBS.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"/&gt; Of the nearly 2,000 letters mailed to Welles and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] after "The War of the Worlds," currently held by the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], roughly 27% came from frightened listeners or people who witnessed any panic. After analyzing those letters, A. Brad Schwartz concluded that although the broadcast briefly misled a significant portion of its audience, very few of those listeners fled their homes or otherwise panicked. The total number of protest letters sent to Welles and the FCC is also low in comparison with other controversial radio broadcasts of the period, further suggesting the audience was small and the fright severely limited.&lt;ref name="Schwartz BH"/&gt;{{Rp|82–93}}&lt;ref name="Schwartz VF"/&gt;

Five thousand households were telephoned that night in a survey conducted by the [[C. E. Hooper]] company, the main radio ratings service at the time. Only 2% of the respondents said they were listening to the radio play, and no one stated they were listening to a news broadcast. About 98% of respondents said they were listening to other radio programming (''The Chase and Sanborn Hour'' was by far the most popular program in that timeslot) or not listening to the radio at all. Further shrinking the potential audience, some CBS network affiliates, including some in large markets such as [[Boston metropolitan area|Boston]]'s [[WEZE|WEEI]], had pre-empted ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', in favor of local commercial programming.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"/&gt;

Ben Gross, radio editor for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', wrote in his 1954 memoir that the streets were nearly deserted as he made his way to the studio for the end of the program.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"/&gt; Producer John Houseman reported that the Mercury Theatre staff was surprised when they were finally released from the CBS studios to find life going on as usual in the streets of New York.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|404}} The writer of a letter that ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published later likewise recalled no panicked mobs in the capital's downtown streets at the time. "The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically immeasurable on the night of the broadcast", media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow wrote in ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'' on its 75th anniversary in 2013; "Almost nobody was fooled".&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article"/&gt;

According to Campbell, the most common response said to indicate a panic was calling the local newspaper or police to confirm the story or seek additional information. That, he writes, is an indicator that people were ''not'' generally panicking or hysterical. "The call volume perhaps is best understood as an altogether ''rational'' response..."&lt;ref name=GIW /&gt; Some New Jersey media and law enforcement agencies received up to 40% more telephone calls than normal during the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartholomew|first=Robert E.|title=The Martian Panic Sixty Years Later: What Have We Learned?|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_martian_panic_sixty_years_later_what_have_we_learned/|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=Skeptical Inquirer|date=November–December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it was late on a Sunday night in the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]], where the broadcast originated, few reporters and other staff were present in newsrooms. Most newspaper coverage thus took the form of [[Associated Press]] stories, which were largely anecdotal aggregates of reporting from its various bureaus, giving the impression that panic had indeed been widespread.

The ''[[Winston-Salem Journal|Twin City Sentinel]]'' of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] pointed out that the situation could have been even worse if most people had not been listening to Edgar Bergen's show: "Charlie McCarthy last night saved the United States from a sudden and panicky death by hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/relishnow/riverrun/winston-salem-citizens-among-those-fooled-by-radio-broadcast/article_e214b44a-f071-571e-ba7f-e5cf29e957ab.html|title=Winston-Salem citizens among those fooled by radio broadcast|last=Clodfelter|first=Tim|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=April 5, 2017|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 1938, the Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterized the incident as "mass hysteria" and stated that "never in the history of the United States had such a wave of terror and panic swept the continent". Unnamed observers quoted by ''The Age'' commented that "the panic could have only happened in America."&lt;ref name="The Age2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bJ1VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JJcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2609%2C186374 |title=Mass Hysteria in U.S.A.

Editorialists chastised the radio industry for allowing that to happen. The response may have reflected newspaper publishers' fears that radio, to which they had lost some of the advertising revenue that was scarce enough during the [[Great Depression]], would render them obsolete. In "The War of the Worlds," they saw an opportunity to cast aspersions on the newer medium: "The nation as a whole continues to face the danger of incomplete, misunderstood news over a medium which has yet to prove that it is competent to perform the news job," wrote ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'', the newspaper industry's trade journal.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mass Communication Theory: Foundations, Ferment, and Future, by Stanley J. Baran, Dennis K. Davis&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Randolph Hearst]]'s papers called on broadcasters to police themselves, lest the government step in, as Iowa Senator [[Clyde L. Herring]] proposed a bill that would have required all programming to be reviewed by the FCC prior to broadcast (he never actually introduced it). Others blamed the radio audience for its credulity. Noting that any intelligent listener would have realized the broadcast was fictional, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' opined, "it would be more tactful to say that some members of the radio audience are a trifle retarded mentally, and that many a program is prepared for their consumption." Other newspapers took pains to note that anxious listeners had called ''their'' offices to learn whether Martians were really attacking.&lt;ref name=GIW /&gt;

Few contemporary accounts exist outside newspaper coverage of the mass panic and hysteria supposedly induced by the broadcast. Justin Levine, a producer at [[KFI]]-AM in Los Angeles, wrote in a 2000 history of the FCC's response to hoax broadcasts that "the anecdotal nature of such reporting makes it difficult to objectively assess the true extent and intensity of the panic.&lt;ref name="Justin Levine"&gt;Levine, Justin; [http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&amp;context=fclj&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DA%2BHistory%2Band%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2Bthe%2BFederal%2BCommunications%2BCommission%2527s%2BResponse%2Bto%2BRadio%2BBroadcast%2BHoaxes%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C33#search=%22History%20Analysis%20Federal%20Communications%20Commissions%20Response%20Radio%20Broadcast%20Hoaxes%22 "A History and Analysis of the Federal Communication Commission's Response to Radio Broadcast Hoaxes"]; 52 Fed Comm L J 2, 273–320, 278n28; March 1, 2000; retrieved November 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartholomew sees this as yet more evidence that the panic was predominantly a creation of the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name="Little Green Men"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Martians Have Landed!: A History of Media-driven Panics and Hoaxes|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina|Jefferson, NC]]|isbn=9780786464982|pages=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyik93izNqEC&amp;pg=PA20|author=Bartholomew, Robert|author2=Radford, Benjamin |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
In a study published in book form as ''The Invasion from Mars'' (1940), Princeton professor [[Hadley Cantril]] calculated that some six million people heard "The War of the Worlds" broadcast.&lt;ref name="Cantril"/&gt;{{Rp|56}} He estimated that 1.7&amp;nbsp;million listeners believed the broadcast was an actual news bulletin and, of those, 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people were frightened or disturbed.&lt;ref name="Cantril"/&gt;{{Rp|58}} Media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow have since concluded, however, that Cantril's study has serious flaws. Its estimate of the program's audience is more than twice as high as any other at the time. Cantril himself conceded that but argued that unlike [[C. E. Hooper|Hooper]], his estimate had attempted to capture the significant portion of the audience that did not have home telephones at that time. Since those respondents were contacted only after the media frenzy, Cantril allowed that their recollections could have been influenced by what they read in the newspapers. Claims that ''Chase and Sanborn'' listeners who missed the disclaimer at the beginning when they turned to CBS during a commercial break or musical performance on that show and thus mistook "The War of the Worlds" for a real broadcast inflated the show's audience and the ensuing alleged panic are impossible to substantiate.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;

Apart from his admittedly-imperfect methods of estimating the audience and assessing the authenticity of their response, Pooley and Socolow found, Cantril made another error in typing audience reaction. Respondents had indicated a variety of reactions to the program, among them "excited", "disturbed", and "frightened". However, he included all of them with "panicked", failing to account for the possibility that despite their reaction, they were still aware the broadcast was staged. "[T]hose who did hear it, looked at it as a prank and accepted it that way," recalled researcher Frank Stanton.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;

Bartholomew grants that hundreds of thousands were frightened, but calls evidence of people taking action based on their fear "scant" and "anecdotal".&lt;ref name=Barth&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Robert E. |title=Little Green Men, Meowing Nuns and Head-Hunting Panics: A Study of Mass Psychogenic Illness and Social Delusion |year=2001 |publisher=Macfarland &amp; Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0997-5 |pages=217ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, contemporary news articles indicate that police were swamped with hundreds of calls in numerous locations, but stories of people doing anything more than calling authorities involved mostly only small groups. Such stories were often reported by people who were panicking themselves.&lt;ref name="GIW" /&gt;

Later investigations found much of the alleged panicked responses to have been exaggerated or mistaken. Cantril's researchers found that contrary to what had been claimed,  no admissions for shock were made at a Newark hospital during the broadcast; hospitals in New York City similarly reported no spike in admissions that night. A few suicide attempts seem to have been prevented when friends or family intervened, but no record of a successful one exists. A ''Washington Post'' claim that a man died of a heart attack brought on by listening to the program could not be verified. One woman filed a lawsuit against CBS, but it was soon dismissed.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;

The FCC also received letters from the public that advised against taking reprisals.&lt;ref name="Letters of Note"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/09/i-did-not-hear-martians-rapping-on-my.html |title=I did not hear the Martians rapping on my chamber door |publisher=Letters of Note, September 9, 2009  |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Eddie Cantor]] urged the commission not to overreact, as "censorship would retard radio immeasurably."&lt;ref name="Prologue article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Potter|first=Lee Ann|title="Jitterbugs" and "Crack-pots": Letters to the FCC about the "War of the Worlds" Broadcast|journal=[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue]]| date=Fall 2003 |volume=35|issue=3|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2003/fall/war-of-worlds.html|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC not only chose not to punish Welles or CBS but also barred complaints about "The War of the Worlds" from being brought up during license renewals. "[[Janet Jackson]]'s 2004 '[[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|wardrobe malfunction]]' remains far more significant in the history of broadcast regulation than Orson Welles' trickery," wrote media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow.&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;

===Meeting of Welles and Wells===

[[H. G. Wells]] and Orson Welles met for the first and only time in late October 1940, shortly before the second anniversary of the ''Mercury Theatre'' broadcast, when they both happened to be lecturing in [[San Antonio]], Texas. On October 28, 1940, the two men visited the studios of [[KTSA]] radio for an interview by Charles C. Shaw,&lt;ref name="TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|361}} who introduced them by characterizing the panic generated by "The War of the Worlds": "The country at large was frightened almost out of its wits".&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUdghSMTXsU |title=Orson Welles and H.G. Wells  |date=October 28, 1940 |publisher=YouTube  |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.G. Wells expressed good-natured skepticism about the actual extent of the panic caused by "this sensational Halloween spree," saying: "Are you sure there was such a panic in America or wasn't it your Halloween fun?"&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; Orson Welles appreciated the comment: "I think that's the nicest thing that a man from England could say about the men from Mars. Mr. Hitler made a good deal of sport of it, you know.... It's supposed to show the corrupt condition and decadent state of affairs in democracy, that 'The War of the Worlds' went over as well as it did. I think it's very nice of Mr. Wells to say that not only I didn't mean it, but the American people didn't mean it."&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

When Shaw interjected that there was "some excitement" that he did not wish to belittle, Welles asked him, "What ''kind'' of excitement? Mr. H. G. Wells wants to know if the excitement wasn't the same kind of excitement that we extract from a practical joke in which somebody puts a sheet over his head and says 'Boo!' I don't think anybody believes that that individual is a ghost, but we do scream and yell and rush down the hall. And that's just about what happened."&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

"That's a very excellent description," Shaw said.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

"You aren't quite serious in America, yet," said Wells. "You haven't got the war right under your chins. And the consequence is you can still play with ideas of terror and conflict.... It's a natural thing to do until you're right up against it."&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

"Until it ceases to be a game," Welles said, a phrase that Wells repeated.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wells Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosslawhead.com/blog/2012/09/when-orson-welles-met-h-g-wells/ |title=When Orson Welles Met H G Wells |publisher=Transcript.

==Authorship==

As the [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury]]'s second theatre season began in 1938, Orson Welles and John Houseman were unable to write the ''Mercury Theatre on the Air'' broadcasts on their own. They hired [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]], whose experience in having a play performed by the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in Chicago led him to leave his law practice and move to New York to become a writer. Koch was put to work at $50 a week, raised to $60 after he proved himself.&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|390}} ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' was a sustaining show, so in lieu of a more substantial salary, Houseman gave Koch the rights to any script he worked on.&lt;ref name="France Theatre of OW"&gt;[[Richard France (writer)|France, Richard]], ''The Theatre of Orson Welles''. Lewisburg, Pennsylvania: Bucknell University Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-8387-1972-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|175–176}}

A condensed version of the script for "The War of the Worlds" appeared in the debut issue of ''Radio Digest'' magazine (February 1939), in an article on the broadcast that credited "Orson Welles and his Mercury Theatre players".&lt;ref&gt;"Help—Men From Mars". ''Radio Digest''. February 1939, pp. 113–127.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete script appeared in ''The Invasion from Mars: A Study in the Psychology of Panic'' (1940), the book publication of a [[Princeton University]] study directed by psychologist [[Hadley Cantril]]. Welles strongly protested Koch being listed as sole author since many others contributed to the script, but by the time the book was published, he had decided to end the dispute.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|176–179}}

Welles did seek legal redress after the CBS TV series ''[[Studio One (U.S. TV series)|Studio One]]'' presented its top-rated broadcast, "[[The Night America Trembled]]", on September 9, 1957. Hosted by [[Edward R. Murrow]], the live presentation of [[Nelson S. Bond]]'s documentary play recreated the 1938 performance of "The War of the Worlds" in the CBS studio, using the script as a framework for a series of factual narratives about a cross-section of radio listeners. No member of the ''Mercury Theatre'' is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/sentence-of-death-the-night-america-trembled/oclc/879500255 |title=Sentence of death, The night America trembled (DVD, 2002) |publisher=[[WorldCat]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jeW30vLwds |title=The Night America Trembled  |publisher=''[[Studio One (U.S. TV series)|Studio One]]'', September 8, 1957, at YouTube |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts ruled against Welles, who was found to have abandoned any rights to the script after it was published in Cantril's book. Koch had granted CBS the right to use the script in its program.&lt;ref name="Appeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/ca9/briefs/govuscourtsca9briefs3264/gov.uscourts.ca9.017518.b.01.pdf |title=Orson Welles, Appellant, v.

"As it developed over the years, Koch took some cash and some credit," wrote biographer Frank Brady. "He wrote the story of how he created the adaptation, with a copy of his script being made into a paperback book enjoying large printings and an album of the broadcast selling over 500,000 copies, part of the income also going to him as copyright owner."&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|179}}

The book, ''The Panic Broadcast'', was first published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Howard, ''The Panic Broadcast: Portrait of an Event''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1970. The radio play ''Invasion from Mars'' was now copyrighted in Koch's name (''Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third Series; Books and Pamphlets, Title Index, January–June 1971'', page 1866). Hadley Cantril's ''The Invasion from Mars'', including the radio play (titled ''The Broadcast''), was copyrighted in 1940 by Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The best-selling album was a sound recording of the broadcast titled ''Orson Welles' War of the Worlds'', "released by arrangement with Manheim Fox Enterprises, Inc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/war-of-the-worlds/oclc/7046922?referer=di&amp;ht=edition  |title=War of the Worlds |publisher=[[WorldCat]] |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/master/view/213631  |title=Orson Welles – War of the Worlds|publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 28, 2014}} The jacket front of the 1968 [[Longines Symphonette]] Society LP reads, "The Actual Broadcast by The Mercury Theatre on the Air as heard over the Columbia Broadcasting System, Oct. 30, 1938.

Initially apologetic about the supposed panic his broadcast had caused (and privately fuming that newspaper reports of lawsuits were either greatly exaggerated or totally fabricated&lt;ref name="Justin Levine" /&gt;), Welles later embraced the story as part of his personal myth. "Houses were emptying, churches were filling up; from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to [[Minneapolis]] there was wailing in the streets and the rending of garments," he told [[Peter Bogdanovich]] years later.&lt;ref name="TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|18}}

CBS, too, found reports ultimately useful in promoting the strength of its influence. It presented a fictionalized account of the panic in "[[The Night America Trembled]]", a 1957 episode of the television series ''[[Studio One (U.S. TV series)|Studio One]]'', and included it prominently in its 2003 celebrations of CBS's 75th anniversary as a television broadcaster. "The legend of the panic," according to Jefferson and Socolow, "grew exponentially over the following years ... [It] persists because it so perfectly captures our unease with the media's power over our lives."&lt;ref name="2013 Slate article" /&gt;

In 1975, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired the television movie ''[[The Night That Panicked America]]'', depicting the effect the radio drama had on the public using fictional, but typical American families of the time.
 
The New Jersey [[West Windsor Township|Township of West Windsor]], where [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey|Grover's Mill]] is located, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the broadcast in 1988 with four days of festivities including art and planetarium shows, a panel discussion, a parade, burial of a time capsule, a dinner dance, film festivals devoted to H. G. Wells and Orson Welles, and the dedication of a bronze monument to the fictional Martian landings. Howard Koch, an author of the original radio script, attended the 49th anniversary celebration as an honored guest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westwindsornj.org/war-of-worlds-news.html War of the Worlds – News Stories], Township of West Windsor, Mercer County, New Jersey; Delany, Don, [http://www.westwindsornj.org/GROVERS_MILL/ww-50th-anniversary.pdf "West Windsor Celebrates 'The War of the Worlds'"] (PDF), ''Mercer Business'', October 1988, pp. 14–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds attacked Radio Quito and ''El Comercio'', a local newspaper that had participated in the hoax by publishing false reports of unidentified objects in the skies above Ecuador in the days preceding the broadcast. The riot resulted in at least seven deaths, including those of Paez's girlfriend and nephew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44933">The '''Theory of Reasoned Action''' ('''ToRA''' or '''TRA''') aims to explain the relationship between attitudes and behaviors within human action. It is mainly used to predict how individuals will behave based on their pre-existing attitudes and behavioral intentions. An individual's decision to engage in a particular behavior is based on the outcomes the individual expects will come as a result of performing the behavior. Developed by Martin Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen]] in 1967, the theory derived from previous research in [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], persuasion models, and attitude theories. Fisbein's theories suggested a relationship between attitude and behaviors (the A-B relationship). However, critics estimated that attitude theories were not proving to be good indicators of human behavior. The ToRA was later revised and expanded by the two theorists in the following decades to overcome any discrepancies in the A-B relationship with the [[Theory of planned behavior|Theory of Planned Behavior]] (TPB) and [[Reasoned action approach|Reasoned Action Approach]] (RAA). The theory is also used in communication discourse as a theory of understanding. &lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers Gillmore|first=Mary|last2=Archibald|first2=Matthew|last3=Morrison|first3=Diane|last4=Wilsdon|first4=Anthony|last5=Wells|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Hoppe|first6=Marilyn|last7=Nahom|first7=Deborah|last8=Murowchick|first8=Elise|date=November 2002|title=Teen Sexual Behavior: Applicability of the Theory of Reasoned Action|url=|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=64|issue=Volume 64|pages=885–897|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00885.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary purpose of the TRA is to understand an individual's voluntary behavior by examining the underlying basic motivation to perform an action&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doswell|first=Willa|last2=Braxter|first2=Betty|last3=Cha|first3=EunSeok|last4=Kim|first4=Kevin|date=2011|title=Testing the Theory of Reasoned Action in Explaining Sexual Behavior Among African American Young Teen Girls|url=|journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . ToRA states that a person's intention to perform a behavior is the main predictor of whether or not they actually perform that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904400161|title=Health behavior : theory, research, and practice|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Glanz, Karen,, Rimer, Barbara K.,, Viswanath, K.

According to the theory, intention to perform a certain behavior precedes the actual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azjen|first=Icek|last2=Madden|first2=Thomas|date=1986|title=Prediction of goal-directed behavior: Attitudes, intentions, and perceived behavioral control|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=22|pages=453–474|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(86)90045-4|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intention is known as behavioral intention and comes as a result of a belief that performing the behavior will lead to a specific outcome. Behavioral intention is important to the theory because these intentions "are determined by attitudes to behaviors and subjective norms".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colman|first=Andrew|date=January 2015|title=Theory of Reasoned Action|url=|journal=A Dictionary of Psychology|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of reasoned action suggests that stronger intentions lead to increased effort to perform the behavior, which also increases the likelihood for the behavior to be performed. 

== Key Concepts and Conditions ==
=== Behavior ===
A [[Positivism|positivistic approach]] to behavior research, ToRA attempts to predict and explain one's intention of performing a certain behavior. The theory requires that behavior be clearly defined in terms of the four following concepts: Action (e.g. to go get), Target (e.g. a mammogram), Context (e.g. at the breast screening center), and Time (e.g. in the 12 months).&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Montaño, DE, Kasprzyk, D, and Taplin, S. The Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior. In: Glanz, K, Lewis, FM, and Rimer, BK (Eds). Health Behavior and Health Education (Second Edition). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass Publishers.    &lt;/ref&gt; According to TRA, behavioral intention is the main motivator of behavior, while the two key determinants on behavioral intention are people's ''attitudes'' and ''norms''. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fishbein, Martin, and Icek Ajzen. ''Belief, Attitude, Intention And Behavior''. Addison-Wesley, 1975.    &lt;/ref&gt; By examining attitudes and subjective norms, researchers can gain an understanding as to whether or not one will perform the intended action. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

=== Attitudes ===
According to TRA, ''attitudes'' are one of the key determinants of behavioral intention and refer to the way people feel towards a particular behavior. &lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Ajzen, I., &amp; Albarracín, D. (2007). Predicting and changing behavior: A reasoned action approach. In I. Ajzen, D. Albarracín, &amp; R. Hornik (Eds.), ''Prediction and change of health behavior: Applying the reasoned action approach'' (pp. 3-21). Mahwah, NJ, US: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; These attitudes are influenced by two factors: the ''strength of behavioral beliefs'' regarding the outcomes of the performed behavior (i.e. whether or not the outcome is probable) and the ''evaluation'' of the potential outcomes (i.e. whether or not the outcome is positive). &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Attitudes regarding a certain behavior can either be positive, negative or neutral. &lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Fishbein, M. (1967). A behavior theory approach to the relations between beliefs about an object and the attitude toward the object. In M. Fishbein (Ed.), Readings in attitude theory and measurement (pp. 389-400). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.    &lt;/ref&gt; The theory stipulates that there exists a direct correlation between attitudes and outcomes, such that if one believes that a certain behavior will lead to a desirable or ''favorable'' outcome, then one is more likely to have a positive attitude towards the behavior. Alternatively, if one believes that a certain behavior will lead to an undesirable or ''unfavorable'' outcome, then one is more likely to have a negative attitude towards the behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== Behavioral Belief ====
''Behavioral belief'' allows us to understand people's motivations for their behavior in terms of the behavior's consequences. &lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, Icek. “Martin Fishbein's Legacy: The Reasoned Action Approach.” ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', vol. 640, 2012, pp. 11–27. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23218420.    &lt;/ref&gt; This concept stipulates that people tend to associate the performance of a certain behavior with a certain set of outcomes or features. &lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; For example, a person believes that if he or she studies for a month for his or her driver's license test, that one will pass the test after failing it the first time without studying at all. Here, the behavioral belief is that studying for a month is equated with success, whereas not studying at all is associated with failure. 

==== Evaluation ====
The evaluation of the outcome refers to the way people perceive and evaluate the potential outcomes of a performed behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such evaluations are conceived in a binary "good-bad" fashion-like manner. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; For example, a person may evaluate the outcome of quitting smoking cigarettes as positive if the behavioral belief is improved breathing and clean lungs. Conversely, a person may evaluate the outcome of quitting smoking cigarettes as negative if the behavioral belief is weight gain after smoking cessation. 

=== Subjective Norms ===
''Subjective norms'' are also one of the key determinants of behavioral intention and refer to the way [[Perception|perceptions]] of relevant groups or individuals such as family members, friends, and peers may affect one's performance of the behavior. &lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; [[Icek Ajzen|Ajzen]] defines subjective norms as the "perceived [[social pressure]] to perform or not perform the behavior". &lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; According to TRA, people develop certain beliefs or ''normative beliefs'' as to whether or not certain behaviors are acceptable. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These beliefs shape one's [[perception]] of the behavior and determine one's intention to perform or not perform the behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; For example, if one believes that recreational drug use (the behavior) is acceptable within one's social group, one will more likely be willing to engage in the activity. Alternatively, if one's friends groups perceive that the behavior is bad, one will be less likely to engage in recreational drug use. However, subjective norms also take into account people's ''motivation to comply'' with their social circle's views and [[Perception|perceptions]], which vary depending on the situation and the individual's motivations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==== Normative Beliefs ====
Normative beliefs touch on whether or not referent relevant groups approve of the action. There exists a direct correlation between normative beliefs and performance of the behavior. Usually, the more likely the referent groups will approve of the action, the more likely the individual perform the act. Conversely, the less likely the referent groups will approve of the action, the less likely the individual will perform the act. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Motivation to Comply ====
Motivation to comply addresses the fact that individuals may or may not comply with [[Social norm|social norms]] of the referent groups surrounding the act. Depending on the individuals motivations in terms of adhering to [[Social pressure|social pressures]], the individual will either succumb to the [[Social pressure|social pressures]] of performing the act if it is deemed acceptable, or alternatively will resist to the [[Social pressure|social pressures]] of performing the act if it is deemed unacceptable. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Behavioral Intention ===
Behavioral intention is a function of both attitudes and subjective norms toward that behavior (also known as the normative component). Attitudes being how strongly one holds the attitude toward the act and subjective norms being the social norms associated with the act. The stronger the attitude and the more positive the subjective norm, the higher the A-B relationship should be. However, the attitudes and subjective norms are unlikely to be weighted equally in predicting behavior. Depending on the individual and situation, these factors might have different impacts on behavioral intention, thus a weight is associated with each of these factors.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication Theories:  Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts|last=Miller|first=Katherine|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few studies have shown that direct prior experience with a certain activity results in an increased weight on the attitude component of the behavior intention function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manstead|first=A.

====Formula====
In its simplest form, the TRA can be expressed as the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;BI {{=}} (AB)W_1 + (SN)W_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''BI'' = behavioral intention
* (''AB'') = one's attitude toward performing the behavior
* ''W'' = empirically derived weights
* ''SN'' = one's subjective norm related to performing the behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Jerold|last2=Householder|first2=Brian|last3=Greene|first3=Kathryn|date=2002|title=The Theory of Reasoned Action|url=|journal=The persuasion handbook: Developments in theory and practice|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conditions ===
The TORA theorists note that there are three conditions that can affect the relationship between behavioral intention and behavior. The first condition is that "the measure of intention must correspond with respect to their levels of specificity".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Comparison of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Theory of Reasoned Action|last = Ajzen|first = Icek|date = February 1992|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|doi = 10.1177/0146167292181001|pmid =|volume=18|pages=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that to predict a specific behavior, the behavioral intention must be equally specific. The second condition is that there must be "stability of intentions between time of measurement and performance of behavior".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The intention must remain the same between the time that it is given and the time that the behavior is performed. The third condition is "the degree to which carrying out the intention is under the volitional control of the individual".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The individual always has the control of whether or not to perform the behavior. These conditions have to do with the transition from verbal responses to actual behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Scope and Limitations ==

=== Scope ===
While Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen|Ajzen]] developed the ToRA within the field of health to understand health behaviors, the theorists asserted that TRA could be applied in any given context to understand and even predict any human behavior. &lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, Martin, and Icek Ajzen. ''Belief, Attitude, Intention And Behavior''. Addison-Wesley, 1975.   &lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheppard et al., behavioral intention can predict the performance of "any voluntary act, unless intent changes prior to the performance or unless the intention measure does not correspond to the behavioral criterion in terms of action, target, context, time-frame and/or specificity". &lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Sheppard, Blair H. et al. "The Theory Of Reasoned Action: A Meta-Analysis Of Past Research With Recommendations For Modifications And Future Research". ''Journal Of Consumer Research'', vol 15, no. 3, 1988, p. 325. ''Oxford University Press (OUP)'', doi:10.1086/209170.&lt;/ref&gt; Their statement asserts that according to TRA, the measure of behavioral intention can predict whether or not an individual will preform a certain act, as long as the behavioral intention remains the same and the behavior is clearly and properly defined. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Broadening the scope of TRA, Sheppard conducted a study in which they applied TRA in situations that did not completely comply or conform with Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen|Ajzen]]'s framework. Surveying 87 previous empirical studies, they applied the theory in contexts where the individual did not have full [[Volition (psychology)|volitional]] control over the behavior and/or where individuals did not have all the information to develop the intention.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Pinder, Craig C. ''Work Motivation In Organizational Behavior''. Psychology Press, 2008, pp. 253 - 266.&lt;/ref&gt; To their surprise, they found that the theory of reasoned action could successfully be applied in situations that did not fully adhere to the three formal terms and conditions specified by the theory. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
Although the scope of TRA is wide, the theory still has its limitations and like any other theory, needs constant refinement and revision particularly when extending to choice and goals. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The distinction between a goal intention and a behavioral intention concerns the capability to achieve one's intention, which involves multiple variables thus creating great uncertainty. [[Icek Ajzen|Ajzen]] acknowledged that "some behaviors are more likely to present problems of controls than others, but we can never be absolutely certain that we will be in a position to carry out our intentions. Viewed in this light it becomes clear that strictly speaking every intention is a goal whose attainment is subject to some degree of uncertainty." &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

According to Eagly and Chaiken, TRA does not take into account that certain conditions that enable the performance of a behavior are not available to individuals. &lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Eagly, A. H., &amp; Chaiken, S. (1993). The psychology of attitudes. Orlando, FL, US: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ToRA focuses on behaviors that people decisively enact, the theory is limited in terms of being able to predict behaviors that require access to certain opportunities, skills, conditions, and/or resources. &lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Additionally, certain intentions do not necessarily play a role in terms of connecting attitudes and behavior. &lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Bagozzi, Richard P. et al. "An Investigation Into The Role Of Intentions As Mediators Of The Attitude-Behavior Relationship". ''Journal Of Economic Psychology'', vol 10, no. 1, 1989, pp. 35-62. ''Elsevier BV'', doi:10.1016/0167-4870(89)90056-1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted by Bagozzi and Yi, the performance of a behavior is not always preceded by a strong intent. In fact, attitudes and behaviors may not always be linked by intentions, particularly when the behavior does not require much cognitive effort. &lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== Development and investigation ==
In 1979, [[H. C. Triandis]] proposed expanding TORA to include more components. These factors were habit, facilitating conditions, and affect. When a person performs a behavior in a routine manner they form a habit. Facilitating conditions are conditions that make completion of an action more or less difficult. Both of these conditions affect their behavior directly. On the other hand, affect is the emotional response a person has towards a behavior and this emotional response only affects behavioral intention rather than directly affecting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink1=Harry C. Triandis|last1=Triandis|first1=Harry C.|date=1979|title=Values, attitudes, and interpersonal behavior|url=|journal=Nebraska Symposium on Motivation|volume=27|pages=195–259|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded version of TORA has been used to study behaviors like women's participation in [[mammography]] procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montano|first=Daniel E.|last2=Taplin|first2=Stephen H.|title=A test of an expanded theory of reasoned action to predict mammography participation|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(91)90153-4|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=32|issue=6|pages=733–741|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(91)90153-4|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Ajzen extended TORA to what he refers as the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB). This involves the addition of one major predictor—perceived behavioral control. This addition was introduced to account for times when people have the intention to conduct the behavior, but the actual behavior is thwarted because of subjective and objective reasons.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Action Control: From Cognition to Behavior|last=Ajzen|first=Icek|publisher=Springer|year=1985|isbn=978-3-642-69748-7|editor-last=Kuhl|editor-first=Julius|location=|pages=11–39|chapter=From Intentions to Actions: A Theory of Planned Behavior|quote=|editor-last2=Beckmann|editor-first2=Jürgen|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the theory of planned behavior, the attitude, subjective norms, and behavioral control have "important although differently weighted effects on a person's intention to behave".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In spite of the improvement, it is suggested that TORA and TPB only provides an account of the determinants of behavior when both motivation and opportunity to process information are high.  Further research demonstrating the casual relationships among the variables in TPB and any expansions of it is clearly necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conner|first=Mark|last2=Armitage|first2=Christopher J.|date=1998-08-01|title=Extending the Theory of Planned Behavior: A Review and Avenues for Further Research|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01685.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|language=en|volume=28|issue=15|pages=1429–1464|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01685.x|issn=1559-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model also mentions little about the memory process.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sutton|first=Stephen|date=1998-08-01|title=Predicting and Explaining Intentions and Behavior: How Well Are We Doing?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01679.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|language=en|volume=28|issue=15|pages=1317–1338|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01679.x|issn=1559-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of the theory  ==
The theory of reasoned action has been used in many studies as a framework for examining specific kinds of behavior such as communication behavior, consumer behavior and health behavior. Many researchers use the theory to study behaviors that are associated with high risks and danger, as well as deviant behavior. In contrast, some research has applied the theory to more normative and rational types of action. Researchers Davies, Foxall, and Pallister suggest that the theory of reasoned action can be tested if "behavior is measured objectively without drawing a connection to prior intention".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Explaining Internet Banking Behavior: Theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behavior, or technology acceptance model?|last = Yousafzai|first = Shumaila|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00615.x|volume=40|pages=1172–1202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies, however, look at intention because of its central role in the theory.

=== Communication ===

==== College fraternity and sorority hazing ====
Theory of Reasoned Action has been applied to the study of [[Whistle blowing|whistle-blowing]] intentions and [[hazing]] in college organizations, specifically [[fraternities and sororities]]. Hazing is understood to be "any activity expected of someone that joins a group, which humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers its victims".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Blowing the Whistle Against Greek Hazing: The Theory of Reasoned Action as a Framework for Reporting Intentions|last = Richardson|first = Brian|date = April–June 2012|journal = Communication Studies|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Wang|first2 = Zuoming|last3 = Hall|first3 = Camille}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, there have been a variety of hazing incidents that have resulted in death and harm of students on several college campuses. Whistle-blowing "involves an individual with some level of unique or inside knowledge using public communication to bring attention to some perceived wrongdoing or problem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Whistle-blowing is significant to this issue because individuals who are aware of hazing incidents can come forward to university officials and make the occurrence of hazing known. In their study, Richardson et al. set out to study whistle-blowing by using the theory of reasoned action as a framework to predict whether or not individuals will come forward about report hazing incidents. Their study served to examine whether the relationships suggested by the TRA model remain true in predicting whistle blowing intentions, and if these relationships would change depending on the severity of the hazing incident.

Richardson et al. surveyed a sample of 259 students from Greek organizations at university in the Southwestern United States. The survey questions measured the different aspects of the TRA model: behavioral beliefs, outcome evaluations, attitude toward the behavior, normative beliefs, motivation to comply, subjective norms, and the consequence endogenous variable. The questions asked respondents to rate their responses on various 7 point scales. "Participants in the study responded to one of three scenarios, varying in level of severity, describing a hazing situation occurring in their fraternity or sorority".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In line with the theory, the researchers wanted to identify if attitudes held about hazing, dangerous activity, and group affiliation, along with subjective norms about whistle-blowing (reactions by others, consequences of reporting the action, isolation from the group) would influence whether or not an individual would go through with reporting a hazing incident. The results of the study found that individuals were more likely to report, or whistle-blow, on hazing incidents that were more severe or harmful to individuals. Simultaneously, individuals were also concerned about the perceptions of others' attitudes towards them and the consequences they may face if they reported hazing incidents.

==== Knowledge sharing in companies ====
TRA is used to examine the communication behavior in corporations. One of the behaviors TRA helped characterize is knowledge sharing (KS) in companies. In the study conducted by Ho, Hsu, and Oh, they proposed two models to construct KS process by introducing TRA and game theory (GT). One model captures personal psychological feelings (attitudes and subjective norms), the other model not only captures personal feelings but also takes other people's decisions into consideration. By comparing the two models, researchers found that the model based on TRA has a higher predictive accuracy than the model based on TRA and GT. They concluded that employees "have a high probability of not analyzing the decisions of others",&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chien‐Ta Bruce Ho|last2=Shih‐Feng Hsu|last3=K.B. Oh|date=2009-10-30|title=Knowledge sharing: game and reasoned action perspectives|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/02635570911002289|journal=Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems|volume=109|issue=9|pages=1211–1230|doi=10.1108/02635570911002289|issn=0263-5577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether taking other colleague's decision into account has a great impact on people's KS behavioral intention. It is indicated that "the more indirect decision-makers there are in organizations, the less effective is KS".&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; To encourage KS, company managers should avoid including indirect decision-makers in the projects.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Consumer behavior ===

==== Coupon usage ====
Coupon usage has also been studied through the theory of reasoned action framework by researchers interested in consumer and marketer behavior. In 1984, Terence Shimp and Alican Kavas applied this theory to coupon usage behavior, with the research premise that "coupon usage is rational, systematic, and thoughtful behavior"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Theory of Reasoned Action Applied to Coupon Usage|last = Shimp|first = Terence|date = December 1984|journal = Journal of Consumer Research|doi = 10.1086/209015|pmid = |last2 = Kavas|first2 = Alican|issue = Volume 11|volume=11|page=795}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in contrast with other applications of the theory to more dangerous types of behavior.

Theory of Reasoned Action serves as a useful model because it can help examine whether "consumers' intentions to use coupons are determined by their attitudes and perceptions of whether important others think one should or should not expend the effort to clip, save, and use coupons".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The consumer's behavior intentions are influenced by their personal beliefs about coupon usage, meaning whether or not they think saving money is important and are willing to spend the time clipping coupons. These potential beliefs also influenced the coupon user's thoughts about what others think about their usage of coupons. Together, the coupon user will use their own beliefs and the opinions of others to form an overall attitude towards coupon usage.  To approach this study, Shimp and Alican surveyed 770 households and measured the aspects of the TRA model in terms of the participant's responses. The received responses indicated that consumers' norms are "partially determined by their personal beliefs toward coupon usage, and to an even greater extend, that attitudes are influenced by internalizations of others' beliefs".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Positive attitudes towards this behavior are influenced by an individual's perceptions that their partners will be satisfied by their time spent and efforts made to save money.
[[File:Pictorial_Presentation_of_UBL.gif|thumb|3 variables in Unit Brand Loyalty (UBL)]]

==== Brand loyalty ====
TRA has been applied to redefine [[brand loyalty]]. According to the theory of reasoned action, the antecedents of purchase behaviour are attitudes towards the purchase and subjective norm. In 1998, Ha conducted a study to investigate the relationships among several antecedents of unit brand loyalty (UBL) by introducing TRA. Consumers are brand loyal when both attitude and behavior are favorable. In his study, Ha developed a table indicating 8 combinations of customers' brand loyalty based on their loyalty on 3 variables – attitude towards the behavior, subjective norm, and purchase behavior is loyal. According to Ha, marketing managers should not be discouraged by a temporary disloyalty and need to strive for grabbing brand loyalty when customers are showing loyalty to two of the three variables, but they need to rediagnose their customers' brand loyalty when customers are showing loyalty to only one of them. The main focus should be pointed at either enhancing the consumer's attitude toward their brand or adjusting their brand to the [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choong Lyong Ha|date=1998-02-01|title=The theory of reasoned action applied to brand loyalty|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/10610429810209737|journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management|volume=7|issue=1|pages=51–61|doi=10.1108/10610429810209737|issn=1061-0421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Green Behaviors ====
TRA has also been used to study consumer attitudes towards [[renewable energy]]. In 2000, Bang, et. al found that people who cared about environmental issues like pollution were more willing to spend more for renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bang|first=Hae-Kyong|last2=Ellinger|first2=Alexander E.|last3=Hadjimarcou|first3=John|last4=Traichal|first4=Patrick A.|date=2000-06-01|title=Consumer concern, knowledge, belief, and attitude toward renewable energy: An application of the reasoned action theory|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6793(200006)17:63.0.CO;2-8/abstract|journal=Psychology and Marketing|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=449–468|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6793(200006)17:6&lt;449::aid-mar2&gt;3.0.co;2-8|issn=1520-6793}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2008 study of Swedish consumers by Hansla et. al showed that those who with a positive view of renewable energy were more willing to spend money on sustainable energy for their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansla|first=André|last2=Gamble|first2=Amelie|last3=Juliusson|first3=Asgeir|last4=Gärling|first4=Tommy|title=Psychological determinants of attitude towards and willingness to pay for green electricity|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2007.10.027|journal=Energy Policy|volume=36|issue=2|pages=768–774|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.10.027|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies are evidence that the emotional response people have towards a topic affects their attitude, which in turn affects their behavioral intent. These studies also provide examples for how the TRA is used to market goods that might not make the most sense from a strictly economic perspective.

In addition, Mishara et.al 's research proved there is a positively relation between behavioral intention and actual behavior in Green Information Technology (GIT) acceptance. Those professionals with positive intentions towards GIT tend to exploit GIT into practice. &lt;ref&gt;Mishra, D., Akman, I., &amp; Mishra, A. (2014).

=== Health behavior ===

==== Condom use ====
Theory of Reasoned Action has been frequently used as a framework and predictive mechanism of applied research on sexual behavior, especially in prevention of [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted disease]] such as HIV. In 2001, Albarracín, Johnson, Fishbein, and Muellerleile applied theory of reasoned action (TRA) and [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB) into studying how well the theories predict [[condom]] use.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albarracín|first=Dolores|last2=Johnson|first2=Blair|last3=Fishbein|first3=Martin|last4=Muellerleile|first4=Paige|title=Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior as Models of Condom Use: A Meta-Analysis|url=http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=chip_docs|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=127|issue=1|pmid=11271752|pmc=4780418|pages=142–61|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.1.142|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be consistent with TRA, the authors synthesized 96 data sets (N = 22,594), and associate every component in condom use with certain weight. Their study indicates that the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior are highly successful predictors of condom use. According to their discussion, "people are more likely to use condoms if they have previously formed the corresponding intentions. These intentions to use condoms appear to derive from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. These attitudes and norms, in turn, appear to derive from outcome and normative beliefs. Nevertheless, whether behavior was assessed retrospectively or prospectively was an important moderator that influenced the magnitude of the associations between theoretically important variables."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Sexual behavior in teenage girls ====
In 2011, W.M. Doswell, Braxter, Cha, and Kim examined sexual behavior in African American teenage girls and applied the theory as a framework for understanding this behavior. The theory of reasoned action can explain these behaviors in that teens' behavioral intentions to engage in early sexual behavior are influenced by their pre-existing attitudes and subjective norms of their peers. Attitudes in this context are favorable or unfavorable dispositions towards teenage sexual behavior.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doswell|first=Willa|last2=Braxter|first2=Betty|last3=Cha|first3=EunSeok|last4=Kim|first4=Kevin|date=2011|title=Testing the Theory of Reasoned Action in Explaining Sexual Behavior Among African American Young Teen Girls|url=|journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective norms are the perceived social pressure teenagers feel from their friends, classmates, and other peer groups to engage in sexual behavior. As a framework, the TRA suggests that adolescents will participate in early behavior because of their own attitudes towards the behavior and the subjective norms of their peers. In this case, intention is the willful plan to perform early sexual behavior.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Findings from the student showed that the TRA was supportive in predicting early sexual behavior among African American teenage girls. Attitudes towards sex and subjective norms both correlated with intentions to participate in early sexual behavior in the study's sample.

==== Pediatricians, parents and HPV vaccinations ====
A 2011 study examining pediatricians' behaviors surrounding the [[HPV vaccines|Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine]] found that TRA predicted the pediatricians would encourage parents to get their daughters vaccinated. Roberto, Krieger, Katz, Goei, and Jain discovered that the norms surrounding this topic were more important in predicting behavior than perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberto|first=Anthony J.|last2=Krieger|first2=Janice L.|last3=Katz|first3=Mira L.|last4=Goei|first4=Ryan|last5=Jain|first5=Parul|date=2011-06-01|title=Predicting Pediatricians' Communication With Parents About the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine: An Application of the Theory of Reasoned Action|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2010.550021|journal=Health Communication|volume=26|issue=4|pages=303–312|doi=10.1080/10410236.2010.550021|issn=1041-0236|pmc=4154063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exercise ====
The public health community, interested in reducing rising obesity rates, has used TRA to study people's exercise behavior. A 1981 study by Bentler and Speckart revealed that intent to exercise was determined by a person's attitude toward exercise, as predicted by TRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bentler|first=Peter M.|last2=Speckart|first2=George|title=Attitudes "cause" behaviors: A structural equation analysis.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.40.2.226|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=226–238|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.2.226|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader literature review on the study of exercise using TRA and TPB, it was determined that behavioral intent to exercise is better framed by TRA than TPB because perceived behavioral control did not have a significant effect on the intent to exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blue|first=Carolyn L.|date=1995-04-01|title=The predictive capacity of the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior in exercise research: An integrated literature review|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nur.4770180205/abstract|journal=Research in Nursing &amp; Health|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=105–121|doi=10.1002/nur.4770180205|issn=1098-240X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Challenges'''

According to Fishbein's and Ajzen's original (1967) formulation of TRA, a behavioral intention measure will predict the performance of any voluntary act, unless intent changes prior to performance or unless the intention measure does not correspond to the behavioral criterion in terms of action, target, context, time-frame and/or specificity.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheppard|first=Blair H.|last2=Hartwick|first2=Jon|last3=Warshaw|first3=Paul R.|date=1988-01-01|title=The Theory of Reasoned Action: A Meta-Analysis of Past Research with Recommendations for Modifications and Future Research|jstor=2489467|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=15|issue=3|pages=325–343|doi=10.1086/209170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model of TRA has been challenged by studies determined to examine its limitation and inadequacy.

The major problem of TRA is pointed out to be the ignorance of the connections between individuals, both the interpersonal and social relations in which they act, and the broader social structures which govern social practice.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cQ7H08_OvP8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=critique+of+reasoned+action&amp;ots=dhCEBUWnHk&amp;sig=jNSnAn-CzvoRMQkNdUzBi0_8P10#v=onepage&amp;q=critique%20of%20reasoned%20action&amp;f=false|title=The Theory of Reasoned Action: Its Application to Aids-preventive Behavior|last=Terry|first=Deborah J.|last2=Gallois|first2=Cynthia|last3=McCamish|first3=Malcolm|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780080419329|location=|pages=255|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although TRA recognizes the importance of [[Norm (social)|social norms]], strategies are limited to a consideration of individual [[Perception|perceptions]] of these social phenomena. Individual's belief, attitudes and understandings are constituted activity, therefore the distinction of the two factors is ambiguous. In 1972, Shwartz and Tessler noted that there are other major and subjective determinants of intentions at play that go beyond attitudes toward the behavior and subjective norms. Namely, they propose that one's sense of right and wrongs, as well as one's beliefs surrounding moral obligation may also impact one's intention. &lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S. H., &amp; Tessler, R. C. (1972). A test of a model for reducing measured attitude-behavior discrepancies. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 24''(2), 225-236.

&lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0033365&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; This value system is internalized independently from Fishbein and Ajzen's subjective norms. &lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Furthermore, social change may be generational rather than the sum of individual change. TRA fails to capture and oversimplifies the social processes of change and the social nature of the change itself: a model in which people collectively appropriate and construct new meanings and practice.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Additionally, the habituation of past behavior also tends to reduce the impact that intention has on behavior as the habit increases. Gradually, the performance of the behavior become less of a rational, initiative behavior and more of a learned response. In addition, intention appears to have a direct effect on behavior in the short term only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Richard|last=Bagozzi|year=1981|title=Attitudes, intentions, and behavior: A test of some key hypotheses|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=41|pages=607–627|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.41.4.607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, the analysis of the conceptual basis also raises concerns. It is criticized that the model does not enable the generation of hypothesis because of their ambiguity. The model focuses on analytic truth rather than synthetic one, therefore the conclusions resulting from those applications are often true by definition rather than by observation which makes the model unfalsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogden|first=Jane|year=2003|title=Some Problems With Social Cognition Models: A Pragmatic and Conceptual Analysis|url=http://psych415.class.uic.edu/Readings/Ogden,%20Social%20Cog%20Models,%20HlthPsy,%202003.pdf|journal=Health Psychology|volume=22|issue=4|pages=424–428|via=|doi= 10.1037/0278-6133.22.4.424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strengths of attitudes toward a behavior (social/personal) and subjective norms also vary cross-culturally while the process by which the behavior engaged remains the same. An example of this is shown in a cross-cultural study on fast food choices, where people from Western cultures were found to be more influenced by their prior choice of restaurant than people from Eastern cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BAGOZZI|first=R|last2=WONG|first2=N|last3=ABE|first3=S|last4=BERGAMI|first4=M|title=Cultural and Situational Contingencies and the Theory of Reasoned Action: Application to Fast Food Restaurant Consumption|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327663JCP0902_4|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=9|issue=2|pages=97–106|doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp0902_4|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that people from different cultures weight subjective norms and existing attitudes differently. A closer examination of the cross-cultural communication process will benefit and complete the understanding of theory of reasoned action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Hee Sun|year=2000|title=Relationships among attitudes and subjective norms: Testing the theory of reasoned action across cultures|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/233197325/fulltext/261DC8DF13FF4427PQ/1?accountid=11091|journal=Communication Studies|volume=|pages=162–175|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Future Directions'''

According to Jaccard James, three directions are waiting for further research in TRA. The first one is per-individual level. The second area is a split-second situations, namely, instant decision-making. The third one is multioption contexts. In other words, how people perform when facing multiple alternatives should be stressed in the future study.&lt;ref&gt;Jaccard, J. (2012). The Reasoned Action Model: Directions for Future Research. ''The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,640''(1), 58-80. &lt;/ref&gt;

A 1944 illustration by [[Thomas C. Lea III]] of [[World War II]]: "[[Thousand-yard stare|The 2000 Yard Stare]]".]]

The use of '''war as metaphor''' is a longstanding literary and rhetorical [[Trope (literature)|trope]]. In political usage, [[war]] [[metaphor]]s are used to manage a perceived societal problem, with the concept taking the place of an individual or state enemy in true war.

[[James Childress]] describes the use of war as a metaphor as a dilemma: "In debating social policy through the language of war, we often forget the moral reality of war."&lt;ref name="jfc"/&gt; One fundamental problem is that it is often unclear when the "war" is over.&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt;

The [[Cultural Revolution]] in China 1966−1976, which initially was launched as a "War against Revisionism", is a discouraging example of a metaphorical war against "-isms".&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of war used as a metaphor, often on the form "War on..." or "War against...":

* "[[Customs war]]", also known as a "toll war" or "tariff war", a type of economic conflict between two or more states.
* "[[Trade war]]"
* "[[War on crime|War on Crime]]", 1930s, [[J. Edgar Hoover]]
* "[[Cold War]]" (1947—1991), a period of hostility between the two dominant [[superpower]]s at the time, the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Cold War in itself was never a war, but several [[proxy war]]s were carried out by both sides over the period.
* The [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966−1976) in China was launched as a "War against Revisionism"&lt;ref name="sr-20160518"/&gt; Marshall [[ Lin Biao]] is given credit for inspiring war metaphors when he said in 1965, at the outset of the movement, "The battlefield of the Cultural Revolution cannot call a ceasefire. This is a war without that option."&lt;ref&gt; {{citation|author=Xing Lu|title=Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA91|date=January 2004|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-543-2|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] announced that the United States was no longer pursuing a War on Terror, as the military focus should be on specific enemies rather than a tactic.
