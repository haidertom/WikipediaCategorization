'''Ambiguous images''' or '''reversible figures''' are [[optical illusion]] images which exploit graphical similarities and other properties of [[visual system]] interpretation between two or more distinct image forms. These are famous for inducing the phenomenon of [[multistable perception]]. Multistable perception is the occurrence of an image being able to provide multiple, although stable, perceptions. Classic examples of this are the [[Rabbit–duck illusion|rabbit-duck]] and the [[Rubin vase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parkkonen | first1 = L. | last2 = Andersson | first2 = J. | last3 = Hämäläinen | first3 = M. | last4 = Hari | first4 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Early visual brain areas reflect the percept of an ambiguous scene | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 51| pages = 20500–20504 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0810966105 | pmid=19074267 | pmc=2602606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambiguous images are important to the field of psychology because they are often research tools used in experiments.&lt;ref name="wimmer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = M. | last2 = Doherty | first2 = M. | year = 2011 | title = The development of ambiguous figure perception: Vi. conception and perception of ambiguous figures | url = | journal = Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development | volume = 76 | issue = 1| pages = 87–104 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5834.2011.00595.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is varying evidence on whether ambiguous images can be represented mentally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mast | first1 = F.W. | last2 = Kosslyn | first2 = S.M. | year = 2002 | title = Visual mental images can be ambiguous: Insights from individual differences in spatial transformation abilities | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 57–70 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00137-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a majority of research has theorized that they cannot be properly represented mentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chambers | first1 = D. | last2 = Reisberg | first2 = D. | year = 1985 | title = Can mental images be ambiguous? | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 317–328 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.11.3.317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The rabbit-duck image seems to be one of the earliest of this type;  first published in ''Fliegende Blätter'', a German humor magazine (Oct. 23, 1892, p.&amp;nbsp;147).

==Identifying and resolving ambiguous images==
Middle vision is the stage in visual processing that combines all the basic features in the scene into distinct, recognizable object groups. This stage of vision comes before high-level vision (understanding the scene) and after early vision (determining the basic features of an image). When perceiving and recognizing images, mid-level vision comes into use when we need to classify the object we are seeing. Higher-level vision is used when the object classified must now be recognized as a specific member of its group. For example, through mid-level vision we perceive a face, then through high-level vision we recognize a face of a familiar person. Mid-level vision and high-level vision are crucial for understanding a reality that is filled with ambiguous perceptual inputs.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;Wolfe, J., Kluender, K., &amp; Levi, D. (2009). Sensation and perception. (2 ed.). Sunderland: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceiving the image in mid-level vision==
When we see an image, the first thing we do is attempt to organize all the parts of the scene into different groups.&lt;ref name="halko"&gt;Halko, M.A. Illusory contour and surface completion mechanisms in human visual cortex. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 3303. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/621754807&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, one of the most basic methods used is finding the edges. Edges can include obvious perceptions such as the edge of a house, and can include other perceptions that the brain needs to process deeper, such as the edges of a person's facial features. When finding edges, the brain's visual system detects a point on the image with a sharp contrast of lighting. Being able to detect the location of the edge of an object aids in recognizing the object. In ambiguous images, detecting edges still seems natural to the person perceiving the image. However, the brain undergoes deeper processing to resolve the ambiguity. For example, consider an image that involves an opposite change in magnitude of luminance between the object and the background (e.g. From the top, the background shifts from black to white, and the object shifts from white to black). The opposing [[gradient]]s will eventually come to a point where there is an equal degree of luminance of the object and the background. At this point, there is no edge to be perceived. To counter this, the visual system connects the image as a whole rather than a set of edges, allowing one to see an object rather than edges and non-edges. Although there is no complete image to be seen, the brain is able to accomplish this because of its understanding of the physical world and real incidents of ambiguous lighting.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt;

[[Image:Kanizsa triangle.svg|thumb|225px|right|"Kanizsa Triangle". These spatially separate fragments give the impression of illusory contours (also known as modal completion) of a triangle]]
In ambiguous images, an illusion is often produced from [[illusory contours]]. An illusory contour is a perceived contour without the presence of a physical gradient. In examples where a white shape appears to occlude black objects on a white background, the white shape appears to be brighter than the background, and the edges of this shape produce the illusory contours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bradley | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Dumais | first2 = S.T. | year = 1975 | title = Ambiguous cognitive contours | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 257 | issue = 5527| pages = 582–584 | doi = 10.1038/257582a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These illusory contours are processed by the brain in a similar way as real contours.&lt;ref name="halko"/&gt; The visual system accomplishes this by making inferences beyond the information that is presented in much the same way as the luminance gradient.

==Gestalt grouping rules==
In mid-level vision, the visual system utilizes a set of heuristic methods, called [[Gestalt grouping rules]], to quickly identify a basic perception of an object that helps to resolve an ambiguity.&lt;ref name="wimmer"/&gt; This allows perception to be fast and easy by observing patterns and familiar images rather than a slow process of identifying each part of a group. This aids in resolving ambiguous images because the visual system will accept small variations in the pattern and still perceive the pattern as a whole. The Gestalt grouping rules are the result of the experience of the visual system. Once a pattern is perceived frequently, it is stored in memory and can be perceived again easily without the requirement of examining the entire object again.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt; For example, when looking at a chess board, we perceive a checker pattern and not a set of alternating black and white squares.

===Good continuation===
The principle of good continuation provides the visual system a basis for identifying continuing edges. This means that when a set of lines is perceived, there is a tendency for a line to continue in one direction. This allows the visual system to identify the edges of a complex image by identifying points where lines cross. For example, two lines crossed in an "X" shape will be perceived as two lines travelling diagonally rather than two lines changing direction to form "V" shapes opposite to each other. An example of an ambiguous image would be two curving lines intersecting at a point. This junction would be perceived the same way as the "X", where the intersection is seen as the lines crossing rather than turning away from each other. Illusions of good continuation are often used by magicians to trick audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bamhart | first1 = A.S. | year = 2010 | title = The exploitation of gestalt principles by magicians | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 39 | issue = 9| pages = 1286–1289 | doi = 10.1068/p6766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarity===
The rule of similarity states that images that are similar to each other can be grouped together as being the same type of object or part of the same object. Therefore, the more similar two images or objects are, the more likely it will be that they can be grouped together. For example, two squares among many circles will be grouped together. They can vary in similarity of colour, size, orientation and other properties, but will ultimately be grouped together with varying degrees of membership.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt;

===Proximity, common region, and connectedness===
[[File:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of Proximity]]
The grouping property of ''proximity (Gestalt)'' is the spatial distance between two objects. The closer two objects are, the more likely they belong to the same group. This perception can be ambiguous without the person perceiving it as ambiguous. For example, two objects with varying distances and orientations from the viewer may appear to be proximal to each other, while a third object may be closer to one of the other objects but appear farther.

Objects occupying a common region on the image appear to already be members of the same group. This can include unique spatial location, such as two objects occupying a distinct region of space outside of their group's own. Objects can have close proximity but appear as though part of a distinct group through various visual aids such as a threshold of colours separating the two objects.

Additionally, objects can be visually connected in ways such as drawing a line going from each object. These similar but hierarchical rules suggest that some Gestalt rules can override other rules.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt;

==Texture segmentation and figure-ground assignments==
The visual system can also aid itself in resolving ambiguities by detecting the pattern of texture in an image. This is accomplished by using many of the Gestalt principles. The texture can provide information that helps to distinguish whole objects, and the changing texture in an image reveals which distinct objects may be part of the same group. Texture segmentation rules often both cooperate and compete with each other, and examining the texture can yield information about the layers of the image, disambiguating the background, foreground, and the object.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, X.A model for figure-ground segmentation by self-organized cue integration. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 3245. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/621577763&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size and surroundedness===
When a region of texture completely surrounds another region of texture, it is likely the background. Additionally, the smaller regions of texture in an image are likely the figure.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt;

===Parallelism and symmetry===
[[Angle of parallelism|Parallelism]] is another way to disambiguate the figure of an image. The orientation of the contours of different textures in an image can determine which objects are grouped together. Generally, parallel contours suggest membership to the same object or group of objects. Similarly, symmetry of the contours can also define the figure of an image.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt;

===Extremal edges and relative motion===
An extremal edge is a change in texture that suggests an object is in front of or behind another object. This can be due to a shading effect on the edges of one region of texture, giving the appearance of depth. Some extremal edge effects can overwhelm the segmentations of surroundedness or size. The edges perceived can also aid in distinguishing objects by examining the change in texture against an edge due to motion.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt;

====Using ambiguous images to hide in the real world: camouflage====
In nature, [[camouflage]] is used by organisms to escape predators. This is achieved through creating an ambiguity of texture segmentation by imitating the surrounding environment. Without being able to perceive noticeable differences in texture and position, a predator will be unable to see their victim.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt;

==Occlusion==
Many ambiguous images are produced through some occlusion, wherein an object's texture suddenly stops. An occlusion is the [[visual perception]] of one object being behind or in front of another object, providing information about the order of the layers of texture.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt; The illusion of occlusion is apparent in the effect of illusory contours, where occlusion is perceived despite being non-existent. Here, an ambiguous image is perceived to be an instance of occlusion. When an object is occluded, the visual system only has information about the parts of the object that can be seen, so the rest of the processing must be done deeper and must involve memory.

==Accidental viewpoints==
An accidental viewpoint is a single visual position that produces an ambiguous image. The accidental viewpoint does not provide enough information to distinguish what the object is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koning | first1 = A. | last2 = van Lier | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = No symmetry advantage when object matching involves accidental viewpoints | url = | journal = Psychological Research/Psychologische Forschung | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 52–58 | doi = 10.1007/s00426-004-0191-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, this image is perceived incorrectly and produces an illusion that differs from reality. For example, an image may be split in half, with the top half being enlarged and placed further away from the perceiver in space. This image will be perceived as one complete image from only a single viewpoint in space, rather than the reality of two separate halves of an object.  Street artists often use tricks of point-of-view to create 2-dimensional scenes on the ground that appear 3-dimensional.

==Recognizing an object through high-level vision==
[[File:Schroeder's stairs.svg|thumb|[[Schroeder's stairs]]]]

To go further than just perceiving the object is to recognize the object. Recognizing an object plays a crucial role in resolving ambiguous images, and relies heavily on memory and prior knowledge. To recognize an object, the visual system detects familiar components of it, and compares the perceptual representation of it with a representation of the object stored in memory.&lt;ref name="halko"/&gt; This can be done using various templates of an object, such as "dog" to represent dogs in general. The template method is not always successful because members of a group may significantly differ visually from each other, and may look much different if viewed from different angles. To counter the problem of viewpoint, the visual system detects familiar components of an object in 3-dimensional space. If the components of an object perceived are in the same position and orientation of an object in memory, recognition is possible.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt; Research has shown that people that are more creative in their imagery are better able to resolve ambiguous images. This may be due to their ability to quickly identify patterns in the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riquelme | first1 = H | year = 2002 | title = Can people creative in imagery interpret ambiguous figures faster than people less creative in imagery? | url = | journal = The Journal of Creative Behavior | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 105–116 | doi = 10.1002/j.2162-6057.2002.tb01059.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; When making a [[mental representation]] of an ambiguous image, in the same way as normal images, each part is defined and then put onto the mental representation. The more complex the scene is, the longer it takes to process and add to the representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kosslyn | first1 = S.M. | last2 = Reiser | first2 = B.J. | last3 = Farah | first3 = M.J. | last4 = Fliegel | first4 = S.L. | year = 1983 | title = Generating visual images: Units and relations | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 112 | issue = 2| pages = 278–303 | doi = 10.1037/0096-3445.112.2.278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Necker cube.svg|thumb|The Necker Cube: a wire frame cube with no depth cues.]]
Figures drawn in a way that avoids depth cues may become ambiguous.
Classic examples of this phenomenon are the [[Necker cube]],&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt; and the [[rhombille tiling]] (viewed as an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] drawing of cubes).

===Using memory and recent experience===
Our memory has a large impact on resolving an ambiguous image, as it helps the visual system to identify and recognize objects without having to analyze and categorize them repeatedly. Without memory and prior knowledge, an image with several groups of similar objects will be difficult to perceive. Any object can have an ambiguous representation and can be mistakenly categorized into the wrong groups without sufficient memory recognition of an object. This finding suggests that prior experience is necessary for proper perception.&lt;ref name="daelli"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daelli | first1 = V. | last2 = van Rijsbergen | first2 = N.J. | last3 = Treves | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = How recent experience affects the perception of ambiguous objects | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1322 | issue = | pages = 81–91 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.01.060 | pmid=20122901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have been done with the use of [[Greeble (psychology)|Greebles]] to show the role of memory in object recognition.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt; The act of priming the participant with an exposure to a similar visual stimulus also has a large effect on the ease of resolving an ambiguity.&lt;ref name="daelli"/&gt;

==Disorders in perception==
[[Prosopagnosia]] is a disorder that causes a person to be unable to identify faces. The visual system undergoes mid-level vision and identifies a face, but high-level vision fails to identify who the face belongs to. In this case, the visual system identifies an ambiguous object, a face, but is unable to resolve the ambiguity using memory, leaving the affected unable to determine who they are seeing.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt;

'''Biopower''' (or ''biopouvoir'' in French) is a term coined by French [[scholar]], [[historian]], and [[social theorist]] [[Michel Foucault]]. It relates to the practice of modern [[nation states]] and their regulation of their subjects through "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the [[control of populations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault first used the term in his lecture courses at the [[Collège de France]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977&amp;ndash;1978'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4; see notes on p.&amp;nbsp;24, notes&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Society Must Be Defended'' Lectures at the Collège de France 1975&amp;ndash;1976 p.&amp;nbsp;243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; but the term first appeared in print in ''The Will To Knowledge'', Foucault's first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, (1998) ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; In Foucault's work, it has been used to refer to practices of public health, regulation of heredity, and risk regulation, among many other regulatory mechanisms often linked less directly with literal [[physical health]]. It is closely related to a term he uses much less frequently, but which subsequent thinkers have taken up independently, [[biopolitics]], which aligns more closely with the examination of the strategies and mechanisms through which human life processes are managed under regimes of authority over knowledge, power, and the processes of subjectivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anthrobiopolitics.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/biopolitics-an-overview/|title=Biopolitics: An Overview|date=2013-01-21|work=The Anthropology of Biopolitics|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foucault's conception ==

For Foucault, biopower is a [[technology]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] for managing [[humans]] in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations. It refers to the control of human bodies through an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' and ''biopolitics of the population'' through societal ''[[Disciplinary institutions]]''. Initially imposed from outside whose source remains elusive to further investigation both by the social sciences and the humanities, and in fact, you could argue will remain elusive as long as both disciplines use their current research methods. Modern power, according to Foucault's analysis, becomes [[encoded]] into social practices as well as human behavior as the human subject gradually acquiesces to subtle regulations and expectations of the social order. It is an integral feature and essential to the workings of—and makes possible—the emergence of the modern [[nation state]], [[capitalism]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v013/13.1.policante.html|title=Amedeo Policante. "War against Biopower: Timely Reflections on an Historicist Foucault", ''Theory &amp; Event'', 13. 1 March 2010|publisher=Muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biopower is literally having power over bodies; it is "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin. p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault elaborates further in his lecture courses on biopower entitled ''Security, Territory, Population'' delivered at the Collège de France between January and April 1978:

{{cquote|By this I mean a number of phenomena that seem to me to be quite significant, namely, the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of power, or, in other words, how, starting from the 18th century, modern Western societies took on board the fundamental biological fact that human beings are a species. This is what I have called biopower.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 1 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It relates to governmental concerns of fostering the life of the population, "an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' a global mass that is affected by overall characteristics specific to life, like birth, death, production, illness, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature Vol 490'' p. 309, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It produces a generalized disciplinary society&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 377-378, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and ''regulatory controls'' through ''biopolitics of the population''".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.,&amp;nbsp;378 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population’’, see also note 71, p. 397 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History Of Sexuality Vol 1'' p.&amp;nbsp;139 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In his lecture ''Society Must Be Defended'', Foucault examines ''biopolitical state racism'', and its accomplished rationale of myth-making and narrative. Here he states the fundamental difference between biopolitics&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;91 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and discipline:

{{cquote|Where discipline is the technology deployed to make individuals behave, to be efficient and productive workers, biopolitics is deployed to manage population; for example, to ensure a healthy workforce.&lt;ref&gt;''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.&amp;nbsp;239&amp;ndash;64 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that the previous [[Greco-Roman]], [[Medieval]] rule of the [[Roman emperor]], the [[Divine right of kings]], [[Absolute monarchy]] and the [[popes]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;401 2007&lt;/ref&gt; model of power and social control over the body was an individualising mode based on a singular individual, primarily the king, [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]], pope and Roman emperor. However, after the emergence of the medieval metaphor [[body politic]] which meant society as a whole with the ruler, in this case the king, as the head of society with the so-called [[Estates of the realm]] and the Medieval [[Roman Catholic Church]] next to the monarch with the majority of the peasant population or feudal serfs at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid. This meaning of the metaphor was then codified into medieval law for the offense of [[high treason]] and if found guilty the sentence of [[Hanged, drawn and quartered]] was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;''A declaration which offences shall be adjudged treason (25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2)'' 1351 "When a man does compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his Queen, or their eldest son and heir."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an excellent account of this legislation see John Barrell ''Imagining The King's Death Figurative Treason, Fantasies of Regicide, 1793-1796'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was drastically altered in 18th century Europe with the advent and realignment of modern political power as opposed to the ancient world and Medieval version of [[political power]]. The mass democracy of the Liberal western world and the voting franchise was added to the mass population; [[liberal democracy]] and [[Political parties]]; universal adult suffrage-exclusively male at this time, then extended to women in Europe in 1929(most certainly as late as 1971 in Switzerland see [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland]]), and extending to people of African descent in America with the abolition of the infamous [[Jim Crow laws]] in 1964 (see [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]).

The emergence of the human sciences and its subsequent direction, during the 16th and 18th centuries, primarily aimed at the modern Western man and the society he inhabits, aided the development of ''[[Disciplinary institutions|Disciplinary institution]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;16 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore, Foucault cites the human sciences, particularly the medical sciences, led to the advent of ''anatomo-politics of the human body,'' a biopolitics and bio-history of man.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault Bio-history and Biopolitics ''Foucault Studies, No. 18, pp. 128‐130, October 2014'' Originally published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' October 1976 which was written as a review essay in response to [[Arthur Jensen]] overt racism and Foucault's great friend [[Jacques Ruffié]] response to Jensen's racist viewpoint, De la biologie à la culture [From biology to culture]&lt;/ref&gt; A transition occurred through forcible removal of various European monarchs into a "scientific" state apparatus and the radical overhaul of judiciary practices coupled with the reinvention and division of those who were to be punished.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;163&amp;ndash;90 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A second mode for seizure of power was developed as a type of power that was [[stochastic]] and "massifying" rather than "individualizing". By "massifying" Foucault means transforming into a population ("population state"),&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.55-86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with an extra added impetus of a governing mechanism in the form of a scientific machinery and apparatus. This scientific mechanism which we now know as the [[state (polity)|State]] "governs less" of the population and concentrates more on administrating external devices. Foucault then reminds us that this ''anatomo-biopoltics'' of the body (and human life) and the population correlates with the new founded knowledge of sciences and the 'new' politics of modern society, masquerading as liberal democracy, where life (biological life) itself became not only a deliberate political strategy but an economic, political and scientific problem, both for the [[Mathematical sciences]] and the [[Biological sciences]]–coupled together with the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And I think that one of the greatest transformations political right underwent in the 19th century was precisely that, I wouldn't say exactly that sovereignty's old right-to take life or let live-was replaced, but it came to be complemented by a new right which does not erase the old right but which penetrate it, permeate. To say that power took possession of life in the nineteenth century, or to say that power at least takes life under its care in the nineteenth century, is to say that it has, thanks to the play of technologies of discipline on the one hand and technologies of regulation on the other, succeeded in covering the whole surface that lies between the organic and the biological, between body and population. We are, then, in a power that has taken control of both the body and life or that has, if you like, taken control of life in general – with the body as one pole and the population as the other. What we are dealing with in this new technology of power is not exactly society (or at least not the social body, as defined by the jurists), nor is it the individual body. It is a new body, a multiple body, a body with so many heads that, while they might not be infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted. Biopolitics deals with the population, with the population as a political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific and political, as a biological problem and as power’s problem I would like in fact like to trace the transformation not at the level of political theory, but rather at the level of the mechanisms, techniques, and technologies of power. We saw the emergence of techniques of power that were essentially centered on the body, on the individual body. They included all devices that were used to ensure the spatial distribution of individuals bodies (their separation, their alignment, their serialization, and their surveillance)and the organization, around those individuals, of a whole field of visibility. They were also techniques that could be used to take control over bodies. Attempts were made to increase their productive force through exercise, drill, and so on. They were also techniques for rationalizing and strictly economizing on a power that had to be used in the least costly way possible, thanks to whole system of surveillance, hierarchies, inspections, book-keeping, and reports-all the technology of labor. It was established at the end of the seventeenth century, and in the course of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.241-244 and p.252 1975&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that nation states, police, government, legal practices, human sciences and medical institutions have their own rationale, cause and effects, strategies, technologies, mechanisms and codes and have managed successfully in the past to obscure their workings by hiding behind observation and scrutiny. Foucault insists social institutions such as governments, laws, religion, politics, social administration, monetary institutions, military institutions cannot have the same rigorous practices and procedure with claims to independent knowledge like those of the human and 'hard' sciences, such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, genetics, and biology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Lang]] Challenges pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;222 See Chapter Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case (Serge Lang refers to his dispute with [[Samuel P. Huntington]] at the [[National Academy of Sciences]]) (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault sees these differences in techniques as nothing more than "behaviour control technologies", and modern biopower as nothing more than a series of webs and networks working its way around the societal body.

However, Foucault argues the exercise of power in the service of maximizing life carries a dark underside. When the state is invested in protecting the life of the population, when the stakes are life itself, anything can be justified. Groups identified as the threat to the existence of the life of the nation or of humanity can be eradicated with impunity.

{{cquote|If [[genocide]] is indeed the dream of modern power, this is not because of the recent return to the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of the population.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Sexuality'' Volume 1 p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== ''Milieu intérieur'' ==

Foucault concentrates his attention on what he calls the major political and social project namely the [[Milieu intérieur|Milieu]] (the environment within). How did the project milieu become interwoven into the political and social relations of men? Foucault takes as his starting point from the 16th century right up until the 18th century with the milieu culminating into the founding disciplines of science, mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;296 p.&amp;nbsp;308 Note 14 2007&lt;/ref&gt; political economy and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;29-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault makes an explicit point on the value of secrecy of government (''arcana imperii,'' from the Latin which means secrecy of power, secrets of the empire which goes back to the time of the Roman empire in the age of Tacitus) coined by [[Jean Bodin]]. Which, Foucault argues, had to be incorporated into a politics of truth. Foucault insist; in referring to the term 'public opinion'('politics of truth'),the concept of truth refers to the term 'regimes of truth'.In which Foucault mentions a group called ''The Ideologues'' where the term ''[[Ideology]]'' first appears and is taken from.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McCaffery ''Who were the Ideologues? How Influential Were They?'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, pp.&amp;nbsp;83&amp;ndash;84, note&amp;nbsp;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is through 'regimes of truth' Foucault argues that [[raison d'état]] achieves its political and biological success.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;275&amp;ndash;78, p.&amp;nbsp;283, notes&amp;nbsp;63&amp;ndash;64 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Here the modern version of government is presented to the population in the national media, both in the electronic medium-television and radio-and especially in the written press, as the modicum of efficiency, fiscal optimisation, political responsibility, and fiscal rigorousness. Thus, a public discourse of government solidarity emerges and social consensus is emphasised through these four points. What general components were essential and necessary to make this consensus happen? Foucault traces the first dynamics, the first historical dimensions belonging to the early Middle Ages.

One major thinker which forms a parallel with Foucault’s own work is the Medieval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' pp.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;ndash;29 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Parrhesia:A Journal of Critical Philosophy'' 5 pp.&amp;nbsp;9&amp;ndash;18 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Discipline and Punish'' p.&amp;nbsp;330 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Golczewski ''Sovereign Right, Democracy and the Rule of Law'' Universitas 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz mentions a Medieval device known as the [[body politic]] (the king's two bodies). This Medieval device was so well received by legal theorists and lawyers of the day that it was incorporated and codified into Medieval society and institutions (Kantorowicz mentions the term [[Corporation]] which would later become known to us as [[capitalism]], an economic category).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Kantorowicz ''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;273&amp;ndash;313 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz also refers to the [[Glossator]]'s belonging to a well-known branch of legal schools in medieval Europe, experts in jurisprudence and law science, appeal of treason, The [[Lords Appellant]] and the commentaries of jurist [[Edmund Plowden]]&lt;ref&gt;The commentaries, or Reports of [[Edmund Plowden]] 1561&lt;/ref&gt; and his Plowden Reports.&lt;ref&gt;Duchy Of Lancaster (1561) 1 Plowden 212,213.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kantorowicz analysis, a Medieval Political theology emerged throughout the Middle Ages which provided the modern basis for the democratisation of the [[hereditary succession]] of a wealthy elite and for our own modern political hierarchical order ([[Politicians]]) and their close association with the wealthy nobility.&lt;ref&gt;''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;42&amp;ndash;78 and pp.&amp;nbsp;87&amp;ndash;107 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, the democratisation of [[Sovereignty]], which is known in modern political terms as "[[Liberal democracy]]". Kantorowicz argues a Medieval triumvirate appears(with the support of the legal machine), a private enterprise of wealth and succession both supporting the fixed hierarchical order reserved exclusively for the nobility and their descendants, and the monarch and her/his heirs. Co-operation was needed by the three groups—the Monarchy, the Church, and the [[Nobility]]—in an uneasy Medieval alliance and at times, it appeared fractious.&lt;ref&gt;According to Sidney Madge the King wasn't the major land owner in medieval Christendom, Madge quite clearly and brilliantly shows at least in one instance the king was only third in line and he had to share that right with others.''The Domesday Of Crown Lands'', pp. 20–21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Much of Madge's information comes from [[Charles Henry Pearson]] meticulous study of the [[domesday]] records.{{Cite book|title=History Of England During The Early Middles Ages Volume 1 1867|last=Charles Henry Pearson|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}. Madge places the barons majority ownership of all land at 50.5% in 1086 (in 1065 it was 50.7%) by the time of the [[Norman conquest]] the monarch of the day—according to Madge analysis of Pearson's work the king wasn't, by all accounts, the major land owner; his percentage share was just 20.5% in 1065 before the conquest and dropped to 19.9% after the conquest in 1086. Moreover, the monarch had to share that right with the powerful [[Roman Catholic]] church of the day (the church's share was 28.8% in 1065; at the end of the conquest in 1086 it was 29.6%). This necessitated an efficient accountancy, and auditing system based on the basic premise: what was the overall fiscal responsibility and liability of the Exchequer, Treasury and the whole kingdom of the realm (kingdom in this case means the Barons and the church who funded the King's expenditure) and its ruler the King known as the [[Barons of the exchequer]], run, supervised and organized by the barons of the day.Sidney J Madge, The Domesday Of Crown Lands, pp.&amp;nbsp;20&amp;ndash;21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, it was never a smooth arrangement; see [[Barons war]].

What is the reasoning behind the whole population subservience with the worshiping of state emblems, symbols and related mechanisms with their associates who represent the institutional mechanism (democratization of sovereignty); where fierce loyalty from the population is presented, in modern times as universal admiration for the president, the monarch, the [[Pope]] and the prime minister, one could argue is it irony or fierce logic that dictates this sort of behaviour. Well, which one is it? Foucault would argue that while all the cost benefits were met by the new founded urban population in the form of production and [[Political power]] that it is precisely this type of behaviour which keeps the well-oiled machine smoothly ticking over and ultimately giving the [[Nation state]] not only its rationale but its "governing less" impenetrable apparatus. In other words, it is dictated by our own inherited political rationality which gives the false impression and appearance of joint solidarity giving the machine (Foucault uses the term [[Dispositif]]) not only legitimacy but an air of invincibility from its main primary sources: reason, truth, freedom, and human existence.

Foucault makes special note on the biological "naturalness" of the human species and the new founded scientific interest that was developing around not only with the species interaction with milieu and technology, but most importantly, technology operating as system not as so often portrayed by the political and social sciences which insisted on technology operating as social improvement. Both milieu, natural sciences and technology, allied with the characteristics surrounding social organization and increasingly the categorization of the sciences to help deal with this "naturalness" of milieu and of the inscription of truth onto nature. Due to Foucault's discussions with [[Georges Canguilhem]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;26-27, see notes 37&amp;ndash;38, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault notices that not only was milieu now a newly discovered scientific biological naturalness ever-present in Lamarckian Biology the notion (biological naturalness) was actually invented and imported from Newtonian mechanics ([[Classical mechanics]]) via [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] due to Buffon mentorship and friendship with [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and used by Biology in the middle of the 18th century borrowing from Newton the explanatory model of an organic reaction through the action of "milieu Newtonian" physics used by [[Isaac Newton]] and the Newtonians.&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;20, pp.&amp;nbsp;26&amp;ndash;27, see notes 33 and 37, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Humans (the species being mentioned in Marx) were now both the object of this newly discovered scientific and "natural" truth and new categorization, but subjected to it allied by laws, both scientific and [[natural law]] (scientific [[Jurisprudence]]), the state's mode of governmental rationality to the will of its population. But, most importantly, interaction with the social environment and social interactions with others and the modern nation state's interest in the populations well-being and the destructive capability that the state possess in its armoury and it was with the group who called themselves the ''[[Economist|économistes]]''&lt;ref&gt;officially known as the [[Physiocrats]], see ''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34&amp;ndash;53, pp.&amp;nbsp;55-86, p.&amp;nbsp;52, note&amp;nbsp;17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Vincent de Gournay]], [[François Quesnay]], [[François Véron Duverger de Forbonnais]], and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]])&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention of [[Vincent de Gournay]] in Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;51, note&amp;nbsp;15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;333&amp;ndash;61, pp.&amp;nbsp;348&amp;ndash;49, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who continued with the rationalization of this "naturalness". Foucault notices that this "naturalness" continues and is extended further with the advent of 18th century political society with the new founded implement "population" and their (political population) association with raison d'état.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, p.&amp;nbsp;81, note&amp;nbsp;19, and pp.&amp;nbsp;285&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blunt instrument''' is any solid [[Physical body|object]] used as a [[weapon]], which damages its target by applying direct mechanical force, and has no penetrating point or edge, or is wielded so that the point or edge is not the part of the weapon that inflicts the injury. Blunt instruments may be contrasted with [[edged weapon]]s, which inflict injury by cutting or stabbing, or [[projectile weapons]], where the projectiles, such as [[bullet]]s or [[arrow]]s, are accelerated to a damaging speed.

Blunt instruments typically inflict [[blunt force trauma]], causing bruising, fractures and other internal bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1680107|Forensic Autopsy of Blunt Force Trauma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the parts of the body attacked, [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s may be ruptured or otherwise damaged. Attacks with a blunt instrument may be fatal.

Some sorts of blunt instruments are very readily available, and often figure in [[crime]] cases.  Examples of blunt instruments include:

* Personal implements such as [[walking stick]]s
* Tools such as [[hammer]]s, [[Crowbar (tool)|wrecking bar]]s, [[pipe wrench]]es, or heftier [[flashlight]]s such as the [[Maglite]] or [[Kel-Lite]].
* Parts of tools, such as [[pickaxe handle]]s
* Sports equipment such as [[cricket bat|cricket]] or [[baseball bat]]s, [[hockey stick]]s, [[pool cue]]s, [[golf club]]s, etc.
* Weapons such as [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]]s, [[bâton français|bâtons français]], [[axe]]s, [[spear]]s (using the haft), or [[gun]]s (see [[firearm as a blunt weapon]])
* Other items, such as [[millwall brick]]s or [[tree]] [[branch]]es

The '''Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue''', otherwise known as the [[Henry Dunant]] Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, or HD, is a private diplomacy organisation based in [[Switzerland]] that assists in [[mediation]] between conflicting parties to prevent or end armed conflicts.&lt;ref name=HDC&gt;

Founded in 1999, the aim of the organisation is to promote and facilitate dialogue among the leadership of the main belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It also conducts research and analysis on mediation and [[peacemaking]] in support of its operational work to improve international efforts to secure and sustain peace. To do so, HD opens channels of communication and mediates between parties in conflict, as well as facilitates dialogue and provides support to the broader mediation and peacebuilding community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/centre-humanitarian-dialogue|website=Geneva Peacebuilding Platform|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HD will facilitate dialogue in both confidential settings as well as public ones.

It is headquartered in Geneva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/centre-humanitarian-dialogue-hd-centre-0|website=International Geneva|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also the location of its Middle East and North Africa programme. HD has regional offices in Africa and Asia.

==History==
The initial intention of HD was to explore new concepts of humanitarian innovation by serving as a venue for dialogue on humanitarian issues - where discreet discussions could take place among those who could have a practical impact on humanitarian policy and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The organisation evolved this approach to include negotiations in support of humanitarian objectives&lt;ref name="discreetcharms"&gt;{{cite web
 | title =The discreet charms of the international go-betweens
 | publisher =The Economist
 | date =3 July 2008
 | url =http://www.economist.com/node/11670918
 | accessdate =24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aimed to create space for humanitarian activities in conflict environments. It quickly broadened, at the behest of conflicting parties in Aceh,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The discreet charms of the international go-betweens&lt;/ref&gt; to include the resolution of the conflict through mediation and conflict prevention.

In July 2015, in recognition of its important role in the mediation of armed conflicts, HD was granted a special status&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Conseil fédéral conclut un accord sur les privilèges et immunités avec le Centre pour le dialogue humanitaire|url=https://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=fr&amp;msg-id=58018|website=Confederation Suisse|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] of Switzerland. Through this status, HD was awarded certain privileges and immunities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Council concludes agreement with Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue on privileges and immunities|url=http://www.noodls.com/viewNoodl/28941994/federal-department-of-foreign-affairs-of-the-swiss-confedera/federal-council-concludes-agreement-with-centre-for-humanita|accessdate=22 August 2015|agency=Noodls}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
intended to enable its peacemaking efforts worldwide.

===Leadership===
The Founding Executive Director of HD was Martin Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Griffiths|url=http://www.inter-mediate.org/martin_griffiths.html|website=Intermediate|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our staff|url=http://www.eip.org/en/people/staff|website=European Institute for Peace|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the organization for more than 10 years, from 1999 to July 2010, when he stepped down from his position. Griffiths was replaced for a brief period (July 2010 to March 2011) by [[Angelo Gnaedinger]], former Director General of the [[ICRC]] and the then HD Regional Director for the Middle East. Following this transitional period, [[David Harland]] was appointed as HD's new Executive Director in April 2011.

==Activities==
HD aims to bring parties together through mediation and dialogue on issues of common concern in conflict zones.&lt;ref name="Annual Report 2011, p. 2"&gt;Annual Report 2011, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, this includes the following activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Open and maintain channels to or between parties to a conflict;
* Help prepare environments for mediation and the resolution of armed conflict;
* Facilitate dialogue in support of wider mediation and dialogue processes, and;
* Provide support to other mediation initiatives through advice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fritz|first1=Jan Marie|title=Moving Toward a Just Peace: The Mediation Continuum|date=18 November 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400728851|page=263|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=T4bEBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=centre+for+humanitarian+dialogue&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; people and operational assistance.

{{quote|A victim of child sexual abuse is under a great deal of pressure to keep the abuse secret. In many cases of child molestation, the molester has threatened to harm the child or a member of the child's family. The molester might have told the child that he would not be believed even if the child did tell. Another common situation is that the molester will tell the child that if the child tells about the abuse, he will get into trouble. The clear message is given to the child that if another person finds out, something bad will happen to the child. This pressure to maintain silence can often be successfully overcome by establishing open communication between children and adults through a proper educational program for children.&lt;ref name=BSA&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/HealthandSafety/GSS/gss01.aspx Boy Scouts of America official web site Guide to Safe Scouting]. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Prevention==

While it is not always possible to stop every case of clandestine abuse, it may be possible to prevent many incidents through policies in [[youth]] organizations.

The '''social isolation model''' asserts that:
{{quote|violence is possible where a [[Victimology|victim]] is [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolated]] and violent behavior and its effects are unlikely to come to light.  The "two-deep" policy of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] requires that a minimum of two adults be present during all activities to minimize the potential for clandestine abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forensiceducation.com/sourcebooks/glossary/s.htm#45 Forensic glossary]. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

The [[Boy Scouts of America|BSA]] policy states:
{{quote|The Boy Scouts of America has adopted a number of policies aimed at eliminating opportunities for abuse within the Scouting program. These policies focus on leadership selection and on placing barriers to abuse within the program.... ... Two-deep leadership [means that] Two registered adult leaders or one registered leader and a parent of a participant, one of whom must be 21 years of age or older, are required on all trips and outings. The chartered organization is responsible for ensuring that sufficient leadership is provided for all activities.&lt;ref name=BSA /&gt;|}}

Other policies of the BSA state:
{{quote|One-on-one contact between adults and youth members is not permitted. In situations that require personal conferences, such as a Scoutmaster's conference, the meeting is to be conducted in view of other adults and youths.... Adult leaders must respect the privacy of youth members in situations such as changing clothes and taking showers at camp, and intrude only to the extent that health and safety require. Adults must protect their own privacy in similar situations.... When camping, no youth is permitted to sleep in the tent of an adult other than his own parent or guardian.... The Boy Scouts of America does not recognize any secret organizations as part of its program. All aspects of the Scouting program are open to observation by parents and leaders.&lt;ref name=BSA /&gt;|}}

==Drug crimes==
A person, especially a child, may be abused in secret because the victim has witnessed ''another'' clandestine crime, such as a working [[Methamphetamine]] [[laboratory]].&lt;ref name=Meth&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/publications/bulletins/children/ "Children at Clandestine Methamphetamine Labs: Helping Meth’s Youngest Victims", by Karen Wetlow, June 2003, US Department of Justice]. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The FBI concluded that "A coordinated multidisciplinary team is critical to ensure that the needs of meth’s youngest victims are met and that adequate information is available to prosecute child endangerment cases successfully."&lt;ref name=Meth /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">In [[mathematics]], the '''distortion''' is a measure of the amount by which a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the [[Euclidean plane]] to itself distorts circles to ellipses.  If the distortion of a function is equal to one, then it is [[conformal map|conformal]]; if the distortion is bounded and the function is a [[homeomorphism]], then it is [[quasiconformal mapping|quasiconformal]].  The distortion of a function ƒ of the plane is given by

:&lt;math&gt;H(z,f)  = \limsup_{r\to 0}\frac{\max_{|h|=r}|f(z+h)-f(z)|}{\min_{|h|=r}|f(z+h)-f(z)|}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the limiting eccentricity of the ellipse produced by applying ƒ to small circles centered at&amp;nbsp;''z''.  This geometrical definition is often very difficult to work with, and the necessary analytical features can be extrapolated to the following definition.  A mapping ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from an open domain in the plane to the plane has finite distortion at a point ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Ω if ''ƒ'' is in the [[Sobolev space]] W{{su|p=1,1|b=loc}}(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] J(''x'',ƒ) is locally integrable and does not change sign in Ω, and there is a measurable function ''K''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 such that

:&lt;math&gt;|Df(x)|^2 \le K(x)|J(x,f)| &lt;/math&gt;

almost everywhere.  Here ''Df'' is the [[weak derivative]] of ƒ, and |''Df''| is the [[Hilbert–Schmidt norm]].

For functions on a higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, there are more measures of distortion because there are more than two [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] of a symmetric tensor.  The pointwise information is contained in the ''distortion tensor''

:&lt;math&gt;G(x,f) =
\begin{cases}
|J(x,f)^{-2/n}D^Tf(x)Df(x)&amp;\text{if }J(x,f)\not=0\\
I &amp;\text{if }J(x,f)=0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The outer distortion ''K''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; and inner distortion ''K''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; are defined via the [[Rayleigh quotient]]s

:&lt;math&gt;K_O(x) = \sup_{\xi\not=0}\frac{\langle G(x)\xi,\xi\rangle^{n/2}}{|\xi|^n},\quad K_O(x) = \sup_{\xi\not=0}\frac{\langle G^{-1}(x)\xi,\xi\rangle^{n/2}}{|\xi|^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The outer distortion can also be characterized by means of an inequality similar to that given in the two-dimensional case.  If Ω is an open set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then a function {{nowrap|&amp;fnof; &amp;isin; W{{su|p=1,1|b=loc}}(&amp;Omega;,'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} has finite distortion if its Jacobian is locally integrable and does not change sign, and there is a measurable function ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''O''&lt;/sub&gt; (the outer distortion) such that

:&lt;math&gt;|Df(x)|^n \le K_O(x)|J(x,f)| &lt;/math&gt;

almost everywhere.

The '''e-Stewards''' Initiative is an electronics waste recycling standard created by the [[Basel Action Network]].

The program and the organization that created it grew out of the concern that electronic waste generated in wealthy countries was being dismantled in poor countries, often by underage workers. The young workers were being exposed to toxic metals and working in unsafe conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recycling Electronic Wastes in Nigeria |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njihr/vol10/iss3/2 |journal=Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights |volume=10 |issue=3 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, BAN published the e-Stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment which set forth requirements for becoming a Certified e-Stewards Recycler—a program that "recognizes electronics recyclers that adhere to the most stringent environmentally and socially responsible practices when recovering hazardous electronic materials."&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite news |title=Onsite Electronics Recycling earns e-Stewards certification |url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/onsite-electronics-recycling-earns-e-stewards.aspx |accessdate=2 September 2011 |newspaper=Recycling Today |date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recyclers that were qualified under the older Pledge program had until 1 September 2011 to achieve certification to the Standard by an e-Stewards Accredited Certification Body accredited by [[ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB)|ANAB (ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board)]].

==Standard==
The e-Stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment was developed by the [[Basel Action Network]]. It is an industry-specific environmental management system standard that is the basis for the e-Stewards Initiative.   On 6 March 2012, BAN released and updated revised Version 2.0 to open public comment prior to its final adoption later in the spring of 2012.

The certification is available to all electronics recyclers and refurbishers. To achieve an e-Stewards certification organizations are subject to an initial Stage I and Stage II audit.  After passing such audits and being accepted by BAN, yearly surveillance audits take place to ensure organizations with the standard and have a registered [[ISO 14001]] environmental management system in place, as well as achieving numerous performance requirements including assuring no export of hazardous electronic wastes to developing countries, no use of prison labor and no dumping of toxic materials in municipal landfills.

'''''Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits''''', also '''''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits''''' was published on March 13, 1847, by [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The book is divided into three parts just as ''Either/Or'' was in 1843 and many of his other discourses were. Kierkegaard had been working toward creating a place for the concepts of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[sin]] in the conscience of the single individual. He discussed the ideas generated by both [[Johann von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Hegel]] concerning reason and nature. This book is his response to the [[idea]]s that nature and reason are perfect.

The first part of the book is a challenge to those who say they are not guilty of anything. Kierkegaard plays the questioner and asks tough questions throughout the text, such as, "What is patience? Is not patience the courage that freely takes upon itself the suffering that cannot be avoided?" "Are you now living in such a way that you are aware of being a single individual and thereby aware of your eternal responsibility before God." "Is not evil, just like evil people, at odds with itself, divided in itself?" "What is it to be more ashamed before others than before oneself but to be more ashamed of seeming than being?" "Should not he who planted the ear hear? But is not the opposite conclusion just as beautiful and convincing: Should not he whose life is sacrificing love believe that God is love?" "What means do you use to perform your work; is the means just as important to you as the end, just exactly as important?"&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 118, 135, 34, 53, 69–70, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part has to do with the idea that nature  is perfect. He goes back to Job as he did in his [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]. He says, "The silent friends did not compare Job with themselves—this did not happen until their respect (in which they silently held him) ceased and they broke the silence in order to attack the sufferer with speeches, but their presence prompted Job to compare himself with himself. No individual can be present, even though in silence, in such a way that his presence means nothing at all by way of comparison. At best, this can be done by a child, who indeed has a certain likeness to the lilies of the field and the birds of the air." "God isolated the human being, made every human being this separate and distinct individual, which is implied in the unconditional character of those first thoughts. The individual animal is not isolated, is not unconditionally separate entity; the individual animal is a number and belongs under what that most famous pagan thinker has called the animal category: the crowd. The human being who in despair turns away from those first thoughts in order to plunge into the crowd of comparisons makes himself a number, regards himself as a beast, no matter whether he by way of comparison is distinguished or lowly. But with the lilies the worried one is isolated, far away from all human or, perhaps more correctly, inhuman comparisons between individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong pp. 161, 189–191&lt;/ref&gt;

The third part deals with the concept of the abstract and the concrete examples. Kierkegaard wrote of individuals known only as A and B in his first book, ''Either/Or''. He then made them less abstract by making A into the Young Man in ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]'' (1843) and B into his guide, the psychiatrist Constantin Constantius. The same day that he published Repetition he published ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' which showed Abraham as an individual who was alone with God as he considered whether to follow his commands. He continued writing until he came to the concrete human being named [[Christ]] and wrote about the [[joy]] there is in following Christ. He's not against the [[ethics]] of Hegel or the [[aesthetics]] of Goethe but thinks that following Christ is the one thing needful. And that [[double-mindedness]] is the beginning of the sickness of the spirit for the single individual.

==Structure==
The book begins with a dedication just as some of his ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' did, however, this book is not dedicated to his father, but to “That Single Individual”. He published these discourses and later wrote a longer dedication called ''The Crowd is Untruth''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/kierkegaard/untruth/files/untruth.html The Crowd is Untruth]&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt; This, which is now considerably revised and enlarged, was written and intended to accompany the dedication to "that single individual," which is found in "Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits." Copenhagen, Spring 1847.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] translated ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'' by Kierkegaard in 1939, 1962 and included ''My Activity as a Writer'' by Soren Kierkegaard (1851) in the book. Here Kierkegaard wrote, "I attached myself again religiously to "that individual", to whom the next essential work (after the Concluding Postscript) was dedicated. I refer to ''Edifying Discourses in Divers Spirits'', or rather the first part of that book which is an exhortation to confession. Perhaps nobody noticed it the first time I employed the category "that individual", and nobody paid much attention to the fact that it was repeated in stereotyped form in the preface of every number of the ''Edifying Discourses''. Religiously speaking, there is no such thing as a [[public]], but only [[individual]]s; for religion is seriousness and seriousness is the individual."&lt;ref&gt;''The Point of View'' by Walter Lowrie 1939, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

This book has a [[preface]] and Kierkegaard has said to pay attention to the prefaces in his book of the same name. The book also has a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dedication dedication]. Here is the first half of his [[Prefaces|preface]]. Kierkegaard thinks an individual must bring the occasion (the need) along with him or her to become the learner.  {{Quote|Preface: Although this little book (it can be called an occasional discourse, yet without having the occasion that makes the speaker and makes him an authority or the occasion that makes the ''reader'' and makes him a ''learner'') in the situation of actuality is like a fancy, a dream in the daytime, yet it is not without confidence and not without hope of fulfillment. It seeks that single individual, to whom it gives itself wholly, by whom it wishes to be received as if it had arisen in his own heart, that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call ''my'' reader, that single individual, who willingly reads slowly, reads repeatedly, and who reads aloud-for his own sake. If it finds him, then in the remoteness of separation the understanding is complete when he keeps the book and the understanding to himself in the inwardness of appropriation.  P. 5}}

===On the Occasion of a Confession===
''On the Occasion of a Confession''&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, 1847, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993 p. 325–326&lt;/ref&gt; was a postscript to the first section of ''[[Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions]]'' (On the Occasion of a Confessional Service). This section has also been titled ''Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing''&lt;ref&gt;Here Kierkegaard wrote &lt;blockquote&gt;Just as a person should not seek his peace through another human being and should not build upon sand, so it also holds true that he should not rely on any other person's work to convince him that he’s a sinner, but rather to remind him of his own responsibility before God if he does not discover it by himself—any other understanding is diversion. It is only a jest if I would pass judgment on you, but it is a serious matter if you forget that God will pass the judgment. So what is sought is given. God is near enough, but ''no one without purity can see God, and sin is impurity, and therefore no one can become aware of God without becoming a sinner''. The first is a beckoning word, and the gaze of the soul is toward the heights where the goal is, but other words that provide the beginning are immediately heard, and these are depressing words. And yet this is the way it is for the person who wants to understand sin.... "The doctor and the pastor ask about your health, but eternity makes you responsible for your condition." ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' p. 28 Hong translation, Purity of Heart, Streere 1938 p. 209–210&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard asks how an individual can find out if he or she is on the "right" path in life. [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] and [[repentance]] before God is his answer with a warning about [[double-mindedness]]. If a single individual were to ask him or herself all the questions asked in this section and try discover all the evasions used to keep from acting single-mindedly, that person would discover that it is very difficult to say I am innocent. In ''Works of Love'' (1847) he asks his reader to "Imagine an enthusiast who enthusiastically wills only one thing and enthusiastically wants to sacrifice everything for the good."&lt;ref&gt;''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 184ff&lt;/ref&gt; Here he is writing about the inwardness of prayer. He says, {{Quote|God does not find out anything by your confessing, but you, the one confessing do. Much of what you try to keep in obscurity you first get to know by letting an omniscient one become aware of it. Even horrible crimes are committed, even blood is shed, and many times in such a way that it must truly be said of the guilty one: He did not know what he was doing –perhaps he died without, through repentance, ever getting to know what it was he did. Indeed, does passion ever really know what it is doing; is not this its ingratiating temptation and its apparent excuse, this delusive ignorance of itself because at the moment it had forgotten the eternal, because continued in a person it changes his life into nothing but moments, because it perfidiously serves its blinded master while working its way up to make him serve like a blinded slave! Hate and anger and revenge and despondency and depression and despair and fear of the future and trust in the world and faith in oneself and pride that mixes in even with sympathy, and envy that mixes in even with friendship, and the changed but not improved inclination—when this was present in a person, when was it without the delusive excuse of ignorance? If a person continued being ignorant of it, was it not precisely because he also continued being ignorant of an omniscient one?
 
The lazy person always has an inordinate imagination; he promptly thinks of how he is going to arrange things for himself and how comfortable he will be as soon as this and that are done; he thinks less about the fact that it is this and that which he is to do. … He does not think that it is the will a person should lean on, yes, that when everything goes to pieces it is the will a person must cling to. He does not think that the will is the mover but that it itself is to be moved, that it itself is vacillating and therefore must be propped up, that it must be moved and supported by reasons, considerations, the advice of others, experiences, and rules of conduct. 
Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong pp. 23, 73–74}}

He asks, "What does the [[conscience]] want to emphasize by means of the awareness that you are a single individual?" (Hong p.&amp;nbsp;132) He answers this way: &lt;blockquote&gt;To will, in the decision, to be and to remain with the good is truth's brief expression for willing to do everything, and in this expression the equality is maintained that recognizes no distinction with regard to that more essential diversity of life or of the human condition: to be acting or to be suffering, since the one who is suffering can, in the decision, also be with the good. …. With respect to the highest, with respect to willing to do everything, it makes no difference at all, God be praised, how big or how little the task. Oh, how merciful the eternal is to us human beings! Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 79–80&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, in Works of Love, Kierkegaard sums up the essence of what it means to have a pure heart using a metaphors from [[Archimedes]] and the New Testament. {{Quote|Make Christianity your own and it will show you a point outside the world, and by means of this you will move heaven and earth; yes, you will do something even more wonderful, you will move heaven and earth so quietly, so lightly, that no one notices it. The world makes a great noise merely in order to achieve a little change, sets heaven and earth in motion for nothing, like the mountain that gives birth to a mouse-Christianity quietly makes infinity's change as if it were nothing. It is very quiet, as nothing in this world can be; it is very quiet, as only the dead of inwardness can be. Indeed, what else is Christianity but inwardness! Love must be out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of a sincere faith. We choose, however, to concentrate attention on the one provision, that love is a matter of conscience, which essentially contains the other two and to which they essentially refer. ''Works of Love'', Hong pp. 136–137}}

===''What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air'' ===
The first discourse (''To Be Contented with Being a Human Being'') deals with [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comparison comparison] and choice and how to trust God with the choice once made. He may have been echoing Goethe's [[Propylaen]] in which Goethe had written "The youth, when Nature and Art attract him, thinks that with a vigorous effort he can soon penetrate into the innermost sanctuary; the man, after long wanderings, finds himself still in the outer court. Such an observation has suggested our title. It is only on the step, in the gateway, the entrance, the vestibule, the space between the outside and the inner chamber, between the sacred and the common, that we may ordinarily tarry with our friends."&lt;ref&gt;Johann Goethe [http://www.bartleby.com/39/34.html ''Introduction to the Propyläen''] 1798&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard writes about nature differently than Goethe but similarly because both see Nature as teachers of human kind and Kierkegaard wrote very much about "the inner being"; the [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or II p. 167 Hong, Fear and Trembling Hong pp. 60–61, Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 79, Repetition p. 200ff Hong, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 458, 499, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 269ff, 328–329&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard wrote a great story about a lily and a naughty bird. It begins like this: {{Quote|[[File:Lily flower.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]Once upon a time there was a lily that stood in an isolated spot beside a small brook and was well known to some nettles and also to a few other small flowers nearby. The lily was, according to the Gospel's truthful account, more beautifully clothed than Solomon in all his glory and in addition was joyful and free of care all the day long. Imperceptibly and blissfully time slipped by, like running water that murmurs and disappears. It so happened that one day a little bird came and visited the lily; it came again the next day, then stayed away a few days before it came again, which struck the lily as odd and inexplicable—inexplicable that the bird, just like the flowers, did not remain in the same place, odd that the bird could be so capricious. But as so often happens, the lily fell more and more in love with the bird precisely because it was capricious. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 167 later he wrote about a wood dove and tame doves p. 174ff}}

The second discourse deals with diverting oneself from worries by "learning from the bird how glorious it is to be a human being."&lt;ref&gt;''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; David F. Swenson translated several of Kierkegaard's discourses which were published in 1958 through the efforts of Paul L Holmer. Kierkegaard wrote of ''The Glory of Our Common Humanity''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/edifyingdiscours00kier#page/230/mode/2up ''The Glory of Our Common Humanity''] Swenson translation&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second of three discourses that were all based on the text from [[Matthew 6]] verses 24 to the end. It was titled ''How Glorious It Is to Be a [[Human Being]]'' by Howard V Hong when he translated Kierkegaard's book in 1993.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The structure of the three discourses about the lilies and the birds is as follows: the first is esthetic, the second ethical, the third religious. ''Journal and Papers of Soren Kierkegaard'' VIII A 1 1847&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard writes about the gift given to human beings that nature doesn't have, conscience. With the use of conscience we can know about time and the future. Something nature cannot know.&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 193–198&lt;/ref&gt; He sums the human ability to love and the distinctiveness of nature up in Works of Love, which he published four months later. {{Quotation| Love does not seek its own. The truly loving one does not love his own distinctiveness but, in contrast, loves every human being according to his distinctiveness; but 'his distinctiveness'; is what for him is his own; that is, the loving one does not seek his own; quite the opposite, he loves what is the others own. Let us for a moment look at nature. With what infinite love nature or God in nature encompasses all the diverse things that have life and existence! Just recollect what you yourself have so often delighted in looking at, recollect the beauty of the meadow!

There is no difference in the love, no, none—yet what a difference in the flowers! Even the least, the most insignificant the most unimpressive, the poor little flower disregarded by even its immediate surroundings, the flower you can hardly find without looking carefully—it is as if this, too, had said to love: Let me become something in myself, something distinctive. And then love has helped it to become its own distinctiveness, but far more beautiful than the poor little flower had ever dared to hope for.

What love! First it makes no distinction, none at all; next, which is just like the first, it infinitely distinguishes itself in loving the diverse. Wondrous love! For what is as difficult as to make no distinction at all in loving, and if one makes no distinction at all, what is as difficult as making distinctions! Just suppose nature were us human beings—rigid, domineering, cold, partisan, small-minded, capricious—and imagine, yes, just imagine what would happen to the beauty of the meadow.

So it is also in the relationships of love among human beings; only true love loves every human being according to the person's distinctiveness. The rigid, the domineering person lacks flexibility, lacks the pliability to comprehend others; he demands his own from everyone, wants everyone to be transformed in his image to be trimmed according to his pattern for human beings. If the rigid and domineering person cannot ever create, he wants at least to transform – that is, he seeks his own so that wherever he points he can say: See, it is my image, it is my idea, it is my will. ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 269–270}}

The third discourse was titled ''What Blessed Happiness is Promised in Being a Human Being'' by Howard V Hong.  Kierkegaard is constantly stressing the importance there is in being a human being instead of a beast in the field because you have been given the gift of [[choice]]. "A choice. My listener, do you know how to express in a single word anything more glorious! If you talked year in and year out, could you mention anything more glorious than a choice, to have choice! It is certainly true that the sole blessing is to choose rightly, but certainly choice itself is the glorious condition."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard began writing about this choice in his first book ''[[Either/Or]]'' where he wrote first as the [[aesthetic]] and then as the [[ethicist]]. Hegel thinks that history and philosophy should come afterwards and explain events. Kierkegaard thinks its better to come beforehand.&lt;blockquote&gt;Only one word more concerning the desire to teach the world what it ought to be. For such a purpose philosophy at least always comes too late. Philosophy, as the thought of the world, does not appear until reality has completed its formative process, and made itself ready. History thus corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, apprehends the real world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. When philosophy paints its grey in grey, one form of life has become old, and by means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known. The owl of Minerva takes its flight only when the shades of night are gathering.
* Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) ''Philosophy of Right'' translated by SW Dyde Queen's University Canada 1896 edition ''Preface xxx''&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all [[philosophy]]. It is only at certain moments that I view everything ''acterno modo'', as [[Spinoza]] says, but I live constantly ''aeterno modo.'' There are many who think that they live thus, because after having done the one or the other, they combine or mediate the opposites. But this is a misunderstanding: for the true eternity does not lie behind either/or, but before it. Hence, their eternity will be a painful succession of temporal moments, for they will be consumed by a two-fold regret. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or'' part I, Swenson p. 37–39&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam. Indeed, I assure you that if my life through no fault of my own were so interwoven with sorrows and sufferings that I could call myself the greatest [[tragic hero]], could divert myself with my affliction and shock the world by naming it, my choice is made: I strip myself of the hero's garb and the pathos of tragedy; I am not the tormented one who can be proud of his sufferings; I am the humbled one who feels my offense; I have only one word for what I am suffering—guilt, only one word for my pain—repentance, only one hope before my eyes—forgiveness. And if it proves to be difficult for me to do—oh, then I have only one prayer. I would throw myself upon the earth and appeal from morning till night to the heavenly power who rules the world for one favor, that it might be granted me to repent, for I know only one sorrow that could bring me to despair and plunge everything into it—that repentance is an illusion, an illusion not with respect to the forgiveness it seeks but with respect to the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/imputation imputation] it [[presupposition|presupposes]]. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or'' part II, Hong  p. 237–238&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Spiritually understood, temporality and eternity are two magnitudes that are to be weighed. But in order to deliberate the person in turn must be a third party or have a third position in relation to the two magnitudes. This is the choice: he weighs, he deliberates, he chooses. Here, however there is never any chance that the two magnitudes weigh equally much, which can of course happen with a scale, it indicates the relation as one of equality. No, praise God, that can never happen, because properly understood the eternal already has a certain overweight and the person who refuses to understand this can never begin really to deliberate. So a person deliberates before he begins. 
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong p. 306–307&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard stresses not only having a choice but learning how to use it. He concludes, "But then in his sadness out there with the lily and the bird the [[worry|worried]] one did indeed acquire something other than his worry to think about; he began to consider what blessed happiness is promised in being a human being. Then let the lily wither and let its loveliness become indiscernible; let the leaf fall to the ground and the bird fly away; let it become dark on the fields—God's kingdom does not change with the seasons! So let the rest be needed for a long time or a short time, let all these things have their moment when they are lacking or possessed, their moment is a subject of discussion until in death they are eternally forgotten—God's kingdom is still that which is to be sought first but which ultimately will also last through all eternities, and "if that which will be abolished was glorious, that which remains will be more glorious,:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3 2 ''Corinthians 3:11'']&lt;/ref&gt; and if it was hard to live in want, then it must indeed be only an easier separation to die to want!&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Gospel of Sufferings===
A.S Aldworth and W.S. Ferrie from Cambridge University translated ''The Gospel of Sufferings'' in 1955. The following is from his introduction. {{Quote|In his trilogy ''Opbyggelige Taler i Forskellig Aand'' ("Edifying Discourses in Another Vein"), Kierkegaard passed from a general religious and philosophical standpoint to a specifically Christian one. The Gospel of Sufferings forms the third part of that trilogy, and is a central plank in the structure of Kierkegaard's mature thought. "The theme [of these discourses] is our sufferings. It is also the gospel that pertains to, and is appropriate to, our sufferings. It is in the realm of faith, and though this gospel that is the peculiar property of those who suffer, that sufferings are found to contain joys. We may say therefore that it is the purpose of this volume to disclose the meaning in the most meaningless element of life. Which might be held to be quite a good definition of the Christian faith."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/gospel-of-sufferings-lidelsernes-evangelium-christian-discourses-being-the-third-part-of-edifying-discourses-in-a-different-vein-published-in-1847-at-copenhagen/oclc/2940311&amp;referer=brief_results ''Gospel of sufferings''] from World Cat. [https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-Sufferings-Library-Theological-Translations/dp/0227674685 ''The Gospel of Sufferings''] Amazon&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Now he begins to write of the meaning and joy there is in following [[Christ]]. It wasn't the first thing he wrote about but he did write about learning, over time, to follow Christ and while learning to also learn to confess, repent and accept as well as give forgiveness. His emphasis has been on seeking God's kingdom first (Matthew 6:33) and learning to be "silent before God".&lt;ref&gt;How can you tell when you are confessing Christ and when you are judging others? ''The Joy of It That Bold Confidence Is Able in Suffering to Take Power from the World and Has the Power to Change Scorn into Honor, Downfall into Victory''  p. 321-341&lt;/ref&gt;

His first three texts are from [[Luke 14]]:27 ''Whoever does not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.''  [[Matthew 11]]:30 ''My yoke is beneficial, and my burden light.'' and ''It is said of him the Lord Jesus Christ: Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he [[Suffering|suffered]]'' [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+5&amp;version=KJV Hebrews 5:8]. [[Acts 5]]:41 Kierkegaard writes about why it might not be so great to have the "distinction" of being an [[apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993 p. 327ff (333–334)&lt;/ref&gt; ''they went away joyful because they had been deemed worthy to be scorned for the sake of Christ's name''. He concluded this way: {{Quote|We have now considered the joy in the thought that bold confidence has this power of victory; we have also called to mind how the apostles understood themselves in this thought. We dare not withhold from anyone the joy, the triumphant joy contained in that thought; we dare not suppress the fact that bold confidence has this power. But neither have we played fast and loose with our words; on the contrary, to the best of our ability we have added the weight of earnest reflections to the joy, in order if possible to exercise a restraining influence. This joyful thought is not like a so-called harmless remedy that can be used in any way without danger and can be used for a light cold, but it is strong medicine, the use of which involves some danger, but rightly used also delivers from the [[The Sickness Unto Death|sickness unto death]].  Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong 1993 p. 339}}

Kierkegaard compared a pound of gold and a pound of feathers. He views the pound of feathers as a lesser weight because of the value of gold compared to feathers. He then asks the reader to decide if a pound of temporality is equal to a pound of eternity.&lt;ref&gt;''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong 1993 p. 318–319&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers and gold and temporality and eternity and numbers all have value in this world. He has [[7 (number)#Religion and mythology|seven]] different discourses in this [[3 (number)#In religion|third]] section. He seems to be using religious numbers generally while writing but always referring to [[Christianity]] specifically.

Kierkegaard seems to have fulfilled his goal presented in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, where he said it had become clear to him that people had forgotten what it means to be religious (confession and repentance before God) and had also forgotten what it means to be a human being and had therefore also forgotten what it means to try to become a Christian. He put it this way. {{Quote|The main thought was that, because of the copiousness of knowledge, people in our day have forgotten what it means to exist, and what inwardness is, and that the misunderstanding between speculative thought and Christianity could be explained by that. I resolved to go back as far as possible in order not to arrive too soon at what it means to exist religiously, not to mention existing Christianly-religiously, and in that way leave dubieties behind me. If people had forgotten what it means to exist religiously, they had probably also forgotten what it means to exist humanly. I resolved to begin: first was to have the existence relation between esthetic and ethical come into existence in an existing human.&lt;ref&gt;[[Either/Or]]&lt;/ref&gt; But this must not on any account be done didactically, because then the misunderstanding would in a new misunderstanding instantly make capital of the explanatory attempt, as if existing consisted in coming to know something about a particular point. If this is communicated as knowledge, the recipient is mistakenly induced to understand that he is gaining something to know, and then we are back in knowledge again. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong 1996 p. 249}}

==Criticism==
''Edifiying Discourses in Diverse Spirits'', also ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' was published on March 13, 1847, and is one of the first books in [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s second authorship. His first authorship included all of his books up to and including  ''[[Two Ages: A Literary Review]]'' which was published March 30, 1846. He had just published his ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'' to ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' on February 27, 1846. He wrote both [[pseudonym]]ous books as well as books signed by his own name. His ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' were all signed by Soren Kierkegaard as author while other books, such as, ''Either/Or'', ''Repetition'', and ''The Concept of Anxiety'' were published under pseudonyms. Howard V. Hong says the book had no record of sales and was not reprinted in Kierkegaard's lifetime.

Previously Kierkegaard had published his own books through two different bookstores, Bookdealer P. G. Philipsen ''[[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'' and C.A. Reitzel's, Printed by Biance Luno Press ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''. This book was published "on an honorarium basis" through another Danish book publisher, Reitzel Forlag. The publishing cost was minimum.

The first section was translated into English in 1938 by [[Douglas V. Steere]] and titled ''Purity of Heart Is To Will One Thing''.  Steere also wrote the introduction to David F Swenson's 1946 translation of ''[[Works of Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XOMDcgAACAAJ Google Link to Swenson's translation of Works of Love]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library|Howard V. and Edna H. Hong]] translated all the discourses and [[Princeton University Press]] published them in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong introduction xii–xiii [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5241.html Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong 1993, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally paid more attention to his pseudonymous writings than his discourses.

Harold Victor Martin published ''Kierkegaard, the Melancholy Dane'' (1950) and had this to say about this book: {{Quotation|The personal religious sense of ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard book)|Repetition]]'' in relation to time and eternity is brought out by Kierkegaard in a striking Discourse entitled: ''The Joy of it—that what thou dost lose temporally, thou dost gain eternally.'' Within his temporal existence, man can only lose the temporal temporally. The seriousness of life is that it is possible for man in his temporal existence to lose the eternal; and this in fact is Kierkegaard's definition of sin—in time to lose eternity. What man must strive after is to gain the eternal eternally. p. 60&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001918252 ''Kierkegaard, the melancholy Dane'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Robert L Perkins of Stetson University edited ''The International Kierkegaard Commentary Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' in 2005. This book presents scholarly perspectives regarding from people interested in the writings of Soren Kierkegaard. He states that A.S. Aldworth and W.S. Ferrie published ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' in three parts ''Purify your Hearts'' (1937), ''Consider the Lilies'' (1940) and ''Gospel of Suffering'' (1955), the 1955 edition was reprinted in an American edition in 1964. Gospel  of Sufferings and The Lilies of the Field were translated by David F Swenson and Lillian Marvin Swenson in 1948. Perkin's book is in External Links below.

Douglas V. Steere wrote a lengthy introduction to his 1938 publication of the first part of Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits. ''Purify your Heart'' of 1937 became ''Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing'' in the hands of Steere in 1938. He says Eduard Geismar (1871–1939), the Danish scholar, said of the book, "It seems to me that nothing that he has written has sprung so directly out of his relationship with God as this address. Anyone who wishes to understand Kierkegaard properly will do well to begin with it."&lt;ref&gt;Steere, ''Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing'', intro p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Steere wrote ''Doors Into Life'' in 1948 and devoted his fourth chapter to Kierkegaard and ''Purity of Heart''. He said, "In a strangely universal way, Kierkegaard is both ancient and modern, both a fierce desert prophet and a metropolitan sophisticate who is all too well schooled in the artifices of modern life to be deceived by them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Doors_into_life_through_five_devotional.html?id=aUBZAAAAMAAJ ''Doors Into Life'' Harper and Brothers p. 119ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geismar lectured on Kierkegaard at Princeton University in 1936. He wrote the following about this book, {{Quote|The way of repentance is described in a long communion sermon of more than a hundred pages. The theme of this sermon is that "'purity of heart' consists of singleness of aim." Kierkegaard explains that it is only possible to will one thing if we will the good, and that such willing is real only if we will the good in entire single-mindedness.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Geismar, ''Lectures on the Religious thought of Soren Kierkegaard'', 1936 p. 59ff&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Howard V Hong translated the wrote book in 1993 along with his wife Edna H Hong. It was translated again in 2005. Hong's 1993 introduction surmised that Kierkegaard perhaps published 500 copies of this book during his lifetime.

''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' &amp; ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' were reviewed together in 1994 by Karl Dusza for ''First Things Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/issue ''First Things'']&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote {{Quote|If the age of Kierkegaard was the age of individualism, is our own not the age of super-individualism? If the age of Kierkegaard was also the age of romanticism, is ours not the age of super-romanticism? And if in a deeper sense Kierkegaard's age was neither that of individualism nor that of romanticism but rather in essence the age of the crowd, what is our own if not the age of the super-crowd? How fortunate for us, then, that this solitary Dane exercised his awesome analytical and rhetorical skills to tear down the veil of deception and uncover the essential folly of his time, and in so doing, bequeathed to us powerful critical tools. He has indeed left us a mirror; peering into it, we can see the folly of our time and glimpse the abyss we are in danger of falling into. ''Appropriating the Paradox''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9402/reviews/dusza.html ''Appropriating the Paradox'' Karl Dusza ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kierkegaard wrote about the expectation of the Christian. The difference Christ made in the world is that he took away the burdens of the Christian. Kierkegaard wrote much about the [[consciousness]] of [[sin]] and wrote about the difference Christianity makes.&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, 1847 ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong pp. 240–242&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|&lt;blockquote&gt;When Christ speaks of the light burden, when he says my burden, there can also be quite particularly the thought of a burden that he has laid upon his followers. He has indeed laid it upon them to carry human burdens lightly, but then in addition a light burden that is specifically for the Christians. What is this? Let us first ask this question: Of all burdens, which is the heaviest? Certainly the consciousness of sin; that is beyond dispute. But the one who takes away the consciousness of sin and gives the consciousness of forgiveness instead—he indeed takes away the heavy burden and give the light one in its place. But why a burden, even if it is called light? Yes, if someone will not understand that forgiveness is also a burden that must be carried, even though a light burden, he is taking forgiveness in vain. Forgiveness is not to be earned—it is not that heavy; but neither is it to be taken in vain and it is not that light either. Forgiveness is not to be paid for—it is not that costly and it cannot be paid for; but neither is it to be taken away as nothing; it is bought at too high a price for that. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993, p. 246 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it more desperate to despair over the truth than not to dare to face the truth! Everyone who secretly houses that gloomy thought about God is in despair. In the spiritual sense, one can see it in him, as it were, because in relation to God he is not like someone who drops his eyes in the consciousness of his guilt and of what he owes God, nor is he like someone who humbly lifts his trusting gaze to God—no, he glowers. Truly, it would be better to dispel the gloom than to glower, to shudder at the thought of this horror that actually belongs to paganism, the horror that God was unable or unwilling to give a person bold confidence. A false god can neither reduce a person to nothing nor make him perceive the nothing that he is—for that the false god is too weak. Neither can a false god give a person bold confidence—he is not strong enough for that. This is why we can say that the false god himself taught the pagan to glower. Even the wisest pagan who has ever lived, however much wiser he otherwise was then the lowliest believer, still has, in comparison with him, a gloominess in his inner being, because when all is said and done the pagan could never be eternally sure and clear whether the fault lay with him or whether it might in a rare case lie with God, whether hopelessness was not a state in which a person can be without guilt because the god himself bears the guilt by leaving him without a task. One can excuse the pagan only by saying that this is so because his god himself is gloomy. But the Christian’s God is clarity. Therefore every human being is without excuse and without any excuse. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993, p. 277–280&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

James Collins, from Saint Louis University, wrote the following about Kierkegaard's ''Gospel of Suffering'' in 1953. "Find a point which is under fire by an atheist of the nineteenth century and which is also defended by a seventeenth century man of faith and you have found an incontrovertibly religious belief. Such is the case with suffering, which is a scandal to a [[Feuerbach]] and a matter of glory to a [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], but to both a distinguishing note of the Christian mode of existence. In the degree that it promotes a meditative inwardness, Christianity makes us aware of God's supreme goodness and our own distance from, and hostility towards, His holiness. A religious sense of one's own sinfulness leads neither to morbid despair nor to rationalization. It issues in a voluntary acceptance of suffering as a way of atoning for sin to God, the just judge, and a way of approaching closer to God the redeemer. In a series of discourses entitled ''The Gospel of Suffering'', Kierkegaard establishes the relation between guilt, suffering, and the triumph of faith, much after the manner of Luther's dialectical treatment of the theme of the sinner as a believer."&lt;ref&gt;James Collins, ''The Mind of Kierkegaard'' Princeton University Press 1953, 1983P. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair chase''' is a term used by hunters to describe an ethical approach to hunting big game animals. North America's oldest wildlife conservation group, the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], defines "fair chase" as requiring hunted big game animals to be wild and free-ranging.&lt;ref name="Boone and Crockett Club"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Chase Statement|url=https://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_fairchase.asp?area=huntingEthics|website=Boone and Crockett Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Wild" refers to an animal that is naturally bred and lives in nature. "Free-ranging" means an animal that is not confined by artificial barriers.

Fair chase has been the honor code of North American hunters for over a century and the principle underlying many of North American hunting laws, and is taught to new hunters in hunter certification courses.

Fair Chase is also a registered trademark of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]].

==History==

The concept and the popularization of the term "fair chase" is credited to [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and perpetuated by the Boone and Crockett Club, a conservation organization of Roosevelt's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes from first meeting of the Boone and Crockett Club|url=http://cdm103401.cdmhost.com/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/51/rec/10|website=Montana Memory Project - University of Montana Mansfield Library|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mauro|first1=Anthony|title=The New Age Hunter|date=2004|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|isbn=0-595-32316-2|page=35}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===European aristocratic roots===

Ethics, or a code of conduct, in hunting first emerged centuries ago among European hunters who were primarily the wealthy landowners and royalty. While the commoner hunted to stay alive, the aristocrat [[Sport hunting|hunted for sport]], and it was this sporting approach that separated the two. These ethics did not transfer to the majority of immigrants that settled in the [[New World]]. Basic human survival and commercial enterprises had no room for a hunting ethic. After two hundred years of the unregulated taking of wildlife by subsistence, recreational, and commercial market hunters, the negative effects were inescapable. By the end of this "era of extermination", wildlife and especially big game populations were in dismal condition. Some species had already been lost to extinction and many others were on the brink.

In the early part of the 20th century, a sense of pride and accomplishment began to emerge among sportsmen that came with their newly accepted responsibility to conserve. Doing right by the game being hunted meant working with conservation and population recovery efforts, including the creation of the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]]. As for the hunt itself, using restraint shifted the emphasis of measuring success from the quantity of game taken to the quality of the chase. The hunting experience became more important than the number killed, and success was now more memorable because the hunting experience became sustainable in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richard J. Ladle|first1=Robert J. Whittaker|title=Conservation Biogeography|date=2011|publisher=Blackwell Publishing LTD|location=West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-1-4443-3503-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development and definition===

The earliest recorded North American usage of the term "fair chase" is in the fifth article of the Boone and Crockett Club constitution, adopted in February 1888. At this time in American history, there were no laws governing the talking of game for food or for sport. Water-killing deer (driving deer with hounds or pushers into lakes where hunters waited in boats to either shoot, club, or cut the throats of deer) was also a widespread practice, especially in the [[Adirondack Mountains]].

Article X of the club’s constitution declared that the killing of game while swimming was an "offense" for which a member may be suspended or expelled from the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boone and Crockett Archive|url=http://cdm103401.cdmhost.com/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/96/rec/1|website=Montana Memory Project - University of Montana Mansfield Library|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later writings by club members Roosevelt, [[George Bird Grinnell]], and [[Aldo Leopold]] articulated the term "fair chase" to the public through books and magazine articles. Most notable of these where the club’s Acorn book series on hunting (1893 – 1933), Leopold's ''[[Sand County Almanac]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leopold|first1=Aldo|title=Sand County Almanac|date=1942|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grinnell’s ''[[Forest and Stream]]'' magazine (now ''[[Field &amp; Stream]]'').

In 1893, Roosevelt wrote about hunting and fair chase in his book titled ''The Wilderness Hunter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roosevelt|first1=Theodore|title=The Wilderness hunter|date=1893|publisher=G.P Putnam's Sons|location=New York, New York|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The teddy bear's connection===

The history of the [[teddy bear]] has a close connection to fair chase. During his presidency in 1902, Roosevelt was in Mississippi to settle a border dispute. His hosts knew Roosevelt was an avid hunter and arranged for a black bear hunt for the president. In the thick brush swamps of Mississippi it was a common practice of the day to hunt bears with hounds. Out of concern for the president's safety, the guides insisted that he stay in camp until a bear was brought to bay by the hounds, and subsequently a small bear was caught and tied to a tree. When Roosevelt arrived at the scene he refused to shoot the defenseless animal.&lt;ref name="Real Teddy Bear Story"/&gt;

Being omitted from the chase was unsettling to Roosevelt, who prided himself in living the hardy life of an [[outdoorsman]]—the harder the hunt the better—and he did not earn this bear though a fair pursuit. Political cartoonist [[Clifford Berryman]] immediately drew a cartoon depicting Roosevelt refusing to shoot the restrained bear. The story made national headlines and a shopkeeper, Morris Michtom in Brooklyn, New York, had his wife sew a stuffed bear to sell in his store. He wrote Roosevelt asking permission to call the child's toy, Teddy's Bear. Roosevelt gave his permission, and history was made.&lt;ref name="Real Teddy Bear Story"&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Teddy Bear Story|url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/site/c.elKSIdOWIiJ8H/b.8684621/k.6632/Real_Teddy_Bear_Story.htm|website=Theodore Roosevelt Association|publisher=Theodore Roosevelt Association|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair chase today==

When in the field, the initial question for every fair chase hunter is whether the animal has a reasonable opportunity to elude the hunter. If the animal does not, the hunt can never be "fair chase". For example, a fair chase hunter does not shoot an animal hampered by deep snow or entangled in a barbed-wire fence.

There are also laws that regulate hunting. Ethical, fair chase hunting therefore begins with obeying game laws. A fair chase hunter must acquaint themselves with the laws that govern hunting, as they reflect considerations for safety, the sustainable use of the wildlife resources, and the minimum level of conduct that the public will tolerate in a particular state, province, region, or country. If something is illegal it cannot, by definition, be fair chase. On the other hand, just because something is legal does not make it fair chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posewitz|first1=James|title=Beyond Fair Chase|date=1994|publisher=Falcon Press Publishing|location=Helena, Montana|isbn=1-56044-302-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are certain aspects of fair chase hunting that extend beyond written laws. For example, shooting at a running deer is not illegal, nor are there any laws regarding shooting at extremely long ranges with a firearm or bow. To those who believe in the responsibility to kill quickly and cleanly, taking such risky shots would be unethical. A large part of the time-honored tradition of hunting has to do with the fact that sportsmen police themselves and others both within and beyond the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posewitz|first1=James|title=Beyond Fair Chase|date=1994|publisher=Falcon Press Publishing|location=Helena, Montana|isbn=1-56044-302-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

"Canned shoots", also known as "[[canned hunting]]", may be legal in some North American states and provinces, but they are not representative of fair chase. Canned shoots involve the "pursuit" and killing of a big game animal kept in or released from captivity to be shot in an artificial hunting situation where a kill is virtually guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMello|first1=Margo|title=Animals and Society: An Introduction to Human-Animal Studies|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15294-5|page=74}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Internet hunting]] was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticized by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. As a representative of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) explained, "The NRA has always maintained that fair chase, being in the field with your firearm or bow, is an important element of hunting tradition. Sitting at your desk in front of your computer, clicking at a mouse, has nothing to do with hunting."&lt;ref name=HSUS-FactSheet&gt;Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, [http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/internet_hunting/facts/internet_hunting_fact_sheet.html#.UzjiW61dW9Y Fact Sheet on Internet Hunting]&lt;/ref&gt;

One hunting club declares that a fair chase shall not involve the taking of animals under the following conditions:
* Helpless in a trap, deep snow or water, or on ice.
* From any power vehicle or power boat.
* By "[[spotlighting|jacklighting]]" or shining at night.
* By the use of any tranquilizers or poisons.
* While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures.
* By the use of any power vehicle or power boat for herding or driving animals, including use of aircraft to land alongside or to communicate with or direct a hunter on the ground.
* By the use of electronic devices for attracting, locating or pursuing game or guiding the hunter to such game, or by the use of a bow or arrow to which any electronic device is attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |title=The Rules of Fair Chase |publisher=[[Pope and Young Club]] |location=[[Chatfield, Minnesota]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67uAifKEP?url=http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |archivedate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 May 2012 |quote=While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family-centered care''' or '''Family-centered service''' is an approach that provides an expanded view of how to work with children and families. Family-centered service is made up of a set of values, attitudes, and approaches to services for children with special needs and their families. In some family-centered settings such as the Hasbro Children's Partial Hospital Program, medical and psychiatric services are integrated to help teach parents and children methods to treat both types of symptoms&lt;!-- what symptoms are being referred here? --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/hospital-based-day-treatment-program-provides-family-centered-services-children-chronic |title=Hospital-Based Day Treatment Program Provides Family-Centered Services to Children With Chronic Illnesses and Emotional Issues as an Alternative to Outpatient and Inpatient Care |date=2014-04-07 | accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family-centered service recognizes that each family is unique; that the family is the constant in the child’s life; and that they are the experts on the child’s abilities and needs. The family works with service providers to make informed decisions about the services and supports the child and family receive. In family-centered service, the strengths and needs of all family members are considered.&lt;ref name="Family-Centered"&gt;Pamela J. Kovacsa; Melissa Hayden Bellinb; David P. Fauria (2006).[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a904287141 "Family-Centered Care  "], Journal of Social Work in End-Of-Life &amp; Palliative Care, Volume 2, Issue 1 July 2006 , pages 13 - 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Family-centered service reflects a shift from the traditional focus on the biomedical aspects of a child’s condition to a concern with seeing the child in context of their family and recognizing the primacy of family in the child’s life. The principles argue in favour of an approach that respects families as integral and coequal parts of the health care team.&lt;ref name="Family-Centered" /&gt; This approach is expected to improve the quality and safety of a patient's care by helping to foster communication between families and health care professionals. Furthermore, by taking family/patient input and concerns into account, the family feels comfortable working with professionals on a plan of care, and professionals are "on board" in terms of what families expect with medical interventions and health outcomes. In some health systems, patients and family members serve as advisers to the hospital in order to provide input that can lead to general quality improvement efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/patient-advisers-participate-hospital-councils-committees-staff-training-and-other |title=Patient Advisers Participate in Hospital Councils, Committees, Staff Training, and Other Activities, Contributing to Improved Patient Satisfaction and Better Organizational Performance Issues as an Alternative to Outpatient and Inpatient Care |date=2014-04-22 | accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family-centered approaches to health care intervention also generally lead to wiser allocation of health care resources, as well as greater patient and family satisfaction.

==Family==

“Family” means any person(s) who plays a significant role in an individual’s life. This may include a person(s) not legally related to the individual who act as [[patient advocacy|advocates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Patient advocacy services ensure optimum health outcomes'' | author= | url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/patient-advocacy-20150920-gjr53j.html | accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of “family” include spouses, domestic partners, and both different-sex and same-sex significant others. “Family” includes a minor patient’s parents, regardless of the gender of either parent. Solely for purposes of visitation policy, the concept of parenthood is to be liberally construed without limitation as encompassing legal parents, foster parents, same-sex parent, stepparents, those serving in loco parentis, and other persons operating in caretaker roles.

This definition of family was developed in consultation with the Healthcare Equality Index Advisory Council, Gay and Lesbian Medical Association and Joint Commission staff members. Like the majority of the definitions of “family” contained in submitted hospital policy, this definition establishes a broad and encompassing concept of family. The specifically enumerated members of family provide guidance to staff and prevent biased interpretation to the contrary. It should be noted that the concept of “domestic partners” contained in this definition encompasses not only domestic partnerships, but all legally recognized same-sex relationships, including civil unions and reciprocal beneficiary arrangements. The definition also focuses on a functional definition of parenthood as established by the individual’s role as caretaker of a minor child. This is designed to ensure visitor access for the individuals most responsible for the care of a minor patient, even if this caretaker relationship lacks formal recognition under applicable state law.

This definition of “family” places hospital personnel on notice as to the unique nature of parenthood in the visitation context. While the definition requires that caretaker-individuals be granted access to visit minor patients, this caretaker status does not necessarily carry with it the rights that accompany legal parental status. For instance, applicable state law may dictate that only a biological or custodial parent may determine the course of medical care for a minor child.

==Role of the family==

While specific methods of implementing family-centered care differ from facility to facility, general procedures are fairly similar. The [[University of Virginia Health System]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], provides an excellent example of this. On admission, the patient usually designates one or two people who will serve as their primary "care partners." These individuals are notated in the patient's electronic and physical medical charts, and they are given an orange [http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/h1n1/carepartners.cfm] wristband to wear in order to designate them as a patient's "care partners." This negates the need for visitor's passes or after-hours registration cards, as the staff can readily identify a patient's "care partners." The admitting staff discuss the reasons for admission with the patient and their "care partners" and what health criteria are required for the patient's discharge.

"Care partners" are then intricately involved with the patient's care by their entire attending healthcare team, including physicians, nurses, nutritionists, social workers, and more. At every stage, "care partners" and patients discuss with healthcare professionals test results, the state of the patient's current health, what type of things to expect throughout the day, and discharge goals. "Care partners" are invited to take part in nursing interventions, including bathing, feeding, helping the nursing staff with moving the patient, and assisting the patient in exercising or moving about the unit. "Care partners" are also invited to take an active role in "rounds," providing feedback and asking questions reflective of theirs and the patient's wishes or concerns.

"Care partners" are also indoctrinated on various elements of hospital operating policy, such as quiet time and visitation rules. The "care partners" are then generally allowed to manage the adherence to these policies in a manner conducive to the patient's healing and common sense—for example, by managing how many visitors are present in the patient's room.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Family-centered care emerged as an important concept in health care at the end of the 20th century; but the implementation of Family Centered care was met with a variety of snags. Prior to the early 1990s, the relationship between care providers and patients was distant. The traditional model of care  centered on physicians, and an expectation that patients and their families would assume a passive role as an observer, rather than a participant. Healing was treated largely as an abstract or business-like affair. Special requests by the patient were seen as interfering with the provision of their care or even as being a detriment to their health. Modern ideas like open visitation or care partners were almost unheard of and were generally dismissed as impossible to accomplish. This was compounded by the implementation of [[Health maintenance organization|Health Maintenance Organizations]], which successfully reigned in the rising healthcare costs of the 1970s at the cost of the patient-healthcare worker relationship.

Much of the early work on Family Centered care emerged from the pediatric and geriatric medicine fields; for example, as research came to light about the effects of separating hospitalized children from their families, many healthcare institutions began to adopt policies that welcomed family members to be with their child around the clock. As awareness increased of the importance of meeting the psychosocial and holistic needs of not only children, but all patients, the family-centered care model began to make serious headway as a bond fide intervention model. In the United States, this was further encouraged by Federal legislation in the late 1980s and early 1990s that provided additional validation on the importance of family-centered principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429946 Public Law 99-457, Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986, Part H—Early Intervention Programs for Handicapped Infants and Toddlers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.help4adhd.org/en/education/rights/idea Individuals With Disabilities Education Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-476)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalgrantswire.com/university-centers-for-excellence-in-developmental-disabilities-education-research-and-service.html Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-496)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/MHDDSAS/acronyms.htm Mental Health Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101-639)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabe.org/documents/policy_legislation/TitleVII1994.pdf Families of Children With Disabilities Support Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-382)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the mid-90's (although elements of family-centered care began appearing in the early 1980s), however, this situation began to change. Studies began to show that many of the supposed detriments to family-centered care were negligible, not supported by research, or untrue. A study conducted in 2001&lt;ref name="Lee, Melissa D 2007 pages 497-501"&gt;Lee, Melissa D. MD; Friedenberg, Allison S. MD; Mukpo, David H.; Conray, Kayla; Palmisciano, Amy RN; Levy, Mitchell M. MD. (2007). Visiting hours policies in New England intensive care units: Strategies for Improvement. Critical Care Medicine, Volume 35(2), pages 497-501.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that open visitation had little to no effect on physiologic parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, cardiac arrhythmias, and intercranial pressure. Indeed, evidence suggested anxiety levels and general cardiovascular health were positively affected after the implementation of family-centered care, leading to fewer medical interventions being required (physical or chemical therapies in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Damboise, Cindy and Cardin, Suzette. (2003). Family Centered Critical Care: How one unit implemented a plan. American Journal of Nursing, Volume 103, Issue 6, pages 56AA-56EE.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of concern, septic and infection control, found that as long as a patient's visitors were educated in the proper aseptic procedure (such as hand washing and use of hand sanitizer gel), infection control outcomes were not negatively affected by unrestricted visitation.&lt;ref name="Lee, Melissa D 2007 pages 497-501"/&gt;

Patient care was also positively affected. Decubidation rates in facilities with family-centered care dropped significantly. In one study, it was found that patients receiving family-centered care were far more likely to have met the criteria of medical and nursing care plans (such as drinking x amount of fluids every eight hours, moving from NP suctioning to bulb suctioning, or the measurement of patient's intake/output), as the patient's family took it upon themselves to encourage or assist the patient in accomplishing these goals.&lt;ref&gt;Insert FMC-article link here&lt;/ref&gt; Family and close friends were more likely to identify slight variations in the patient's mental or physical health that health care professionals largely unfamiliar with the patient may miss. Furthermore, while health care professionals are very talented at their work, their jobs are generally limited by the walls of the health care facility, whereas a patient's family is not. Enlisting a patient's family as a part of their health care team helps enable their ability to assist, manage, and assess the patient's healing after their discharge from a health care facility.

A study undertaken at the University of Virginia's Children's Hospital&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/pediatrics/ University of Virginia Children's Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt; showed that sharing information and involving family in a patient's care (via the family-centered care model described previously) had the following effects:
* A rise in staff satisfaction due to reduced phone calls by security at night;
* Improved consistency of information given to family members;
* A decrease in clinical workload; and
* A significant rise in patient satisfaction scores on the Press-Ganey scale in the areas of Accommodations and Comfort of Visitors (93 to 98), Information Provided to Family (87 to 99), Staff Attitudes Towards Visitors (62 to 75), and Safety and Security Felt at the Hospital (86 to 88).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/733899/tops_in_the_nation__press_ganey_announces_2006_health/index.html Tops in the Nation -- Press Ganey Announces 2006 Health Care Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bickley, L.

'''Feminist art criticism''' emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=n.paradoxa|date=Sep 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of [[art criticism]].

== Emergence ==
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s 1971 groundbreaking essay, "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]", analyzes the embedded privilege in the predominantly white, male, Western art world and argued that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|author-link=Linda Nochlin|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?| work = Women, Art and Power and Other Essays | year=1971 |publisher= Westview Press|url=|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, as well as questioning which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Atkins |first1= Robert |author-link1= |year= 2013|title= Artspeak: A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present |edition= 3rd|location= New York|publisher= Abbeville Press |isbn= 9780789211507 |oclc=855858296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is articulated by artist [[Judy Chicago]]: "...it is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chicago|first1=Judy|author-link1=Judy Chicago|last2=Lucie-Smith|first2=Edward|author-link2=Edward Lucie-Smith|title=Women and Art: Contested Territory|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-5852-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genius===
Nochlin challenges the myth of the Great Artist as 'Genius' as an inherently problematic construct. '[[Genius]]' “is thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the person of the Great Artist.”&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt;
This ‘god-like’ conception of the artist’s role is due to "the entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the profession of art history is based."&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; She develops this further by arguing that "if women had the golden nugget of artistic genius, it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself. Q.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget of artistic genius."&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; Nochlin deconstructs the myth of the 'Genius' by highlighting the unjustness in which the Western art world inherently privileges certain predominantly white male artists. In Western art, ‘Genius’ is a title that is generally reserved for artists such as, van Gogh, Picasso, Raphael, and Pollock—all white men.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt; As recently demonstrated by Alessandro Giardino, when the concept of artistic genius started collapsing, women and marginal groups emerged at the forefront of artistic creation.&lt;ref&gt; Alessandro Giardino, ''[https://www.academia.edu/35257521/_Caravaggio_and_the_Enfranchisement_of_Women._New_Discoveries_Theory_in_Action_2017 "Caravaggio and the Enfranchisement of Women. New Discoveries"_]'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum organizations===
Similar to Nochlins’ assertions on women’s position in the art world, art historian [[Carol Duncan]] in the 1989 article, “The MoMA Hot Mamas”, examines the idea that institutions like the [[MoMA]] are masculinized. In MoMA’s collection, there is a disproportionate amount of sexualized female bodies by male artists on display compared to a low percentage of actual women artists included.&lt;ref name="Duncan MoMA"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/776968?uid=3739400&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104799788381 | title=The MoMA Hot Mamas | work=Art Journal | date=1998 | accessdate=2014-11-28 | last=Duncan | first=Carol | pages=171–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data accumulated by the Guerrilla Girls, “less than 3% of the artists in the Modern Art section of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art are women, but 83% of the nudes are female”, even though “51% of visual artists today are women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get the Facts|work = National Museum of Women in the Arts |url= http://nmwa.org/advocate/get-facts |accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan claims that, in regards to women artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the MoMA and other museums, their numbers are kept well below the point where they might effectively dilute its masculinity. The female presence is necessary only in the form of imagery. Of course, men, too, are occasionally represented. Unlike women, who are seen primarily as sexually accessible bodies, men are portrayed as physically and mentally active beings who creatively shape their world and ponder its meanings.&lt;ref name="Duncan MoMA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article narrows its focus on one institution to use as an example to draw from and expand on. Ultimately to illustrate the ways in which institutions are complicit in patriarchal and racist ideologies.

=== Intersectionality ===

Women of color in the art world were often not addressed in earlier feminist art criticism. An intersectional analysis that includes not only gender but also race and other marginalized identities is essential.

[[Audre Lorde]]’s 1984 essay “[http://www.muhlenberg.edu/media/contentassets/pdf/campuslife/sdp%20reading%20lorde.pdf The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House],” briefly addresses a vital dilemma that artists who are women of color are often overlooked or tokenized in the visual arts. She argues that "in academic feminist circles, the answer to these questions is often, ‘We did not know who to ask.’ But that is the same evasion of responsibility, the same cop-out, that keeps Black women's art out of women's exhibitions, Black women's work out of most feminist publications except for the occasional ‘Special Third World Women's Issue,’ and Black women's texts off your reading lists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last = Lorde| first = Audre| author-link = Audre Lorde | title = The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House| work = [[Sister Outsider]]: Essays and Speeches| year=1984|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Berkeley|pages=110–114|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde’s statement brings up how important it is to consider intersectionality in these feminist art discourses, as race is just as integral to any discussion on gender.

Furthermore, [[bell hooks]] expands on the discourse of black representation in the visual arts to include other factors. In her 1995 book, ''Art on My Mind'', hooks positions her writings on the visual politics of both race and class in the art world. She states that the reason art is rendered meaningless in the lives of most black people is not solely due to the lack of representation, but also because of an entrenched colonization of the mind and imagination and how it is intertwined with the process of identification.&lt;ref name="hooks Art"&gt;{{Cite book| last =hooks| first = bell| author-link = bell hooks | date=1995|title = Art on My Mind: Visual Politics|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31737494|location= New York|publisher= New Press|isbn= 9781565842632|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Thus she stresses for a “shift [in] conventional ways of thinking about the function of art. There must be a revolution in the way we see, the way we look,"&lt;ref name="hooks Art" /&gt;{{rp|4}} emphasizing how visual art has the potential to be an empowering force within the black community. Especially if one can break free from "imperialist white-supremacist notions of the way art should look and function in society."&lt;ref name="hooks Art" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

== Intersection with other schools of thought ==
Feminist art criticism is a smaller subgroup in the larger realm of [[feminist theory]], because feminist theory seeks to explore the themes of [[discrimination]], [[sexual objectification]], [[oppression]], [[patriarchy]], and [[stereotyping]], feminist art criticism attempts similar exploration.

This exploration can be accomplished through a variety of means. [[Structuralism|Structuralist theories]], [[deconstructionist]] thought, [[psychoanalysis]], [[Queer theory|queer analysis]], and [[semiotic]] interpretations can be used to further comprehend gender symbolism and representation in artistic works. The social structures regarding gender that influence a piece can be understood through interpretations based on stylistic influences and biographical interpretations.

=== Freudian Psychoanalytic Theory ===

[[Laura Mulvey]]'s 1975 essay, "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]" focuses on the gaze of the spectator from a Freudian perspective. Freud's concept of [[scopophilia]] relates to the objectification of women in art works. The gaze of the viewer is, in essence, a sexually charged instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Mulvey|first= Laura|author-link= Laura Mulvey|editor1-first= Karyn|editor1-last= Kay|editor2-first= Gerald|editor2-last= Peary|editor2-link= Gerald Peary|encyclopedia= Women and the Cinema: A Critical Anthology|title= Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|year= 1977|publisher= Dutton|location= New York|isbn= 0525474595|oclc= 3315936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the gender inequity that exists in the art sphere, the artist's portrayal of a subject is generally a man's portrayal of women. Other [[Freudian]] symbolism can be used to comprehend pieces of art from a feminist perspective—whether gender specific symbols are uncovered through psychoanalytic theory (such as [[phallic]] or [[yonic]] symbols) or specific symbols are used to represent women in a given piece.

=== Realism and Reflectionism ===
Are the women depicted in an artistic work realistic portrayals of women? Writer [[Toril Moi]] explained in her 1985 essay "'Images of Women' Criticism" that "reflectionism posits that the artist's selective creation should be measured against 'real life,' thus assuming that the only constraint on the artist's work is his or her perception of the 'real world.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= Moi|first= Toril|author-link= Toril Moi|editor-first= Moi|editor-last= Toril|editor-link= Toril Moi|encyclopedia= Sexual/Textual Politics: Feminist Literary Theory|title= 'Images of women’ criticism|year= 1985|publisher= Methuen|location= London|isbn= 0416353606|oclc= 12103885|pages= 42ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals and publication ==
The 1970s also saw the emergence of feminist art journals, including ''The Feminist Art Journal'' in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: Feminist Timeline: United States|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_timeline/plain_text.php|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies]]'' in 1977. The journal ''[[n.paradoxa]]'' has been dedicated to an international perspective on feminist art since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktpress.co.uk/feminist-art-magazines.asp A List of Past and Present Feminist Art Journals on n.paradoxa's information pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond the academy ==
In 1989, the [[Guerrilla Girls|Guerilla Girls]]' poster protest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW WOMEN GET MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IN ART MUSEUMS|url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml|accessdate=1 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125204514/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml|archivedate=25 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s gender imbalance brought this feminist critique out of the academy and into the public sphere.

===Exhibition===
In 2007, the exhibit "[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]" presented works of 120 international artists and artists’ groups at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Johnson| first = Ken| author-link1 = Ken Johnson (art critic)|title = WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution - Art - Review| work = New York Times| accessdate = 2014-11-28| date = 2008-02-15| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/arts/design/15wack.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of its kind that employed a comprehensive view of the intersection between feminism and art from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Ozler Wack"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Ozler| first = Levent| title = Wack!: Art and the Feminist Revolution| work = Dexigner| accessdate = 2014-11-28| date = 2007-02-16| url = https://www.dexigner.com/news/10312}}&lt;/ref&gt; WACK! “argues that feminism was perhaps the most influential of any postwar art movement-on an international level-in its impact on subsequent generations of artists.”&lt;ref name="Ozler Wack" /&gt;

== Today ==
Rosemary Betteron’s 2003 essay, “Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism”, insists that older feminist art criticism must adapt to newer models, as our culture has shifted significantly since the late twentieth century. Betterton points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Feminist art criticism is no longer the marginalized discourse that it once was; indeed it had produced some brilliant and engaging writing over the last decade and in many ways has become a key site of academic production. But, as feminist writers and teachers, we need to address ways of thinking through new forms of social engagement between feminism and the visual, and of understanding the different ways in which visual culture is currently inhabited by our students.&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Betterton| first = Rosemary| title = Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism| work = The Feminist Visual Cultural Reader| year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=11–14|accessdate = 2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Betterton, the models used to critique a Pre-Raphaelite painting are not likely to be applicable in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist" /&gt; She also expresses that we should explore ‘difference’ in position and knowledge, since in our contemporary visual culture we are more used to engaging with "multi-layered text and image complexes" (video, digital media, and the Internet).&lt;ref name="Betterton Feminist" /&gt; Our ways of viewing have changed considerably since the 1970s.

'''Fossil fuel phase out''' refers to the discontinuation of the use of [[fossil fuels]], through the decommissioning of operating [[Fossil-fuel power station|fossil fuel-fired power plants]], the prevention of the construction of new ones, and the use of [[alternative energy]] to replace the role of fossil fuels.

The purpose of fossil fuel phase-out is to reduce the negative [[externalities]] that use of fossil fuels cause. Negative externalities refer to the costs a certain activity has over people who did not choose to incur in them. A direct negative externality from fossil fuels' use is [[air pollution]], and an indirect negative externality are [[mining accidents]], that happen as a consequence of the extraction of fossil fuels. Fossil fuel burning contributes to [[climate change]], as it releases [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/contents.html|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007|last=Solomon, S., D.

=== Coal ===
[[File:Top 5 Coal Consumers.png|thumb|Coal consumption trends 1980–2012 in the top five coal-consuming countries ([[Energy Information Administration|US EIA]])]]
[[File:Grand Junction Trip 92007 098.JPG|thumb|right|Coal-fired power plants provided 30% of consumed electricity in the United States in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_1_01|title=Electric Power Monthly - Table 1.1.

Coal is one of the largest sources of energy, supplying 28.6% percent of the world's primary energy in 2014 (equivalent to 3,917&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]) according to the [[International Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf|title=Key World Energy Statistics|date=2016|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal combustion accounted for 14,863&amp;nbsp;Mt of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2014, which is equivalent to a 45.9% of fossil fuel emissions from combustion (excluding non-energy emissions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To decrease carbon emissions and thus possibly stop extreme climate change, some have called for coal to be phased out.&lt;ref&gt;Kharecha, P.A., and J.E.

Hansen said "We need a moratorium on coal now...with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/europe/23coal.html?_r=2&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin|title=Europe Turns Back to Coal, Raising Climate Fears|last=Rosenthal|first=Elizabeth|date=23 April 2008|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|quote=“We need a moratorium on coal now,” he added, “with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades.”|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in [[Science (journal)|Science]] in 2017, coal has to be phased-out globally by about 2030, if the agreed 2&amp;nbsp;°C target is taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Rockström]] et al.: ''A roadmap for rapid decarbonization''. In: Science. 355, 6331, 2017, pp. 1269–1271, {{DOI|10.1126/science.aah3443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations have decreased their coal consumption thus far in the 21st century, the greatest reductions being in the United States (coal consumption reduced by 176 million metric tons per year over the period 2000–2012), Canada (reduced by 21 million tons per year) and Spain (20 million tons per year). Other nations have increased their coal consumption in the same period, led by China (increased 2,263 million metric tons per year in the period 2000–2012), India (increased 367 million tons per year), and South Korea (59 million tons per year). Worldwide, coal consumption increased 60% during the period 2000–2012.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&amp;pid=1&amp;aid=2 International statistics: coal consumption], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, 1200 new coal power plants were reportedly being planned worldwide, most of them in China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Damian | last=Carrington | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/20/coal-plants-world-resources-institute | title=More than 1,000 new coal plants being planned | newspaper=The Guardian, | date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011–2013 period, the [[OECD]] group of Western European countries has increased the use of coal, attributed largely to the low cost of coal and the high price of imported natural gas in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=US EIA | url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail/2013-09-27/multiple-factors-push-western-europe-use-less-natural-gas-and-more | title=Multiple factors push Western Europe to use less natural gas and more coal | date=27 September 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150527/http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail/2013-09-27/multiple-factors-push-western-europe-use-less-natural-gas-and-more | archivedate=27 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, coal consumption has peaked in China in 2013 or 2014, depending on the data used and fell in 2015 by 3.6%, even though there was a growth of GDP of 6.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qi | first1 = Ye | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = China's post-coal growth | url = | journal = [[Nature Geoscience]] | volume =  9| issue = | pages =  564–566| doi = 10.1038/ngeo2777 | bibcode = 2016NatGe...9..564Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; After smaller increases, consumption remained below the prior peak by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Qi Ye, Jiaqi Lu ([[Brookings Institute]]): China's coal comsumption has peaked[https://www.brookings.edu/2018/01/22/chinas-coal-consumption-has-peaked/], 20.

According to [[Scientific American]], the average coal plant emits more than 100 times as much radiation per year than does a comparatively sized nuclear power plant, in the form of fly ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste|title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste: By burning away all the pesky carbon and other impurities, coal power plants produce heaps of radiation|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some like the "coal advisory board" of the IEA believe that coal should not be phased out, considering that longer-term global economic growth cannot be achieved without adequate and affordable energy supplies, which will require continuing significant contributions from fossil fuels including coal.

=== Oil ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Oil is refined into [[fuel oil]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[gasoline]]. The refined products are primarily for transportation by conventional cars, trucks, trains, planes and ships.  Popular alternatives are [[human-powered transport]], [[public transport]], [[electric vehicles]], and [[biofuels]].

=== Natural gas ===
{{Main|Natural gas}}
Although natural gas has about half the carbon intensity of coal it is also the single largest source of [[atmospheric methane]] in the United States. It is seen by many as a temporary "bridge fuel" to replace coal, but in turn to be replaced by renewable sources. However this "bridge fuel" is likely to  significantly extend the use of fossil fuel as the average plant life is 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://energycenter.org/sites/default/files/docs/nav/policy/research-and-reports/Natural_Gas_Bridge_Fuel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gas consumption has tripled since 1971, and by 2015 it was generating half as much electricity as coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyNaturalGasTrends.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417225701/https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyNaturalGasTrends.pdf|title=Key natural gas trends|year=2015|archive-date=2016-04-17|website=www.iea.org|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the consumption of gas is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2040, the phase out is likely to be many years in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/topics/naturalgas/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
The basis of phasing-out fossil fuels consists mainly of the projected lower cost of renewable sources of energy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irena.org/publications/2018/Jan/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2017&lt;/ref&gt; but the avoidance of risks in health and [[mitigation of global warming]] are also important considerations.

=== Health ===
Using computer modeling he developed over 20 years, [[Mark Z. Jacobson]] has found that [[carbon]]aceous fuel [[particulate matter|soot emissions]] (which lead to respiratory illness, heart disease, and asthma) have resulted in 1.5 million premature deaths each year, mostly in the developing world where the non-fossil fuels wood and animal dung are used for cooking. Jacobson has also said that soot from diesel engines, coal-fired power plants, and burning wood is a "bigger cause of global warming than previously thought, and is the major cause of the rapid melting of the Arctic's sea ice".&lt;ref name="dp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Scientists-say-soot-a-key-factor-in-warming-3180603.php#ixzz0v1KwN5yZ | title=Scientists say soot a key factor in warming | work=SFGate | date=28 July 2010 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Perlman, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies are needed:

{{Block quote|Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/pdfs/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Future%2011-16-11.pdf |title=Toward a Sustainable Future for the U.S. Power Sector: Beyond Business as Usual 2011 |author=Synapse Energy Economics |date=16 November 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Global warming mitigation ===
{{See|Global warming}}In 2008, [[James E. Hansen|James Hansen]] and nine other scientists published a journal article titled "Target atmospheric {{co2}}: Where should humanity aim?" which calls for a complete phase-out of coal power by 2030.&lt;ref name="hansen-etal-2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last2=Sato |first2=Makiko| last3=Kharecha |first3=Pushker| last4=Beerling|first4=David|last5=Berner|first5=Robert|last6=Masson-Delmotte|first6=Valerie|authorlink6=Valerie Masson-Delmotte | last7=Pagani |first7=Mark | last8=Raymo | first8=Maureen| last9=Royer | first9=Dana L | date=31 October 2008 | title=Target atmospheric {{co2}}: Where should humanity aim?|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/TargetCO2_20080407.pdf|journal=The Open Atmospheric Science Journal|volume=2|pages=217–231|arxiv=0804.1126|bibcode=2008OASJ....2..217H|doi=10.2174/1874282300802010217|access-date=2016-10-31|first1=James|last1=Hansen|first10=James C|last10=Zachos}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Hansen has stated that continued [[opposition to nuclear power]] threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/|title=Top climate change scientists issue open letter to policy influencers - CNN.com|date=3 November 2013|author=By|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter, co-authored with other climate change experts declared "If we stay on the current path," he said, "those are the consequences we'll be leaving to our children. The best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power. It's ready now. We need to take advantage of it." and "Continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."

Also in 2008, Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen published a peer-reviewed scientific study analyzing the effect of a coal phase-out on atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Implications of "peak oil" for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and climate|url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2008/Kharecha_Hansen.html|journal=Global Biogeochem. Cycles|volume=22|issue=3|pages=GB3012|arxiv=0704.2782|bibcode=2008GBioC..22.3012K|doi=10.1029/2007GB003142|author1=Kharecha, P.A.|author2=J.E. Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050. The authors describe the scenario as follows:

{{quote|The second scenario, labeled Coal Phase-out, is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions.  Between 2025 and 2050 it is assumed that both developed and developing countries will linearly phase out emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from coal usage.  Thus in Coal Phase-out we have global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal increasing 2% per year until 2012, 1% per year growth of coal emissions between 2013 and 2022, flat coal emissions for 2023–2025, and finally a linear decrease to zero CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal in 2050.  These rates refer to emissions to the atmosphere and do not constrain consumption of coal, provided the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is captured and sequestered. Oil and gas emissions are assumed to be the same as in the BAU [business as usual] scenario.}}

Kharecha and Hansen also consider three other mitigation scenarios, all with the same coal phase-out schedule but each making different assumptions about the size of oil and gas reserves and the speed at which they are depleted. Under the Business as Usual scenario, atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at 563 parts per million (ppm) in the year 2100. Under the four coal phase-out scenarios, atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at 422-446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter. The key implications of the study are as follows: a phase-out of coal emissions is the most important remedy for mitigating human-induced global warming; actions should be taken toward limiting or stretching out the use of conventional oil and gas; and strict emissions-based constraints are needed for future use of unconventional fossil fuels such as [[methane hydrates]] and [[tar sands]].

In December 2015, [[Greenpeace]] and [[Climate Action Network|Climate Action Network Europe]] released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across Europe.

A September 2016 report by Oil Change International, concludes that the carbon emissions embedded in the coal, oil, and gas in currently working mines and fields, assuming that these run to the end of their working lifetimes, will take the world to just beyond the 2{{nnbsp}}°C limit contained in the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] and even further from the 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C goal.&lt;ref name="mathiesen-2016"&gt;

In October 2016, the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) and 11 other [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s released a report on the impact of building new coal-fired power plants in countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks access to electricity.  The report concludes that, on the whole, building coal-fired power plants does little to help the poor and may make them poorer.  Moreover, wind and solar generation are beginning to challenge coal on cost.&lt;ref name="nuccitelli-2016"&gt;

A 2018 study in Nature Energy, suggests that 10 countries in Europe could completely phase out coal-fired electricity generation with their current infrastructure, whilst the United States and Russia could phase out at least 30%.&lt;ref name="wilson-and-staffell-2018"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges of fossil fuel phase-out ==
The phase-out of fossil fuels involves many challenges, and one of them is the reliance that currently the world has on them. In 2014, fossil fuels provided 81.1% of the [[primary energy consumption]] of the world, with approximately 11,109&amp;nbsp;Mtoe. This number is composed by 4,287&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of oil consumption; 3,918&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of coal consumption, and 2,904&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of natural gas consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf|title=Key World Energy Statistics|last=|first=|date=2016|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil fuel phase-out can lead to an increment in electricity prices, because of the new investments needed to replace their share in the electricity mix with alternative energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=R|last2=Staffell|first2=I|date=2016|title=Electricity in Europe: exiting fossil fuels?|url=https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-pdf/32/2/282/7298756/grw003.pdf|journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=282-303|doi=10.1093/oxrep/grw003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause to increasing electricity price comes from the need to import the electricity that can't be generated nationally.&lt;ref&gt;Yilmaz, H. Ü., Bchini, Q., Keles, D., Hartel, R., Fichtner, W., Mikulić, M., &amp; Jakšić, D. (2016). Impacts of a UK and German coal phase-out on the electricity mix and CO 2 emissions in Europe. ''Insight Energy'', (April).

Another impact of a phase-out of fossil fuels is in the employment. In the case of employments in the fossil fuel industry, a phase-out is logically undesired, therefore, people in the industry will usually oppose any measures that put their industries under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Heinrichs 285–305"/&gt; Endre Tvinnereim and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten studied the relationship between employment in the fossil fuel industry with the support to climate change policies. They proposed that one opportunity for displaced drilling employments in the fossil fuel industry could be in the geothermal energy industry. This was suggested as a result of their conclusion: people and companies in the fossil fuel industry will likely oppose measures that endanger their employments, unless they have other stronger alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tvinnereim|first=Endre|last2=Ivarsflaten|first2=Elisabeth|date=2016-09-01|title=Fossil fuels, employment, and support for climate policies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516302828|journal=Energy Policy|volume=96|pages=364–371|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.05.052}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be extrapolated to political interests, that can push against the phase-out of fossil fuels initiative. One example is how the vote of [[United Stats|US]] Congress members is related to the preeminence of fossil fuel industries in their respective states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cragg|first=Michael I.|last2=Zhou|first2=Yuyu|last3=Gurney|first3=Kevin|last4=Kahn|first4=Matthew E.|date=2013-04-01|title=Carbon Geography: The Political Economy of Congressional Support for Legislation Intended to Mitigate Greenhouse Gas Production|ssrn=2225690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation and initiatives to phase out coal ==

=== Major economies ===
In 8 June 2015, several newspapers ran an article wrote that the leaders of the [[Group of Seven]] (or G7, consisting of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) agreed to phase-out fossil fuel use by 2100,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/g7-leaders-agree-phase-out-fossil-fuel-use-end-of-century|title=G7 leaders agree to phase out fossil fuel use by end of century|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2015-06-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ec2c365a-0ddf-11e5-aa7b-00144feabdc0|title=G7 leaders agree to phase out fossil fuels|last=Clark|first=Pilita|date=8 June 2015|work=Financial Times|access-date=|last2=Wagstyl|first2=Stefan|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the efforts to keep global temperature increase under 2°C. This was done as a prelude for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (a.k.a. [[COP 21]]) hosted in Paris, on December of the same year.

=== Australia ===
[[File:Graph RE Australia 2010.svg|thumb|Electricity generation from renewable sources in Australia in 2010]]

The [[Australian Greens]] party have proposed to phase out coal power stations. The NSW Greens proposed an immediate moratorium on coal-fired power stations and want to end all coal mining and [[coal industry subsidies]].  The Australian Greens and the [[Australian Labor Party]] also oppose nuclear power.  The Federal Government and Victorian State Government want to modify existing coal-fired power stations into clean coal power stations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The Federal Labor government extended the [[Mandatory Renewable Energy Target#Australia|mandatory renewable energy target]]s, an initiative to ensure that new sources of electricity are more likely to be from wind power, solar power and other sources of [[renewable energy in Australia]].  [[Australia]] is one of the largest consumers of coal per capita, and also the largest exporter. The proposals are strongly opposed by industry, unions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australian-options.org.au/issues/options_53/article_colley.php Australian Options Magazine, CFMEU on coal phase out] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320100225/http://www.australian-options.org.au/issues/options_53/article_colley.php |date=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the main Opposition Party in Parliament (now forming the party in government after the September 2013 election).

=== Canada ===
In 2005, Canada annually burned 60 million tons of coal, mainly for electrical power, increasing by 15 percent annually.

In November 2016, Canada announced plans to phase-out coal-fired electricity generation by 2030.&lt;ref name="the-guardian-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2005, [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] planned coal phase-out legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050216005791/en/Ontarios-Coal-Phase-out-Drastic-Consequences-Thinking-Companies#.Uv-cnP0-vCE Ontario's Coal Phase-out Will Have Drastic Consequences, Say The Thinking Companies]. 16 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario annually consumed 15 million tons of coal in large power plants to supplement nuclear power. [[Nanticoke Generating Station]] was a major source of air pollution, and Ontario suffered "smog days" during the summer.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}
In 2007, Ontario's Liberal government committed to phasing out all coal generation in the province by 2014.

=== China ===
There are currently no plans to phase out coal burning power stations in the [[People's Republic of China]] on the national level.

China's exceedingly high energy demand has pushed the demand for relatively cheap coal-fired power. Each week, another 2&amp;nbsp;GW of coal-fired power is put online in China.  Coal supplies about 80% of China's energy needs today, and that ratio is expected to continue, even as overall power usage grows rapidly. Serious air quality deterioration has resulted from the massive use of coal and many Chinese cities suffer severe smog events.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

As a consequence the region of Beijing has decided to phase out all its coal-fired power generation by the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/singapore/chinas-beijing-city-to-abolish-coal-fired-power-27490804|title=China's Beijing city to abolish coal-fired power plants by end 2014 - Electric Power - Platts News Article &amp; Story|website=www.platts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update inline|date=November 2016}}

In 2009, China had 172&amp;nbsp;GW of installed hydro capacity the largest in the world, producing 16% of China's electricity, the Eleventh Five-Year Plan has set a 300&amp;nbsp;GW target for 2020. China built the world's largest power plant of any kind, the [[Three Gorges Dam]].

[[Hard coal]] mining has long been subsidized in Germany, reaching a peak of €6.7{{nbsp}}billion in 1996 and dropping to €2.7{{nbsp}}billion in 2005 due to falling output.

Coal is still the largest source of power in Germany.

In 2007, [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] and her party agreed to legislation to phase out Germany's hard coal mining sector. That does not mean that they support phasing out coal in general. There were plans to build about 25 new plants in the coming years. Most German coal power plants were built in the 1960s, and have a low energy efficiency. Public sentiment against coal power plants is growing and the construction or planning of some plants has been stopped.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; A number are under construction and still being built. No concrete plan is in place to reduce coal-fired electricity generation. As of October 2015, the remaining coal plants still under planning include: Niederaussem, Profen, and Stade. The coal plants currently under construction include: Mannheim, Hamm D, Datteln, and Willhelmshaven. Between 2012 and 2015, six new plants went online. All of these plants are 600–1800&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]]&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energytransition.de/2015/10/the-demise-of-coal-in-germany-and-globally/|title=The demise of coal in Germany and globally|date=15 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Germany's coal consumption dropped for the first time, having risen each year since the low during the 2009 recession.&lt;ref name="bp-statistical-review-2015"&gt;

A 2014 study, found that coal is not making a comeback in Germany, as is sometimes claimed.  Rather renewables have more than offset the nuclear facilities that have been shutdown as a result of Germany's [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''Atomausstieg'').  Hard coal plants now face financial stringency as their operating hours are cut back by the market.  But in contrast, [[lignite]]-fired generation is in a safe position until the {{nowrap|mid-2020s}} unless government policies change.  To phase-out coal, Germany should seek to strength the emissions trading system ([[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]), consider a carbon tax, promote [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and strengthen the use of natural gas as a bridge fuel.&lt;ref name="jungjohann-and-morris-2014"&gt;

In 2016, the German government and affected [[lignite]] power plant operators [[:de:Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlengesellschaft|Mibrag]], [[RWE]], and [[Vattenfall]] reached an understanding (''Verständigung'') on the transfer of lignite power plant units into security standby (''Überführung von Braunkohlekraftwerksblöcken in die Sicherheitsbereitschaft'').  As a result, eight lignite-fired power plants are to be mothballed and later closed, with the first plant scheduled to cease operation in October 2016 and the last in October 2019.  The affected operators will receive state compensation for foregone profits.  The [[European Commission]] has declared government plans to use €1.6{{nbsp}}billion of public financing for this purpose to be in line with EU [[state aid]] rules.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-2016"&gt;

A 2016 study, found that the phase-out of lignite in [[Lusatia]] (''Lausitz'') by 2030 can be financed by future owner [[Energetický a průmyslový holding|EPH]] in a manner that avoids taxpayer involvement.  Instead, liabilities covering decommissioning and land rehabilitation could be paid by EPH directly into a foundation, perhaps run by the public company [[:de:Lausitzer und Mitteldeutsche Bergbau-Verwaltungsgesellschaft|LMBV]].

As of 2007, South Africa's power sector is the 8th highest global emitter of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071114163448.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005/2006, 77% of South Africa's energy demand was directly met by coal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dme.gov.za/energy/coal.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202053007/http://www.dme.gov.za/energy/coal.stm |archivedate=2 December 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when current projects come online, this ratio will increase in the near term.

There are no plans to phase out coal-fired power plants in South Africa, and indeed, the country is investing in building massive amounts of new coal-fired capacity to meet power demands, as well as modernizing the existing coal-fired plants to meet environmental requirements.

On April 6, 2010, the World Bank approved a $3.75B loan to South Africa to support the construction of the world's 4th largest coal-fired plant, at Medupi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7088297.ece | work=[[The Times]] | location=London | title=Britain may block World Bank loan for coal plant in South Africa | first=Ben | last=Webster | date=April 6, 2010 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The proposed World Bank loan includes a relatively small amount{{snd}} $260 million{{snd}} for wind and solar power.

Rated at 4800&amp;nbsp;GW, [[Medupi Power Station]] would join other mammoth coal-fired power plants already in operation in the country, namely [[Kendal Power Station]] (4100&amp;nbsp;GW), [[Majuba Power Station]] (4100&amp;nbsp;GW), and [[Matimba Power Station]] (4000&amp;nbsp;GW), as well as a similar-capacity [[Kusile Power Station]], at 4800&amp;nbsp;GW, currently under construction.  Kusile is expected to come online in stages, starting in 2012, while Medupi is expected to first come online in 2013, with full capacity available by 2017.  These schedules are provisional, and may change.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Since 2008, South Africa's government started funding [[solar water heating]] installations. As of January 2016, there have been 400 000 domestic installations in total, with free-of-charge installation of low-pressure solar water heaters for low-cost homes or low-income households which have access to the electricity grid, while other installations are subsidised.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ee.co.za/article/solar-water-heater-rollout-programme-gains-momentum.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[Ed Miliband]] ([[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|energy secretary]] from 3 October 2008{{snd}} 11 May 2010) announced that no new coal-fired power stations will be built in Britain from 2009 onwards unless they capture and bury at least 25% of greenhouse gases immediately and 100% by 2025 although at the time this was a statement of intent rather than something he was able to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/23/clean-coal-energy-policy | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Vidal | title=Clean coal push marks reversal of UK energy policy | date=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Huhne]] (energy secretary from 12 May 2010{{snd}} 5 February 2012) has confirmed that the legislation required to allow his office to enforce [[Emission standard#UK|emissions standards]] are proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/1806551/huhne-promises-coal-plants-ccs |title=Huhne promises no more coal plants without CCS |publisher=BusinessGreen |date=17 Aug 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK is also subject to the EU's [[Large Combustion Plant Directive]] covering non-CO2 emissions which is expected to bring many older plants to a close over the next few years as they are too expensive to upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/industrial/eu-international/lcpd/ |title=Large Combustion Plant Directive « Industrial emissions |publisher=Defra.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424052427/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/industrial/eu-international/lcpd/ |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amber Rudd]] (energy secretary from 11 May 2015) announced on 18 November 2015 that all coal-fired power stations would close by 2025. This will not be a complete phase out of fossil fuels because gas-fired power stations will continue to provide some [[firm power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/12001752/UK-coal-plants-must-close-by-2025-Amber-Rudd-to-announce.html|title=UK coal plants must close by 2025, Amber Rudd announces|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 154 new coal-fired plants were on the drawing board in 42 states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2006/10/71952 Eco Concern: Coal Plant Boom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214223405/http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2006/10/71952 |date=14 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, that had dropped to 15, mostly due to new rules limiting mercury emissions, and limiting carbon emissions to 1,000 pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per megawatt-hour of electricity produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303404704577307524051798192|title=EPA Proposes CO|author=Keith Johnson in Washington, Rebecca Smith in San Francisco and Kris Maher in Pittsburgh|date=28 March 2012|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, US Secretary of Energy [[Ernest Moniz]] outlined Obama administration policy on fossil fuels:

{{Block quote|In the last four years, we’ve more than doubled renewable energy generation from wind and solar power.  However, coal and other fossil fuels still provide 80 percent of our energy, 70 percent of our electricity, and will be a major part of our energy future for decades.  That’s why any serious effort to protect our kids from the worst effects of climate change must also include developing, demonstrating and deploying the technologies to use our abundant fossil fuel resources as cleanly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Moritz, [http://energy.gov/articles/excerpts-energy-secretary-ernest-moniz-s-remarks-national-energy-technology-laboratory Excerpts of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz’s Remarks at National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown], [[United States Department of Energy]], 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then-US Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu]] and researchers for the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] have noted that greater electrical generation by non-[[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] renewables, such as wind and solar, will also increase the need for flexible natural gas-powered generators, to supply electricity during those times when solar and wind power are unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;April Lee and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56324.pdf Opportunities for synergy between natural gas and renewable energy], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Funk, [http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2012/01/doe_boss_says_shale_gas_could.html DOE boss says shale gas could benefit wind and solar], Cleveland Plain Dealer, 18 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Gas-powered generators have the ability to ramp up and down quickly to meet changing loads.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=13191 Natural gas-fired combustion turbines are generally used to meet peak electricity load], 1 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, many of the fossil fuel phase-out initiatives have taken place at the state or local levels.

==== California ====
[[California]]'s SB 1368 created the first governmental moratorium on new coal plants in the United States. The law was signed in September 2006 by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/emission_standards/index.html |title=SB 1368 Emission Performance Standards |publisher=Energy.ca.gov |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; took effect for investor-owned utilities in January 2007, and took effect for publicly owned utilities in August 2007. SB 1368 applied to long-term investments (five years or more) by California utilities, whether in-state or out-of-state. It set the standard for greenhouse gas emissions at 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, equal to the emissions of a combined-cycle natural gas plant. This standard created a de facto moratorium on new coal, since it could not be met without carbon capture and sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solutionsforglobalwarming.org/docs/SB1368_FS_FINAL.pdf "California Takes on Power Plant Emissions: SB 1368 Sets Groundbreaking Greenhouse Gas Performance Standard,"] [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] Fact Sheet, August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maine ====
On April 15, 2008, [[Maine]] Governor [[John E. Baldacci]] signed LD 2126, "An Act To Minimize Carbon Dioxide Emissions from New Coal-Powered Industrial and Electrical Generating Facilities in the State." The law, which was sponsored by Rep. W. Bruce MacDonald (D-[[Boothbay, Maine|Boothbay]]), requires the Board of Environmental Protection to develop greenhouse gas emission standards for coal gasification facilities. It also puts a moratorium in place on building any new coal gasification facilities until the standards are developed.&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda Erskine, [http://www.wcsh6.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=84867 "Maine Governor Baldacci Signs Bill to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions,"] [[WCSH]] [[WCSH6]].com, April 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oregon ====
In early March 2016, Oregon lawmakers approved a plan to stop paying for out-of-state coal plants by 2030 and require a 50 percent renewable energy standard by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/oregon-lawmakers-approve-far-reaching-climate-change-bill/ar-BBqiuvg?ocid=ansmsnnews11|title=Oregon lawmakers approve far-reaching climate change bill|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305215204/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/oregon-lawmakers-approve-far-reaching-climate-change-bill/ar-BBqiuvg?ocid=ansmsnnews11|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental groups such as the [[American Wind Energy Association]] and leading Democrats praised the bill.

==== Texas ====
In 2006 a coalition of [[Texas]] groups organized a campaign in favor of a statewide moratorium on new coal-fired power plants. The campaign culminated in a "Stop the Coal Rush" mobilization, including rallying and lobbying, at the state capital in  [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] on February 11 and 12th, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texas.sierraclub.org/press/newsreleases/20070125.asp "Stop the Coal Rush" Rally &amp; Lobby Day Set for February 11 &amp; 12"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030034206/http://texas.sierraclub.org/press/newsreleases/20070125.asp |date=30 October 2008 }}, [[Sierra Club]] Lone Star Chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40 citizen groups supported the mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthecoalrush.com/participating-organizations/ |title=StopTheCoalRush - Hot Rush in Marketing |work=stopthecoalrush.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513110722/http://www.stopthecoalrush.com/participating-organizations/ |archivedate=13 May 2008 |df=dmy }}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2007, A resolution calling for a 180-day moratorium on new pulverized coal plants was filed in the Texas Legislature by State Rep. [[Charles "Doc" Anderson]] (R-Waco) as House Concurrent Resolution 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/80R/billtext/pdf/HC00043I.pdf|title=Text of HCR 43|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was left pending in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=80R&amp;Bill=HCR43|title=Texas Legislature Online - 80(R) History for HCR 43|work=state.tx.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2007, Rep. Anderson announced his support for two proposed  [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) coal plants proposed by [[Luminant]] (formerly TXU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docandersonfortexas.com/news.htm Rep.

==== Washington state ====
[[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] has followed the same approach as California, prohibiting coal plants whose emissions would exceed those of natural gas plants. Substitute Senate Bill 6001 (SSB 6001), signed on May 3, 2007, by Governor [[Christine Gregoire]], enacted the standard.&lt;ref name="whitmanpioneer.com"&gt;Christina Russell, [http://whitmanpioneer.com/outdoors/2007/11/15/wallula-coal-plant-proposal-controversial-among-students-faculty/ "Wallula Coal Plant Proposal Controversial Among Students, Faculty,"] [[Whitman College]] Pioneer, 11/15/07&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of SSB 6001, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090716184525/http://www.energy-northwest.com/generation/igcc/index.php Pacific Mountain Energy Center] in Kalama was rejected by the state. However, a new plant proposal, the [http://www.wallulaenergy.com/ Wallula Energy Resource Center], shows the limits of the "natural gas equivalency" approach as a means of prohibiting new coal plants. The proposed plant would meet the standard set by SSB 6001 by capturing and sequestering a portion (65 percent, according to a plant spokesman) of its carbon.&lt;ref name="whitmanpioneer.com"/&gt;

=== Japan ===
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, made a major move to use more fossil fuels in 2012, when the nation shut down nuclear reactors following the Fukishima accident. Nuclear, which had supplied 30 percent of Japanese electricity from 1987 to 2011, supplied only 2 percent in 2012 (hydropower supplied 8 percent). Nuclear electricity was replaced with electricity from petroleum, coal, and liquified natural gas. As a result, electricity generation from fossil fuels rose to 90 percent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=10391  "Japan’s fossil-fueled generation remains high because of continuing nuclear plant outages"], US Energy Information Administration, 15 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Japanese government announced plans to build 45 new coal-fired power plants in the next ten years, largely to replace expensive electricity from petroleum power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Babs McHugh, [http://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/sydney/japan-plans-to-build-45-new-coal-power-plants-27762428 "Japan plans to build 45 coal power plants in next decade,"] Platts, 3 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opinion polls ===

==== Opinion research ====
In October 2007, [http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/ Civil Society Institute] released the results of a poll of 1,003 US citizens conducted by Opinion Research Corporation.

The authors of the poll reported:
"75 percent of Americans—including 65 percent of Republicans, 83 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Independents—would 'support a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in the United States if there was stepped-up investment in clean, safe renewable energy—such as wind and solar—and improved home energy-efficiency standards.' Women (80 percent) were more likely than men (70 percent) to support this idea. Support also was higher among college graduates (78 percent) than among those who did not graduate from high school (68 percent)."&lt;ref&gt;Opinion Research Corporation, [http://www.cleanenergyaction.net/101807_CLEAN_survey_report.pdf A Post Fossil-Fuel America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201122738/http://www.cleanenergyaction.net/101807_CLEAN_survey_report.pdf |date=1 December 2008 }}, Executive Summary, National Opinion Survey Produced for Citizens Lead for Energy Action Now (CLEAN),
A Project of the Civil Society Institute, 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact question posed by the survey was as follows:
"More than half of power plant-generated electricity comes from coal. Experts say that power plants are responsible for about 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide pollution linked to global warming. There are plans to build more than 150 new coal-fired power plants over the next several years. Would you support a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in the United States if there was stepped-up investment in clean, safe and renewable energy—such as wind and solar—and improved home energy-efficiency standards? Would you say definitely yes, probably yes, probably no, definitely no, or don't know."

==== Gallup ====
In 2013, the Gallup organization determined that 41% of Americans wanted less emphasis placed on coal energy, versus 31% who wanted more. Large majorities wanted more emphasis placed on solar (76%), wind (71%), and natural gas (65%).&lt;ref&gt;Gallup, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/161519/americans-emphasis-solar-wind-natural-gas.aspx Americans want more emphasis on solar, wind, natural gas], 27 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 ABC/Washington Post poll found 52% of Americans favored more coal mining (33% strongly favored), while 45% opposed (27% strongly opposed). The most support was for wind and solar, which were favored by 91% (79% strongly favored).&lt;ref&gt;ABC News/Washington Post, [http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/1093a4Energy.pdf Energy policy has initial support], 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CLEAN call to action ===
In October 2007, fifteen groups led by [http://theclean.org/ Citizens Lead for Energy Action Now] (CLEAN) called for a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants, with no exception for plants sequestering carbon. The groups included Save Our Cumberland Mountains (Tennessee); Ohio Valley Environmental Council (West Virginia); Cook Inlet Keeper (Alaska); Christians for the Mountains (West Virginia); Coal River Mountain Watch (West Virginia); Kentuckians for the Commonwealth (Kentucky); Civil Society Institute (Massachusetts); Clean Power Now (Massachusetts); Indigenous Environmental Network (Minnesota); Castle Mountain Coalition (Alaska); Citizens Action Coalition (Indiana); Appalachian Center for the Economy &amp; the Environment (West Virginia); Appalachian Voices (NC); and Rhode Island Wind Alliance (Rhode Island).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanenergyaction.net/101807release.cfm CLEAN press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155325/http://www.cleanenergyaction.net/101807release.cfm |date=9 May 2008 }}, 18 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental Defense Fund ===
The US-based [[Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF) has taken a stand in favor of natural gas production and [[hydraulic fracturing]], while pressing for stricter environmental controls on gas drilling, as a feasible way to replace coal.&lt;ref&gt;EDF, [http://www.edf.org/energy/natural-gas-policy Natural gas policy], accessed 4 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has funded studies jointly with the petroleum industry on the environmental effects of natural gas production.

== Alternative Sources of Energy ==
{{See also|Alternative energy|energy transition|100% renewable energy}}

[[Alternative energy]] refers to any source of energy that can substitute the role of fossil fuels. [[Renewable energy]], or energy that is harnessed from [[Renewable resource|renewable sources]], is an alternative energy. However, alternative energy can refer to non renewable sources as well, like [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Between the alternative sources of energy are: [[solar energy]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[marine energy]], [[Wind power|wind energy]], [[geothermal energy]], [[biofuel]]s, [[ethanol]] and [[Hydrogen economy|Hydrogen]].

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] is complementary to the use of alternative energy sources, when phasing-out fossil fuels.

=== Renewable energy ===
[[File:Bp world energy consumption 2016.gif|thumb|The worldwide growth of renewable energy is shown by the green line&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview Statistical Review of World Energy], Workbook (xlsx), London, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Renewable energy is [[energy]] that comes from resources which are naturally replenished such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], [[wave power|waves]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]]. {{As of|2014}}, 19% of global final energy consumption comes from [[renewable resource]]s, with 9% of all energy from traditional [[biomass]], mainly used for [[heating]], 1% from biofuels, 4% from [[hydroelectricity]] and 4% from biomass, geothermal or solar heat. Popular renewables (wind, solar, geothermal and biomass for power) accounted for another 1.4% and are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REN21_GSR2016_KeyFindings_en_10.pdf pg18&lt;/ref&gt; While renewable energy supplies are growing and have displaced coal in some regions, the amount of coal burned in 2021, is expected to be the same as it was in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/MediumTermCoalMarketReport2016ExecutiveSummaryEnglishversion.pdf pg3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
[[File:Chief Joseph Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Chief Joseph Dam]] near [[Bridgeport, Washington]], US, is a major run-of-the-river station without a sizeable reservoir.]]
In 2015, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric energy]] generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe and North America environmental concerns around land flooded by large [[reservoir]]s ended 30 years of dam construction in the 1990s. Since then large dams and reservoirs continue to be built in countries like China, Brazil and India. [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] and [[small hydro]] have become popular alternatives to conventional dams that may create reservoirs in environmentally sensitive areas.

=== Wind power ===
{{Main|Wind farm}}
[[File:Turbiny wiatrowe w Szwecji, 2011 ubt.JPG|thumb|[[Lillgrund Wind Farm]] in Sweden]]
[[File:windpark Estinnes 20juli2010 kort voor voltooiing.jpg|thumb|First wind farm consisting of 7,5&amp;nbsp;MW Enercon E-126 turbines, [[Estinnes]], [[Belgium]], 20 July 2010, two months before completion; note the 2-part blades.]]

A wind farm is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

Wind power has grown dramatically since 2005 and by 2015 supplied almost 1% of global energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REN21_GSR2016_KeyFindings_en_10.pdf page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the United States and China. The [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China has over 5,000&amp;nbsp;MW installed with a goal of 20,000&amp;nbsp;MW by 2020. China has several other "wind power bases" of similar size. The [[Alta Wind Energy Center]] in [[California]], United States is the largest onshore wind farm outside of China, with a capacity of 1020&amp;nbsp;MW of power.&lt;ref name=terragen&gt;[http://www.terra-genpower.com/News/Terra-Gen-Power-Announces-Closing-of-$650-Million-.aspx Terra-Gen Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902091230/http://www.terra-genpower.com/News/Terra-Gen-Power-Announces-Closing-of-$650-Million-.aspx |date=2 September 2015 }}, 17 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2012, the [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367&amp;nbsp;MW, followed by [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project]] (300&amp;nbsp;MW), also in the United Kingdom.

Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"&gt;Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biofuels ===
{{Main|Biofuel}}
[[Biofuels]], in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials, are entering the market. However, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008).

=== Biomass ===
[[Biomass]] is [[biomaterial|biological material]] from living, or recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials.&lt;ref name="Biomass Energy Center"&gt;[http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Biomass Energy Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008081905/http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |date=8 October 2006 }}.

Retrieved on 2012-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[renewable energy source]], biomass can either be used directly, or indirectly{{snd}} once or converted into another type of energy product such as [[biofuel]]. Biomass can be converted to energy in three ways: ''thermal conversion'', ''chemical conversion'', and ''biochemical conversion''.

Using biomass as a fuel produces [[air pollution]] in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides), VOCs ([[volatile organic compound]]s), particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as [[coal]] or [[natural gas]]  in some cases (such as with indoor heating and cooking).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal |title=Proposed biomass plant: Better than coal? |author=Eartha Jane Melzer |date=26 January 2010 |work=The Michigan Messenger |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514091947/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal |archivedate=14 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = J. | last2 = Smith | first2 = K.

=== Nuclear energy ===
The 2014 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] report identifies nuclear energy as one of the technologies that can  provide electricity with less than 5% of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 60 nuclear reactors shown as under construction in the list of [[Nuclear power by country]] with China leading at 23. Globally, more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years but overall capacity has increased.&lt;ref name="econ13"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/11/difference-engine-0|title=Difference Engine: The nuke that might have been|date=11 November 2013|author=|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has stated its plans to double nuclear generation by 2030. India also plans to greatly increase its nuclear power.

Several countries have enacted laws to cease construction on new nuclear power stations. Several European countries have debated [[Nuclear power phase-out|nuclear phase-outs]] and others have completely shut down some reactors. Three [[nuclear accidents]] have influenced the slowdown of nuclear power: the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in the United States, the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the USSR, and the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan. Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors and pledged to close the rest by the end of 2022.&lt;ref name="Annika Breidthardt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530|title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest|date=30 May 2011|work=Reuters|author=Annika Breidthardt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://referendum.interno.it/referendum/refe110612/RFT0003.htm|title=Italy Nuclear Referendum Results|date=13 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325171121/http://referendum.interno.it/referendum/refe110612/RFT0003.htm|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland and Spain have banned the construction of new reactors.&lt;ref name="nweek11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/11/27/post-fukushima-nuclear-power-changes-latitudes.html|title=Nuclear Power Goes Rogue|date=28 November 2011|author=[[Henry Sokolski]]|work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in Japan's reliance on nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-28/nuclear-promotion-dropped-in-japan-energy-policy-after-fukushima.html|title=Nuclear Promotion Dropped in Japan Energy Policy After Fukushima|date=28 October 2011|lastauthoramp=yes|author1=Tsuyoshi Inajima|author2=Yuji Okada|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan's president did the same.

=== Energy efficiency ===
{{Main|Efficient energy use}}

Moving away from fossil fuels will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074454/http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency.  Renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] are said to be the "twin pillars" of [[sustainable energy]] policy. [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:&lt;ref name=am&gt;American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007). [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429195906/http://www.aceee.org/store/proddetail.cfm?CFID=785209&amp;CFTOKEN=22090724&amp;ItemID=432&amp;CategoryID=7 ''The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy''] Report E074.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency (2007).

The '''fundamental theorems of asset pricing''' (also: '''of arbitrage''', '''of finance''')  provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a market to be [[arbitrage|arbitrage free]] and for a market to be [[Complete market|complete]]. An arbitrage opportunity is a way of making money with no initial investment without any possibility of loss. Though arbitrage opportunities do exist briefly in real life, it has been said that any sensible market model must avoid this type of profit.&lt;ref name=Pasc&gt;Pascucci, Andrea (2011) ''PDE and Martingale Methods in Option Pricing''. Berlin: [[Springer-Verlag]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} The first theorem is important in that it ensures a fundamental property of market models. Completeness is a common property of market models (for instance the [[Black–Scholes model]]). A complete market is one in which every [[contingent claim]] can be [[Replicating strategy|replicated]]. Though this property is common in models, it is not always considered desirable or realistic.&lt;ref name=Pasc /&gt;{{rp|30}}

==Discrete markets==
In a discrete (i.e. finite state) market, the following hold:&lt;ref name=Pasc /&gt;
#'''The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing''': A discrete market, on a discrete [[probability space]] (Ω, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;), is [[arbitrage|arbitrage-free]] if, and only if, there exists at least one [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] that is [[Equivalence (measure theory)|equivalent]] to the original probability measure, ''P''.
#'''The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing''': An arbitrage-free market (S,B) consisting of a collection of stocks ''S'' and a [[risk-free bond]] ''B'' is [[Complete market|complete]] if and only if there exists a unique risk-neutral measure that is equivalent to ''P'' and has [[numeraire]] ''B''.

==In more general markets==

When stock price returns follow a single [[Brownian motion]], there is a unique risk neutral measure.   When the stock price process is assumed to follow a more general [[sigma-martingale]] or [[semimartingale]], then the concept of arbitrage is too narrow, and a stronger concept such as [[no free lunch with vanishing risk]] must be used to describe these opportunities in an infinite dimensional setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What is... a Free Lunch?|first1=Freddy|last1=Delbaen|first2=Walter|last2=Schachermayer|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=51|number=5|pages=526–528|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200405/what-is.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9213">'''Geons''' are the simple 2D or 3D forms such as [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]], [[brick]]s, [[Wedge (geometry)|wedge]]s, [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], [[circles]] and [[rectangle]]s corresponding to the simple parts of an object in [[Irving Biederman|Biederman's]] [[recognition-by-components theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.94.2.115 |title=Recognition-by-components: A theory of human image understanding |year=1987 |last1=Biederman |first1=Irving |journal=Psychological Review |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=115–47 |pmid=3575582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory proposes that the visual input is matched against structural representations of objects in the [[brain]]. These structural representations consist of geons and their relations (e.g., an [[ice cream cone]] could be broken down into a [[sphere]] located above a [[cone (geometry)|cone]]). Only a modest number of geons (&lt; 40) are assumed. When combined in different relations to each other (e.g., on-top-of, larger-than, end-to-end, end-to-middle) and coarse metric variation such as aspect ratio and 2D orientation, billions of possible 2- and 3-geon objects can be generated. Two classes of shape-based visual identification that are not done through geon representations, are those involved in: a) distinguishing between similar faces, and b) classifications that don’t have definite boundaries, such as that of  bushes or a crumpled garment.  Typically, such identifications are not viewpoint-invariant.

==Properties of geons==
[[File:Geons.png|thumb|150px|right|Two cases of two interrelated geons, What does the reader imagine in each case?]]
There are 4 essential properties of geons:
#View-invariance: Each geon can be distinguished from the others from almost any viewpoints except for “accidents” at highly restricted angles in which one geon projects an image that could be a different geon, as, for example, when an end-on view of a cylinder can be a sphere or circle. Objects represented as an arrangement of geons would, similarly, be viewpoint invariant.
#Stability or resistance to visual noise: Because the geons are simple, they are readily supported by the Gestalt property of smooth continuation, rendering their identification robust to partial occlusion and degradation by visual noise as, for example, when a cylinder might be viewed behind a bush.
#Invariance to illumination direction and surface markings and texture.
#High distinctiveness:  The geons differ qualitatively, with only two or three levels of an attributes, such as straight vs. curved, parallel vs. non parallel, positive vs. negative curvature. These qualitative differences can be readily distinguished thus rendering the geons readily distinguishable and the objects so composed, readily distinguishable.

==Derivation of invariant properties of geons==
'''Viewpoint invariance:'''  The viewpoint invariance of geons derives from their being distinguished by three nonaccidental properties (NAPs) of contours that do not change with orientation in depth:

#Whether the contour is straight or curved,
#The vertex that is formed when two or three contours coterminate (that is, end together at the same point), in the image, i.e., an L (2 contours), fork (3 contours with all angles &lt; 180°), or an arrow (3 contours, with one angle &gt; 180°), and
#Whether a pair of contours is parallel or not (with allowance for perspective).  When not parallel, the contours can be straight (converging or diverging) or curved, with positive or negative curvature forming a convex or concave, envelope, respectively (see Figure below).

[[File:Geon2.png|thumb|left]]

NAPs can be distinguished from metric properties (MPs), such as the degree of non-zero curvature of a contour or its length, which do vary with changes in orientation in depth.

===Invariance to lighting direction and surface characteristics===
Geons can be determined from the contours that mark the edges at orientation and depth discontinuities of an image of an object, i.e., the contours that specify a good line drawing of the object’s shape or volume. Orientation discontinuities define those edges where there is a sharp change in the orientation of the normal to the surface of a volume, as occurs at the contour at the boundaries of the different sides of a brick.  A depth discontinuity is where the observer’s line of sight jumps from the surface of an object to the background (i.e., is tangent to the surface), as occurs at the sides of a cylinder.  The same contour might mark both an orientation and depth discontinuity, as with the back edge of a brick. Because the geons are based on these discontinuities, they are invariant to variations in the direction of lighting, shadows, and surface texture and markings.

==Geons and generalized cones==
The geons constitute a partition of the set of generalized cones,&lt;ref&gt;Nevatia, R. (1982) Machine Perception.  Prentice-Hall.{{page needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the volumes created when a cross section is swept along an axis.  For example, a circle swept along a straight axis would define a cylinder (see Figure).  A rectangle swept along a straight axis would define a "brick" (see Figure).  Four dimensions with contrastive values (i.e., mutually exclusive values) define the current set of geons (see Figure):
# Shape of cross section: round vs. straight. For example, as stated above, a rectangle swept along a straight axis would define a "brick" and the cross section would be straight.
#Axis:  straight vs. curved.
#Size of cross-section as it is swept along an axis:  constant vs. expanding (or contracting) vs. expanding then contracting vs. contracting then expanding. The cross section size of a "brick" would be constant.
#Termination of geon with constant sized cross-sections:  truncated vs. converging to a point vs. rounded.

These variations in the generating of geons create shapes that differ in NAPs.

==Experimental tests of the viewpoint invariance of geons==
There is now considerable support for the major assumptions of geon theory (See [[Recognition-by-components theory]]). One issue that generated some discussion was the finding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0096-1523.19.6.1162 |url=http://geon.usc.edu/~biederman/publications/Biederman_Gerhardstein_1993.pdf |title=Recognizing depth-rotated objects: Evidence and conditions for three-dimensional viewpoint invariance |year=1993 |last1=Biederman |first1=Irving |last2=Gerhardstein |first2=Peter C. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=1162–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the geons were viewpoint invariant with little or no cost in the speed or accuracy of recognizing or matching a geon from an orientation in depth not previously experienced.  Some studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/1089 |year=1998 |last1=Tarr |first1=Michael J. |last2=Williams |first2=Pepper |last3=Hayward |first3=William G. |last4=Gauthier |first4=Isabel |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=275–7 |pmid=10195159 |title=Three-dimensional object recognition is viewpoint dependent}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported modest costs in matching geons at new orientations in depth but these studies had several methodological shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=2885–99 |doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(98)00309-5 |title=One-shot viewpoint invariance in matching novel objects |year=1999 |last1=Biederman |first1=I |journal=Vision Research |volume=39 |issue=17 |pmid=10492817 |last2=Bar |first2=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=707–24 |doi=10.1068/p2953 |title=Imperfect invariance to object translation in the discrimination of complex shapes |year=2001 |last1=Dill |first1=Marcus |last2=Edelman |first2=Shimon |journal=Perception |volume=30 |issue=6 |pmid=11464559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on geons==
There is much research out about geons and how they are interpreted. An important study happening now{{when?|date=May 2017}} is one that is looking at how the scrambling of geons impacts image recognition in pigeons. Kim Kirkpatrick-Steger, Edward A. Wasserman and Irving Biederman are conducting this research and have found that the individual geons along with their spatial composition are important in recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0097-7403.24.1.34 |title=Effects of Geon Deletion, Scrambling, and Movement on Picture Recognition in Pigeons |year=1998 |last1=Biederman |first1=Irving |last2=Kirkpatrik-Steger |first2=Kim |last3=Wasserman |first3=Edward |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=34–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the findings in this research seem to indicate that non-accidental sensitivity can be found in all shape discriminating species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0097-7403.24.1.34 |title=Effects of Geon Deletion, Scrambling, and Movement on Picture Recognition in Pigeons |year=1998 |last1=Biederman |first1=Irving |last2=Kirkpatrik-Steger |first2=Kim |last3=Wasserman |first3=Edward |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=34–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Honne''''' and '''''tatemae''''' are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words that describe the contrast between a person's {{Nihongo|true [[feeling]]s and desires|[[wikt:本音|本音]]|hon'ne|"true sound"}} and {{Nihongo|the behavior and opinions one displays in public|[[wikt:建前|建前]]|tatemae|"built in front", "façade"}}.
The public use of this dyadic concept began in the [[post-war]] era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Takeo Doi]],The anatomy of self,1985,page35&lt;/ref&gt;

''Honne'' may be contrary to what is expected by society or what is required according to one's position and circumstances, and they are often kept hidden, except with one's closest friends. ''Tatemae'' is what is expected by society and required according to one's position and circumstances, and these may or may not match one's ''honne''.

In many cases ''tatemae'' leads to outright telling of lies in order to avoid exposing the true inward feelings.

The ''honne–tatemae'' divide is considered by some to be of paramount importance in [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Takeo | last = Doi | authorlink = Takeo Doi | title = The Anatomy of Dependence: Exploring an area of the Japanese psyche: feelings of indulgence | publisher = Kodansha International | year = 1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Honne'' and ''tatemae'' are similar to the Persian concepts of ''zaher'' (ظاهر) and ''batin'' (باطن). The self in Iranian culture is thought of as having two separate and distinct levels: an inner private core self (batin), and a social self or the "proper public face" (zaher).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Shabnam | last = Ziabakhsh | title = The Relationship Between the "Iranian Self" and the Acculturative Patterns of Iranian Immigrant Women | publisher = Simon Fraser University | year = 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Some analysts{{who | date=May 2012}} see ''honne'' and ''tatemae'' as a cultural necessity resulting from a [[Population density|large number of people living in a comparatively small]] island nation. Close-knit co-operation and the avoidance of [[Group conflict|conflict]] are considered to be of vital importance in everyday life.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The vulnerability of the Japanese to failures and slurs ,which make them feel shame,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page153&lt;/ref&gt; inferiority,&lt;ref&gt;[[Takeo Doi]],The anatomy of dependence,1971,page53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]],War without Mercy,1986,page122,127,133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]],Embracing Defeat,1999,page284&lt;/ref&gt; makes them to feel competitions so keenly to avoid them except necessary ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page153,154,164&lt;/ref&gt; A Japanese worthy of being called sincere never verges on the danger of insulting a person he does not mean to provoke to aggression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page218&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Japanese tend to go to great lengths to avoid conflict, especially within the context of large groups.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The conflict between ''honne'' and ''[[Giri (Japanese)|giri]]'' (social obligations) is one of the main topics of Japanese drama throughout the ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page205-207,315(...conceal his emotions,to give up his desires,..)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the protagonist would have to choose between carrying out his obligations to his family/[[feudal lord]] or pursuing a clandestine love affair.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The same concept in Chinese culture is called inside face and outside face, and they also frequently come into conflict.

==Effect==
Contemporary phenomena such as ''[[hikikomori]]'' and [[parasite single]]s are seen as examples of late Japanese culture's growing problem of the new generation growing up unable to deal with the complexities of ''honne–tatemae''{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and pressure of an increasingly consumerist society.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Debate over whether ''tatemae'' and ''honne'' are a uniquely Japanese phenomenon continues in Japan,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} especially among those Japanese who feel their culture is unique in having the concepts of "private mind" and "public mind". Although there might not be direct single word translations for ''honne'' and ''tatemae'' in some languages,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} they do have two-word descriptions; for example in English "private mind" and "public mind".

Some researchers{{who|date=August 2015}} suggest that the need for explicit words for ''tatemae'' and ''honne'' in Japanese culture is evidence that the concept is relatively new to Japan, whereas the unspoken understanding in many other cultures indicates a deeper internalization of the concepts. In any case, all cultures have conventions that help to determine appropriate communication and behavior in various social contexts which are implicitly understood without an explicit name for the social mores on which the conventions are based.

A similar discord of Japanese true own feeling and the pretension before public is observed in ''yase-gaman'',&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]],War without Mercy,1986,page230&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase means even starving to skeleton,being content or pretending to be so.Nowadays,the phrase is used for two different meanings, expressing archaic samurai virtue of self-discipline,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]],The Chrysanthemum and the Sword,1946,page218(man who is free of passion),228,63(frugality)&lt;/ref&gt; silent moral heroism,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lafcadio Hearn]],Japan:An Attempt at Interpretation,1904,Dodo Press,page226,246,250,252&lt;/ref&gt; or ridiculing stubbornness, face-savingness.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]],Embracing Defeat,1999,page284&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ineffability''' is concerned with [[idea]]s that cannot or should not be expressed in spoken words (or language in general), often being in the form of a [[taboo]] or incomprehensible term. This property is commonly associated with [[philosophy]], [[ontology|aspects of existence]], and similar concepts that are inherently "too great", complex or abstract to be communicated adequately. A typical example is the name of [[God in Judaism]], written as [[YHWH]] but substituted with "the Lord" or "[[HaShem]]" (the name) when reading.

In addition, [[logic|illogical]] statements, principles, reasons and arguments may be considered intrinsically ineffable along with [[Logical possibility|impossibilities]], contradictions and paradoxes. Terminology describing the nature of [[experience]] cannot be conveyed properly in dualistic [[symbol]]ic language; it is believed that this knowledge is only held by the individual from which it originates. [[Profanity]] and [[vulgarism]]s can easily and clearly be stated, but by those who believe they should not be said, they are considered ineffable. Thus, one method of describing something that is ineffable is by using [[apophasis]], i.e. describing what it is ''not'', rather than what it ''is''. The architect Le Corbusier described his design for the interior of the Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut at Ronchamp as ''L'espace indicible'' translated to mean 'ineffable space', a spiritual experience which was difficult to describe.

'''Information sensitivity''' is the control of access to [[information]] or [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge]] that might result in loss of an advantage or level of security if disclosed to others.

Loss, misuse, modification, or [[Access control|unauthorized access]] to sensitive information can adversely affect the [[privacy]] or [[welfare]] of an individual, [[trade secret]]s of a business or even the [[national security|security]] and international relations of a nation depending on the level of sensitivity and nature of the information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-032/_4768.htm "Sensitive Information"] (definition) Aug. 23, 1996. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-sensitive information==

===Public information===

This refers to information that is already a matter of public record or knowledge. With regard to government and private organizations, access to or release of such information may be requested by any member of the public, and there are often formal processes laid out for how to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/access-to-information/accessing-public-information/ "Accessing Public Information" Information and Privacy Commissioner, Ontario, Canada. Retrieved Feb. 11 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The accessibility of government-held public records is an important part of government transparency, accountability to its citizens, and the values of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracyweb.org/accountability/principles.php "Accountability and Transparency: Essential Principles" Democracy Web. Retrieved Feb. 11, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public records]] may furthermore refer to information about identifiable individuals that is not considered confidential, including but not limited to: [[census]] records, [[criminal records]], [[sex offender registry]] files, and [[voter registration]].

===Routine business information===

This includes business information that is not subjected to special protection and may be routinely shared with anyone inside or outside of the business.

==Types of sensitive information==
''Confidential information'' is used in a general sense to mean sensitive information whose access is subject to restriction, and may refer to information about an individual as well as that which pertains to a business.

However, there are situations in which the release of personal information could have a negative effect on its owner. For example, a person trying to avoid a stalker will be inclined to further restrict access to such personal information. Furthermore, a person's [[Social Security number|SSN]] or [[Social Insurance Number|SIN]], credit card numbers, and other financial information may be considered private if their disclosure might lead to [[crime]]s such as [[identity theft]] or [[fraud]].

Some types of private information, including records of a person's [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|health care]], education, and employment may be protected by [[privacy law]]s. Unauthorized disclosure of private information can make the perpetrator liable for civil remedies and may in some cases be subject to criminal penalties.

Even though they are often used interchangeably, personal information is sometimes distinguished from private information, or [[personally identifiable information]]. The latter is distinct from the former in that private information can be used to identify a unique individual. Personal information, on the other hand, is information belonging to the private life of an individual that cannot be used to uniquely identify that individual. This can range from an individual’s favourite colour, to the details of their domestic life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/lesson/private-and-personal-information-3-5 "Private and Personal Information"] Common Sense Media Inc., 2013. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a common example of personal information that is also regarded as sensitive, where the individual sharing these details with a trusted listener would prefer for it not to be shared with anyone else, and the sharing of which may result in unwanted consequences.

===Confidential business information===

Confidential business information refers to information whose disclosure may harm the business. Such information may include [[trade secret]]s, sales and marketing plans, new product plans, notes associated with patentable inventions, customer and supplier information, financial data, and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsdd.com/articles/confidential-information-and-trade-secrets/ "Confidential information and trade secrets"] MaRS, Dec. 8 2009. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classified===
[[Classified information]] generally refers to information that is subject to special security classification regulations imposed by many national governments, the disclosure of which may cause harm to national interests and security. The protocol of restriction imposed upon such information is categorized into a hierarchy of classification levels in almost every national government worldwide, with the most restricted levels containing information that may cause the greatest danger to national security if leaked. Authorized access is granted to individuals on a [[need to know]] basis who have also passed the appropriate level of [[security clearance]]. Classified information can be reclassified to a different level or declassified (made available to the public) depending on changes of situation or new intelligence.

Classified information may also be further denoted with the method of communication or access. For example, Protectively Marked "Secret" Eyes Only or Protectively Marked "Secret" Encrypted transfer only. Indicating that the document must be physically read by the recipient and cannot be openly discussed for example over a telephone conversation or that the communication can be sent only using encrypted means. Often mistakenly listed as meaning for the eyes of the intended recipient only &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/eyes-only&lt;/ref&gt; the anomaly becomes apparent when the additional tag "Not within windowed area" is also used.

==Legal protection from unauthorised disclosure==

===Personal and private information===

Data privacy concerns exist in various aspects of daily life wherever personal data is stored and collected, such as on the [[Internet privacy|internet]], in [[Medical privacy|medical records]], [[Financial privacy|financial records]], and [[Political privacy|expression of political opinions]]. In over 80 countries in the world, personally identifiable information is protected by [[information privacy law]]s, which outline limits to the collection and use of personally identifiable information by public and private entities. Such laws usually require entities to give clear and unambiguous notice to the individual of the types of data being collected, its reason for collection, and planned uses of the data. In consent-based legal frameworks, explicit consent of the individual is required as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc300h/winter/13/lectures/week2-privacy.pdf "Basic Privacy"] (lecture). University of Toronto, Jan. 24, 2012. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the [[Data Protection Directive]] provides a rigorous standard for privacy protection legislation across all member states. Although the Directive is not legally binding in itself, all member states are expected to enact their own national privacy legislation within three years of the Directive’s adoption that conforms to all of its standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:NOT "Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data"] European Parliament, Council. Nov. 23 1995. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since adoption, the Directive has demonstrated significant influence on the privacy legislation of non-EU nations, through its requirements on the privacy laws of non-member nations engaging in transborder flows of private data with EU member nations.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, J. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p172821_index.html "The Influence of the European Commission Data Privacy Protection Directive on 'Third Countries'"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA, May 24, 2007. Retrieved Feb. 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has passed the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), which will replace the Directive. The regulation was adopted on 27 April 2016. It becomes enforceable from 25 May 2018 after a two-year transition period and, unlike a directive, it does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation, and is thus directly binding and applicable.&lt;ref name="BlackmerGDPR16"&gt;

"The proposed new EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides for a harmonisation of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for non-European companies to comply with these regulations; however, this comes at the cost of a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 4% of worldwide turnover."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/oExZ4PVtEeefHEPs4cEz6w/www.mlawgroup.de/news/publications/detail.php|title=New draft European data protection regime|last=|first=|date=February 2, 2012|website=[[Law Patent Group]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GDPR also brings a new set of "digital rights" for EU citizens in an age when the economic value of personal data is increasing in the digital economy.
In Canada, the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] (PIPEDA) regulates the collection and use of personal data and electronic documents by public and private organizations. PIPEDA is in effect in all federal and provincial jurisdictions, except provinces where existing privacy laws are determined to be “substantially similar”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2002/2002-08-03/html/notice-avis-eng.html#i10 "DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY: PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT"] Canada Gazette, Apr. 03 2002.

Even though not through the unified sensitive information framework, the United States has implemented significant amount of privacy legislation pertaining to different specific aspects of data privacy, with emphasis to privacy in healthcare, financial, e-commerce, educational industries, and both on federal and state levels. Whether being regulated or self regulated, the laws require to establish ways at which access to sensitive information is limited to the people with different roles, thus in essence requiring establishment of the "sensitive data domain" model &lt;ref&gt;[http://mask-me.net/datamaskingwiki/wiki/35/sensitive-data-discovery "Sensitive Data Discovery"]&lt;/ref&gt; and mechanisms of its protection. Some of the domains have a guideline in form of pre-defined models such as "Safe Harbor" of HIPAA,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#standard&lt;/ref&gt; based on the research of [[Latanya Sweeny]] and established privacy industry metrics.

Additionally, many other countries have enacted their own legislature regarding data privacy protection, and more are still in the process of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationshield.com/intprivacylaws.html "International Privacy Laws "] InformationShield.

===Confidential business information===
The [[confidentiality]] of sensitive business information is established through [[non-disclosure agreements]], a legally binding contract between two parties in a professional relationship. NDAs may be one-way, such as in the case of an employee receiving confidential information about the employing organization, or two-way between businesses needing to share information with one another to accomplish a business goal. Depending on the severity of consequences, a violation of non-disclosure may result in employment loss, loss of business and client contacts, criminal charges or a civil lawsuit, and a hefty sum in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Niznik, J. S. [http://jobsearchtech.about.com/library/weekly/aa-nondisclosure-4.htm "Non-Disclosure Agreement"] About.com, 2002. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When NDAs are signed between employer and employee at the initiation of employment, a [[non-compete clause]] may be a part of the agreement as an added protection of sensitive business information, where the employee agrees not to work for competitors or start their own competing business within a certain time or geographical limit.

Unlike personal and private information, there is no internationally recognized framework protecting [[trade secrets]], or even an agreed-upon definition of the term “trade secret”.&lt;ref&gt;Magri, K. A. [http://www.myersbigel.com/library/articles/InternationalAspectsofTradeSecret.pdf "International Aspects of Trade Secrets Law"] 1997. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many countries and political jurisdictions have taken the initiative to account for the violation of commercial confidentiality in their criminal or civil laws. For example, under the US [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]], it is a federal crime in the United States to misappropriate trade secrets with the knowledge that it will benefit a foreign power, or will injure the owner of the trade secret.&lt;ref&gt;104th US Congress.

[[Espionage]], or spying, involves obtaining sensitive information without the permission or knowledge of its holder. The use of spies is a part of national intelligence gathering in most countries, and has been used as a political strategy by nation-states since ancient times. It is unspoken knowledge in international politics that countries are spying on one another all the time, even their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Woolsey, R. J.

==Digital sensitive information==

[[Computer security]] is information security applied to computing and network technology, and is a significant and ever-growing field in computer science. The term [[computer insecurity]], on the other hand, is the concept that computer systems are inherently vulnerable to attack, and therefore an evolving arms race between those who exploit existing vulnerabilities in security systems and those who must then engineer new mechanisms of security.

A number of security concerns have arisen in the recent years as increasing amounts of sensitive information at every level have found their primary existence in digital form. At the personal level, [[credit card fraud]], [[internet fraud]], and other forms of [[identity theft]] have become widespread concerns that individuals need to be aware of on a day-to-day basis. 
The existence of large databases of classified information on computer networks is also changing the face of domestic and international politics. [[Cyber-warfare]] and [[cyber espionage]] is becoming of increasing importance to the national security and strategy of nations around the world, and it is estimated that 120 nations around the world are currently actively engaged in developing and deploying technology for these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Brodkin, J. [http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/112907-government-cyberattacks.html "Government-sponsored cyberattacks on the rise, McAfee says"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617091822/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/112907-government-cyberattacks.html |date=2013-06-17}} Networked World: Nov. 29 2007.

Philosophies and internet cultures such as [[open-source governance]], [[hacktivism]], and the popular hacktivist slogan "[[information wants to be free]]" reflects some of the cultural shifts in perception towards political and government secrecy. The popular, controversial [[WikiLeaks]] is just one of many manifestations of a growing cultural sentiment that is becoming an additional challenge to the security and integrity of classified information.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[category theory]] - internal categories are a generalisation of the notion of [[small category]], and are defined with respect to a fixed [[ambient category]]. If the ambient category is taken to be the [[category of sets]] then one recovers the theory of small categories. In general, internal categories consist of a pair of objects in the ambient category - thought of as the 'object of objects' and 'object of morphisms', together with a collection of morphisms in the ambient category satisfying certain identities. [[Group object]]s, are common examples of internal categories.

There are notions of internal functors and natural transformations which make the collection of internal categories in a fixed category into a [[2-category]].

==Definitions==

Let &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; be a category with [[Pullback (category theory)|pullback]]s. An internal category in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; consists of the following data: two &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-objects &lt;math&gt;C_0,C_1&lt;/math&gt; named "object of objects" and "object of morphisms" respectively and four &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-arrows &lt;math&gt;d_0,d_1:C_1\rightarrow C_0, e:C_0\rightarrow C_1,m:C_1\times_{C_0}C_1\rightarrow C_1&lt;/math&gt; subject to coherence conditions expressing the axioms of category theory.

'''Internet censorship''' is the [[censorship|control or suppression]] of what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the [[Internet]] enacted by regulators, or on their own initiative. Individuals and organizations may engage in [[self-censorship]] for moral, religious, or business reasons, to conform to societal norms, due to intimidation, or out of fear of legal or other consequences.&lt;ref name="NYT-20181015"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=There May Soon Be Three Internets.

The extent of Internet censorship varies on a country-to-country basis. While most democratic countries have moderate Internet censorship, other countries go as far as to limit the access of information such as news and suppress discussion among citizens.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt; Internet censorship also occurs in response to or in anticipation of events such as elections, protests, and riots. An example is the increased censorship due to the events of the [[Arab Spring]]. Other areas of censorship include copyrights, defamation, harassment, and obscene material.

Support for and opposition to Internet censorship also varies. In a [[#Internet Society's Global Internet User Survey|2012 Internet Society survey]] 71% of respondents agreed that "censorship should exist in some form on the Internet". In the same survey 83% agreed that "access to the Internet should be considered a basic human right" and 86% agreed that "[[freedom of expression]] should be guaranteed on the Internet". Perception of internet censorship in the US is largely based on the First Amendment and the right for expansive free speech and access to content without regard to the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Erica|date=|title=FREE SPEECH CONSEQUENTIALISM|url=www.jstor.org/stable/43783393|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=116|pages=687-694|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[GlobalWebIndex]], over 400 million people use [[virtual private network]]s to circumvent censorship or for increased user privacy.&lt;ref name="Guardian 5 December 2014"/&gt;

==Overview==
Many of the challenges associated with Internet censorship are similar to those for offline censorship of more traditional media such as newspapers, magazines, books, music, radio, television, and film. One difference is that national borders are more permeable online: residents of a country that bans certain information can find it on websites hosted outside the country. Thus censors must work to prevent access to information even though they lack physical or legal control over the websites themselves. This in turn requires the use of technical censorship methods that are unique to the Internet, such as site blocking and content filtering.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

Views about the feasibility and effectiveness of Internet censorship have evolved in parallel with the development of the Internet and censorship technologies:
* A 1993 ''Time Magazine'' article quotes computer scientist [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], one of the founders of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], as saying "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/internet-article.html "First Nation in Cyberspace"], Philip Elmer-Dewitt, ''Time'', 6 December 1993, No.49&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2007, "Father of the Internet" [[Vint Cerf]] stated that he sees government control of the Internet failing because the Web is almost entirely privately owned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN1420689320071114?sp=true "Cerf sees government control of Internet failing"], Pedro Fonseca, Reuters, 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* A report of research conducted in 2007 and published in 2009 by the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at Harvard University stated that: "We are confident that the [ [[censorship circumvention]] ] tool developers will for the most part keep ahead of the governments' blocking efforts", but also that "...we believe that less than two percent of all filtered Internet users use circumvention tools".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/2007_Circumvention_Landscape.pdf ''2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools''], Hal Roberts, Ethan Zuckerman, and John Palfrey, Beckman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast, a 2011 report by researchers at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] published by [[UNESCO]] concludes "... the control of information on the Internet and Web is certainly feasible, and technological advances do not therefore guarantee greater freedom of speech."&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;
* Dr Shashi Tharoor in quarterly lecture series programme organized by a think tank based in India, Centre for Public Policy Research stated that "avenues of expressing our views and opinions having amplified multifold via digital media, freedom of expression comes immense responsibility"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2012/sep/15/tharoor-calls-for-caution-in-freedom-of-expression-406318.html|title=Tharoor calls for caution in freedom of expression|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Internet blocked in Iran.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Error message used to block content deemed harmful by government in Iran.]]

Blocking and filtering can be based on relatively static [[blacklist]]s or be determined more dynamically based on a real-time examination of the information being exchanged. Blacklists may be produced manually or automatically and are often not available to non-customers of the blocking software. Blocking or filtering can be done at a centralized national level, at a decentralized sub-national level, or at an institutional level, for example in libraries, universities or [[Internet cafes]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt; Blocking and filtering may also vary within a country across different ISPs.&lt;ref name=Chadwick-2009&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed. Chadwick| first = Andrew| title = Routledge handbook of Internet politics| publisher = Taylor and Francis| series = Routledge international handbooks| year = 2009| pages = 332 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Routledge_handbook_of_Internet_politics.html?id=GJdfuGSa1xUC| isbn = 978-0-415-42914-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries may filter sensitive content on an ongoing basis and/or introduce temporary filtering during key time periods such as elections. In some cases the censoring authorities may surreptitiously block content to mislead the public into believing that censorship has not been applied. This is achieved by returning a fake [[404 error|"Not Found"]] error message when an attempt is made to access a blocked website.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Unless the censor has total control over all Internet-connected computers, such as in [[Internet censorship in North Korea|North Korea]] (who employ an [[intranet]] that only privileged citizens can access), or [[Internet censorship in cuba|Cuba]], total censorship of information is very difficult or impossible to achieve due to the underlying distributed technology of the Internet. [[Pseudonymity]] and [[data haven]]s (such as [[Freenet]]) protect [[free speech]] using technologies that guarantee material cannot be removed and prevents the identification of authors. Technologically savvy users can often find ways to access blocked content. Nevertheless, blocking remains an effective means of limiting access to sensitive information for most users when censors, such as those in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], are able to devote significant resources to building and maintaining a comprehensive censorship system.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

The term "[[splinternet]]" is sometimes used to describe the effects of national [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]. The verb "[[River crab (Internet slang)|rivercrab]]" colloquially refers to censorship of the Internet, particularly in Asia.&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lao Wai|title=I've Been Rivercrabbed!|work=An American In Beijing|date=21 October 2007|url=http://americaninbeijing.blogspot.com/2007/10/ive-been-rivercrabbed.html|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content suppression methods ==

===Technical censorship===

As per Hoffmann, different methods are used to block certain websites or pages including [[DNS poisoning]], blocking access to [[IP address|IP]]s, analyzing and [[URL|filtering URLs]], inspecting filter packets and resetting connections.&lt;ref name="howto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoffman |first1=Chris |title=How the “Great Firewall of China” Works to Censor China’s Internet |url=https://www.howtogeek.com/162092/htg-explains-how-the-great-firewall-of-china-works/ |website=https://www.howtogeek.com |publisher=How to geek |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Approaches====
Internet content is subject to technical censorship methods, including:&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/freedom-of-connection-freedom-of-expression-the-changing-legal-and-regulatory-ecology-shaping-the-internet/ ''Freedom of connection, freedom of expression: the changing legal and regulatory ecology shaping the Internet''], Dutton,  March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Internet Protocol (IP) address blocking''': Access to a certain [[IP address]] is denied. If the target Web site is hosted in a [[Shared web hosting service|shared hosting server]], all websites on the same server will be blocked. This affects IP-based protocols such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Post Office Protocol|POP]]. A typical circumvention method is to find [[Proxy server|proxies]] that have access to the target websites, but proxies may be jammed or blocked, and some Web sites, such as Wikipedia (when editing), also block proxies. Some large websites such as [[Google]] have allocated additional IP addresses to circumvent the block, but later the block was extended to cover the new addresses. Due to challenges with [[geolocation]], [[geo-blocking]] is normally implemented via IP address blocking.
*'''Domain name system (DNS) filtering and redirection''': Blocked [[domain name]]s are not resolved, or an incorrect IP address is returned via [[DNS hijacking]] or other means. This affects all IP-based protocols such as HTTP, FTP and POP. A typical circumvention method is to find an alternative [[DNS resolver]] that resolves domain names correctly, but domain name servers are subject to blockage as well, especially IP address blocking. Another workaround is to bypass DNS if the IP address is obtainable from other sources and is not itself blocked. Examples are modifying the [[Hosts file]] or typing the IP address instead of the domain name as part of a URL given to a [[Web browser]].
*'''Uniform Resource Locator (URL) filtering''': [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] strings are scanned for target keywords regardless of the domain name specified in the URL. This affects the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] protocol. Typical circumvention methods are to use [[percent-encoding|escaped characters]] in the URL, or to use encrypted protocols such as [[Virtual private network|VPN]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS/SSL]].&lt;ref&gt;For an example, see [[Wikipedia:Advice to users using Tor to bypass the Great Firewall]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Packet filtering''': Terminate [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] transmissions when a certain number of controversial keywords are detected. This affects all TCP-based protocols such as HTTP, FTP and POP, but [[Search engine results page]]s are more likely to be censored. Typical circumvention methods are to use encrypted connections – such as VPN and TLS/SSL – to escape the HTML content, or by reducing the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] [[Protocol stack|stack]]'s [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]]/[[Maximum segment size|MSS]] to reduce the amount of text contained in a given packet.
*'''Connection reset''': If a previous [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection is blocked by the filter, future connection attempts from both sides can also be blocked for some variable amount of time. Depending on the location of the block, other users or websites may also be blocked, if the communication is [[Routing|routed]] through the blocking location.

*'''Network disconnection''': A technically simpler method of Internet censorship is to completely cut off all routers, either by software or by hardware (turning off machines, pulling out cables). This appears to have been the case on 27/28 January 2011 during the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], in what has been widely described as an "unprecedented" internet block.&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowie |first=James |title=Egypt Leaves the Internet |publisher=Renesys |url=http://research.dyn.com/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet/ |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga?url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IDGnews_Egyptfullblock"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeremy |last=Kirk |title=With Wired Internet Locked, Egypt Looks to the Sky |date=28 January 2011 |publisher=IDG News/[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/218064/with_wired_internet_locked_egypt_looks_to_the_sky.html |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w518Yu9B?url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/218064/with_wired_internet_locked_egypt_looks_to_the_sky.html |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 3500 [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP) routes to Egyptian networks were shut down from about 22:10 to 22:35 UTC 27 January.&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock" /&gt; This full block was implemented without cutting off major intercontinental [[fibre optics|fibre-optic]] links, with Renesys stating on 27 January, "Critical European-Asian fiber-optic routes through Egypt appear to be unaffected for now."&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock" /&gt; Full blocks also occurred in [[Internet censorship in Myanmar|Myanmar/Burma]] in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opennet.net/research/bulletins/013|title=Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma|work=opennet.net|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Free speech in the media during the 2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]] in 2011,&lt;ref name=Libya-RWB-2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalists confined to their hotels, Internet disconnected|url=http://en.rsf.org/journalists-confined-to-their-04-03-2011,39681.html|work=Journalists confined to their hotels, Internet disconnected|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Internet censorship in Syria|Syria]] during the [[Syrian civil war]].

*'''Portal censorship''' and '''search result removal''': Major portals, including [[search engine]]s, may exclude web sites that they would ordinarily include. This renders a site invisible to people who do not know where to find it. When a major portal does this, it has a similar effect as censorship. Sometimes this exclusion is done to satisfy a legal or other requirement, other times it is purely at the discretion of the portal. For example, [https://www.google.com/ Google.de] and [https://www.google.com/ Google.fr] remove [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] and other listings in compliance with German and French law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/google-excluding-controversial-sites/ Google excluding controversial sites], Declan McCullagh, CNET News, 23 October 2002, 8:55&amp;nbsp;pm PDT.

*'''Computer network attacks''': [[Denial-of-service attack]]s and attacks that deface opposition websites can produce the same result as other blocking techniques, preventing or limiting access to certain websites or other online services, although only for a limited period of time. This technique might be used during the lead up to an election or some other sensitive period. It is more frequently used by non-state actors seeking to disrupt services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/emergence-open-and-organized-pro-government-cyber-attacks-middle-east-case-syrian-electronic-army "The Emergence of Open and Organized Pro-Government Cyber Attacks in the Middle East: The Case of the Syrian Electronic Army"], Helmi Noman, OpenNet Initiative, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Over- and under-blocking====
Technical censorship techniques are subject to both over- and under-blocking since it is often impossible to always block exactly the targeted content without blocking other permissible material or allowing some access to targeted material and so providing more or less protection than desired.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt; An example is blocking an IP-address of a server that hosts multiple websites, which prevents access to all of the websites rather than just those that contain content deemed offensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/24/india_blocks_yahoo_groups/ "India blocks Yahoo!

Writing in 2009 [[Ronald Deibert]], professor of political science at the [[University of Toronto]] and co-founder and one of the principal investigators of the [[OpenNet Initiative]], and, writing in 2011, Evgeny Morzov, a visiting scholar at [[Stanford University]] and an Op-Ed contributor to the ''[[New York Times]]'', explain that companies in the United States, Finland, France, Germany, Britain, Canada, and South Africa are in part responsible for the increasing sophistication of online content filtering worldwide. While the off-the-shelf [[filtering software]] sold by Internet security companies are primarily marketed to businesses and individuals seeking to protect themselves and their employees and families, they are also used by governments to block what they consider sensitive content.&lt;ref name=Chadwick2009-1&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed.

Among the most popular filtering software programs is [[SmartFilter]] by [[Secure Computing]] in California, which was bought by [[McAfee]] in 2008.

On 12 March 2013 in a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance'', Reporters Without Borders named five "Corporate Enemies of the Internet": [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), [[FinFisher|Gamma]] (UK and Germany), [[Hacking Team]] (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany).

In a U.S. lawsuit filed in May 2011, [[Cisco Systems]] is accused of helping the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese Government]] build a firewall, known widely as the [[Golden Shield]], to censor the Internet and keep tabs on dissidents. Cisco said it had made nothing special for China. Cisco is also accused of aiding the Chinese government in monitoring and apprehending members of the banned [[Falun Gong]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/technology/group-says-it-has-new-evidence-of-ciscos-misdeeds-in-china.html "Group Says It Has New Evidence of Cisco’s Misdeeds in China"], Somini Sengupta, ''New York Times'', 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Many filtering programs allow blocking to be configured based on dozens of categories and sub-categories such as these from Websense: "abortion" (pro-life, pro-choice), "adult material" (adult content, lingerie and swimsuit, nudity, sex, sex education), "advocacy groups" (sites that promote change or reform in public policy, public opinion, social practice, economic activities, and relationships), "drugs" (abused drugs, marijuana, prescribed medications, supplements and unregulated compounds), "religion" (non-traditional religions occult and folklore, traditional religions), ....&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt; The blocking categories used by the filtering programs may contain errors leading to the unintended blocking of websites.&lt;ref name=Chadwick2009-1/&gt; The blocking of [[DailyMotion]] in early 2007 by Tunisian authorities was, according to the [[OpenNet Initiative]], due to Secure Computing wrongly categorizing DailyMotion as pornography for its SmartFilter filtering software. It was initially thought that Tunisia had blocked DailyMotion due to satirical videos about human rights violations in Tunisia, but after Secure Computing corrected the mistake access to DailyMotion was gradually restored in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed.

Organizations such as the [[Global Network Initiative]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Amnesty International]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] have successfully lobbied some vendors such as [[Websense]] to make changes to their software, to refrain from doing business with repressive governments, and to educate schools who have inadvertently reconfigured their filtering software too strictly.&lt;ref name="riaclu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.riaclu.org/20050418.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205070114/http://www.riaclu.org/20050418.html | title = R.I.

Vendors often consider information about what sites and content is blocked valuable intellectual property that is not made available outside the company, sometimes not even to the organizations purchasing the filters. Thus by relying upon out-of-the-box filtering systems, the detailed task of deciding what is or is not acceptable speech may be outsourced to the commercial vendors.&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt;

==Circumvention==
{{Main|Internet censorship circumvention}}

Internet censorship circumvention is the processes used by technologically savvy Internet users to bypass the technical aspects of Internet filtering and gain access to the otherwise censored material. Circumvention is an inherent problem for those wishing to censor the Internet because filtering and blocking do not remove content from the Internet, but instead block access to it.  Therefore, as long as there is at least one publicly accessible uncensored system, it will often be possible to gain access to the otherwise censored material. However circumvention may not be possible by non-tech-savvy users, so blocking and filtering remain effective means of censoring the Internet access of large numbers of users.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

Different techniques and resources are used to bypass Internet censorship, including [[Proxy server|proxy websites]], [[virtual private network]]s, [[sneakernet]]s, and circumvention software tools. Solutions have differing ease of use, speed, security, and risks. Most, however, rely on gaining access to an Internet connection that is not subject to filtering, often in a different jurisdiction not subject to the same censorship laws. According to [[GlobalWebIndex]], over 400 million people use virtual private networks to circumvent censorship or for an increased level of privacy.&lt;ref name="Guardian 5 December 2014"/&gt; The majority of circumvention techniques are not suitable for day to day use.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, H., Zuckerman, E., &amp; Palfrey, J. (2009, March). 2007 Circumvention Landscape Report: Methods, Uses, and Tools (Rep.). Retrieved March 18, 2016, from The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are risks to using circumvention software or other methods to bypass Internet censorship. In some countries, individuals that gain access to otherwise restricted content may be violating the law and if caught can be expelled, fired, jailed, or subject to other punishments and loss of access.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140311" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.cship.org/wiki/Risks "Risks"], ''Internet censorship wiki''. Retrieved 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 the ''New York Times'' reported that the U.S. is engaged in a "global effort to deploy 'shadow' Internet and mobile phone systems that dissidents can use to undermine repressive governments that seek to silence them by censoring or shutting down telecommunications networks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/world/12internet.html?pagewanted=all "U.S. Underwrites Internet Detour Around Censors"], James Glanz and John Markoff, ''New York Times'', 12 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to circumvent Internet censorship is to physically go to an area where the Internet is not censored. In 2017 a so-called "Internet refugee camp" was established by IT workers in the village of Bonako, just outside an area of Cameroon where the Internet is regularly blocked.&lt;ref&gt;https://qz.com/942879/an-internet-shutdown-in-cameroon-has-forced-startups-to-create-an-internet-refugee-camp-in-bonako-village/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/cameroon-internet-shutdowns-cost-anglophones-millions-180123202824701.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common targets==
There are several motives or rationales for Internet filtering: politics and power, social norms and morals, and security concerns. Protecting existing economic interests is an additional emergent motive for Internet filtering. In addition, networking tools and applications that allow the sharing of information related to these motives are themselves subjected to filtering and blocking. And while there is considerable variation from country to country, the blocking of web sites in a local language is roughly twice that of web sites available only in English or other international languages.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008&gt;[http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/Deibert_02_Ch01_005-028.pdf "Measuring Global Internet Filtering"], Robert Faris and Nart Villeneuve, in [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 ''Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226100258/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 |date=26 February 2009 }}, Ronald Deibert, John Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski, and Jonathan Zittrain, eds., MIT Press (Cambridge), 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and power===
Censorship directed at political opposition to the ruling government is common in authoritarian and repressive regimes. Some countries block web sites related to religion and minority groups, often when these movements represent a threat to the ruling regimes.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* Political blogs and web sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/Blog-censorship-gains-support/2100-1028_3-5670096.html |title=Blog censorship gains support |work=CNET |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Lèse majesté]]'' sites, sites with content that offends the dignity of or challenges the authority of a reigning [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or of a [[Sovereign state|state]]
* [[Falun Gong]] and [[Tibetan exile]] group sites in [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]] or [[Buddhist]], [[Cao Dai]] faith, and indigenous [[Hill tribes#South-East Asia|hill tribes]] sites in [[Internet censorship in Vietnam|Vietnam]]
* Sites aimed at religious conversion from Islam to Christianity&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;
* Sites criticizing the government or an authority in the country&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that comment on political parties that oppose the current government of a country&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that accuse authorities of corruption&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that comment on minorities or [[LGBT]] issues&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;

===Social norms===
Social filtering is censorship of topics that are held to be antithetical to accepted societal norms.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt; In particular censorship of [[child pornography]] and to [[think of the children|protect children]] enjoys very widespread public support and such content is subject to censorship and other restrictions in most countries.

Examples include:
* Sites that include [[hate speech]] inciting [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], or other forms of bigotry
* Sites seen as promoting [[Substance abuse|illegal drug use]] ([[Erowid]]){{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* [[Eroticism|Sex and erotic]], [[fetishism]], prostitution, and [[Anti-pornography movement|pornographic]] sites
* [[Child pornography]] and [[pedophile]] related sites (see also [[CIRCAMP]])
* Gambling sites
* Sites encouraging or inciting violence&lt;ref name=time20151123&gt;{{cite magazine |title=WHAT IT TAKES TO FORGIVE A KILLER |magazine=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2015-11-23 |url=http://backissues.time.com/storefront/2015/what-it-takes-to-forgive-a-killer/prodTD20151123.html |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sites promoting criminal activity&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* [[Communist]] symbols and imagery in [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Latvia]], [[Moldova]], and [[Hungary]]
* [[Nazism|Nazi]] and similar websites, particularly in [[Internet censorship in France|France]] and [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22885402-12335,00.html |title=Latest Stories From News.Com.Au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sites that contain [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] content, particularly when directed at a majority or state supported religion&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that contain [[Defamation|defamatory, slanderous, or libelous]] content&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that include [[political satire]]&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;
* Sites that contain information on social issues or "online protests, petitions and campaigns"&lt;ref name=time20151123/&gt;

===Security concerns===
Many organizations implement filtering as part of a [[defense in depth (computing)|defense in depth]] strategy to protect their environments from [[malware]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/id=747218 |publisher=[[Gartner]] |title=Why Malware Filtering Is Necessary in the Web Gateway |date=26 August 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to protect their reputations in the event of their networks being used, for example, to carry out sexual harassment.

Internet filtering related to threats to [[national security]] that targets the Web sites of [[insurgents]], [[extremists]], and terrorists often enjoys wide public support.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* [[North Korean websites banned in South Korea|Blocking of pro–North Korean sites by South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/bulletins/009/ "Collateral Blocking: Filtering by South Korean Government of Pro-North Korean Websites"], OpenNet Initiative: Bulletin 009, 31 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blocking sites of groups that foment domestic conflict in [[Internet censorship in India|India]]
* Blocking of sites of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in some countries in the Middle East
* Blocking [[WikiLeaks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Australia_secretly_censors_Wikileaks_press_release_and_Danish_Internet_censorship_list%2C_16_Mar_2009 |title=Australia secretly censors Wikileaks press release and Danish Internet censorship list |date=16 March 2009 |work=wikileaks.org |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blocking sites such as [[4chan]] thought to be related to the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-authorities-take-on-anonymous-hackers/2011/09/11/gIQAYrhgMK_story.html "Federal authorities take on Anonymous hackers"], Associated Press in the Washington Post, 12 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection of existing economic interests and copyright===
The protection of existing economic interests is sometimes the motivation for blocking new Internet services such as low-cost telephone services that use [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP). These services can reduce the customer base of telecommunications companies, many of which enjoy entrenched monopoly positions and some of which are government sponsored or controlled.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

[[Anti-copyright]] activists [[Christian Engström]], [[Rick Falkvinge]] and [[Oscar Swartz]] have alleged that censorship of child pornography is being used as a pretext by copyright lobby organizations to get politicians to implement similar site blocking legislation against copyright-related piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/the-copyright-lobby-absolutely-loves-child-pornography-110709/ |title=The Copyright Lobby Absolutely Loves Child Pornography |author=[[Rick Falkvinge]] |date=9 July 2011 |work=[[TorrentFreak]] |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include:
* [[File sharing]] and [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) related websites such as [[The Pirate Bay]]
* [[Skype]]
* Sites that sell or distribute music, but are not 'approved' by rights holders, such as [[allofmp3]]

===Network tools===
Blocking the intermediate tools and applications of the Internet that can be used to assist users in accessing and sharing sensitive material is common in many countries.&lt;ref name=Faris-2008/&gt;

Examples include:
* Media sharing websites (e.g. [[Flickr]] and [[Censorship of YouTube|YouTube]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2007/03/11/youtube-blocked-inthailand/ |title=YouTube Blocked in...Thailand |date=11 March 2007 |work=Mashable |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social network service|Social networks]] (e.g. [[Censorship of Facebook|Facebook]] and Instagram)

{{main|Right to be forgotten}}

The ''right to be forgotten'' is a concept that has been discussed and put into practice in the [[European Union]]. In May 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled against [[Google]] in ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'', a case brought by a Spanish man who requested the removal of a link to a digitized 1998 article in ''La Vanguardia'' newspaper about an auction for his foreclosed home, for a debt that he had subsequently paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain |title=What we can salvage from 'right to be forgotten' ruling |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=15 May 2014 |accessdate=16 May 2014 |author=Julia Powles |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516024112/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain |archivedate=16 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially attempted to have the article removed by complaining to Spain's data protection agency—''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos''—which rejected the claim on the grounds that it was lawful and accurate, but accepted a complaint against Google and asked Google to remove the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Solon |first=Olivia |title=People have the right to be forgotten, rules EU court |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/13/right-to-be-forgotten-ruling |work=Wired.co.uk |publisher=Conde Nast Digital |accessdate=13 May 2014 |date=13 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514071400/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/13/right-to-be-forgotten-ruling |archivedate=14 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google sued in Spain and the lawsuit was transferred to the European Court of Justice. The court ruled in ''Costeja'' that search engines are responsible for the content they point to and thus, Google was required to comply with EU [[information privacy|data privacy]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU court backs 'right to be forgotten' in Google case |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27388289 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 May 2014 |date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU court rules Google must tweak search results in test of "right to be forgotten" |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eu-court-google-must-tweak-search-results-right-to-be-forgotten/ |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=13 May 2014 |date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began compliance on 30 May 2014 during which it received 12,000 requests to have personal details removed from its search engine.&lt;ref name="GoogleEU"&gt;{{cite news |title=Removal of Google personal information could become work intensive |url=http://www.europenews.net/index.php/sid/222490797/scat/88176adfdf246af5/ht/Removal-of-Google-personal-information-could-become-work-intensive |accessdate=2 June 2014 |publisher=Europe News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Index on Censorship]] claimed that "''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'' ruling ... allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight. This is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books. Although the ruling is intended for private individuals it opens the door to anyone who wants to whitewash their personal history....The Court’s decision is a retrograde move that misunderstands the role and responsibility of search engines and the wider internet. It should send chills down the spine of everyone in the European Union who believes in the crucial importance of free expression and freedom of information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/05/index-blasts-eu-court-ruling-right-forgotten/ |title=Index blasts EU court ruling on "right to be forgotten" |work=indexoncensorship.org |accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As more people in more places begin using the Internet for important activities, there is an increase in online censorship, using increasingly sophisticated techniques. The motives, scope, and effectiveness of Internet censorship vary widely from country to country. The countries engaged in state-mandated filtering are clustered in three main regions of the world: east Asia, central Asia, and the [[MENA|Middle East/North Africa]].

Countries in other regions also practice certain forms of filtering. In the [[Internet censorship in the United States|United States]] state-mandated Internet filtering occurs on some computers in libraries and [[K-12 schools]]. Content related to [[Nazism]] or [[Holocaust denial]] is blocked in [[Internet censorship in France|France]] and [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]]. [[Child pornography]] and [[hate speech]] are blocked in many countries throughout the world.&lt;ref name=Zittrain-2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262541963intro1.pdf |title="Introduction" |accessdate=2011-09-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629074247/http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262541963intro1.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}, Jonathan Zittrain and John Palfrey, in [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 ''Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226100258/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 |date=26 February 2009 }}, Ronald Deibert, John Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski, and Jonathan Zittrain, eds., MIT Press (Cambridge), 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many countries throughout the world, including some democracies with long traditions of strong support for [[freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of the press]], are engaged in some amount of online censorship, often with substantial public support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/Deibert_03_Ch02_029-056.pdf "Internet Filtering: The Politics and Mechanisms of Control"], Jonathan Zittrain and John Palfrey, in [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 ''Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226100258/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11329 |date=26 February 2009 }}, Ronald Deibert, John Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski, and Jonathan Zittrain, eds., MIT Press (Cambridge), 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet censorship in [[China]] is among the most stringent in the world. The government blocks Web sites that discuss the [[Dalai Lama]], the 1989 crackdown on [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protesters]], the banned spiritual practice [[Falun Gong]], as well as many general Internet sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internet Censorship in China|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/internet_censorship/index.html|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government requires Internet search firms and state media to censor issues deemed officially “sensitive,” and blocks access to foreign websites including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|title=World Report 2012: China|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-china|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a recent study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=G. King|title=Reverse-engineering censorship in China: Randomized experimentation and participant observation|journal=Science|doi= 10.1126/science.1251722 |date=22 August 2014|volume= 345 |issue= 6199 |page=891|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6199/1251722|display-authors=etal |pmid=25146296}}&lt;/ref&gt; censorship in China is used to muzzle those outside government who attempt to spur the creation of crowds for any reason—in opposition to, in support of, or unrelated to the government. The government allows the Chinese people to say whatever they like about the state, its leaders, or their policies, because talk about any subject unconnected to collective action is not censored. The value that Chinese leaders find in allowing and then measuring criticism by hundreds of millions of Chinese people creates actionable information for them and, as a result, also for academic scholars and public policy analysts.

There are international bodies that oppose internet censorship, for example "Internet censorship is open to challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) as it can restrict trade in online services, a forthcoming study argues".&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/217137198 WTO could challenge Internet censorship Anonymous.

Detailed country by country information on Internet censorship is provided by the [[OpenNet Initiative]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Freedom House]], and in the [[U.S. State Department]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]'s ''Human Rights Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm "2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices"], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings produced by several of these organizations are summarized in the [[Internet censorship by country]] and the [[Censorship by country]] articles.

====OpenNet Initiative reports====
Through 2010 the OpenNet Initiative had documented Internet filtering by governments in over forty countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=Noman-2011/&gt; The level of filtering in 26 countries in 2007 and in 25 countries in 2009 was classified in the political, social, and security areas. Of the 41 separate countries classified, seven were found to show no evidence of filtering in all three areas ([[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Internet censorship in France|France]], [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]], [[Internet censorship in India|India]], [[Human rights in Ukraine#Media Freedom and Freedom of Information|Ukraine]], [[Internet censorship in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], and [[Internet censorship in the United States|United States]]), while one was found to engage in pervasive filtering in all three areas ([[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]]), 13 were found to engage in pervasive filtering in one or more areas, and 34 were found to engage in some level of filtering in one or more areas. Of the 10 countries classified in both 2007 and 2009, one reduced its level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in Pakistan|Pakistan]]), five increased their level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Internet censorship in Belarus|Belarus]], [[Internet censorship in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Internet censorship in South Korea|South Korea]], and [[Internet censorship in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]]), and four maintained the same level of filtering ([[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[Internet censorship in Iran|Iran]], [[Internet censorship in Myanmar|Myanmar]], and [[Human rights in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=ONIChildPornLegal&gt;Due to legal concerns the [[OpenNet Initiative]] does not check for filtering of [[child pornography]] and because their classifications focus on technical filtering, they do not include other types of censorship.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom on the Net reports====

The ''Freedom on the Net'' reports from [[Freedom House]] provide analytical reports and numerical ratings regarding the state of [[Digital rights|Internet freedom]] for countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2018/&gt; The countries surveyed represent a sample with a broad range of geographical diversity and levels of economic development, as well as varying levels of political and media freedom. The surveys ask a set of questions designed to measure each country's level of Internet and digital media freedom, as well as the access and openness of other digital means of transmitting information, particularly mobile phones and text messaging services. Results are presented for three areas: Obstacles to Access, Limits on Content, and Violations of User Rights.
The results from the three areas are combined into a total score for a country (from 0 for best to 100 for worst) and countries are rated as "Free" (0 to 30), "Partly Free" (31 to 60), or "Not Free" (61 to 100) based on the totals.

Starting in 2009 Freedom House has produced nine editions of the report.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2009&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20OnThe%20Net_Full%20Report.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2009''], Freedom House, accessed 16 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2011&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2011 ''Freedom on the Net 2011''], Freedom House, accessed 15 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2012&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/inline_images/FOTN%202012%20FINAL.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2012''], Freedom House, accessed 24 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOTN-2013&gt;[http://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013_Full%20Report_0.pdf ''Freedom on the Net 2013''], Freedom House, 3 October 2013.

The 2014 report assessed 65 countries and reported that 36 countries experienced a negative trajectory in Internet freedom since the previous year, with the most significant declines in [[Internet censorship in Russia|Russia]], [[Censorship in Turkey#Internet censorship|Turkey]] and [[Internet in Ukraine#Internet censorship and surveillance|Ukraine]]. According to the report, few countries demonstrated any gains in Internet freedom, and the improvements that were recorded reflected less vigorous application of existing controls rather than new steps taken by governments to actively increase Internet freedom. The year's largest improvement was recorded in [[Internet censorship in India|India]], where restrictions to content and access were relaxed from what had been imposed in 2013 to stifle rioting in the northeastern states. Notable improvement was also recorded in [[Censorship in Brazil#Internet freedom|Brazil]], where lawmakers approved the bill [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Marco Civil da Internet]], which contains significant provisions governing net neutrality and safeguarding privacy protection.&lt;ref name=FOTN-2014/&gt;

=====RWB ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''=====
On 12 March 2013, [[Reporters_Without_Borders|Reporters Without Borders]] published a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831072750/http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ |date=31 August 2013 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The report includes two new lists: 
* a list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights; and
* a list of "Corporate Enemies of the Internet", companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information.

The five "State Enemies of the Internet" named in March 2013 are: [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The five "Corporate Enemies of the Internet" named in March 2013 are: [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), [[Gamma International]] (UK and Germany), [[Hacking Team]] (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany).&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

====BBC World Service global public opinion poll====
A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users,&lt;ref&gt;For the BBC poll Internet users are those who used the Internet within the previous six months.&lt;/ref&gt; was conducted for the [[BBC World Service]] by the international polling firm [[GlobeScan]] using telephone and in-person interviews between 30 November 2009 and 7 February 2010. GlobeScan Chairman Doug Miller felt, overall, that the poll showed that:
:Despite worries about privacy and fraud, people around the world see access to the internet as their fundamental right. They think the web is a force for good, and most don’t want governments to regulate it.&lt;ref name=BBCPoll-2010&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_03_10_BBC_internet_poll.pdf "BBC Internet Poll: Detailed Findings"], BBC World Service, 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from the poll include:&lt;ref name=BBCPoll-2010/&gt;
*Nearly four in five (78%) Internet users felt that the Internet had brought them greater freedom.
*Most Internet users (53%) felt that "the internet should never be regulated by any level of government anywhere".
*Opinion was evenly split between Internet users who felt that “the internet is a safe place to express my opinions” (48%) and those who disagreed (49%). Somewhat surprisingly users in [[Internet censorship in Germany|Germany]] and [[Internet censorship in France|France]] agreed the least, followed by users in a highly filtered country such as [[Internet Censorship in China|China]], while users in [[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Internet censorship in India|India]] and [[Internet in Kenya|Kenya]] agreed more strongly.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;
*The aspects of the Internet that cause the most concern include: fraud (32%), violent and explicit content (27%), threats to [[internet privacy|privacy]] (20%), state censorship of content (6%), and the extent of corporate presence (3%).
*Almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right (50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm "Internet access is 'a fundamental right'"], ''BBC News'', 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; And while there is strong support for this right in all of the countries surveyed, it is surprising that the United States and Canada were among the top five countries where people most strongly disagreed that access to the Internet was a fundamental right of all people (13% in [[Human rights in Japan#Civil liberties|Japan]], 11% in the [[Internet censorship in the United States|U.S.]], 11% in [[Internet in Kenya|Kenya]], 11% in [[Internet censorship in Pakistan|Pakistan]], and 10% in [[Internet censorship in Canada|Canada]] strongly disagree).&lt;ref name=UNESCO-2011/&gt;

====Internet Society's Global Internet User Survey====
In July and August 2012 the [[Internet Society]] conducted online interviews of more than 10,000 Internet users in 20 countries. Some of the results relevant to Internet censorship are summarized below.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/GIUS2012-GlobalData-Table-20121120_0.pdf "Global Internet User Survey 2012"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314063616/https://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/GIUS2012-GlobalData-Table-20121120_0.pdf |date=14 March 2013 }}, Internet Society, 20 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency of filtering or blocking activities===
Among the countries that filter or block online content, few openly admit to or fully disclose their filtering and blocking activities. States are frequently opaque and/or deceptive about the blocking of access to political information.&lt;ref name=Chadwick-2009/&gt; For example:
* [[Internet censorship in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Internet in the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) are among the few states that publish detailed information about their filtering practices and display a notification to the user when attempting to access a blocked website. The websites that are blocked are mostly [[Pornographic]] and against the respective states and/or the Islamic Religion.
* In contrast, countries such as [[Internet censorship in China|China]] and [[Internet censorship in Tunisia|Tunisia]] send users a false error indication. China blocks requests by users for a banned website at the [[Transport layer|router level]] and a connection error is returned, effectively preventing the user's [[IP address]] from making further [[HTTP]] requests for a varying time, which appears to the user as "time-out" error with no explanation. Tunisia has altered the block page functionality of [[SmartFilter]], the commercial filtering software it uses, so that users attempting to access blocked websites receive a fake "File not found" error page.
* In [[Internet censorship in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] users are frequently sent block pages stating that the website is blocked because of pornography, even when the page contains no pornography. Uzbeki ISPs may also redirect users' request for blocked websites to unrelated websites, or sites similar to the banned websites, but with different information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = ed.

===Arab Spring===
:''See also: [[Internet Censorship in the Arab Spring]], [[Internet in Egypt#2011 Internet shutdown|2011 Egyptian Internet shutdown]], and [[Free speech in the media during the Libyan civil war]]''

During the [[Arab Spring]] of 2011, media [[jihad]] (media struggle) was extensive. Internet and mobile technologies, particularly social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, played and are playing important new and unique roles in organizing and spreading the protests and making them visible to the rest of the world. An activist in Egypt tweeted, “we use Facebook to schedule the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ "The Arab Spring’s Cascading Effects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227051329/http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |date=27 February 2011 }}, Philip N. Howard, Miller-McCune, 23 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This successful use of digital media in turn led to increased censorship including the complete loss of Internet access for periods of time in Egypt&lt;ref name="jamescowie_techdetails_Egyptfullblock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDGnews_Egyptfullblock"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://monkey.org/~labovit/blog//viewpage.php?page=middle_east_scorecard_feb20 "Middle East Political Protest And Internet Traffic Report: February 12–20, 2011"], Craig Labovitz, Arbor Networks&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Free speech in the media during the 2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=Libya-RWB-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Analysis of Egyptian and Libyan outages"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2011/outages_censorship/outages_censorship.pdf| title=Analysis of Country-wide Internet Outages Caused by Censorship|last=Dainotti|year=2011| publisher=ACM|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Syria, the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), an organization that operates with at least tacit support of the government, claims responsibility for defacing or otherwise compromising scores of websites that it contends spread news hostile to the Syrian government. SEA disseminates denial of service (DoS) software designed to target media websites including those of [[Al Jazeera]], [[BBC News]], Syrian satellite broadcaster [[Orient TV]], and Dubai-based [[Al Arabiya]] TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennet.net/syrian-electronic-army-disruptive-attacks-and-hyped-targets "Syrian Electronic Army: Disruptive Attacks and Hyped Targets"], OpenNet Initiative, 25 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the greater freedom of expression brought about by the Arab Spring revolutions in countries that were previously subject to very strict censorship, in March 2011, Reporters Without Borders moved [[Internet censorship in Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[Internet censorship in Egypt|Egypt]] from its "Internet enemies" list to its list of countries "under surveillance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-egypt,39740.html "Countries under surveillance: Egypt"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060153/http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-egypt,39740.html |date=4 March 2016 }}, Reporters Without Borders, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 dropped [[Free speech in the media during the Libyan civil war|Libya]] from the list entirely.&lt;ref name=RWBEnemies2012/&gt;&lt;!-- defined by template:RWB Internet lists --&gt; At the same time, there were warnings that Internet censorship might increase in other countries following the events of the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.future500.org/blog/censorship-fallout-from-the-arab-spring/ "Censorship fallout from the Arab Spring?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126060054/http://www.future500.org/blog/censorship-fallout-from-the-arab-spring/ |date=26 January 2012 }}, Juliette Terzieff, The Future 500, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCATRE78R3CM20110928?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 "Insight: Social media – a political tool for good or evil?"], Peter Apps, Reuters Canada, 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2013, Libyan communication company [[Libya Telecom &amp; Technology|LTT]] blocked the pornographic websites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2013/09/13/ltt-blocks-pornographic-websites/ LTT Blocks Pornographic Websites]&lt;/ref&gt; It even blocked the family-filtered videos of ordinary websites like [[Dailymotion]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Kaldor's growth laws''' are a series of three ''laws'' relating to the causation of economic growth.

Looking at the countries of the world now and through time [[Nicholas Kaldor]] noted a high correlation between living standards and the share of resources devoted to industrial activity, at least up to some level of income. Only New Zealand, Australia and Canada have become rich whilst relying mainly on agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaldor |first=N. |year=1967 |title=Strategic Factors in Economic Development |location=New York |publisher=Ithaca |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thirlwall |first=A. |year=2003 |title=Growth and Development: With Special Reference to Developing Economies |edition=7th |location= |publisher=Palgrave |pages=121–122 |isbn=0-333-98089-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed three laws on these empirical regularities:
#The growth of the GDP is positively related to the growth of the manufacturing sector. This is perhaps better stated in terms of GDP growth being faster the greater the excess of growth of industrial growth relative to GDP growth: that is when the share of industry in GDP is rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thirlwall|first=A. P.|date=1983|title=A Plain Man's Guide to Kaldor's Growth Laws|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4537750|journal=Journal of Post Keynesian Economics|volume=5|issue=3|pages=345–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The productivity of the manufacturing sector is positively related the growth of the manufacturing sector (this is also known as [[Verdoorn's Law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verdoorn |first=P. J. |year=1949 |title=Fattori che regolano lo sviluppo della produttivita del lavoro |journal=L‘Industria |volume=1 |issue= |pages=310 |doi= }} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Here the argument is that there are increasing returns to scale in manufacturing. These may be static—where the larger the size of the sector the lower the average costs—or dynamic via the induced effect that output growth has on capital accumulation and technical progress. Learning by doing effects are also likely to be important.
#The productivity of the non-manufacturing sector is positively related to the growth of the manufacturing sector. This last law is the least intuitive and is based on the argument that the non-industrial sector has diminishing returns to scale. As resources are moved out the average productivity of those that remain will rise.

[[Anthony Thirlwall|Thirlwall]] (2003, p123–124) also reports Kaldor's highlighting of three subsidiary propositions which are also important to take into account. They are:
# That as the scope for the increasing returns sector to absorb the labour from the diminishing returns sector reduces so too will the rate of growth of GDP.
# That in the early stages of industrialisation the demand comes from the agricultural sector—but in the later stages export demand is likely to drive the process. Here the limited size of the internal market is likely to be such as to limit the realisation of economies of scale and there is the need for generating foreign exchange to import necessary inputs.
# A [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|virtuous circle]] can be generated by export growth and output growth but that this is difficult to establish as it is likely to depend on exceptional enterprise, protection or subsidy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">The '''Källén function''', also known as '''triangle function''', is a polynomial function in three variables, which appears in geometry and particle physics. In the latter field it is usually denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. It is named after the theoretical physicist [[Gunnar Källén]], who introduced it as a short-hand in his textbook ''Elementary Particle Physics''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Källén, ''Elementary Particle Physics'', (Addison-Wesley, 1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The function is given by a quadratic polynomial in three variables
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(x,y,z) \equiv x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
In geometry the function describes the area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a triangle with side lengths &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{4} \sqrt{-\lambda(a^2,b^2,c^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;
See also [[Heron's formula]].

The function appears naturally in the [[Kinematics]] of [[Special relativity|relativistic]] particles, e.g. when expressing the energy and momentum components in the center of mass frame by [[Mandelstam variables]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Byckling, K. Kajantie, ''Particle Kinematics'', (John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The function is (obviously) symmetric in permutations of its arguments, as well as independent of a common sign flip of its arguments:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(-x,-y,-z) = \lambda(x,y,z). &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;y,z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the polynomial factorizes into two factors
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(x,y,z) = (x-(\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})^2)(x-(\sqrt{y}-\sqrt{z})^2).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the polynomial factorizes into four factors
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(x,y,z) = -(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})(-\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})(\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}-\sqrt{z}).&lt;/math&gt;

Its most condensed form is
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(x,y,z) = (x-y-z)^2-4yz. &lt;/math&gt;

{{Social teachings of the popes}}
'''''Laudato si{{'}}''''' (Medieval Central [[Italian language|Italian]] for "Praise Be to You") is the second [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Francis]]. The encyclical has the subtitle "On care for our common home".&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText" /&gt; In it, the Pope critiques [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment|irresponsible development]], laments [[environmental degradation]] and [[global warming]], and calls all people of the world to take "swift and unified global action."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical, dated 24 May 2015, was officially published at noon on 18 June 2015, accompanied by a news conference.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The Vatican released the document in Italian, German, English, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese and Arabic, alongside the original Latin.&lt;ref name=strong /&gt;

The encyclical is the second published by Francis, after ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' ("The Light of Faith"), which was released in 2013. Since ''Lumen fidei'' was largely the work of Francis's predecessor [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], ''Laudato si{{'}}'' is generally viewed as the first encyclical that is entirely the work of Francis.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;&lt;ref name=things /&gt;

== Content ==
[[File:John Zizioulas presents the encyclical Laudato si' at the press conference in Rome.webm|thumb| [[w:John Zizioulas|John Zizioulas]],  [[w:Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]]  [[w:Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[w:Pergamon|Pergamon]], presents the encyclical ''Laudato si''' at the [[b:Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Press Conference Presentation Laudato si'|Press conference]] in Rome ]]
The title of the social encyclical is an [[Central Italian|Umbrian]] phrase&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt; from Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]'s 13th-century "[[Canticle of the Sun]]" (also called the Canticle of the Creatures), a poem and prayer in which God is praised for the creation of the different creatures and aspects of the Earth.&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt;

The tone of the Pope's phrasing has been described as "cautious and undogmatic, and he specifically calls for discussion and dialogue."&lt;ref name=good/&gt;  For example, he states in the encyclical (#188):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are certain environmental issues where it is not easy to achieve a broad consensus. Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics. But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.&lt;ref name=good/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He adds that "Although the post-industrial period may well be remembered as one of the most irresponsible in history, nonetheless there is reason to hope that humanity at the dawn of the twenty-first century will be remembered for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Francis does state that concern for the natural world is no longer "'optional' but is an integral part of the Church teaching on social justice."&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

Francis reportedly has said that the encyclical was not really an environmental document at all.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  The warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as they pursue short-term economic gains.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  This has resulted in a "[[throwaway culture]]" in which unwanted items and unwanted people, such as the unborn, the elderly, and the poor, are discarded as waste.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  This subtext makes the document "more profoundly subversive" than it appears on the surface.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

The real problem, according to Francis, lies in the fact that humans no longer see God as the [[Creator deity#Christianity|Creator]].&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  Thus we see "other living beings as mere objects subjected to arbitrary human domination" and do not realize that "the ultimate purpose of other creatures is not found in us."&lt;ref name=return/&gt; Francis says that instead of viewing humanity as having "dominion" over the earth, we must see that everything is interconnected and that all of creation is a "kind of universal family".&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; Nature cannot be seen as something apart from humanity, or merely the place where we live.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; He says that our social and environmental crises are thus one complex crisis that must be solved holistically.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

===Environmentalism===
Francis "pulls no punches" when lamenting pollution, [[global warming|climate change]], a lack of clean water, loss of biodiversity, and an overall decline in human life and a breakdown of society.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; "Never have we so hurt and mistreated our common home as we have in the last two hundred years," he states.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

He "describe[s] a relentless [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] and [[Environmental degradation|destruction]] of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; ''Laudato si''' "unambiguously accepts the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that [[global warming|changes in the climate]] are largely man-made"&lt;ref name=eco /&gt; and states that "climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day" and warns of "unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us" if prompt [[climate change mitigation]] efforts are not undertaken.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical highlights the role of [[fossil fuel]]s in causing climate change. "We know that technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be progressively replaced without delay," Francis says. "Until greater progress is made in developing widely accessible sources of renewable energy, it is legitimate to choose the less harmful alternative or to find short-term solutions."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  The encyclical's comments on climate change are consistent with the [[scientific consensus on climate change]].&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt;

===Poverty===
The encyclical states that [[developed nation]]s are morally obligated to assist [[developing nation]]s in combating the climate-change crisis.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Poor nations, the pontiff says, are ill-prepared to [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt to the effects of climate change]] and will bear the brunt of its [[Effects of global warming|effects]].&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  Linking the issues of [[poverty]], which has been a major issue in his papacy, and the environment, he insists that the world must "hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor."&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;

He does not believe, according to [[R. R. Reno]], that "for all our flaws, Western societies are more democratic, more egalitarian, and more inclusive than any in history."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  Citing the New Zealand Bishops Conference ''Statement on Environmental Issues'', Francis asks "what the commandment 'Thou shall not kill' means when 'twenty percent of the world's population consumes resources at a rate that robs the poor nations and future generations of what they need to survive.'"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

===Science and modernism===
"Science and religion, with their distinctive approaches to understanding reality, can enter into an intense dialogue fruitful for both," according to the pontiff.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Religions, including Christianity, can make "rich contributions ... towards an integral ecology and the full development of humanity,"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  However, "the scientific and experimental method" itself can be part of the problem when it decouples creation from the Creator.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

The editor of ''[[First Things]]'' R. R. Reno critiques the encyclical, writing ''Laudato si''' makes "many fierce denunciations of the current global order." This global order "destroys the environment, oppresses the multitudes, and makes us blind to the beauty of creation."&lt;ref name=return/&gt; According to Reno, the critiques of the scientific and technocratic present contained in the encyclical make this "perhaps the most anti-modern encyclical since the [[Syllabus of Errors]], [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX's]] haughty 1864 dismissal of the conceits of the modern era."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  He adds that the encyclical's tone lacks elements commonly found in the works of John Paul II and Benedict XVI that, in the tradition of [[Gaudium et Spes]], would have affirmed the modern world while correcting its errors.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

===Technology===
Modern technology, the "dominant technological paradigm", is seen as a key contributor to the environmental crisis and human suffering. "The technological paradigm has become so dominant that it would be difficult to do without its resources and even more difficult to utilize them without being dominated by their internal logic. It has become countercultural to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology…  Technology tends to absorb everything into its ironclad logic, and those who are surrounded with technology 'know full well that it moves forward in the final analysis neither for profit nor for the well-being of the human race.'"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

Technology is not value neutral and technological developments are directed by the profit motive, according to Pope Francis. This is a form of institutionalized greed, generally with little regard for environmental and social consequences. "The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings".&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt; The encyclical warns against "blind confidence in technical solutions," particularly in view of the fact that "the specialization which belongs to technology makes it difficult to see the large picture," which "can actually become a form of ignorance."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt; As a result, many technological solutions are nothing more than short-term techno-fixes attempting to remove symptoms rather than addressing the underlying environmental, social, economic, and even moral and spiritual problems: "Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

Given these significant short-comings of technology, "scientific and technological progress cannot be equated with progress of humanity and history," and we are deluded by the myth of progress to believe that "ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without need for ethical consideration or deep change."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  A profound redefinition of progress and "liberation from the dominant technocratic paradigm" are needed, i.e., "we have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology; we can put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  More fundamentally, according to the pontiff, we need to recognize that "technology severed from ethics will not easily be able to limit its own power," and that "the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Pope Francis adds that the environmental crisis can ultimately only be solved if our immense technological developments are accompanied by a "development in human responsibility, values, and conscience."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

===Other topics===

According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' summary, the encyclical is "sweeping" in scope and is wide-ranging (80 pages/45,000 words), including mentions of such topics as [[urban planning]], [[agricultural economics]], and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical also gives voice to the Pope's opposition to [[abortion]], [[Stem cell controversy#Catholicism|embryonic stem cell research]] and [[population control]] – saying that respect for creation and human dignity go hand in hand.&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt; "Since everything is interrelated," Francis says, "concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion."&lt;ref name="TheIndependent" /&gt; According to the Pope, we can't in fact "genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

''Laudato si''' opposes [[gender theory]] and supports "valuing one's own body in its femininity or masculinity." In acknowledging differences, the Pope states "we can joyfully accept the specific gifts of another man or woman, the work of God the Creator, and find mutual enrichment."&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;

===Sources===

The encyclical has 172 footnoted citations,&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText" /&gt; many to Francis's immediate predecessors, [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The encyclical also "draws prominently from" [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople]], the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Church of Constantinople]] and an ally of the pope.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;  It is highly unusual to quote an Orthodox bishop in a papal document.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  More than 10% of the footnotes, 21, cite documents from 16 bishops' conferences around the world, mostly from the [[global south]].&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;&lt;ref name=footnote /&gt;  This is the first encyclical to cite bishops' conferences.&lt;ref name=footnote /&gt;  This was an effort, experts believe, to build alliances on a controversial topic.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  The encyclical also cites Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]; [[Ali al-Khawas]], a 9th-century [[Islamic mysticism|Sufi mystic]];&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mystic /&gt; [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]; and [[Romano Guardini]].&lt;ref name=Faggioli /&gt;

== History ==

=== Early stages ===
Speculation about an "environmental encyclical" to be issued by Pope Francis first began in November 2013.&lt;ref name="RoeweProgress" /&gt; On 24 January 2014, the Vatican confirmed that drafting had begun. The Rev. [[Federico Lombardi]], the [[Holy See Press Office]] director, said that the document was in its very early stages, that no publication date had been set, and that the encyclical would be about ecology (and specifically the "ecology of man").&lt;ref name="RoeweProgress" /&gt;

Cardinal [[Peter Turkson]], the president of the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]], and his team wrote the first draft of the encyclical.&lt;ref name="Kaleem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; The draft was later reviewed by several theologians as well and sent (about three weeks before the encyclical's release) to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], the second section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and the [[theologian of the Papal Household]].&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; Edits were made based on their responses.&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt;

In drafting the encyclical, the Vatican consulted with leading scientific experts for months.&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt; One of the experts consulted was [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]], the founder and head of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]].&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt;

On 28 April 2015, in advance of the encyclical's release, the Vatican hosted a one-day conference on climate change, featuring Turkson, [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] (who delivered the keynote address), Ecuadorian president [[Rafael Correa]] and American economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref name=weight /&gt;&lt;ref name="Correa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirchgaessner" /&gt;

The title and subtitle of the encyclical were first reported on in a [[Twitter]] message by Spanish-language journalist Mercedes De La Torre on 30 May 2015.&lt;ref name=titled /&gt; The Vatican confirmed that the title would be ''Laudato si' '' on 10 June.&lt;ref name=confirms /&gt; While some initial reports said the encyclical would be called ''Laudato Sii'', this was incorrect; the pope chose to use the original Umbrian form and spelling of the poem, with a single ''i''.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;

On 4 June, the Vatican press office announced that the encyclical – which was "already attracting global attention for its expected discourses on Catholic theology on ecology, current environmental destruction, and climate change" – would be released on 18 June.&lt;ref name=released /&gt;

=== Leak ===
Four days before the encyclical's release, the Italian magazine ''[[L'Espresso]]'' posted a leaked draft of the document online.&lt;ref name="Koffler" /&gt; The leaked document "almost exactly matched" the final document.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The leak angered [[Vatican Curia|Vatican officials]]&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; who called it a "heinous act"&lt;ref name="Koffler" /&gt; and revoked the press credentials of the longtime ''L'Espresso''  Vatican correspondent [[Sandro Magister]].&lt;ref name="Winfield" /&gt; The ''New York Times'' and the Italian newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' both noted suggestions that the leak came from conservatives inside the Vatican who wished to embarrass the pope and hinder the rollout of the encyclical.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winfield" /&gt;

=== Release ===
The encyclical letter was officially released at an event in the New Synod Hall of the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; Speaking at the press conference were Turkson, Schellnhuber, and [[John Zizioulas]] (the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Pergamon]], representing the Orthodox Church).&lt;ref name=expert /&gt; On the day of the encyclical's official release, Pope Francis issued two messages about it on his official Twitter account, @Pontifex.&lt;ref name="Kaleem" /&gt; It has been suggested that the encyclical's release was timed to influence three summits being held at the [[United Nations]] on financial aid, sustainable development and climate change later in 2015.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

== Reception ==
{{globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=July 2015}}
After the encyclical was released, the Vatican's website was briefly inaccessible as many  people tried to read it.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  It has been described as "one of the shrewdest documents issued by the Vatican during the past century" and "has revealed Francis as a wily and sophisticated politician of the first order."&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  It contains, according to [[Paul Vallely]], "a raft of defenses against critics who dismiss it as the work of some kind of left-wing maverick."&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

=== Within Roman Catholic Church ===
The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], led by its president [[Joseph Edward Kurtz]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville|archbishop of Louisville]], described the encyclical as "our marching orders for advocacy"&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and planned briefings on the encyclical with both chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and with the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=cama /&gt;  Cardinal [[Seán Patrick O'Malley|Sean O'Malley]] of Boston said that the "constant linkage throughout the encyclical of the dual need to respect and protect "Our Common Home" and the need to respect and protect the dignity and lives of the poor may be regarded as the distinctive characteristic of this powerful message of Pope Francis."&lt;ref name=omalley/&gt;

Filipino Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]], the [[Archbishop of Manila]], wrote that "In ''Laudato si''' Pope Francis reminds us to replace consumption with a sense of sacrifice, greed with generosity and wastefulness with a spirit of sharing. We must "give, and not simply give up." We are called to free ourselves from all that is heavy and negative and wasteful and to enter into dialogue with our global family."&lt;ref name=tagle/&gt;

The three bishops of Northern and Central California, [[Stephen Blaire]], [[Armando Xavier Ochoa]], and [[Jaime Soto]], issued a joint statement that highlighted how climate change disproportionately affects the poor.  "The Catholic perspective is that human and natural ecology go hand in hand," the trio said. "We are called to solidarity with the poor as well as stewardship of the Earth. Our deep regard for the dignity of every person commands us to cultivate a climate of life where each of God's children thrive and join with creation in praising our Creator. This is the 'integral ecology' of which Pope Francis speaks."&lt;ref name=bee/&gt;

Bishop [[Richard Pates]] of [[Des Moines, Iowa]], which has the first major [[Presidential Primary|presidential primary]] contest in the United States, called on candidates to show courage and leadership on the issue, saying "With presidential candidates already visiting us regularly, I encourage Catholics across our state, and all people of good will, to talk to them and ask not if, but how, they plan to work toward solutions to climate change."&lt;ref name=plates/&gt;

[[Germany|German]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg|Archbishop of Hamburg]] [[Stefan Heße]] praised the encyclical, calling it "valuable momentum for a worldwide ecological reorientation." He commented further, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;He makes it clear that urgent issues of the future for the whole world and for all human beings have to be solved. Without a radical change of mentality, it will not do. Thus he underlines that the problems that concern all can be solved only by all.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.erzbistum-hamburg.de/ebhh/layer/layer_suchergebnis.php?we_objectID=4408&amp;pid=2|title = Erzbischof würdigt Umwelt-Enzyklika des Papstes|last =|first =|date = 18 June 2015|work = Erzbistum Hamburg|language = German|trans-title = Archbishop commends environmental papal encyclical|access-date = 11 March 2016|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://incaelo.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/bishops-react-to-laudato-si/|title = Bishops react to Laudato si'|last = de Vries|first = Mark|date = 19 June 2015|website = In Caelo et in Terra|publisher =|access-date = 11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Vaticanology|Vaticanologist]] [[John L. Allen, Jr.]], said in an analysis, "''Laudato si''' seems destined to go down as a major turning point, the moment when environmentalism claimed pride of place on a par with the [[dignity]] of human life and [[economic justice]] as a cornerstone of [[Catholic social teaching]]. It also immediately makes the Catholic Church arguably the leading moral voice in the press to combat global warming and the consequences of climate change."&lt;ref name=earthquake /&gt;

Catholic Millennials have written widely giving their opinions of the encyclical.&lt;ref name=mil/&gt;

====Criticism====
Samuel Gregg, director of research at the libertarian [[Acton Institute]], has criticized "the sheer overreach that plagues" ''Laudato si'''.&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  [[RealClearReligion]] editor Nicholas Hahn has said that "Good Catholics can disagree on how to combat climate change and shouldn't worry about being sent to the confessional if they drive a SUV."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;

This criticism comes despite the fact that Francis took "care to locate his text firmly in the substantial body of teaching set out by previous popes," especially John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who are especially admired by conservative Catholics.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

=== From other faiths ===
Three days before the encyclical was released, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] issued a Twitter message stating: "Since climate change and the global economy now affect us all, we have to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity."&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;

Two days before the encyclical was released, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Justin Welby]], head of the [[Anglican Communion]], issued a "green declaration" (also signed by the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Conference]] as well as representatives of the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] and the British Muslim, Sikh and Jewish communities) urging a transition to a [[low-carbon economy]] and fasting and prayer for success at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|December 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;&lt;ref name=joins /&gt;

The same day, the [[Lausanne Movement]] of global [[evangelical Christian]]s said it was anticipating the encyclical and was grateful for it.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;  The encyclical was also welcomed by the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

[[File:One Earth one family - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|Pope Francis's environmental encyclical [[w:Laudato si'|''Laudato si''']] has been welcomed by many environmental organisations of different faiths – Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action]]

=== From world leaders ===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], welcomed the encyclical in a statement on the day it was released.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=spokesman /&gt; [[Kofi Annan]], the former UN secretary-general and current chair of the [[Africa Progress Panel]], also issued a statement in support of the encyclical, stating "As Pope Francis reaffirms, climate change is an all-encompassing threat. … I applaud the Pope for his strong moral and ethical leadership. We need more of such inspired leadership. Will we see it at the climate summit in Paris?"&lt;ref name=chair /&gt;

[[Christiana Figueres]], the executive secretary of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], said: "Pope Francis is personally committed to this issue like no other pope before him. I do think the encyclical is going to have a major impact. It will speak to the moral imperative of addressing climate change in a timely fashion in order to protect the most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="Vidal" /&gt;

On the same day, [[Jim Yong Kim]], the president of the [[World Bank Group]], also praised the encyclical.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

=== From the scientific community ===
Science historian [[Naomi Oreskes]] observes that ''Laudato si''' "insists we embrace the moral dimensions of problems that have heretofore been viewed primarily as scientific, technological, and economic."&lt;ref name=Heald/&gt;&lt;ref name=oreskes/&gt;

The encyclical gave a boost to the [[fossil fuel divestment]] movement.&lt;ref name=schwartz /&gt;  Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the founding director of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] (PIK) and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]], who advised the Vatican on the drafting of the encyclical, said that "the science of ''Laudato si' '' is watertight" and gave the pontiff an "A" for command of the subject.&lt;ref name=expert /&gt;

An editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' praised the encyclical for its statements about [[sustainability]] and global poverty and the [[energy transition|transition]] from [[fossil fuel]]s to [[renewable energy|renewable energy sources]]: "The papal calls to end poverty and share the world's ecological space in a fair way are objectives that mirror the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]], to be released in September. The Pope's letter adds an important facet to the discussion: it is not merely conceivable to secure a sound future for human civilization without relying on coal, oil and gas – it is a prerequisite."&lt;ref name=hope/&gt; However it criticized Francis for ignoring important issues like [[family planning]] and [[birth control]]. "Alas, he remained silent on issues of contraception. With a world population heading towards a possible 10 billion, the importance of family planning is clear. The Vatican has been brave on climate change. If it is serious about the fate of the planet and the welfare of its inhabitants, then it must be braver still on the issue of contraception."&lt;ref name=hope/&gt;

A review by nine climate scientists under the [[Climate Feedback]] project concluded the encyclical "rather accurately depicts the current reality of climate change" and "fairly represents the present concerns raised by the scientific community."&lt;ref name=feedback/&gt;

[[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Nicholas Stern]], chair of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] and author of an influential report on climate change, stated that "The publication of the Pope's encyclical is of enormous significance. He has shown great wisdom and leadership. Pope Francis is surely absolutely right that climate change raises vital moral and ethical issues.... Moral leadership on climate change from the Pope is particularly important because of the failure of many heads of state and government around the world to show political leadership."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

{{anchor|Daly's comment}}
Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] praised the Pope's encyclical on the grounds that it "... unifies the main divisions of [[Christianity]] on at least the fundamental recognition that we have a shamefully neglected duty to care for the [[Earth]] out of which we evolved, and to share the Earth's life support more equitably with each other, with the future, and with other creatures." Daly even believes that the Pope "skates fairly close to the idea of [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economics]]," although the important issues of population stabilization, responsible [[family planning]] and [[Birth control|contraception]] were "conspicuously near-absent" in the encyclical.&lt;ref name=Daly/&gt;

===Impact on the United States political system===
[[Stephen F. Schneck]], the director of Institute for Policy Research &amp; Catholic Studies at [[The Catholic University of America]], has said that "Something's going to come out of this and it's definitely going to have an impact on public policy in the US."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  However, Kathy Saile, the former long time director of the US bishops' office for domestic social justice, does not believe that "it will spark a climate change bill, but someday when negotiations are happening on a bill or a treaty, these kinds of moral teachings could have an influence."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt; Nonetheless, she added, "Pope Francis's tone, his honesty, how he talks about mercy and care for the poor, and his genuine desire to be a bridge," could influence political culture in Washington. "If he could change the tone of the debate, that would be an amazing gift."

[[Miami]] Archbishop [[Thomas Wenski]], chairman of the US bishops' committee on domestic peace and justice, wrote a letter to Congress letting them know that "The U.S. bishops stand united with the Holy Father in his call to protect creation."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  He also asked them to "resist any effort to impair the development of a national carbon standard and instead to support our nation's ability to address this urgent global challenge confronting the human family."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  Schneck opined that "This is different than the normal letters that the USCCB sends over all the time on a variety of issues. It really transcends the fault lines of both US politics and politics around the world."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;

Cornell anthropologists [[Annelise Riles]] and Vincent Ialenti told NPR.org: "We find ''Laudato Si''' important because it defies the United States' political imagination at every turn. In some moments, the pope reads like an archconservative, in other moments an archliberal. Sometimes he defers to scientists, other times he quotes scripture and, still other times, he criticizes the very foundations of economics. Mixing together ideas many see as incompatible, he forces us to think."&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/09/26/442485534/excited-about-the-popes-visit-read-laudato-si "Excited About The Pope's Visit? Read 'Laudato Si'"] Cosmos &amp; Culture, NPR.org (26 September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported that the encyclical put pressure on Catholics seeking the [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016|Republican Party nomination for president of the United States]] in 2016, including [[Jeb Bush]], [[Marco Rubio]], and [[Rick Santorum]], who "have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change, and have harshly criticized policies designed to tax or regulate the burning of fossil fuels."&lt;ref name=davenport /&gt; Jeb Bush said: "I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope."&lt;ref name=backlash /&gt;

====Neoconservative critique and counterarguments====
[[Neoconservative]] circles in the United States have criticized the encyclical right from its publication in Rome, sometimes in very harsh terms.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;  Writing in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', [[Irwin M. Stelzer]] has argued that

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Pope Francis is unambiguously opposed to the American system of "savage capitalism". He has famously quoted a fourth century Doctor of the Church, [[St. Basil of Caesarea]], who called money "the devil's dung", has railed against the "anonymous influences of mammon" and a "new colonialism" that includes "free trade treaties... [and] imposition of austerity," and stated a preference for "cooperatives". Throw in Francis' views that we are witnessing "a disturbing warming of the climatic system... due to the great concentration of greenhouse gasses," and that "there is an urgent need of a true world political authority," and you have positions that it will take more than a spoonful of the Pontiff's charm to make go down the throats of many Americans.&lt;ref name=Stelzer/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== From industry ===
A [[lobbyist]] of [[Arch Coal]] sent an email to Republican lawmakers stating the pope "does not appear to address the tragedy of global [[energy poverty]]." The lobbyist argued the church should promote fossil fuels instead if he really cared about the poor.&lt;ref name=backlash /&gt; The email suggested "talking points" to the legislators for defending the coal industry and rejecting the arguments of the pope. The lobbyist wrote: "Billions of people around the globe are living without electrification and suffering through untold poverty and disease as a result." In contrast to these arguments the encyclical argues that fossil fuels in general and coal in particular threaten the poor: Fossil fuels are a threat to prosperity for the poor. They would suffer even more in particular from sea level rise, droughts, warming and extreme weather caused by burning fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/122052/climate-deniers-say-nope-red-pope  Climate Deniers Say Nope to "Red Pope"], ''The New Republic'', 17 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From other groups ===

The [[LGBT]]-interest magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' noted that the encyclical contains passages which reinforce the church's position against the [[transsexuality]] movement, calling for "the acceptance of our bodies as God's gift."&lt;ref name="TheAdvocate"/&gt;

[[Bill McKibben]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' reviewed the encyclical.&lt;ref name="McKibben"/&gt;

== In music ==
On behalf of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg|Diocese of Limburg]], [[Peter Reulein]] wrote the music for the [[oratorio]] ''[[Laudato si' (oratorio)|Laudato si' – a Franciscan Magnificat]]'' to the [[libretto]] by [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]].&lt;ref name="Laudato si-score"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reulein | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Reulein | last2 = Schlegel | first2 = Helmut | authorlink2 = Helmut Schlegel | title = Laudato si' / Ein franziskanisches Magnificat | publisher = [[Patrick Dehm|Dehm Verlag]] | location = [[Limburg an der Lahn]] | year = 2016 | isbn = 978-3-943302-34-9 | pages = 230 | ismn = 979-0-50226-047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work is based on the Latin version of the [[Magnificat]], corresponds to the ''[[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]],'' and includes texts from the [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'' and the [[encyclical]] ''Laudato si'''.

{{Portal|Free software}}
The '''Mixed Reality Simulation Platform (MIXR)''' is an open-source software project designed to support the development of robust, scalable, virtual and constructive, and stand-alone and distributed simulation applications. Its most common use case is to support the development of executable simulation applications used to assemble real-time, interactive, distributed virtual environments (DVEs).

==Abbreviated History==

The genesis of MIXR software codebase can be traced to the late 1980s when it was written in the C programming language and executed on a Commodore Amiga 1000.  Because C doesn't directly support the object-oriented (OO) programming paradigm, the codebase defined an OO-like infrastructure to support programming from this perspective.  In the early 1990's, the C-based OO system was converted to C++, where applications were developed and executed on Silicon Graphics (i.e., SGI) workstations.  The transition away from Silicon Graphics workstations to personal computers (PCs) occurred in 1997.

Initially, the codebase had no official name associated with it; that changed in 2002 when it was named the Enhanced Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground Linked Environment Simulation (EAAGLES); later updated to mean the Extensible Architecture for the Analysis and Generation of Linked Simulations.  The update removed domain-specific terminology such as "air-to-air" and "air-to-ground" to emphasize the more general purpose modeling and simulation capabilities the software is designed to support.

In 2003, EAAGLES became more visible within the DoD community when an EAAGLES-based fighter cockpit application was demonstrated at the Interservice/ Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC); the world's largest modeling, simulation, and training conference. Even though the fighter cockpit simulator was developed in only a few months, it performed flawlessly; a testament to both the design of the application and the underlying framework.

In July of 2006, a significant subset of the original EAAGLES codebase was released into the public domain; it became what is known as {{Smallcaps|OpenEaagles}}. At the same time, a website was set up to provide information, documentation, and releases.  In 2009, the book "Design &amp; Implementation of Virtual and Constructive Simulations Using {{Smallcaps|OpenEaagles}}" was published. Since then, a steady stream of releases has been posted.

In 2017, the previously named {{Smallcaps|OpenEaagles}} project was renamed to MIXR for a number of reasons. These include:
* providing a better alignment of the project name with domain of interest; i.e., the development of mixed reality simulation applications,
* explicitly shifting away from using the term ''framework'' in favor of ''platform'' to indicate a concerted effort to expose the functionality/capability it provides in different ways, as opposed to traditional object-oriented inheritance (i.e., subclassing),
* serve as an indication that the project is transitioning away from a ''traditional C++'' codebase in favor of a ''modern C++'' codebase to improve quality, capability, understandably, and reduce complexity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4021">'''Mark(ing) your own homework''' (where "your" is often substituted with "their", "one's", "its", "his" or "her") is a British expression used in [[political discourse]], the study of [[organisational behaviour]] and in everyday life. The expression implies that whenever a person or group self-assesses and/or [[Industry self-regulation|self regulates]] their own work they will usually treat it more favorably than if it were assessed by an independent person or group. 

== Examples ==
* UK [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] have been criticised for marking their own homework by self-regulating their own expense claims and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27998410 MPs' inquiry into 'marking their own homework'] ''[[BBC News]]'' 25 Jun 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/10/in-praise-of-not-marking-ones-own-homework In praise of … not marking one's own homework] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 10 April 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John McTernan]] [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12065287/MPs-need-an-independent-regulator.html MPs need an independent regulator] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 22 Dec 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] said, in the context of a perceived lack of diversity in [[Fire services in the United Kingdom|fire and rescue]] crews, "It is not so much marking your own homework as setting your own exam paper and resolving that you've passed – and it has to change."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3607243/Theresa-May-criticises-lack-diversity-fire-rescue-crews.html Theresa May criticises lack of diversity in fire and rescue crews] ''[[Mail Online]]'' 24 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura Hughes [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/24/theresa-may-fire-chiefs-are-eroding-public-confidence-and-underm/ Theresa May: Fire chiefs are 'eroding public confidence' and undermining respect for their profession] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 24 May 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;
* According to UK MP [[Ann Clwyd]], hospitals in the UK are still marking their own homework. Many hospitals do not yet have clear protocols about how complaints are handled and investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Clwyd]] [https://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/patient-safety/complainants-voices-are-as-muted-as-ever/7004232.article Complainants’ voices are as muted as ever] ''[[Health Service Journal]]'' 22 Apr 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Scottish health regulator, [[Healthcare Improvement Scotland]], has itself been accused of marking its own homework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/concerns-voiced-over-scottish-nhs-marking-its-own-homework-1-4095694 Concerns voiced over Scottish NHS ‘marking its own homework’] ''[[The Scotsman]]'' 09 Apr 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Bradford [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35563619 Scots health watchdog accused of 'marking its own homework'] ''BBC News'' 12 Feb 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Care Quality Commission|CQC]] said, in the context of a proposal to introduce [[coregulation]] of NHS health providers to encourage them to develop their own systems and processes for understanding quality, it will be able to protect against providers marking their own homework by checking self-assessments against its own data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/hsj-live/hsj-live-28102015-hunt-gives-junior-doctors-pay-guarantee/5091503.article HSJ Live 28.10.2015] ''Health Service Journal'' 28 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maternal sensitivity''' is a mother's ability to perceive and infer the meaning behind her infant's [[human behavior|behavioural signals]], and to respond to them promptly and appropriately. Maternal sensitivity affects child development at all stages through life, from infancy, all the way to adulthood. In general, more sensitive mothers have healthier, more socially and cognitively developed children than those who are not as sensitive.&lt;ref name="Wu 2011 469–477"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Tiejian |author2=Wallace E.

==Description==

Maternal sensitivity was first defined by [[Mary Ainsworth]] as "a mother's ability to perceive and interpret accurately her infant's signals and communications and then respond appropriately". It was later revised by Karl and Broom in 1995 as "a mother's ability to recognize infant cues consistently and act on those cues, and the ability to monitor and accurately interpret infant cues, as evidenced by mother–child interactions that are contingent, reciprocal and affectively positive". It can be generally defined as a broad concept combining a variety of behavioral care giving attributes.&lt;ref name="Hyunjeong"/&gt;

The research on maternal sensitivity follows earlier work in psychoanalytics and is especially rooted in [[attachment theory]]. As the focus of psychoanalytics shifted from individuals (particularly adults) to children, research studies on mother–infant [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]], on the effects of early childhood on development, and on pregnancy became wider. A psychologist named [[John Bowlby]] eventually developed the attachment theory in 1969. [[Mary Ainsworth]], who worked with Bowlby, along with her colleagues created the concept of maternal sensitivity in 1978 in order to describe early mother–infant interaction observed in her empirical studies.&lt;ref name="Kemppinen"&gt;Kemppinen, K. (2007). ''Early Maternal Sensitivity: Continuity and Related Risk Factors''. Kuopio University Publications D. Medical Sciences 412. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four important aspects of maternal sensitivity: dynamic process involving maternal abilities, reciprocal give-and-take with the infant, contingency on the infant's behavior, and quality of maternal behaviors.&lt;ref name=Hyunjeong&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shin|first=Hyunjeong|title=Maternal sensitivity: a concept analysis|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|year=2008|volume=64|issue=3|pages=304–314|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04814.x/pdf|accessdate=13 June 2012|pmid=18764848|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04814.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hyunjeong /&gt;

Maternal sensitivity is dynamic, elastic and can change over time. A sensitive mother needs to be able to perceive the cues and signals her baby gives her, interpret them correctly and act appropriately. The three most positive affecting factors for the baby are a mother's [[social support]], maternal–fetal attachment and high [[self-esteem]]. The three most negative affecting factors are maternal [[Depression (mood)|depression]], maternal [[Stress (biology)|stress]], and maternal [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=Hyunjeong /&gt;  Recent studies have shown that maternal posttraumatic stress disorder ([[PTSD]]) can negatively impact a mother's sensitivity during stressful moments with her child that serve as traumatic reminders and that this quite likely has a neural basis in the maternal brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = DS | last2 = Moser | first2 = D | last3 = Wang | first3 = Z | last4 = Marsh | first4 = R | last5 = Hao | first5 = XJ | last6 = Duan | first6 = Y | last7 = Yu | first7 = S | last8 = Gunter | first8 = B | last9 = Murphy | first9 = D | last10 = McCaw | first10 = J | last11 = Kangarlu | first11 = A | last12 = Willheim | first12 = E | last13 = Myers | first13 = M | last14 = Hofer | first14 = M | last15 = Peterson | first15 = BS | year = 2012 | title = An fMRI study of the brain responses of traumatized mothers to viewing their toddlers during separation and play | url = | journal = Journal of Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 8| pages = 969–79 | doi=10.1093/scan/nsr069| pmc = 3501701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = DS | last2 = Willheim | first2 = E | last3 = Hinojosa | first3 = C | last4 = Scholfield-Kleinman | first4 = K | last5 = Turner | first5 = JB | last6 = McCaw | first6 = J | last7 = Zeanah | first7 = CH | last8 = Myers | first8 = MM | year = 2010 | title = Subjective and objective measures of parent-child relationship dysfunction, child separation distress, and joint attention | url = | journal = Psychiatry: Interpersonal and Biological Processes | volume = 73 | issue = 2| pages = 130–144 | doi=10.1521/psyc.2010.73.2.130 | pmid=20557225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==

===Naturalistic observation===

Maternal sensitivity is most commonly assessed during naturalistic observation of free play interactions between mother and child.&lt;ref name= "Bento" /&gt; There are several factors surrounding assessment during observation that may cause differences in results, including the setting (home vs laboratory), the context (free play vs structured task), the length of observation and the frequency of observation. While some observational studies focus strictly on the relationship between mother and child during close interaction such as feeding or free play, other studies look into how well the maternal figure divides her attention between the baby and other everyday activities.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2011 41–50"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=K|author2=Dozier, M. |author3=Lindhiem, O |title=Maternal Sensitivity: Within-Person Variability and the Utility of Multiple Assessments|journal=Child Maltreatment|year=2011|volume=16|issue=1|pages=41–50|pmid=21131634|doi=10.1177/1077559510387662|pmc=3210187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was demonstrated in an experiment conducted by Atkinson et al. where mothers were given a questionnaire to act as a "distractor task", and were assessed on their ability to effectively divide their attention between the "distractor task" and their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=L.|author2=Goldberg, S. |author3=Raval, V. |author4=Pederson, D. |author5=Benoit, D. |author6=Moran, G. |author7=Leung, E. |title=On the relation between maternal state of mind and sensitivity in the prediction of infant attachment security|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2005|volume=41|pages=42–53|pmid=15656736|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.1.42|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to length of observation, some studies require no more than a one-time 10-minute assessment, while other studies used a much lengthier time.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2011 41–50"/&gt;

===Strange Situation===

The [[Strange Situation]] was developed by [[Mary Ainsworth]] in the 1970s to assess attachment relationships between caregivers and children between 9 and 18 months old. Because maternal sensitivity is an indicator of attachment relationship, researchers sometimes use the Strange Situation to observe attachment so that they may use the results to predict and infer the level of maternal sensitivity.&lt;ref name="McLeod" /&gt;

In the [[Strange Situation]], the toddler's behavior and stress is observed during a 21-minute free-play session through a [[one-way glass]] window as the caregiver and strangers come into and leave the room.&lt;ref name="McLeod" /&gt; The specific sequence of events is as follows:

# The mother and child are alone. Observation of the use of the mother as a secure base, who fosters exploratory behavior and independence.
# A stranger enters the room, which shows the effects of stranger anxiety.
# The mother leaves the child, which shows the effects of separation anxiety. The strange tries to comfort the child, which tests the effects of stranger anxiety.
# The mother returns and the stranger leaves. Observation of reunion behavior.
# The parent leaves and the child once more; separation anxiety is tested for.
# The stranger returns and tries to comfort the infant; stranger anxiety is tested for.
# The parent returns and the stranger leaves. Once more, observation of reunion behavior.&lt;ref name="McLeod" /&gt;

The children are observed and categorized into one of the four attachment patterns&amp;nbsp;– [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|secure attachment]], [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|anxious-ambivalent attachment]], [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|anxious-avoidant attachment]], or [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|disorganized attachment]]&amp;nbsp;– based on the infant's separation anxiety, willingness to explore, stranger anxiety, and reunion behavior.&lt;ref name="McLeod" /&gt;

===Mother–infant synchrony and maternal mind-mindedness===

Two related qualitative concepts that are correlated with maternal sensitivity are ''mother–infant synchrony'' and ''maternal mind-mindedness''.&lt;ref name="Zentall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meins" /&gt;

In mother–infant synchrony, the mother and infant's ability to change their own behaviour based on the other's response is taken into consideration. Infant affect (vocal and facial) and maternal stimulation (vocal and tactile) are good indicators of mother–infant synchrony. Zentall et al. found that infants' rhythm was stronger and interactions were led better at 5 months than at 3 months. According to the study, an infant's ability to send signals and a mother's ability to perceive them increase with synchrony over time.&lt;ref name="Zentall" /&gt; Studies have shown that mother–infant synchrony will result in the infant's development of [[self-control]] and other self-regulating behaviours later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickler|first=R. H|author2=Reyna, A.B|title=Mother–Infant Synchrony|journal=JOGNN|year=2009|volume=38|pages=470–477|pmid=19614883|doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.2009.01044.x|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related concept of maternal mind-mindedness assesses the mother's ability to understand and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness has been found to be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an ''appropriate'' mind-related comment if the comment was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if the comment associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the comment encouraged the infant to go on with his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the comment about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the comment deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the comment is unclear, it is deemed a ''in-appropriate'' mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.&lt;ref name="Meins" /&gt;

==Role of maternal sensitivity in development==

===Infancy===

Infants whose mothers are more sensitive are more likely to display secure attachment relationships. Because the maternal figure is generally accessible and responsive to the infant's needs, the infant is able to form expectations of the mother's behaviour. Once expectations are met and the infant feels a consistency in the mother's sensitivity, the infant is able to find security in the maternal figure. Those infants whose mothers do not respond to the signals from their children or respond inappropriately to their children's cries for attention will form insecure and anxious attachments because the infants are unable to consistently depend on the maternal figures for predictable and safe responses.&lt;ref name=MS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ainsworth|first=M.S|title=Infant-Mother Attachment|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|issue=10|pages=932–937|pmid=517843|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.34.10.932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the infant to feel that the maternal figure is accessible and responsive, a certain amount of interaction must occur. Though the most research has been done on face-to-face interaction, studies have found that bodily interaction is also important in sensitivity and development. It is not how often the baby is held that reflects attachment, but ''how'' the baby is held and whether or not the baby desires to be held that matters in attachment development. Another factor that is important is sensitivity to the infant's feeding signals.&lt;ref name=MS /&gt; There lies some controversy in whether infants who form [[insecure attachment]] relationships with their mothers do so because the mother is particularly insensitive to her child's needs or because of differences in their personality (i.e. their temperament) and due to life situations.&lt;ref name=Susman-Stillman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susman-Stillman |first=A.|title=Infant Temperament and Maternal Sensitivity as Predictors of Attachment Security|journal=Infant Behaviour and Development|year=1996|volume=19|issue=1|pages=33–47|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638396900429|accessdate=July 14, 2012|doi=10.1016/S0163-6383(96)90042-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===

[[File:Doing the best she can.jpg|thumb|Children whose mothers have higher levels of maternal sensitivity are generally happier, healthier, smarter, and better behaved.]]

There is a crucial interplay between parenting and child characteristics such as health, temperament, development and cognition. The children with the most sensitive, consistent mothers are the ones who are generally most healthy, happy and well adapted.&lt;ref name="Wu 2011 469–477"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alink 2009 99–120"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alink|first=Lenneke R. A.|author2=Judi Mesman |author3=Jantien van Zeijl |author4=Mirjam N. Stolk |author5=Femmie Juffer |author6=Marian J. Bakermans-Kranenburg |author7=Marinus H. van IJzendoorn |author8= Hans M.

====Health in childhood====

Maternal sensitivity even in the first few months of mother–child relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with [[obesity]]. A study using data from the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's]] Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother–child interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and [[body mass index]] was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage of overweight or obese grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and by grade six, 34.34% of the children were classified as overweight or obese. More interesting is the difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive mothers had an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children.&lt;ref name="Wu 2011 469–477"/&gt;

====Temperament in childhood====

Current studies have shown a correlation between maternal sensitivity or insensitivity, [[negative discipline]] and childhood [[aggression]]. An experiment sampling 117 mother–child pairs showed a unique relationship between the mother's sensitivity and the use of discipline and the child's temperament level. Observations (of the mother's sensitivity to the child's needs, the child's aggression and temperament level and the relationship between the two) were made when the children on average were 26.71 months old (range of 13.58 to 41.91 months). The data were collected again a year later. Results show a year later that negative discipline is correlated with child aggression, but only when that mother is insensitive.&lt;ref name="Alink 2009 99–120"/&gt;

====Development in childhood====

A study by [[Jay Belsky]] and R.M. Pasco Fearon tested the correlation between childhood [[Child development|development]] and the sensitivity of the mother.&lt;ref name=Belsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belsky|first=Jay|author2=R. M. Pasco Fearon|title=Early attachment security, subsequent maternal sensitivity, and later child development: Does continuity in development depend upon continuity of caregiving?|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|year=2002|volume=4|issue=3|pages=361–387| pmid = 12537851|doi=10.1080/14616730210167267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypotheses were:
* secure attachment (observed at 15 months) and maternal sensitivity (observed at 24 months) produced the highest competencies in three-year-old children,
* the least competent children would have a history of insecure attachment and maternal insensitivity,
* and the children reared with mixed or inconsistency would fall in between.
The children were tested in five developmental categories: problem behavior, social competence, expressive
language, receptive language and school readiness. Results highly support the hypothesis (i.e. maternal sensitivity and childhood development are [[Positive correlation|positively correlated]].) This is an important issue as it shows how influential the early experience of a child affects their future development.&lt;ref name=Belsky /&gt;

====Cognition in childhood====

Mothers who were found to display higher sensitivity towards their children from preschool to first grade were found to have higher achieving children than those who displayed lower maternal sensitivity. The children of maternally sensitive mothers scored higher in math and [[phoneme]] knowledge than those who had a history of lower maternal sensitivity.&lt;ref name=downer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downer|first=Jason T.|author2=Robert C. Pianta|title=Academic and Cognitive Functioning in First Grade: Associations with Earlier Home and Child Care Predictors and with Concurrent Home and Classroom Experiences|journal=School Psychology Review|year=2006|volume=35|issue=1|pages=11–30|url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/spr/spr351downer.pdf|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal sensitivity has been shown to teach infants attentional skills, which are necessary later in life for emotional control, and other more complex cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Martha Ann|author2=Christy D. Wolfe|title=Emotion and Cognition: An Intricately Bound Developmental Process|journal=Child Development|date=March–April 2004|volume=75|issue=2|pages=366–370|pmid = 15056192|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00679.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In families with more than one child ([[twins]] or [[Multiple birth#Higher order multiples|triplets]]), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are more needs to be taken care of by the mother and less time to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Booting|first=J |author2=Macfarlane, A. |author3=Price, F|title=Three, Four and More. A Study of Triplets and Higher Order Births|journal=London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Ruth|author2=Arthur I. Eidelman |author3=Noa Rotenberg |title=Parenting Stress, Infant Emotion Regulation, Maternal Sensitivity, and the Cognitive Development of Triplets: A Model for Parent and Child Influences in a Unique Ecology|journal=Child Development|date=November–December 2004|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1774–1791|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00816.x|pmid=15566379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Socialization in childhood====

Maternal sensitivity has been shown to have an effect on children's socialization skills. In particular, some research suggests that children of more sensitive caregivers have high levels of effortful (i.e. emotional and behavioural) control. Such control is proposed to have been fostered from the infancy stage when the a sensitive mother's quick and appropriate responses to the baby's distress teaches the baby to adjust his/her arousal. This speedy regulation of arousal is then adapted into childhood resulting in the ability to regulate emotion and behaviour well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spinrad | first1 = T.L. | last2 = Eisenberg | first2 = N. | last3 = Gaertner | first3 = B. | last4 = Popp | first4 = T. | last5 = Smith | first5 = C.

Caregiver sensitivity has also been found to have a connection with empathy in children. Generally, securely attached children have been found to be more empathetic compared with insecurely attached children. The reasoning suggested for this result is that because securely attached children receive more empathy from caregivers during times that they themselves are distressed, they are more likely to show empathy in a situation where someone else is distressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kiang | first1 = L. | last2 = Moreno | first2 = A.J. | last3 = Robinson | first3 = J.

===Adulthood===
Adults' own understanding of maternal sensitivity affects their sensitivity towards their own children.&lt;ref name="dev psy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckwith|first=Leila|title=Maternal Sensitivity During Infancy and Subsequent Life Events Relate to Attachment Representation at Early Adulthood|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=May 1999|volume=35|issue=3|pages=693–700|url=http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~rakison/attachment1.htm|accessdate=12 June 2012| pmid = 10380860|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.35.3.693|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who had insensitive mothers during  infancy were found to not be able to remember specific childhood events or their importance. They were not able to present an accurate description of their parents by use of memories, they were found to idealize experiences and are more likely to remember situations in which they were rejected.&lt;ref name="chi dev"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waters|first=Everett|author2=Hamiltion, Claire E. |title=The Stability of Attachment Security from Infancy to Adolescence and early Adulthood: General Introduction|journal=Child Development|date=May–June 2000|volume=71|issue=3|pages=678–683|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8624.00175/abstract|accessdate=13 June 2012|pmid = 10953933|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00175|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who experienced higher maternal sensitivity during both infancy and adulthood were found to be less [[Dismissive Parenting|dismissive]] and more secure than those who did not. Adults who are preoccupied were found to also try to please their parents as they were young, and have a sense of anger towards them.&lt;ref name="chi dev" /&gt; About half of the adults who were found more preoccupied than others were found to have experienced divorce between their parents earlier in life, as well as other negative life events such as death of a parent or sexual abuse. These life events cause the security of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] between mother and child to decrease as the mother's availability, as well as responsiveness may decrease, no matter the maternal sensitivity experienced prior to these events.&lt;ref name="chi dev" /&gt; Male adults were found to have experienced less maternal sensitivity earlier in life than females and were more likely to be classified as dismissive than females were.&lt;ref name="dev psy" /&gt;

==Difference in maternal sensitivity in adult and teen mothers==
Maternal sensitivity has been found to be greater for adult mothers than for adolescent mothers.&lt;ref name="beh dev" /&gt; The level and quality of mind-mindedness, which refers to how prone the mother is to comment about the infant's mental activity during interaction, is higher in adult mothers, and has been related to greater maternal sensitivity. The comments made by adult mothers were found to be more positive than those made by adolescent mothers. Adolescent mothers used almost no positive comments, but instead negative comments. This causes the adolescent mother to be more insensitive to their baby's needs, possibly because of lack of need understanding, and therefore have lower maternal sensitivity and a less secure [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to their infants.&lt;ref name="beh dev" /&gt;

Maternal sensitivity in adolescent mothers can be predicted prenatally.&lt;ref name="chi dev 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Mary J.|author2=Elizabeth A. Carlson|title=Associations among Adult Attachment Representations, Maternal Sensitivity, and Infant-Mother Attachment in a Sample of Adolescent Mothers|journal=Child Development|year=1995|volume=66|pages=69–79|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00856.x/abstract|accessdate=13 June 2012|pmid = 7497830|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00856.x|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers who talked lively and positively about their future relationship with the child were found to display higher maternal sensitivity than those who did not (classified as autonomous mothers). Autonomous mothers were also found to have infants with a more [[secure attachment]]. Adolescent mothers who were not classified as autonomous were found to have anxiously attached infants.&lt;ref name="chi dev 2" /&gt; Furthermore, adolescent mothers were found to have children four–eight years old with lower [[IQ]]s and a below-average [[reading level]], than did adult mothers.&lt;ref name="hopkins med"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lobi|first=M|author2=Welcher DW |author3=Mellitz ED |title=Maternal age and intellectual functioning of offspring.|journal=Johns Hopkins Med J|year=1971|volume=128|pages=347–361| pmid = 5559291|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although adolescent mothers have been found to display lower maternal sensitivity, there is no evidence that maternal age itself has a negative effect on child development, as other factors at that age such as education and financial status may play a role in the insensitivity of the mother towards the child as well.&lt;ref name=pedi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elster|first=Arthur B. |author2=Elizabeth R.

==Measurement==

===Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scale (AMSS)===

Mary Ainsworth developed Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scale (AMSS) to use as a measure in her Baltimore longitudinal study (1963). The scale is based on naturalistic observations completed by Ainsworth over a period of several hours and thus has no short procedure outline. Her method uses a nine-point scale (nine being very high and one being very low) in a number of important maternal traits. In order for this measurement to be accurate, it is essential that the researcher has developed good observations and insight into the behaviour of the caregiver.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt;

* ''Sensitivity vs. insensitivity to signals:'' This scale measures the how well the maternal figure is able to perceive and correctly interpret what the baby is giving signs of or signalling through behaviour and how appropriately the maternal figure is able to respond to them. The scale ranges from highly sensitive to highly insensitive.
* ''Cooperation vs. interference with ongoing behavior:'' This scale measures how badly the maternal figure's timing of tasks interrupt the baby's own activities rather than with consideration to the baby's mood and interest. The scale ranges from conspicuously cooperative to highly interfering.
* ''Acceptance vs. rejection of infant's needs:'' This scale measures the maternal figure's good and bad feelings towards her baby. The scale ranges from highly accepting to highly rejecting. 
* ''Accessibility vs ignoring:'' This scale measures the maternal figure's accessibility and responsiveness to the baby. The scale ranges from highly accessible to highly inaccessible, ignoring or neglecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prior|first=Vivien|title=Understanding attachment and attachment disorders : theory, evidence and practice|year=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London; Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-84310-245-8|edition=1. publ.|author2=Glaser, Danya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal Behaviour Q-sort (MBQS)===

Maternal Behaviour Q-sort (MBQS) was developed by David Pederson, Greg Moran and Sandi Bento to measure maternal sensitivity. It has been used to measure a variety of studies including home based and video-recorded observations. The measures are defined using q-factor analyses.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;Moran, G. (2009). The Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (MBQS)&amp;nbsp;– Overview, Available Materials and Support. ''SelectedWorks of Greg Moran.''&lt;/ref&gt; The standard version of the Q-sort consists of 90 items that measure maternal sensitivity with regards to accessibility, responsiveness and promptness to the child's needs and there are many variations. In order to measure sensitivity, observers sort the items into nine piles of ten based on correspondence between the observed behaviour and the item. The maternal sensitivity score is calculated by comparing the descriptive sort and the criterion sort (prototypical sensitive mother). Pederson and Moran based their Q-sort on the Waters Attachment Q-Set, which is an assessment of the behavior of children.&lt;ref&gt;Pederson &amp; Moran (1995). A categorical description of infant-mother relationships in the home and its relation to the Q-sort measures of infant-mother interaction. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 60 (2/3), 111-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pederson and Moran Sensitivity Q-Sort===

The Pederson and Moran Sensitivity Q-Sort was developed by Pederson D.R., Moran G., Sitko C., Campbell K., and Ghesquire K. in 1990. Similar to Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scales, the Pederson and Moran Sensitivity Q-Sort was designed to detect changes in maternal sensitivity with relation to infant behaviour.&lt;ref name= "Pederson" /&gt;

===Related measures===

The Atypical Maternal Behavior Instrument for Assessment and Classification (AMBIANCE) scale was developed by Elisa Bronfman, Elizabeth Parsons and Karlen Lyons-Ruth. It was developed to measure the extent to which the parent failed to follow into the intentional or affective direction of the baby’s communications by engaging in contradictory responses to infant cues or failing to respond to infant cues altogether. AMBIANCE has the following five dimensions:&lt;ref name="pmid19122769"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lyons-Ruth K |title=Contributions of the mother-infant relationship to dissociative, borderline, and conduct symptoms in young adulthood |journal=Infant Mental Health Journal |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=203–218 |year=2008 |pmid=19122769 |pmc=2613366 |doi=10.1002/imhj.20173 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Affective Communication Errors (e.g., talks in inviting voice, but physically blocks infant’s access)
* Role Confusion: (e.g., draws attention to self when infant is in need)
* Disorientation: (e.g., appears confused, hesitant, or frightened with infant; incongruous affect)
* Negative-Intrusive Behavior: (e.g., mocks or teases infant)
* Withdrawing Behavior: (e.g., fails to initiate interaction, does not greet infant after separation)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8536">{{For|artist and illustrator (1873-1949) from New York|May Wilson Preston}}
'''May Wilson''' (1905 – October 19, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] artist and figure in the 1960s to 1970s New York City avant-garde art world.  A pioneer of the [[feminist art|feminist]] and [[mail art]] movement, she is best known for her [[Surrealist]] [[Junk art|junk]] [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]] and her "Ridiculous Portrait" [[photocollage]]s.

==Biography==
Wilson was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], into an underprivileged family. Her father died when she was young. She was reared by her [[Irish Catholic]] mother, who sewed piecework at home. Wilson left school after the ninth grade to become a stenographer/secretary to help support her family. When she turned 20, she married a young lawyer, William S. Wilson, Jr., and give birth to her first child. She continued to work until the birth of her second child, after which she devoted her energies primarily to mothering and homemaking. In 1942, the couple had prospered enough to move to [[Towson, Maryland]], where she began to take correspondence courses in art and art history from several schools, including the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1948, after the marriage of their daughter, the couple moved to a [[gentleman's farm]] north of Towson, where she pursued painting and gave private art lessons to neighbors. She exhibited her paintings, scenes of everyday life painted in a flat, purposefully [[Primitive art|primitive]] manner in local galleries and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Wilson, "May Wilson: Constructing Woman (1905-1986)", in Ann Aptaker, ed., ''Ridiculous Portrait: The Art of May Wilson'', ed. Ann  Aptaker, Morristown, N.J.: Morris Museum, 2008, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 and 1958, she won awards for work submitted to juried exhibitions at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="editors"/&gt;

In 1956, her son, the writer Williams S. Wilson, gave to [[Ray Johnson]], the founder of the [[Mail art|New York Correspondence School]], his mother's address. This began a friendship and artistic collaboration between Johnson and Wilson, which would last the remainder of her life. Wilson became an integral part of Johnson's mail art circle and was initiated into the New York [[avant-garde]] through letters and small works that she exchanged with [[Robert Watts]], [[George Brecht]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Arman]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, in Aptaker (2008); Sachs and Minioudaki, eds. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

When her marriage dissolved, she moved to New York City in the spring of 1966, aged 61, taking up residence first in the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] and then in a studio next door, where she threw legendary soirées and became known as the "Grandma Moses of the Underground". By the time she arrived, Wilson was already working with photomontage techniques. Encouraged by Johnson, who had sent her magazines through the mail, she scissored patterns into images of pin-up girls and muscle men until they resembled doilies or snowflakes, as Wilson called them. She decorated her hotel room and later her studio on West 23rd Street with these and other manipulated, [[found object]] images.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, "Art is a Jealous Lover: May Wilson: 1905-1986", November 18, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, she also began her series of "Ridiculous Portraits", for which she would ride the subway to [[Times Square]], where she made exaggerated faces in photo booths. She then would cut and paste her photo-booth face onto postcards, along with Old Master reproductions, fashion shoots, and softcore magazine pornography. Long before artists such as [[Cindy Sherman]] and [[Yasumasa Morimura]] embarked on similar critical projects, Wilson's "Ridiculous Portraits" sent up the ubiquitous sexism and ageism that exists in popular and fine-art images of women.&lt;ref&gt;Camhi (2001)&lt;!-- page(s)?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 70, she converted a nude photograph of herself into a stamp that she pasted on envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, in Aptaker (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Her collages and humorous self-portraits were made as gifts and mail-art items for her friends and were not widely known until after her death.&lt;ref name="editors"&gt;Sachs and Minioudaki, eds. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an innovator of [[junk art]] [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]] that incorporated real objects, such as high-heel shoes, bed sheets, sauce pans, toasters, liquor bottles, ice trays, and wrapped baby dolls. Her sculptures were inspired by [[Surrealist]] and [[Dada]] practices and are similar in spirit to [[Yayoi Kusama]]'s contemporary accumulations.&lt;ref name="editors"/&gt; Wilson was the subject of a 1969 experimental documentary by Amalie R. Rothschild, "[https://www.newday.com/film/woo-who-may-wilson Woo Hoo? May Wilson]".

She died of pneumonia on Sunday, October 19, 1986, at the Village Nursing Home in [[Manhattan]]. She was survived by her children, William S. Wilson, III, and Mrs. Betty Jane Butler as well as six grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;"May Wilson, 81, Artist Noted for Her 'Junk' Assemblages", ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 22, 1986, p. A29; accessed August 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her death, May Wilson's work has been featured in numerous exhibitions and retrospectives at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], Maryland; Gracie Mansion Gallery, New York; the Morris Museum, Morristown, N.J.; the Pavel Zoubok Gallery, New York City; and The [[University of the Arts, Philadelphia]].

'''Media system dependency theory''' ('''MSD'''), or simply '''media dependency''', was developed by Sandra Ball-Rokeach and [[Melvin Defleur]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|author2=DeFleur, ML|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects|journal=[[Communication Research (journal)|Communication Research]]|year=1976|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–21|doi=10.1177/009365027600300101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is grounded in classical sociological literature positing that media and their audiences should be studied in the context of larger social systems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Efficacy on the Internet: A Media System Dependency Approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/2193885/Political_Efficacy_on_the_Internet_A_Media_System_Dependency_Approach|publisher=[[Academia.edu]]|accessdate=5 May 2014|author=Ognyanova, K.|author2=Ball-Rokeach, S. J.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSD ties together the interrelations of broad [[Social system|social systems]], [[mass media]], and the individual into a comprehensive explanation of media effects. At its core, the basic dependency hypothesis states that the more a person depends on media to meet needs, the more important media will be in a person's life, and therefore the more effects media will have on a person. 
 
==The relationships between components==
Dependency on media emerges from three relationships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Alan M|author2=Windahl, S|title=The uses and dependency model of mass communication|journal=[[Critical Studies in Media Communication]]|year=1986|volume=3|pages=184–199|doi=10.1080/15295039609366643}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''The relationship between the society and the media:''' Within this relationship, media access and availability are regarded as important antecedents to an individual's experience with the media. The nature of media dependence on societal systems varies across political, economic, and cultural system.
#'''The relationship between the media and the audience:''' This relationship is the key variable in this theory because it affects how people might use a mass medium. This relationship also varies across media systems. The more salient the information needs, the stronger are the motivation to seek mediated information and the dependency on the medium. In result, the likelihood for the media to affect audiences becomes greater.
#'''The relationship between the society and the audience:''' The societies influence consumers' needs and motives for media use, and provide norms, values, knowledge, and laws for their members. Social system can function an alternatives to the media by offering similar services of the media.

==Media needs and media dependency==
===Three types of needs===
According to Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|author2=DeFleur, ML|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects|journal=In G. Gumpert &amp; R.S. Cathart, (eds.), Inter/Media: Interpersonal communication in a media world.|year=1979|pages=81–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; three media needs determine how important media is to a person at any given moment:
#The need to understand one's social world (surveillance)
#The need to act meaningfully and effectively in that world (social utility)
#The need to escape from that world when tensions are high (fantasy-escape)

When these needs for media are high, the more people turn to media to meet these needs, and therefore the media have a greater opportunity to affect them. That said, none of these media needs are constant over long periods of time. They change based on aspects of our social environment.

===Two basic conditions for heightened media needs===
Media dependency theory states two specific conditions under which people's media needs, and consequently people's dependency on media and the potential for media effects, are heightened.

The first condition of heightened media needs occurs when the number of media and centrality of media functions in a society are high.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; For instance, in modernized countries like the United States, there are many media outlets and they serve highly centralized social functions. In the United States alone, the media act as a "fourth branch" of government, an alarm system during national emergencies, and as a tool for entertainment and escape, whereas in the underdeveloped world the media are not as numerous and serve far fewer functions. As such, the media have a greater opportunity to serve needs and exert effects in contemporary America than in a third world country.

The second condition of heightened media needs occurs when a society is undergoing social change and conflict. When there is a war or large-scale public protests like during Vietnam or the Arab Spring, a national emergency like the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowery|first=W|title=Media dependency during a large-scale social disruption: The case of September 11|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2004|volume=7|issue=3|pages=339–357|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0703_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hindman|first=DB|title=Media system dependency and public support for the press and president|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2004|volume=7|issue=1|pages=29–42|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0701_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina, people turn to media to help understand these important events. Consequently, the media have a greater opportunity to exert effects during these times of social change and conflict.

==The effects of media message==
Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur suggests that the cognitive, behavioral and affective consequences of media use
are premised upon characteristics of both individuals and their social environment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Cognitive===
There are five types of cognitive effects that will be exerted on audiences, the first of which is the creation and resolution of ambiguity. Ambiguity occurs when audiences receive inadequate or incomplete information about their social world. When there is high ambiguity, stress is created, and audiences are more likely to turn to mass media to resolve ambiguity. Ambiguity might be especially prevalent during times of social change or conflict.

The second effect is agenda-setting. This is another reason why we might call dependency a "comprehensive" theory of media effects&amp;nbsp;– it incorporates the entire theory of agenda-setting within its theoretical framework. Like any other effect, media agenda-setting effects should be heightened during times when the audience's needs and therefore dependency on media are high. So, for instance, if our informational needs and dependency on media was high during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, we would have been more susceptible to agenda-setting effects, and we would have therefore perceived the Iraq War as the most important problem (MIP) facing the United States.

Third is attitude formation. Media exposes us to completely new people, such as political figures and celebrities, not to mention physical objects like birth control pills or car safety mechanisms that we come to form attitudes about. Dependency does not suggest media are monolithic in their ability to influence attitudes, but the theory does suggest that media play a role in selecting objects and people for which people form attitudes about. If a person is experiencing greater media dependency, we would therefore expect that the person will form more (or more complex) attitudes about these attitude-objects than people with low media dependency.

Media also have the potential cognitive effect of expanding people's belief systems. Media can create a kind of "enlargement" of citizen's beliefs by disseminating information about other people, places, and things. Expansion of people's belief systems refers to a broadening or enlarging of beliefs in a certain category. For example, a constant flow of information about global warming will expand people's beliefs about pollution affecting the earth's atmosphere, about cap and trade and other policies, and about personal contributions to global warming. These beliefs meet with and are incorporated into an existing value system regarding religion, free enterprise, work, ecology, patriotism, recreation, and the family.

Last is value clarification and conflict. Media help citizens clarify values (equality, freedom, honesty, forgiveness) often by precipitating information about value conflicts. For instance, during the 1960s the mass media regularly reported on the activities of the Civil Rights movement, presenting conflicts between individual freedoms (e.g., a businessman's property rights to deny blacks entrance) and equality (e.g., human rights). When such conflicts play out in the mass media, the value conflicts are identified, resulting in audiences forming their own value positions. Such a position can be painful to articulate because it can force a choice between mutually incompatible goals and the means for obtaining them. However, in the process of trying to decide which is more important in a particular case, general value priorities can become clarified.

===Affective===
Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur mentions several possible affective media effects that are more likely to occur during times of heightened dependency.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; First is desensitization, which states that prolonged exposure to violent content can have a "numbing" effect on audiences, promoting insensitivity or the lack of desire toward helping others when violent encounters happen in real life.

Second, exposure to news messages or TV dramas that portray crime-ridden cities can increase people's fear or anxiety about living in or even traveling to a city.

Media can also have effects on morale and feelings of alienation. The degree of positive or negative mass media depictions of social groups can cause fluctuations in people's sense of morale in belonging to that group or in their sense of alienation from that group.

===Behavioral===
There are two broad categories of behavioral effects that Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur identify.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The first broad category is called "activation" effects, which refer to instances in which media audiences do something they would not otherwise have done as a consequence of receiving media messages. Behavioral effects are largely thought to work through cognitive and affective effects. For instance, a woman reading a news story about sexism in the workplace might form an attitude toward sexism that creates a negative emotional state, the culmination of which is joining a women's rights march in her local community.

The second broad category of behavioral effects is called "deactivation", and refers to instances in which audiences would have otherwise done something, but don't do as a consequence of media messages. For example, the primary presidential campaign has become longer and increasingly use more media to target audiences. As such, primary campaigns might elicit negative attitudes toward the electoral process and negative affective states such as boredom or disgust that in turn might make a person not turn out to vote.

==The levels of media dependency==
In the MSD view, the media system has two-way resource-dependency relations with individuals (micro-level), groups and organizations (meso-level), and other social systems (macro-level).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|title=The origins of individual media-system dependency: a sociological framework| journal=Communication research|year=1985|volume=12|issue=4|pages=485–510|doi=10.1177/009365085012004003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The microlevel (individual level)===
Microlevel, or individual level application, focuses on the relationship between individuals and media. The microlevel dependency, better known as individual level media system dependency (IMD), begins with an assessment of the types of motivation that bring individuals to use the media.
In the perspective of IMD, goals are preferred to needs to conceptualize the motivations that affect media behavior. According to Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur, goals are the key dimension of individual motivation. While needs imply both rational and irrational motives, goals imply a problem-solving motivation more appropriate to a theory of media behavior based upon the dependency relation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Three types of motivational goals====
The IMD approach provides a comprehensive conceptualization of three motivational goals: understanding, orientation, and play.
#Understanding – needs for individuals to have a basic understanding of themselves and the world around them.
#Orientation – needs for individuals to direct personal actions effectively and interact successfully with others.
#play(or recreation) – a way through which one learns roles, norms, and values and its reflected in such activities as sport, dance, and celebration.

===The macrolevel===
Every country's media system is interdependent on the country's other social systems (e.g., its economy, its government) for resources, and vice versa. At the macrolevel, dependency theory states these interrelationships influence what kinds of media products are disseminated to the public for consumption, and the range of possible uses people have for media.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

====Media and economic system====
The media depend on a society's economic system for 1) inculcation and reinforcement of free enterprise values, 2) establishing and maintaining linkages between producers and sellers, and 3) controlling and winning internal conflicts, such as between management and unions. In turn, the media is dependent on a society's economic system for 1) profit from advertising revenue, 2) technological developments that reduce costs and compete effectively with other media outlets, and 3) expansion via access to banking and finance services, as well as international trade.

====Media and political system====
A society's media and political system are also heavily interdependent. Political system rely on the media to 1) inculcate and reinforce political values and norm such as freedom, voting, or obedience to the law, 2) maintain order and social integration, 3) organize and mobilize citizens to carry out essential activities like waging war, and 4) controlling and winning conflicts that develop within political domains (e.g., Watergate). Conversely, the media rely on a country's political system for judicial, executive, and legislative protection, formal and informal resources required to cover the news, and revenue that comes from political advertising and subsidies.

====Media and secondary systems====
To a lesser extent, media has established interdependencies with several other social systems. The family is dependent on media for inculcation and reinforcement of family values, recreation and leisure, coping with everyday problems of child rearing, marriage, and financial crises. On the other hand, the media is dependent on the family for consuming their media products.

The same is true of media and religious systems. Religious systems rely on media for inculcation and reinforcement of religious values, transmitting religious messages to the masses, and successfully competing with other religious or nonreligious philosophies. In turn, the media relies on the religious system to attain profits from religious organizations who purchase space or air time.

The educational system in a society relies on media for value inculcation and reinforcement, waging successful conflicts or struggles for scarce resources, and knowledge transmission such as in educational media programming. Media depends on the educational system for access to expert information and being able to hire personnel trained in the educational system.

Finally, the military system depends on the media for value inculcation and reinforcement, waging and winning conflicts, and specific organizational goals such as recruitment and mobilization. The media, in turn, depends on the military for access to insider or expert information.

The consequences of all of these interdependencies, again, are alterations in media products that audiences consume. In this way, the system-level interdependencies control media products, the range of possible social uses for media, the extent to which audiences depend on the media to fulfill needs, and ultimately media effects on audiences. Individual differences due to demographics or personality traits might change what people actually do with media messages or how they interpret media messages, but the messages always begin as the result of interdependent social systems.

==Comparison with use and gratification theory==
Ball-Rokeach summarized the major differences between uses and gratification (U&amp;G) theory and media system dependency (MSD) theory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Conception of audience members===
Both U&amp;G and MSD theorists view the audience member as active, but the basic conceptions of the audience member differ. U&amp;G theorists focus on psychological and sociodemographic origins of differences in media use. In this perspective, the variability of text interpretation suggests an audience member in charge of the text.

MSD theorists focus on psychological, interpersonal, and sociological origins of differences in micro MSD relations as well as the macro MSD relations that constrain media text production and individual's MSD relations. The responsiveness of micro MSD relations to environmental conditions and the ecological constraints on media production and consumption are important features. In this perspective, the audience member is neither in charge of the text nor controlled by the text. The only way we can predict the effects is the audiences' MSD relations in context of the ecology of macro relations.

===Conception of interpersonal networks and communication===
U&amp;G theorists emphasize the role of interpersonal communication in the distortion of media messages and of networks as interpretive communities. In this conception, interpersonal networks are regarded as a safety way against the cultural apparatus of the media and its partners. They believe that the interpersonal network contributes to individual "agency", and the "networked" individual is empowered to manipulate media texts, not to be manipulated by them.

The MSD conception is compatible with the U&amp;G conception up to a point. Consistent with MSD conceptions of the individual member of the active media audience, the interpersonal networks play major roles in MSD theory. They link the individual to public and they link and influence the nature of the individual's relations with the media system.

===Conception of the media system and of media power===
U&amp;G theorists in the psychological tradition think of the media system as creators of tentative texts subject to multiple reconstructions. In this perspective, the media system is functional to the extent that it is useful or affords ways for individuals to gratify needs.

The MSD conception is closer to a macro functionalist version of U&amp;G. MSD shares the macro functionalists' view of the media's interdependence with other social and cultural system. In this view, the function of media is seen as a key structure for vertical and horizontal integration of society. The MSD viewpoints seem to be even closer to cultural studies traditions in that the central concern for structural relations of control over information resources that generate the power to create social realities and to negotiate social conflict and social change.

===Methods of observation, analysis, and interpretation===
Although both U&amp;G and MSD researchers ask similar questions of individuals, they do so for very different reasons. Those differences are reflected most clearly in (a) the logics of hypothesis formation (b) item and scale construction (c) modes of data analysis, and (d) interpretation of findings.

The MSD researcher essentially wants to know the micro and macro determinants of stability and change in micro MSD relations to learn something about their cross-level consequences for individuals and their interpersonal networks-the dynamics of their inner worlds and how they live in their social worlds. The U&amp;G theorist wants to learn something about the individual's attraction to media texts and the interaction between text and reader to better understand the contributions of reader characteristics to text processing. The differences between micro U&amp;G and micro MSD are, thus, in their epistemological origins, assumptions, concepts, and missions.

==Theoretical applications in social media==
===New media dependency (NMD)===
The characteristics of new media, including social media domain and the unique contents available through participatory use, as adding to the measure of individual dependency relation (IMD), are treated as the mediator. This cognitive process of mediating IMD is called new media dependency (NMD). Age and the popularity of online contents are seen as influential to NMD, in which younger people show higher NMD especially on popular content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Yoonwhan|year=2009|title=New media uses and dependency effect model: exploring the relationship between new media use habit, dependency relation, and possible outcomes|url=https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/25730/PDF/1/|journal=Doctoral dissertation, Rutgers University-Graduate School-New Brunswick|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cross-level===
====Inevitable limitations====
#The mass media centered framework.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ball-Rokeach, S.J. &amp; Jung, J-Y, (2009). The Evolution of Media System dependency theory. In R. Nabi and M. B. Oliver,'' Sage Handbook of Media Processes and Effects''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Its theoretical assumption of asymmetry between mass media and individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
However, the communication environment has changed as social media provides more choices for people to actively select information generated by other people, instead of passively receiving from satellites and cable channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Cross-level analysis of social media====
Three basic factors of MSD – individual characteristics, social environment, and media system activity – are derived from both micro and macro levels in a society, postulating media remained on a single level. However, the functionality of social media has been suggested as crossing those levels. Through social media, users are able to create the story (on the micro level), and the story can be either shared publicly (on the macro level) or not. Thus, social media gain the ability to move across levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Joo-Young, J., Moro, M., Jung, J. Y., &amp; Munehito, M. (2012). Cross-level analysis of social media: Toward the construction of an ecological framework. ''国際基督教大学学報. II-B, 社会科学ジャーナル'', 73, 53-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The argument about studies in social media===
Particularly, there are lots of MSD studies in online social networking sites ranging from MySpace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schrock|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=Myspace Or Ourspace: A Media System Dependency View Of Myspace|url=|journal=Doctoral dissertation, University of Central Florida|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, J. Y. (2012). Social media use and goals after the Great East Japan Earthquake. ''First Monday'', ''17''(8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ha, L., Yoon, K., &amp; Zhang, X. (2013). Consumption and dependency of social network sites as a news medium: A comparison between college students and general population. ''Journal of Communication and Media Research'', ''5''(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, scholars still have concerns about whether it is appropriate or not to apply MSD for studying the use of social media.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matei.org/ithink/2010/07/27/from-media-dependency-system-to-communication-infrastructure-theory/comment-page-1/|title=Can media system dependency account for social media? Or should communication infrastructure theory take care of it?|last=Matei|first=Sorin Adam|date=27 July 2010|website=I Think|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that MSD accounts for social media, giving reasons that:
#MSD provides a framework for the many relationships through which information can flow in social media environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
#In the case of social media, the power is dependent on the relationship between the provider of information and the consumer of information, rather than in specific people or positions, which is consistent with what MSD suggests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
On the contrary, others challenge that MSD does not fit well with social media studies, because:
#Unlike the one-to-many aspect of traditional mass media, social media's many-to-many nature determines that it is difficult to find out who or what is the original generators producing and spreading messages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
#MSD is inadequate for studying social media as it "mainly accounting for mass media and reducing interpersonal networks to effect gauges".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Baran and Davis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baran, S.J.|author2=Davis, D.K.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Mass communication theory: Foundation, ferment, and the future|year=2008|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|pages=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; identify four primary criticisms of dependency theory:
#Variability in microlevel and macrolevel measurement makes between-study comparability problematic.
#The theory is often difficult to empirically verify.
#The meaning and power of dependency is sometimes unclear.
#Dependency theory lacks power in explaining long-term effects.

== Definition ==
The idea of motherhood studies was influenced by [[Adrienne Rich]]’s ''Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution'' in 1976. It is consists of three interconnected categories of inquiry: motherhood as institution, motherhood as experience, and motherhood as identity or subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Green|first=Fiona Joy|title=Motherhood Studies|date=2010|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/motherhood/n441.xml|work=Encyclopedia of Motherhood|pages=832–832|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412979276.n441|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motherhood studies is often referred to as a [[Feminism|feminist practice]].

== History ==
Samira Kawash argues that "the marginalization of motherhood in feminist thought was not only a political rejection of maternalist politics construed as a conservative backlash to feminism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawash|first=Samira|date=2011-06|title=New Directions in Motherhood Studies|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/658637|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=36|issue=4|pages=969–1003|doi=10.1086/658637|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the leading portals of mother studies is ''The m/other voices foundation'', a non-profit organization in the USA. It emerged in 2014 from Deirdre M. Donoghue's research project ''(m)other voices: the maternal as an attitude, maternal thinking and the  production of time and knowledge'' at [[Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art|Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art]].  The project's purpose was to initiate discourse and the doing of maternal theory within arts and other fields of cultural production and to reflect on the maternal figure as a thinker and a producer of knowledge.

More and more organized initiatives within academic communities are starting such as the ''[https://jarm.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/jarm/index Motherhood Initiative for Research and Community Involvement]'', a feminist scholarly and activist organization on mothering-motherhood based in Toronto, Canada.

The ''Journal of the Motherhood Initiative'' re-launched in 2010 as a continuation of the ''Journal of the Association for Research on Mothering'' that started in 1999.

A '''negative repetition''' ('''negative rep''') is the repetition of a technique in [[weight training|weight lifting]] in which the lifter performs the eccentric phase of a lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Eccentric Weight Training|url = http://weighttraining.about.com/od/glossary/g/eccentric.htm|accessdate = 2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of pressing the weight up slowly, in proper form, a [[Spotting (weight training)|spotter]] generally aids in the concentric, or lifting, portion of the repetition while the lifter slowly performs the eccentric phase for 3–6 seconds. Negative reps are used to improve both [[Physical strength|muscular strength]] and power in subjects, this is commonly known as hypertrophy training.

Due to its mechanical properties, this form of training can be used for both healthy individuals and individuals who are in rehabilitation. Studies have shown that negative repetitions or "[[Eccentric training|eccentric phase training]]" combines a high amount of force on the muscle with a lower energy cost than normal concentric training, which requires 4–5 times the amount of energy. This justifies why this type of training is more beneficial and less of a risk to subjects rehabilitating or with a limited exercise capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Eccentric+Exercise+Training%3A+Modalities%2C+Applications+and+Perspectives&amp;rft.jtitle=Sports+Medicine&amp;rft.au=Marie-Eve+Isner-Horobeti&amp;rft.au=St%C3%A9phane+Pascal+Dufour&amp;rft.au=Philippe+Vautravers&amp;rft.au=Bernard+Geny&amp;rft.date=2013-06-01&amp;rft.pub=Springer+Science+%26+Business+Media&amp;rft.issn=0112-1642&amp;rft.eissn=1179-2035&amp;rft.volume=43&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=483&amp;rft.externalDocID=3141405021&amp;paramdict=en-US|title = Eccentric exercise training: modalities, applications and perspectives|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1007/s40279-013-0052-y|pmid = |access-date = |volume=43 |pages=483–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Eccentric training is often associated with the terms "muscles soreness" and "muscle damage". In 1902, [[Theodore Hough]] discovered and developed the term DOMS ([[delayed onset muscle soreness]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/doms-the-good-the-bad-and-what-it-really-means-to-your-training|title = DOMS: the good, the bad and what it really means to your training|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; after he found that exercises containing negative repetitions caused athletes to have sore muscles. Hough believed this was causing a rupture within the muscle; when he looked further into the subject, he found that when performing eccentric exercise that exhibited soreness, the muscle "quickly adapts and becomes accustomed to the increase in applied stress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mc.uky.edu/athletic_training/docs/nzsmsc-2010/Eccentric_Training_Spring2011.pdf|title = Eccentric training|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this was that the muscles' soreness not only decreased, but the muscular damage did too.

== Health benefits for the elderly ==
It has been proven that eccentric resistance training improves the functional mobility of older adults. Studies have shown that eccentric training of the lower body, in particular the [[:Category:Knee extensors|knee extensors]], are essential in preventing falls in older adults and helping them maintain their independence. A study conducted focusing on eccentric training for the age group 65–87 years of age showed that, over 12 weeks, they had strengthened their knee extensors by up to 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Aging%2C+functional+capacity+and+eccentric+exercise+training&amp;rft.jtitle=Aging+and+disease&amp;rft.au=Gault%2C+Mandy+L&amp;rft.au=Willems%2C+Mark+E+T&amp;rft.date=2013&amp;rft.eissn=2152-5250&amp;rft.volume=4&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=351&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/24307968&amp;rft.externalDocID=24307968&amp;paramdict=en-US|title = Aging, Functional Capacity and Eccentric Exercise Training|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this evidence, it is reasonable to suggest that negative repetitions can help improve the health of older adults.

== Treatment of Tendinopathy ==
Studies have shown that eccentric training may be successful in the treatment of certain [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]].

{{Wiktionary|paramountcy}}
== Federalist law ==
The doctrine of '''paramountcy''' is the legal principle that reconciles contradicting or conflicting laws in a [[Federalism|federalist]] state, where both the central government, and the provincial or state governments, have the power to create laws in relation to the same matters. In a case where both central and state law exist, central laws will be given priority over state laws through the doctrine of [[Supremacy_Clause|supremacy]]. This is usually applied in cases of post-colonial [[indirect rule]].

== Historical systems ==
In feudalism, paramountcy is a matter of [[Suzerainty]], generally vested in a sovereign Monarch, as the summit of a vassallic pyramid of subject entities.
 
Thus the Mughal badshah (emperor) was the overlord, directly or indirectly, of many native [[princely states]] in pre-colonial India.

In the colonial age and system, paramountcy could similarly be vested in (the crown) of the colonizing imperial power, insofar as it practices [[indirect rule]] over native rulers, but could also be delegated to [[chartered company]].
 
Thus the [[British paramountcy]] in [[British India]] over its [[princely states]] (first by the chartered [[British East India Company]], later by the Colonial Office of the British imperial government) replaced or imitated the Mughal overlordship over a similar, growing list of native states, while some would be annexed. Similarly, the Dutch (first the [[VOIC]], later the government) assumed suzerain paramountcy over the native rulers in the [[Dutch East Indies]].

{{Certainty}}
A '''proof''' is  [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] [[evidence]] or a sufficient [[argument]] for the [[truth]] of a [[proposition]].&lt;ref&gt;''Proof and other dilemmas: mathematics and philosophy'' by [[Bonnie Gold]], Roger A. Simons 2008 {{ISBN|0883855674}} pages 12–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Papers, Volume 2'' by Imre Lakatos, John Worrall, Gregory Currie, ISBN Philosophical Papers, Volume 2 by Imre Lakatos, John Worrall, Gregory Currie 1980 {{ISBN|0521280303}} pages 60–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Evidence, proof, and facts: a book of sources'' by Peter Murphy 2003 {{ISBN|0199261954}} pages 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Logic in Theology – And Other Essays'' by Isaac Taylor 2010 {{ISBN|1445530139}} pages 5–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept applies in a variety of disciplines,&lt;ref&gt;
Compare {{Bibleverse|1 Thessalonians|5:21|KJV}}: "Prove all things [...]."
&lt;/ref&gt;
with both the nature of the evidence or justification and the criteria for sufficiency being area-dependent. In the area of oral and written [[communication]] such as [[conversation]], [[dialog]], [[rhetoric]], etc., a proof is a [[persuasive]] [[perlocutionary act|perlocutionary]] [[speech act]], which demonstrates the truth of a proposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Langshaw Austin]]: ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]''. Cambridge (Mass.) 1962 – Paperback: [[Harvard University Press]], 2nd edition, 2005, {{ISBN|0-674-41152-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In any area of [[mathematics]] defined by its assumptions or [[axioms]], a proof is an argument establishing a [[theorem]] of that area via accepted [[rules of inference]] starting from those axioms and from other previously established theorems.&lt;ref&gt;Cupillari, Antonella. The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs. Academic Press, 2001. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject of [[logic]], in particular [[proof theory]], formalizes and studies the notion of [[formal proof]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences (ed. Jan Tarski). 4th Edition. Oxford Logic Guides, No. 24. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994, xxiv + 229 pp. {{ISBN|0-19-504472-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some areas of [[theory of justification|epistemology]] and [[existence of god|theology]], the notion of [[Theory of justification|justification]] plays approximately the role of proof,&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[jurisprudence]] the corresponding term is [[evidence (law)|evidence]],&lt;ref&gt;
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/proof
&lt;/ref&gt;
with "burden of proof" as a concept common to both [[philosophic burden of proof|philosophy]] and [[legal burden of proof|law]].

==On proof==
In most disciplines, evidence is required to prove something. Evidence is drawn from experience of the world around us, with [[science]] obtaining its evidence from [[nature (science)|nature]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman00.pdf/$file/sciman00.pdf Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence], 2nd Ed. (2000), p. 71. Accessed May 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; law obtaining its evidence from [[witness]]es and [[forensics|forensic investigation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Henry Wigmore]], ''A Treatise on the System of  Evidence in Trials at Common Law,'' 2nd ed., Little, Brown, and Co., Boston, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.   A notable exception is mathematics, whose proofs are drawn from a mathematical world begun with axioms and further developed and enriched by theorems proved earlier.

Exactly what evidence is sufficient to prove something is also strongly area-dependent, usually with no absolute threshold of sufficiency at which evidence becomes proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3052837 |author1=Simon, Rita James |author2=Mahan, Linda.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1971 | title = Quantifying Burdens of Proof—A View from the Bench, the Jury, and the Classroom| journal = Law and Society Review | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 319–330 | jstor = 3052837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valpo.edu/mcs/pdf/ReasonableDoubtFinal.pdf |format=PDF|title=Distributions of Interest for Quantifying Reasonable Doubt and Their Applications |accessdate=2007-01-14 |author1=Katie Evans |author2=David Osthus |author3=Ryan G.

Pruss&lt;/ref&gt; In law, the same evidence that may convince one [[jury]] may not persuade another.  [[Formal proof]] provides the main exception, where the criteria for proofhood are ironclad and it is impermissible to defend any step in the reasoning as "obvious" (except for the necessary ability of the one proving and the one being proven to, to correctly identify any symbol used in the proof.);&lt;ref&gt;[[A. S. Troelstra]], H. Schwichtenberg (1996). ''Basic Proof Theory''.  In series ''Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-77911-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[well-formed formula]] to qualify as part of a formal proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus of some [[formal system]] to the previous well-formed formulae in the proof sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Geoffrey, Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic, University of California Pres, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs have been presented since antiquity. [[Aristotle]] used the observation that patterns of nature never display the machine-like uniformity of [[determinism]] as proof that [[chance (Ancient Greek concept)|chance]] is an inherent part of nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle's Physics: a Guided Study'', Joe Sachs, 1995 {{ISBN|0813521920}} p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Thomas Aquinas]] used the observation of the existence of [[law of nature (science)|rich patterns in nature]] as proof that nature is ''not'' ruled by chance.&lt;ref&gt;''The treatise on the divine nature: Summa theologiae I'', 1–13, by Saint Thomas Aquinas, Brian J. Shanley, 2006 {{ISBN|0872208052}} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs need not be verbal.  Before [[Copernicus]], people took the apparent motion of the [[Sun]] across the sky as proof that [[geocentric model|the Sun went round the Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution, pp. 5–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Suitably incriminating evidence left at the scene of a [[crime]] may serve as proof of the identity of the perpetrator.  Conversely, a verbal entity need not assert a proposition to constitute a proof of that proposition.  For example, a [[signature]] constitutes direct proof of [[authorship]]; less directly, [[handwriting analysis]] may be submitted as proof of authorship of a document.&lt;ref&gt;''Trial tactics by Stephen A. Saltzburg, 2007 {{ISBN|159031767X}} page 47&lt;/ref&gt;  [[secret|Privileged information]] in a document can serve as proof that the document's author had access to that information; such access might in turn establish the location of the author at certain time, which might then provide the author with an [[alibi]].

A '''rate gyro''' is a type of [[gyroscope]], which rather than indicating direction, indicates the rate of change of angle with time. If a gyro has only one gimbal ring, with consequently only one plane of freedom, it can be adapted for use as a rate gyro to measure a rate of angular movement.

Rate gyros are used in [[rate integrating gyroscope]]s, and in [[attitude control system]]s for vehicles, and in combination with other sensors to make [[inertial navigation system]]s.

The advantage of rate gyros over other types of gyros is the fast response rate and their relatively low cost.

==Principles==

===Spinning===
The traditional type of rate gyro employs relatively conventional gyroscopes with viscous couplings to transfer the spin rate to allow it to be read.

===Vibrating structure gyroscope===
{{main|Vibrating structure gyroscope}}
MEMS gyros are cheap and have no moving parts. They often work by sonic resonance effects driven by [[piezoelectric]] transducers, that provide a signal when a rotation occurs.

The '''right to homeland''' is according to some legal scholars a universal [[human right]], which is derived from the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], including its Article 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alfred-Maurice |last=de Zayas |title=International Law and Mass Population Transfers |journal=Harvard International Law Journal |year=1975 |pages=207–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alfred-Maurice |last=de Zayas |title=The Right to One's Homeland, Ethnic Cleansing and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |journal=Criminal Law Journal |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept evolved in German jurisprudence and is recognized in German constitutional law to a certain degree. Notable proponents of the concept include legal scholars [[Kurl Rabl]], [[Rudolf Laun]], [[Otto Kimminich]], [[Dieter Blumenwitz]], [[Felix Ermacora]] and [[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]. The concept is relevant to debates concerning [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe after [[World War II]] (notably of Germans and Hungarians), ethnic cleansing in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Cyprus]] and other areas.

[[File:Salón de Mayo 1967. Havana. Cuba.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Salón de Mayo Billboard_1967. Havana. Cuba]]
The '''Salón de Mayo''' (May Salon) was an art exhibition held in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], in July 1967. It took its name from the [[Salon de Mai]], an artists collective founded during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]]. It was organized by [[Carlos Franqui]] with the assistance of such artists as [[Wifredo Lam]], [[René Portocarrero]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Pablo Picasso]].

The exhibition presented works by more than a hundred artists and represented rival schools of twentieth-century art: early modernists (Picasso, Miro, Magritte); the next generation (Lam, Calder, [[Jacques Hérold]], [[Stanley Hayter]]); and postwar ([[Asger Jorn]], [[Antonio Saura]], [[Jorge Soto (artist)|Jorge Soto]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982 |date=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA154&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lam wrote to Franqui in anticipation of the event of his hopes:
{{quote|...that young painters and sculptors would be able to work in a socialist country such as Cuba and enjoy the spontaneity of creating something so that they would have memories of the pleasure they experienced working in Cuba just for the sake of working.}}
Some artists were invited to create works in Cuba in the weeks preceding the exhibition, with those works donated to the Cuban government to form the nucleus of the collection of a contemporary art museum. The museum was never constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982| page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA161&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative engagement was a principle theme of the event. On 19 July 1967, more than eighty artists and writers contributed to a mural, ''Cuba colectiva'', in front of the Cuba Pavilion in Havana, adding either images or text inside spiral bands that circled outward from a central image of "rhomboid heads" by Lam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982|pages=155–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA155&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Paris newspaper described the event:&lt;ref name=sims156&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA156&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...with a speed that is typically Cuban, a giant white canvas was hung in the outdoors, practically in the street, in the humid night air of the tropics ... It had the feel of a somewhat surrealist magic ceremony which was celebrated in the midst of a popular festival. Although not a drop of alcohol was consumed, the event was intoxicating}}
In Franqui's words the enterprise represented:&lt;ref name=sims156/&gt;
{{quote|a collective art, a socialist art, an art of liberty, of revolution, imaginative, convulsive, revolutionary, popular ... For the first time, during the night, revolutionary artists and the people created an imaginative reality.}}
The [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] had dreamed of "a revolutionary imagination that could support social change" and this event, in the estimation of one art historian, "delivered the opportunity for Surrealist adherents to participate satisfactorily–if only briefly–in an act of solidarity with an actual revolutionary regime ... that accommodated both sensuality and revolutionary rectitude."&lt;ref name=sims156/&gt; The radical poet [[Alain Jouffroy]] wrote:&lt;ref name=sims156/&gt;
{{quote|The Collective Mural of Cuba represents a new cultural and historical reality through which the individual unconscious is for the first time in direct dialogue with the collective political conscious. The ideology of Che [Guevara] was present, as well as a sensuality, a festiveness, a delirium, a tenderness, friendship ... and it is enough that the Cuban revolution set the context in which revolutionary artists and intellectuals met, where hope for a reconciliation of the subversive imagination and revolutionary political reason become a reality. The riskiest venture for man today, which would allow him to communicate most directly with pleasure and death, is to participate in and dedicate himself to revolution.}}
The Salón was a unique event under a regime that, in the words of a writer who was later imprisoned, "used every imaginable pretext to keep culture on a short leash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Padilla|first1=Herberto|title=Self-Portrait of the Other: A Memoir|date=1990|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_pGtjnmLy4C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a demonstration of vigorous self-expression, the Salón de Mayo has also been interpreted as a rejection of the Soviet Union's approach to artistic endeavor, an assertion on the part of Communist Cuba of its independence from the Soviet model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Horowitz|first1=Irving Louis|title=Cuban Communism|date=1988|publisher=Transaction Books|page=462 |edition=Sixth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hx2_y7Vu-PUC&amp;pg=PA462&amp;|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Cuba, the Salón de Mayo represented the high point of free artistic expression. Some in Cuba's cultural establishment resented the influence of foreigners and visiting intellectuals, and they took measures soon after it against writers identified as dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson |first1=Stephen|title=Detective Fiction in Cuban Society and Culture|date=2006|publisher=Peter Lang AG|pages=72ff. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkRJ77zp6ToC&amp;pg=PA72&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban government released a series of [[commemorative stamps]] that depicted 25 of the works included in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982 |page=254 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA254&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-image''' is the mental picture, generally of a kind that is quite resistant to change, that depicts not only details that are potentially available to objective investigation by others (height, weight, hair color, etc.), but also items that have been learned by that person about themself, either from personal experiences or by [[Internalization#Psychology and sociology|internalizing]] the judgments of others.

Self-image may consist of four types:
# Self-image resulting from how an individual sees oneself.
# Self-image resulting from how others see the individual.
# Self-image resulting from how the individual perceives others see them.
# Self-image resulting from how the individual perceives the individual sees oneself.

These four types may or may not be an accurate representation of the person. All, some or none of them may be true.

A more technical term for self-image that is commonly used by social and cognitive psychologists is '''[[self-schema]]'''. Like any [[schema (psychology)|schema]], self-schemas store information and influence the way we think and remember. For example, research indicates that information which refers to the self is preferentially encoded and recalled in memory tests, a phenomenon known as "[[self-referential encoding]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T.B., Kuiper, N.A., Kirker, W.S. (1977) Self-Reference and the Encoding of Personal Information, ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''35'', 677-688.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-schemas are also considered the traits people use to define themselves, they draw information about the self into a coherent scheme.&lt;ref name=Schacter&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|title=Psychology 2nd Ed.|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L.|title=Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|pages=494|edition=2|author2=Daniel T. Gilbert |author3=Daniel M. Wegner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poor self-image==

Poor self-image may be the result of accumulated criticisms that the person collected as a child which have led to damaging their own view of themselves. Children in particular are vulnerable to accepting negative judgments from authority figures because they have yet to develop competency in evaluating such reports. Also, adolescents are highly targeted to suffer from poor body image issues. Individuals that already exhibit a low-sense of self-worth may be vulnerable to develop social disorders.

Negative self-images can arise from a variety of factors. A prominent factor, however, is personality type. [[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionists]], high achievers, and those with "[[Type A personality|type A]]" personalities seem to be prone to having negative self-images.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Ronald B., Lawrence B. Rosenfeld, and Russell F. Proctor, II. Interplay: The Process of Interpersonal Communication, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because such people constantly set the standard for success high above a reasonable, attainable level. Thus, they are constantly disappointed in this "failure."

Another factor that contributes to a negative self-image is the beauty values of the society in which a person lives. In the American society, a popular beauty ideal is thinness. Oftentimes, girls feel that they do not measure up to society's "thin" standards, which leads to them having a negative self-image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/factors-may-contribute-eating-disorders]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
When people are in the position of evaluating others, self-image maintenance processes can lead to a more negative evaluation depending on the self-image of the evaluator. That is to say [[prejudice|stereotyping and prejudice]] may be the way individuals maintain their self-image. When individuals evaluate a member of a stereotyped group, they are less likely to evaluate that person negatively if their self-images had been bolstered through a self-affirmation procedure, and they are more likely to evaluate that person stereotypically if their self-images have been threatened by negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, S., &amp; Spencer, S.J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 73(1), 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may restore their self-esteem by derogating the member of a stereotyped group.&lt;ref&gt;Florack, A., Scarabis, M., &amp; Gosejohann, S. (2005). The Effects of Self-Image Threat on the Judgment of Out-Group Targets. Swiss Journal of Psychology 64(2), 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fein and Spencer (1997) conducted a study on Self-image Maintenance and Discriminatory Behavior. This study showed evidence that increased prejudice can result from a person's need to redeem a threatened positive perception of the self. The aim of the study was to test whether a particular threat to the self would instigate increased stereotyping and lead to actual discriminatory behavior or tendencies towards a member of a "''negatively''" stereotyped group. 
The study began when Fein and Spencer gave participants an ostensible test of intelligence. Some of them received negative feedback, and others, positive and supportive feedback. In the second half of the experiment, the participants were asked to evaluate another person who either belonged to a ''negatively stereotyped group'', or one who did not. 
The results of the experiment proved that the participants who had previously received unfavorable comments on their test, evaluated the target of the ''negatively stereotyped group'' in a more antagonistic or opposing way, than the participants who were given excellent reports on their intelligence test. They concluded that the negative feedback on the test threatened the participants' self-image and they evaluated the target in a more negative manner, all in efforts to restore their own self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, S. &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 73, 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

A present study extends the studies of Fein and Spencer in which the principal behavior examined was avoidance behavior.  In the study, Macrae et al. (2004) found that participants that had a salient negative stereotype of "skinheads" attached, physically placed themselves further from a skinhead target compared to those in which the stereotype was not as apparent.  Therefore, greater salience of a negative stereotype led participants to show more stereotype-consistent behavior towards the target.&lt;ref&gt;Macrae (1994).  Self-image Maintenance and Discriminatory Behavior. ''Revue internationale de psychologie sociale'', 153-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residual==
'''Residual self-image''' is the concept that individuals tend to think of [[Self (psychology)|themselves]] as projecting a certain [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]],&lt;ref&gt;''Literature and Psychology'' No. 4, Vol. 49; Pg. 43; ISSN 0024-4759.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Lankton, Carol H. Lankton,  ''Enchantment and Intervention in Family Therapy'' (1986), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; or certain position of social entitlement, or lack thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Kum-Kum Bhavnani, [[Ann Phoenix]], ''Shifting Identities, Shifting Racisms: A Feminism &amp; Psychology Reader (1994), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used at least as early as 1968,&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association: Volume 16'', Issues 3-4 (1968), p. 594. (stating "Women remain 'depriving competitors,' and the residual self image is 'I don't have the equipment to attract men.'")&lt;/ref&gt; but was popularized in fiction by the [[The Matrix (series)|''Matrix'' series]], where persons who existed in a digitally created world would subconsciously maintain the physical appearance that they had become accustomed to projecting.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Lawrence, ''Like a Splinter in Your Mind: The Philosophy Behind the Matrix'' (2004), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victimisation==
Victims of [[abuse]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] often get trapped into a self-image of [[victimisation]]. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, [[locus of control|loss of control]], [[pessimism]], negative thinking, strong feelings of self-guilt, [[shame]], [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's disparity==
Self-image disparity was found to be positively related to chronological age (CA) and intelligence, two factors thought to increase concomitantly with maturity: Capacity for guilt and ability for cognitive differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, P., &amp; Zigler, E. (1967). Self-image Disparity: A Developmental Approach. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 5(2), 186-195.&lt;/ref&gt; However, males had larger self-image disparities than females, Caucasians had larger disparities and higher ideal self images than African Americans, and socioeconomic status (SES) affected self-images differentially for the 2nd and 5th graders.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D.A., &amp; Zigler, E.F. (1980). Children's self-image disparity: Effects of age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 39(4), 689-700.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengtheners===
A child's self-awareness of who they are differentiates into three categories around the age of five: their social self, academic persona, and physical attributes. Several ways to strengthen a child's self-image include communication, reassurance, support of hobbies, and finding good role models.&lt;ref&gt;Bourland, Julia. Parenting13. 4 (May 1999): 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolved awareness in mirror==
When does a child become aware that the image in a mirror is their own? Research was done on 88 children between 3 and 24 months.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam, B. (1972). Mirror self-image reactions before age two. Developmental Psychobiology. 5(4), 297-305.&lt;/ref&gt; Their behaviors were observed before a mirror. The results indicated that children's awareness of self-image followed three major age-related sequences:  
* From about 6 through 12 months of age, the first prolonged and repeated reaction of an infant to their mirror image is that of a sociable “playmate”. 
* In the second year of life, wariness and withdrawal appeared; self-admiring and embarrassed behavior accompanied those avoidance behaviors starting at 14 months, and was shown by 75% of the subjects after 20 months of age. 
* During the last part of the second year of life, from 20 to 24 months of age, 65% of the subjects demonstrated recognition of their mirror images.

==Physical activity==
Regular practice of endurance exercise was related to a more favourable self-image. There was a strong association between participation in sports and the type of personality that tends to be resistant to drug and alcohol addiction. Physical exercise was further significantly related to scores for physical and psychological well-being. Adolescents who engaged regularly in physical activity were characterised by lower anxiety-depression scores, and displayed much less social behavioural inhibition than their less active counterparts.

It is likely that discussion of recreational or exercise involvement may provide a useful point of entry for facilitating dialogue among adolescents about concerns relating to body image and self-esteem. In terms of psychotherapeutic applications, physical activity has many additional rewards for adolescents. It is probable that by promoting physical fitness, increased physical performance, lessening body mass and promoting a more favourable body shape and structure, exercise will provide more positive social feedback and recognition from peer groups, and this will subsequently lead to improvement in an individual's self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkcaldy, B.D., Shephard, R.J., Siefen, R.G. (2002) The relationship between physical activity and self-image and problem behaviour among adolescents. Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology. 37(11), 544-550.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automatic activation of stereotypes and threat==
Does self-image threatening feedback make perceivers more likely to activate stereotypes when confronted by members of a minority group? Participants in Study 1 saw an Asian American or European American woman for several minutes, and participants in Studies 2 and 3 were exposed to drawings of an African American or European American male face for fractions of a second. These experiments found no evidence of automatic stereotype activation when perceivers were cognitively busy and when they had not received negative feedback. When perceivers had received negative feedback, however, evidence of stereotype activation emerged even when perceivers were cognitively busy.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, S.J., Fein, S., Wolfe, C.T., Fong, C., Duinn, M.A. (1998) Automatic Activation of Stereotypes: The Role of Self-Image Threat. Personality and social psychology bulletin. 24(11), 1139-1152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's sexual behavior==
A magazine survey that included items about body image, self-image, and sexual behaviors was completed by 3,627 women. The study found that overall self-image and body image are significant predictors of sexual activity. Women more satisfied with body image reported more sexual activity, orgasm, and initiating sex, greater comfort undressing in front of their partner, having sex with the lights on, trying new sexual behaviors (e.g. anal sex), and pleasing their partner sexually than those dissatisfied. Positive body image was inversely related to self-consciousness and importance of physical attractiveness, and positively related to relationships with others and overall satisfaction. Body image was predictive only of one's comfort undressing in front of partner and having sex with lights on. Overall satisfaction was predictive of frequency of sex, orgasm, and initiating sex, trying new sexual behaviors, and confidence in giving partner sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Ackard, D.M., Kearney-Cooke, A., Peterson, C.B. (2000) Effect of body image and self-image on women's sexual behaviors. International Journal of Eating Disorders. 28(4), 422-429.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men's sexual behavior==

One hundred and ten heterosexual individuals (67 men; 43 women) responded to questions related to penis size and satisfaction. Men showed significant dissatisfaction with penile size, despite perceiving themselves to be of average size. Importantly, there were significant relationships between penile dissatisfaction and comfort with others seeing their penis, and with likelihood of seeking medical advice with regard to penile and/or sexual function. Given the negative consequences of low body satisfaction and the importance of early intervention in sexually related illnesses (e.g., testicular cancer), it is imperative that attention be paid to male body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Lucy, Tracey McLellan, and Audrey McKinlay. 2014. "(Perceived) Size Really Does Matter: Male Dissatisfaction With Penis Size." Psychology Of Men &amp; Masculinity 15, no. 2: 225-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sensation''' is the [[fiction-writing mode]] for portraying a character's perception of the senses.  According to [[Ron Rozelle]], "...the success of your story or novel will depend on many things, but the most crucial is your ability to bring your reader into it.  And that reader will be most completely in when you deliver the actual sensations of the many things that comprise your story" {{Harvard citation | Rozelle | 2005 | p =76 }}. As stated by  [[Jessica Page Morrell]], "You breathe life into fiction by translating the senses onto the page, producing stories rooted in the physical world ... that creates a tapestry, a galaxy of interwoven sensory ingredients." {{Harvard citation | Morrell | 2006 | p = 172}}

Also according to Rozelle, "The sensation of what something feels like is used to describe everything from sensual pleasure to pain and torture.  It's a wide range, and your readers have actually experienced only some of those feelings.  So your job is to either make them recall exactly what it feels like when something occurs in your story or, if they haven't experienced it, what it would feel like if they did" {{Harvard citation | Rozelle | 2005 | p = 86}}.   Morrell describes a "sensory surround", which when "coupled with drama tugs the reader into [the] story and forces him to keep reading." {{Harvard citation | Morrell | 2006 | p = 173}} 

The importance of conveying sensation in fiction is widely accepted.  However, recognition of sensation as a distinct fiction-writing mode is a matter of discussion.

In [[pedagogy]] and theoretical syntax, a '''sentence diagram''' or ''[[parse tree]]'' is a pictorial representation of the [[grammar|grammatical]] structure of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. The term "sentence diagram" is used more in pedagogy, where sentences are ''diagrammed''. The term "parse tree" is used in linguistics (especially computational linguistics), where sentences are ''[[Parsing|parsed]]''. Their purposes are to demonstrate the structure of sentences. The model is informative about the relations between words and the nature of syntactic structure and is thus used as a tool to help predict which sentences are and are not possible.

== History ==
Most methods of diagramming in pedagogy are based on the work of Alonzo Reed and [[Brainerd Kellogg]] in their book ''Higher Lessons in English,'' first published in 1877, though the method has been updated with recent understanding of grammar. Reed and Kellogg were preceded, and their work probably informed, by W. S. Clark, who published his "balloon" method of depicting grammar in his 1847 book ''A Practical Grammar: In Which Words, Phrases &amp; Sentences are Classified According to Their Offices and Their Various Relationships to Each Another.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitty Burns Florey]] (2006) [[Sister Bernadette's Barking Dog]], [[Melville House Publishing]] {{ISBN|978-1-933633-10-7}}.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schoolteachers continue to use the Reed–Kellogg system in teaching grammar, but others have discouraged it in favor of more modern tree diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/2003-12-15.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2003.12.15 |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these modern tree structures draw on techniques that were already present in Reed–Kellogg diagrams. Reed and Kellogg defend their system in the preface to their grammar:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Objections to the Diagram.''--The fact that the pictorial diagram groups the parts of a sentence according to their offices and relations, and not in the order of speech, has been spoken of as a fault. It is, on the contrary, a merit, for it teaches the pupil to look through the literary order and discover the logical order. He thus learns what the literary order really is, and sees that this may be varied indefinitely, so long as the logical relations are kept clear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The assertion that correct diagrams can be made mechanically is not borne out by the facts. It is easier to avoid precision in oral analysis than in written. The diagram drives the pupil to a most searching examination of the sentence, brings him face to face with every difficulty, and compels a decision on every point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These statements bear witness to the fact that Reed–Kellogg diagrams abstract away from actual word order in order to focus more intently on how words in sentences function and relate to each other.

==Reed–Kellogg system==

Simple sentences in the Reed–Kellogg system are diagrammed according to these forms:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram1.jpg|Basic Reed–Kellogg schema]]
	 
The diagram of a simple sentence begins with a horizontal line called the ''base''. The [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is written on the left, the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] on the right, separated by a vertical bar which extends through the base. The predicate must contain a [[verb]], and the verb either requires other sentence elements to complete the predicate, permits them to do so, or precludes them from doing so. The verb and its [[object (grammar)|object]], when present, are separated by a line that ends at the baseline. If the object is a [[direct object]], the line is vertical. If the object is a [[subject complement|predicate noun]] or [[predicate adjective|adjective]], the line looks like a [[backslash]], \, sloping toward the subject.

[[Grammatical modifier|Modifiers]] of the subject, predicate, or object are placed below the base line:

::[[File:Examples of Reed-Kellogg diagrams.jpg|Full Reed–Kellogg examples]]

Modifiers, such as [[adjective]]s (including articles) and [[adverb]]s, are placed on slanted lines below the word they modify. Prepositional phrases are also placed beneath the word they modify; the preposition goes on a slanted line and the slanted line leads to a horizontal line on which the object of the preposition is placed.

These basic diagramming conventions are augmented for other types of sentence structures, e.g. for [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[dependent clause|subordinate clauses]].

==Constituency and dependency==
The connections to modern principles for constructing parse trees are present in the Reed–Kellogg diagrams, although Reed and Kellogg understood such principles only implicitly. The principles are now regarded as the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s and the dependency relation of [[dependency grammar]]s. These two relations are illustrated here adjacent to each other for comparison:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram3.jpg|Constituency and dependency]]

::(D = Determiner, N = Noun, NP = Noun Phrase, S = Sentence, V = Verb, VP = Verb Phrase)

[[Image:Xbarst1.svg|thumb|X-bar theory graph of the sentence ''He studies linguistics at the university.'' IP = Inflectional phrase.]]

Constituency is a one-to-one-or-more relation; every word in the sentence corresponds to one or more nodes in the tree diagram. Dependency, in contrast, is a one-to-one relation; every word in the sentence corresponds to exactly one node in the tree diagram. Both parse trees employ the convention where the category acronyms (e.g. N, NP, V, VP) are used as the labels on the nodes in the tree. The one-to-one-or-more constituency relation is capable of increasing the amount of sentence structure to the upper limits of what is possible. The result can be very "tall" trees, such as those associated with [[X-bar theory]]. Both constituency-based and dependency-based theories of grammar have established traditions.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1957"&gt;Chomsky, N. 1957. Syntactic structures. The Hague/Paris: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tesniere 1959"&gt;Tesnière, L. 1959. Éleménts de syntaxe structurale. Paris: Klincksieck.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed–Kellogg diagrams employ both of these modern tree generating relations. The constituency relation is present in the Reed–Kellogg diagrams insofar as subject, verb, object, and/or predicate are placed equi-level on the horizontal base line of the sentence and divided by a vertical or slanted line. In a Reed–Kellogg diagram, the vertical dividing line that crosses the base line corresponds to the binary division in the constituency-based tree (S → NP + VP), and the second vertical dividing line that does not cross the baseline (between verb and object) corresponds to the binary division of VP into verb and direct object (VP → V + NP). Thus the vertical and slanting lines that cross or rest on the baseline correspond to the constituency relation. The dependency relation, in contrast, is present insofar as modifiers dangle off of or appear below the words that they modify.

==Hybrid trees==
One can render Reed–Kellogg diagrams according to modern tree conventions. When one does so, the result is a hybrid dependency-constituency tree. The Reed–Kellogg diagrams above appear as the following trees:

::[[File:Sentence-diagram4.jpg|Hybrid trees]]

A mixing of labeling conventions (i.e. category label vs. actual word) helps draw attention to the presence of both constituency and dependency. The S and VP in these trees mark the constituency relation and the words themselves mark the dependency relation. A major difference between these hybrid trees and the Reed–Kellogg diagrams, however, is that the hybrid trees encode actual word order, whereas the Reed–Kellogg diagrams are abstracting away from actual word order in order to focus more on function.

==Functional breakdown==
A sentence may also be broken down by functional parts: subject, object, adverbial, verb (predicator).&lt;ref&gt;B. Arts and L. Haegerman, English Word Classes and Phrases in The Handbook of English Linguistics, Wiley– Blackewell, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is the owner of an action, the verb represents the action, the object represents the recipient of the action, and the adverbial qualifies the action. The various parts can be phrases rather than individual words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34786">'''Stimulus modality''', also called '''sensory modality''', is one aspect of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] or what is perceived after a stimulus. For example, the temperature modality  is registered after heat or cold stimulate a receptor. Some sensory modalities include: [[light]], [[sound]], [[temperature]], [[taste]], [[pressure]], and [[Olfaction|smell]]. The type and location of the [[sensory receptor]] activated by the stimulus plays the primary role in coding the sensation. All sensory modalities work together to heighten stimuli sensation when necessary.&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt;

== Multimodal perception ==
Multimodal perception is the ability of the mammalian nervous system to combine all of the different inputs of the [[sensory nervous system]] to result in an enhanced detection or identification of a particular stimulus. Combinations of all sensory modalities are done in cases where a single sensory modality results in ambiguous and incomplete result.&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt;

[[File:Multisensory.jpg|thumb|Location of visual, auditory and somatosensory perception in the superior colliculus of the brain. Overlapping of these systems creates multisensory space.]]

Integration of all sensory modalities occurs when multimodal neurons receive sensory information which overlaps with different modalities. Multimodal neurons are found in the superior colliculus;&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt; they respond to the versatility of various sensory inputs. The multimodal neurons lead to change of behavior and assist in analyzing behavior responses to certain stimulus.&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt; Information from two or more [[sense]]s is encountered. Multimodal perception is not limited to one area of the brain: many brain regions are activated when sensory information is perceived from the environment.&lt;ref name = "ivry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ivry|first=Richard|title=Cognitive Neuroscience:  The biology of the mind|year=2009|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-92795-5|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the hypothesis of having a centralized multisensory region is receiving continually more speculation, as several regions previously uninvestigated are now considered multimodal. The reasons behind this are currently being investigated by several research groups, but it is now understood to approach these issues from a decentralized theoretical perspective. Moreover, several labs using invertebrate model organisms will provide invaluable information to the community as these are more easily studied and are considered to have decentralized nervous systems.

===Lip reading===
[[Lip reading]] is a multimodal process for humans.&lt;ref name = "ivry"/&gt; By watching movements of lips and face, humans get conditioned and practice lip reading.&lt;ref name = "ivry"/&gt; Silent lip reading activates the [[auditory cortex]].  When sounds are matched or mismatched with the movements of the lips, temporal sulcus of the left hemisphere becomes more active.&lt;ref name = "ivry"/&gt;

===Integration effect===
Multimodal [[perception]] comes into effect when a unimodal stimulus fails to produce a response. Integration effect is applied when the brain detects weak unimodal signals and combines them to create a multimodal perception for the [[mammal]].  Integration effect is plausible when different stimuli are coincidental. This integration is depressed when multisensory information are not coincidentally presented.&lt;ref name = "ivry"/&gt;

===Polymodality===
''Polymodality'' is the feature of a single receptor of responding to multiple modalities, such as [[free nerve endings]] which can respond to temperature, mechanical stimuli (touch, pressure, stretch) or pain ([[nociception]]).

==Light modality==

[[File:Schematic diagram of the human eye en.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of the human eye.]]

===Description===
The stimulus modality for vision is light; the human eye is able to access only a limited section of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], between 380 and 760 [[nanometre]]s.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=J.P|author2=Wolfe, S.L. |author3=Hertz, P.E. |author4=Starr, C. |author5=Fenton, M. B. |author6=Addy, H. |author7=Denis, M. |author8=Haffie, T. |author9=Davey, K.   |title=Biology: Exploring the Diversity of Life, First Canadian Edition, Volume Three|year=2010|publisher=Nelson Education|isbn=0-17-650231-9|pages=833–840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific inhibitory responses that take place in the visual cortex help create a visual focus on a specific point rather than the entire surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarbrough|first=Cathy|title=Brains response to visual stimuli helps us to focus on what we should see, rather than all there is to see|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-10/si-brt102105.php|work=EurekAlert!|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception===
To perceive a light stimulus, the [[eye]] must first refract the light so that it directly hits the [[retina]]. Refraction in the eye is completed through the combined efforts of the [[cornea]], [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The transduction of light into neural activity occurs via the [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the retina. When there is no light, [[Vitamin A]] in the body attaches itself to another molecule and becomes a protein. The entire structure consisting of the two molecules becomes a [[photopigment]]. When a particle of light hits the photoreceptors of the eye, the two molecules come apart from each other and a chain of chemical reactions occurs. The chemical reaction begins with the photoreceptor sending a message to a neuron called the [[bipolar cell]] through the use of an [[action potential]], or nerve impulse. Finally, a message is sent to the ganglion cell and then finally the brain.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=N. R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptation===
The eye is able to detect a visual stimulus when the [[photons]] (light packets) cause a photopigment molecule, primarily [[rhodopsin]], to come apart. Rhodopsin, which is usually pink, becomes bleached in the process. At high levels of light, photopigments are broken apart faster than can be regenerated. Because a low number of photopigments have been regenerated, the eyes are not sensitive to light. When entering a dark room after being in a well lit area, the eyes require time for a good quantity of rhodopsin to regenerate. As more time passes, there is a higher chance that the photons will split an unbleached photopigment because the rate of regeneration will have surpassed the rate of bleaching. This is called [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Colour stimuli===
Humans are able to see an array of colours because light in the visible spectrum is made up of different wavelengths (from 380 to 760&amp;nbsp;nm). Our ability to see in colour is due to three different [[cone cells]] in the retina, containing three different photopigments. The three cones are each specialized to best pick up a certain wavelength (420, 530 and 560&amp;nbsp;nm or roughly the colours blue, green and red). The brain is able to distinguish the wavelength and colour in the field of vision by figuring out which cone has been stimulated. The physical dimensions of colour include [[wavelength]], [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] and purity while the related perceptual dimensions include [[hue]], [[brightness]] and saturation.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

Primates are the only mammals with colour vision.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

The [[Trichromatic theory]] was proposed in 1802 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]. According to Young, the human visual system is able to create any colour through the collection of information from the three cones. The system will put together the information and systematize a new colour based on the amount of each hue that has been detected.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Subliminal visual stimuli===
Some studies show that subliminal stimuli can affect attitude. In a 1992 study Krosnick, Betz, Jussim and Lynn conducted a study where participants were shown a series of slides in which different people were going through normal every day activities (i.e. going to the car, sitting in a restaurant). These slides were preceded by slides that caused either positive emotional arousal (i.e. bridal couple, a child with a Mickey Mouse doll) or negative emotional arousal (i.e. a bucket of snakes, a face on fire) for a period 13 [[milliseconds]] that participants consciously perceived as a sudden flash of light. None of the individuals were told of the subliminal images. The experiment found that during the questionnaire round, participants were more likely to assign positive personality traits to those in the pictures that were preceded by the positive subliminal images and negative personality traits to those in the pictures that were preceded by the negative subliminal images.&lt;ref name="KrosnickAndOthers"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = J. A.| last3 = Jussim | first2 = A. L.| last1 = Krosnick | first3 = L. J.| last2 = Betz | first4 = A.

===Tests===
Some common tests that measure visual health include [[visual acuity]] tests, refraction tests, [[visual field test]]s and colour vision tests. Visual acuity tests are the most common tests and they measure the ability to bring details into focus at different distances. Usually this test is conducted by having participants read a map of letters or symbols while one eye is covered. Refraction tests measure the eye's need for glasses or [[corrective lenses]]. This test is able to detect whether a person may be [[nearsighted]] or [[farsighted]]. These conditions occur when the light rays entering the eye are unable to converge on a single spot on the [[retina]]. Both [[refractive errors]] require corrective lenses in order to cure blurriness of vision. Visual field tests detect any gaps in peripheral vision. In healthy normal vision, an individual should be able to partially perceive objects to the left or right of their field of view using both eyes at one time. The center field of vision is seen in most detail. Colour vision tests are used to measure one's ability to distinguish colours. It is used to diagnose colour blindness. This test is also used as an important step in some job screening processes as the ability to see colour in such jobs may be crucial. Examples include military work or law enforcement.&lt;ref name="vision test"&gt;{{cite web|author=Healthwise Staff|title=Vision Tests|url=http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/vision-tests|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound modality==

[[File:HumanEar.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the human ear.]]

===Description===
The stimulus modality for [[hearing]] is sound. Sound is created through changes in the pressure of the air. As an object vibrates, it compresses the surrounding molecules of air as it moves towards a given point and expands the molecules as it moves away from the point. Periodicity in sound waves is measured in [[hertz]]. Humans, on average, are able to detect sounds as pitched when they contain periodic or quasi-periodic variations that fall between the range of 30 to 20000 hertz.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Perception===
When there are vibrations in the air, the [[eardrum]] is stimulated. The eardrum collects these vibrations and sends them to receptor cells. The [[ossicles]] which are connected to the eardrum pass the vibrations to the fluid-filled [[cochlea]]. Once the vibrations reach the cochlea, the [[stirrup]] (part of the ossicles) puts pressure on the [[oval window]]. This opening allows the vibrations to move through the liquid in the cochlea where the receptive organ is able to sense it.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Pitch, loudness and timbre===
There are many different qualities in sound stimuli including [[loudness]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[timbre]].&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

The human ear is able to detect differences in pitch through the movement of auditory hair cells found on the [[basilar membrane]]. High frequency sounds will stimulate the auditory hair cells at the base of the basilar membrane while medium frequency sounds cause vibrations of auditory hair cells located at the middle of the basilar membrane. For frequencies that are lower than 200&amp;nbsp;Hz, the tip of the basilar membrane vibrates in sync with the sound waves. In turn, neurons are fired at the same rate as the vibrations. The brain is able to measure the vibrations and is then aware of any low frequency pitches.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

When a louder sound is heard, more hair cells are stimulated and the intensity of firing of [[axons]] in the [[cochlear nerve]] is increased. However, because the rate of firing also defines low pitch the brain has an alternate way of encoding for loudness of low frequency sounds. The number of hair cells that are stimulated is thought to communicate loudness in low pitch frequencies.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

Aside from pitch and loudness, another quality that distinguishes sound stimuli is timbre. Timbre allows us to hear the difference between two instruments that are playing at the same frequency and loudness, for example. When two simple tones are put together they create a complex tone. The simple tones of an instrument are called [[harmonics]] or [[overtones]]. Timbre is created by putting the harmonics together with the [[fundamental frequency]] (a sound's basic pitch). When a complex sound is heard, it causes different parts in the basilar membrane to become simultaneously stimulated and flex. In this way, different timbres can be distinguished.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Sound stimuli and human fetuses===
A number of studies have shown that a human fetus will respond to sound stimuli coming from the outside world.&lt;ref name=Sontang&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sontag | first1 = L. W. | title = Changes in the Rate of the Human Fetal Heart in Response to Vibratory Stimuli | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.1936.01970150087006 | journal = Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 583–589 | year = 1936 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Forbes | first1 = H. S. | last2 = Forbes | first2 = H. B. | doi = 10.1037/h0071872 | title = Fetal sense reaction: Hearing | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–355 | year = 1927 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of 214 tests conducted on 7 pregnant women, a reliable increase in fetal movement was detected in the minute directly following the application of a sound stimulus to the abdomen of the mother with a frequency of 120 per second.&lt;ref name=Sontang /&gt;

===Tests===
[[Hearing tests]] are administered to ensure optimal function of the ear and to observe whether or not sound stimuli is entering the ear drum and reaching the brain as should be. The most common hearing tests require the spoken response to words or [[Pitch (music)|tones]]. Some hearing tests include the whispered speech test, [[pure tone audiometry]], the tuning fork test, speech reception and word recognition tests, [[otoacoustic emission]]s (OAE) test and [[auditory brainstem response]] (ABR) test.&lt;ref name="hearing test"&gt;{{cite web|author=Healthwise Staff|title=Hearing Tests|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hearing-tests?|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a whispered speech test, the participant is asked to cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind the participant and say a series of words in a soft whisper. The participant is then asked to repeat what is heard. If the participant is unable to distinguish the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until the participant is able to understand what is being said. The other ear is then tested.&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

In [[pure tone audiometry]], an [[audiometer]] is used to play a series of tones using headphones. The participants listen to the tones which will vary in pitch and loudness. The test will play with the volume controls and the participant is asked to signal when he or she can no longer hear the tone being played. The testing is completed after listening to a range of pitches. Each ear is tested individually.&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

During the tuning fork test, the tester will have the [[tuning fork]] vibrate so that it makes a sound. The tuning fork is placed in a specific place around the participant and hearing is observed. In some instances, individuals will show trouble hearing in places such as behind the ear.&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

Speech recognition and word recognition tests measure how well an individual can hear normal day-to-day conversation. The participant is told to repeat conversation being spoken at different volumes. The spondee threshold test is a related test that detects the loudness at which the participant is able to repeat half of a list of two syllable words or [[spondee (grammar)|spondees]].&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

[[Otoacoustic emission]]s test (OAE) and [[auditory brainstem response]] (ABR) testing measures the brain's response to sounds. The OAE measures hearing of newborns by placing an emitting sound into the baby's ear through a probe. A microphone placed in the baby's [[ear canal]] will pick up the inner ear's response to sound stimulation and allows for observation. The ABR, also known as the [[Brainstem auditory evoked potentials|brainstem auditory evoked response]] (BAER) test or auditory brainstem evoked potential (ABEP) test measure the brain's response to clicking sounds sent through headphones. [[Electrodes]] on the scalp and earlobes record a graph of the response.&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

==Taste modality==

===Description===

==== Taste modality in mammals ====
In mammals, taste stimuli are encountered by axonless receptor cells located in [[taste bud]]s on the tongue and
[[pharynx]]. Receptor cells disseminate onto different [[neuron]]s and convey the message of a particular taste in a single medullar nucleus. This [[pheromone]] detection system deals with taste stimuli.  The pheromone detection system is distinct from the normal taste system, and is designed like the [[olfactory system]].&lt;ref name = "stocker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stocker|first=Reinhard F|title=Taste Perception: Drosophila – A Model of Good Taste|journal=Current Biology|date=1 July 2004|volume=14|issue=14|pages=R560–R561|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.07.011|pmid=15268874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taste modality in flies and mammals ====
In insect and mammalian taste, receptor cells changes into attractive or aversive stimulus.  The number of taste receptors in a mammalian [[tongue]] and on the tongue of the fly ([[Labellum (insect anatomy)|labellum]]) is same in amount.  Most of the receptors are dedicated to detect repulsive [[ligand]].&lt;ref name = "stocker"/&gt;

=== Perception ===
Perceptions of taste is generated by the following sensory afferents: [[gustatory]], [[olfactory]], and [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]] fibers.  Taste perception is created by combining multiple sensory inputs. Different modalities help determine perception of taste especially when attention is drawn to particular sensory characteristics which is different from taste.&lt;ref name = "small"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=Dana M.|author2=Prescott, John |title=Odor/taste integration and the perception of flavor|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 July 2005|volume=166|issue=3–4|pages=345–357|doi=10.1007/s00221-005-2376-9 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n348v0386g164un6/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration of taste and smell modality===
Impression of both taste and smell occurs in heteromodal regions of the [[limbic system|limbic]] and paralimbic brain. Taste–odor
integration occurs at earlier stages of processing. By life experience, factors such as the physiological significance of a given stimulus is perceived. Learning and affective processing are the primary functions of limbic and paralimbic brain. Taste perception is a combination of oral [[somatosensation]] and retronasal olfaction.&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt;

===Pleasure of food===
The sensation of taste come from oral somatosensory stimulation and with retronasal olfaction. The perceived pleasure encountered when eating and drinking is influenced by:
# sensory features, such as taste quality
# experience, such as prior exposure to taste-odor mixtures
# internal state
# cognitive context, such as information about brand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=SMALL|first=D. M.|author2=BENDER, G. |author3=VELDHUIZEN, M. G. |author4=RUDENGA, K. |author5=NACHTIGAL, D. |author6= FELSTED, J. |title=The Role of the Human Orbitofrontal Cortex in Taste and Flavor Processing|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=10 September 2007|volume=1121|issue=1|pages=136–151|doi=10.1196/annals.1401.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature modality==

===Description===

Temperature modality excites or elicits a symptom through cold or hot temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperature modality|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/temperature+modality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different mammalian species have different temperature modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bodenheimer|first=F. S|title=Observations on Rodents in Herter's Temperature Gradient|journal=Physiological Zoology|jstor=30161738|volume=14|pages=186–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception===

The [[cutaneous]] somatosensory system detects changes in temperature.  The perception begins when thermal stimuli from a [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] set-point excite temperature specific sensory nerves in the skin. Then with the help of sensing range, specific thermosensory fibers respond to warmth and to cold. Then specific cutaneous cold and warm receptors conduct units that exhibit a discharge at constant skin temperature.&lt;ref name = "mcglone"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGlone|first=Francis|author2=Reilly, David |title=The cutaneous sensory system|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=34|issue=2|pages=148–159|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nerve fibers for temperature===

Warm and cold sensitive nerve fibers differ in structure and function.  The cold-sensitive and warm-sensitive nerve fibers are underneath the skin surface.  Terminals of each temperature-sensitive fiber do not branch away to different organs in the body. They form a small sensitive point which are unique from neighboring fibers. Skin used by the single receptor ending of a temperature-sensitive nerve fiber is small.  There are 20 cold points per square centimeter in the lips, 4 in the finger, and less than 1 cold point per square centimeter in trunk areas.  There are 5 times as many cold sensitive points as warm sensitive points.&lt;ref name = "mcglone"/&gt;

==Pressure modality==

===Description===
The sense of touch, or tactile perception, is what allows organisms to feel the world around them.  The environment acts as an external stimulus, and tactile perception is the act of passively exploring the world to simply sense it.  To make sense of the stimuli, an organism will undergo active exploration, or [[haptic perception]], by moving their hands or other areas with environment-skin contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reuter E. |author2=Voelcker-Rehage C. |author3=Vieluf S. |author4=Godde B. | year = 2012 | title = Touch perception throughout working life: Effects of age and expertise | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 216 | issue = 2| pages = 287–297 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-011-2931-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This will give a sense of what is being perceived, and give information about size, shape, weight, temperature, and material.  Tactile stimulation can be direct in the form of bodily contact, or indirect through the use of a tool or probe.  Direct and indirect send different types messages to the brain, but both provide information regarding roughness, hardness, stickiness, and warmth.  The use of a probe elicits a response based on the vibrations in the instrument rather than direct environmental information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yoshioka T. |author2=Bensmaïa S. |author3=Craig J. |author4=Hsiao S. | year = 2007 | title = Texture perception through direct and indirect touch: An analysis of perceptual space for tactile textures in two modes of exploration | url = | journal = Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1-2| pages = 53–70 | doi = 10.1080/08990220701318163 |pmc=2635116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tactual perception gives information regarding [[cutaneous]] stimuli (pressure, vibration, and temperature), [[kinaesthetic]] stimuli (limb movement), and [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] stimuli (position of the body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bergmann Tiest W | year = 2010 | title = Tactual perception of material properties | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 50 | issue = 24| pages = 2775–2782 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2010.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   There are varying degrees of tactual sensitivity and thresholds, both between individuals and between different time periods in an individual's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Angier R | year = 1912 | title = Tactual and kinæsthetic space | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 9 | issue = 7| pages = 255–257 | doi = 10.1037/h0073444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been observed that individuals have differing levels of tactile sensitivity between each hand.  This may be due to callouses forming on the skin of the most used hand, creating a buffer between the stimulus and the receptor.  Alternately, the difference in sensitivity may be due to a difference in the cerebral functions or ability of the [[left hemisphere|left]] and [[right hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weinstein S. |author2=Sersen E. | year = 1961 | title = Tactual sensitivity as a function of handedness and laterality | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 6| pages = 665–669 | doi = 10.1037/h0044145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tests have also shown that deaf children have a greater degree of tactile sensitivity than that of children with normal hearing ability, and that girls generally have a greater degree of sensitivity than that of boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chakravarty A | year = 1968 | title = Influence of tactual sensitivity on tactual localization, particularly of deaf children | url = | journal = Journal of General Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 219–221 | doi = 10.1080/00221309.1968.9710435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tactile information is often used as additional stimuli to resolve a sensory ambiguity.  For example, a surface can be seen as rough, but this inference can only be proven through touching the material.  When sensory information from each modality involved corresponds, the ambiguity is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelace, C. (2000). Feature binding across sense modalities: Visual and tactual interactions. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 61(4-B), 2251. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/619577012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somatosensory information===
Touch messages, in comparison to other sensory stimuli, have a large distance to travel to get to the brain.  Tactual perception is achieved through the response of [[mechanoreceptor]]s in the skin that detect physical stimuli.  The response from a mechanoreceptor detecting pressure can be experienced as a touch, discomfort, or pain, and the force of pressure is measured by a pressure algometer and a dolorimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xiong S. |author2=Goonetilleke R. |author3=Jiang Z. | year = 2011 | title = Pressure thresholds of the human foot: Measurement reliability and effects of stimulus characteristics | url = | journal = Ergonomics | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 282–293 | doi = 10.1080/00140139.2011.552736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mechanoreceptors are situated in highly vascularized skin, and appear in both glabrous and hairy skin.  Each mechanoreceptor is tuned to a different sensitivity, and will fire its action potential only when there is enough energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pawson L. |author2=Pack A. |author3=Checkosky C. |author4=Bolanowski S. | year = 2008 | title = Mesenteric and tactile pacinian corpuscles are anatomically and physiologically comparable | url = | journal = Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 194–206 | doi = 10.1080/08990220802377571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The axons of these single tactile receptors will converge into a single nerve trunk, and the signal is then sent to the spinal cord where the message makes its way to the somatosensory systems in the brain.

====Mechanoreceptors====

There are four types of mechanoreceptors: Meissner corpuscles and merkel cell neurite complexes, located between the epidermis and dermis, and [[Pacinian]] corpuscles and [[Ruffini ending]]s, located deep within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.  Mechanoreceptors are classified in terms of their adaptation rate and the size of their receptive field.  Specific mechanoreceptors and their functions include:&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;Wolfe, J., Kluender, K., &amp; Levi, D. (2009). Sensation and perception. (2 ed.). Sunderland: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thermoreceptors that detect changes in skin temperature.
* Kinesthetic receptors detect our movements and the position of our limbs.
* Nociceptors that have bare nerve endings that detect tissue damage and give the sensation of pain.

===Tests===
A common test used to measure the sensitivity of a person to tactile stimuli is measuring their two-point touch threshold.  This is the smallest separation of two points at which two distinct points of contact can be sensed rather than one.  Different parts of the body have different degrees of tactile acuity, with extremities such as the fingers, face, and toes being the most sensitive.  When two distinct points are perceived, it means that your brain receives two different signals.  The differences of acuity for different parts of the body are the result of differences in the concentration of receptors.&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt;

===Use in clinical psychology===
Tactile stimulation is used in clinical psychology through the method of prompting.  Prompting is the use of a set of instructions designed to guide a participant through learning a behavior.  A physical prompt involves stimulation in the form of physically guided behavior in the appropriate situation and environment.  The physical stimulus perceived through prompting is similar to the physical stimulus that would be experienced in a real-world situation, and is makes the target behavior more likely in a real situation.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. (2012). Behavior modification: principles and procedures. (5 ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smell modality==

===Sensation===

The sense of smell is called [[olfaction]].  All materials constantly shed molecules, which float into the nose or are sucked in through breathing.  Inside the nasal chambers is the [[neuroepithelium]], a lining deep within the nostrils that contains the receptors responsible for detecting molecules that are small enough to smell.  These receptor neurons then synapse at the olfactory cranial nerve (CN I), which sends the information to the olfactory bulbs in the brain for initial processing.  The signal is then sent to the remaining olfactory cortex for more complex processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Doty R | year = 2001 | title = Olfaction | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 423–452 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odors===
An olfactory sensation is called an [[odor]].  For a molecule to trigger olfactory receptor neurons, it must have specific properties.  The molecule must be:
# volatile (able to float through the air)
# small (less than 5.8 x 10-22&amp;nbsp;grams)
# [[hydrophobic]] (repellant to water)

However, humans do not process the smell of various common molecules such as those present in the air.

Our olfactory ability can vary due to different conditions.  For example, our olfactory detection thresholds can change due to molecules with differing lengths of carbon chains.  A molecule with a longer carbon chain is easier to detect, and has a lower detection threshold.  Additionally, women generally have lower olfactory thresholds than men, and this effect is magnified during a woman's [[ovulatory period]].&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt; People can sometimes experience a hallucination of smell, as in the case of [[phantosmia]].

===Interaction with other modalities===
Olfaction interacts with other sensory modalities in significant ways.  The strongest interaction is that of olfaction with taste.  Studies have shown that an odor coupled with a taste increases the perceived intensity of the taste, and that an absence of a corresponding smell decreases the perceived intensity of a taste.  The olfactory stimulation can occur before or during the episode of taste stimulation.  The dual perception of the stimulus produces an interaction that facilitates association of the experience through an additive neural response and memorization of the stimulus.  This association can also be made between olfactory and tactile stimuli during the act of swallowing.  In each case, temporal synchrony is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Labbe D. |author2=Gilbert F. |author3=Martin N. | year = 2008 | title = Impact of olfaction on taste, trigeminal, and texture perceptions | url = | journal = Chemosensory Perception | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 217–226 | doi = 10.1007/s12078-008-9029-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests===
A common [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] test of olfactory ability is the triangle test.  In this test, the participant is given three odors to smell.  Of these three odors, two are the same and one is different, and the participant must choose which odor is the unique one.  To test the sensitivity of olfaction, the staircase method is often used.  In this method, the odor's concentration is increased until the participant is able to sense it, and subsequently decreased until the participant reports no sensation.&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5471">{{About|changes in market dynamics and economic systems|structural change in statistical and econometric models|Structural break}}
In economics, '''structural change''' is a shift or change in the basic ways a market or economy functions or operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structural_change.asp|title = Structural Change Definition {{!}} Investopedia|last = root|website = Investopedia|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such change can be caused by such factors as [[economic development]], global shifts in capital and labor, changes in resource availability due to war or natural disaster or discovery or depletion of natural resources, or a change in political system. For example, a [[subsistence economy]] may be transformed into a [[manufacturing]] economy, or a regulated [[mixed economy]] may be liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;Etchemendy, Sebastian, Models of Economic Liberalization: Regime, Power and Compensation in the Iberian-American Region (2009). APSA 2009 Toronto Meeting Paper. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1449085&lt;/ref&gt; A current driver of structural change in the world economy is [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Margaret |last=Sharp |title=The challenge of long-term structural change |journal=Futures |volume=12 |issue=5 |year=1980 |pages=370–385 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(80)90091-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural change is possible because of the dynamic nature of the [[economic system]].&lt;ref name="llp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pasinetti |first=Luigi L. |year=1981 |title=Structural Change and Economic Growth |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-27410-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterns and changes in sectoral employment drive demand shifts through the [[income elasticity]]. Shifting demand for both locally sourced goods and for imported products is a fundamental part of development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan George Barnard Fisher|Fisher, A]] (1939) Production: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary, Economic Record, June&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, C (1940) The Conditions of Economic Progress&lt;/ref&gt; The structural changes that move countries through the development process are often viewed in terms of shifts from primary, to secondary and finally, to tertiary production. Technical progress is seen as crucial in the process of structural change as it involves the [[obsolescence]] of skills, vocations, and permanent changes in spending and production resulting in [[structural unemployment]].&lt;ref name="llp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon, P. (1967) Structural Change and Growth in Capitalism, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Historically, structural change has not always been strictly for the better. The [[division of Korea]] and the separate paths of development taken by each [[sovereign state|state]] exemplifies this. [[Korea under Japanese rule]] was relatively uniform in economic structure, but after [[World War II]], the two countries underwent drastically different structural changes due to drastically different political structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foley |first=James A. |title=Korea's divided families: fifty years of separation |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-29738-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Korea]]'s economy before the 1950s mostly consisted of [[agriculture]]. During the 1960s and 1970s, Korea began to change their structure to [[IT]], [[micro systems technology]], and also [[Service (economics)|services]]. More than 50% of the world uses a [[Samsung]] smartphone, whose headquarters are located there. Today, South Korea's economy is the 15th strongest economy system.

In the [[Ruhr|Ruhr Area (Ruhrgebiet)]] in [[Germany]], the economy was mostly marked by [[coal and steel industry]]. During and after the coal crisis began in the 1960s and 1970s, this area started to change its economic structures to services, IT and [[logistics]]. The city [[Dortmund]] opened the first technology center named "Technologiepark Dortmund" in the 1980s. Companies including [[Signal Iduna]] and [[Wilo]] are based there.

Structural change can be initiated by policy decisions or permanent changes in resources, population or the society. The [[Revolutions of 1989|downfall of communism]], for example, is a political change that has had far-reaching economic implications.

==Structural changes in employment==
&lt;imagemap&gt;
Image:US employment by sectors, both genders.png|thumb|US employment by sectors, both genders [https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072912/http://www.bluenomics.com/data#!data/national_accounts_gdp/gdp_production_approach/structure_of_gross_value_added_by_sectors_gva_/structure_of_gross_value_added_by_sectors_gva_annual_of_gdp%7Cchart/line$countries=usa&amp;sorting=list//title]
&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Economic structural changes impact also on employment. A developing economy typically reveals a high share of employment in the [[primary sector]], while the share of employment in the [[tertiary sector]] is high in an advanced/developed economy.

==Testing econometric models for structural change==
{{Main|Structural break#Structural break tests}}
Structural change tests are a type of [[econometrics|econometric]] [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis test]]. They are used to verify the equality of coefficients across separate [[Replication (statistics)|subsamples]] of a [[data set]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">{{short description|The sixth of 17 Sustainable Development Goals calling for clean water and sanitation for all people by 2030}}
'''Sustainable Development Goal 6''' ('''SDG6''' or '''SDG 6'''), one of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the UN in 2015. It calls for clean water and [[sanitation]] for all people. The official wording is: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal has eight targets to be achieved by at least 2030. Progress toward the targets will be measured by using eleven "indicators."     

SDG6 is closely linked with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  For example, improving sanitation also helps make cities more sustainable (Goal 11). Sanitation improvements can lead to more jobs (Goal 8) which would also lead to economic growth (Goal 8).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  SDG6 progress improves [[health]] (Goal 3) and [[social justice]] (Goal 16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targets==

SDG 6 has eight targets. Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020 and one has no target year.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators for SDG6.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]:&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt; 

# By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]] for all
# By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] for all and end [[open defecation]], paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
# By 2030, improve water quality by reducing [[Water pollution|pollution]], eliminating dumping and minimizing release of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous chemicals]] and materials, halving the proportion of untreated [[wastewater]] and substantially increasing [[Reclaimed water|recycling and safe reuse]] globally

Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption supports education and employment, both of which are the foundation of alleviating poverty. Therefore, toilets at school and at the work place are included in the second target ("achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all"). Equitable sanitation and hygiene solutions address the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.

Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented. Preserving natural sources of water is very important so as to achieve universal access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]]. Therefore, one target aims to reduce [[water pollution]] by eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and untreated [[wastewater]]. The potential for recycling and safe [[Reclaimed water|reuse of wastewater]] is also mentioned.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt;

The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]] services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The current statistic in the 2017 baseline estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The JMP is a joint program of [[UNICEF]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and compiles data to monitor SDG6 progress. 

The definition of safely managed sanitation service is: "Use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite."&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Links with other SDGs==
The SDGs are all interlinked. [[WASH]] experts have stated that without progress on Goal 6, the other goals and targets cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="IPSnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/10/opinion-sanitation-water-hygiene-for-all-cannot-wait-for-2030/|title=Opinion: “Sanitation, Water &amp; Hygiene For All” Cannot Wait for 2030|last1=Rao Gupta|first1=Geeta|date=October 2015|website=Inter Press|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="batty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/beyond-the-sdgs-how-to-deliver-water-and-sanitation-to-everyone-everywhere-86975|title=Beyond the SDGs: How to deliver water and sanitation to everyone, everywhere|last1=Batty|first1=Margaret|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, accomplishing the other SDGs will require assuring clean water and sanitation for all as stated in SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=SuSanA|first=|date=2017|website=|publisher=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sanitation systems with a [[Reuse of excreta|resource recovery]] and reuse focus are getting increased attention and can contribute to achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs, especially in an urban context.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20170919145350-bovq7|title=The rise of the sanitation economy: how business can help solve a global crisis|last=Paranipe|first=Nitin|date=14 November 2017|website=Thomson Reuters Foundation News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Kim|last2=Dickin|first2=Sarah|last3=Rosemarin|first3=Arno|date=2016-12-08|title=Towards "Sustainable" Sanitation: Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Areas|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1289|doi=10.3390/su8121289}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater (like nutrients, water and energy) contributes to achieving Goal 12 ([[sustainable consumption]] and [[sustainable production|production]]) and Goal 2 (end hunger). 

Ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to Goal 11 ([[sustainable cities]] and communities), Goal 1 (no poverty) and Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Organizations==

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) works on sanitation issues as a global network of 9000 individuals and 300 partner organizations. Global organizations such as [[Oxfam]], [[UNICEF]], [[WaterAid]] and many small NGOs as well as universities, research centres, private enterprises, government-owned entities etc. are all part of SuSanA and are dedicated to achieving SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the population. This will require cooperation between governments, civil society and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko,, Tan, Tay Keong,, Flynn, Patricia M.,|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synderesis''' or '''synteresis''', in [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[moral philosophy]], is the natural ''capacity'' or disposition (habitus) of the ''[[practical reason]]'' to apprehend intuitively the universal ''[[first principles]]'' of human ''action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14384a.htm | title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Synderesis | work=Catholic Encyclopedia | access-date=2 January 2016 | quote=Synderesis, or more correctly synteresis, is a term used by the Scholastic theologians to signify the habitual knowledge of the universal practical principles of moral action.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reason]] is a single faculty, but is called differently according to the end that it assigns to its search for [[truth]]; when its goal is the mere consideration (contemplation) of truth, it is called ''speculative reason''; when it considers truth in view of action ([[Praxis (process)|praxis]]), it is called ''practical reason''. In both cases reason uses demonstration ([[syllogism]]) as its tool; it proceeds from the understanding of previously known truths ([[premise]]s) to the statement of a proposition ([[logical consequence|conclusion]]) whose truth follows necessarily from the premises.

How does one know that those premises (and consequently their conclusion) are true? Because they are themselves conclusions of previous demonstrations. Although one could take back this process of demonstration of the truth of premises as far as we want, a [[Infinite regress|regression ad infinitum]] would deprive the demonstrative chain of certitude. Consequently, it is necessary that the point of departure of human reasoning be some immediately knowable, i.e. [[self-evident]], [[proposition]]s called ''first principles'', whose truth is not, indeed cannot be grasped through demonstration, but only by [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] (noûs).

The habit or disposition that allows the speculative reason to apprehend intuitively the principles that preside over its [[discursive reasoning]] is called "understanding of principles" (intellectus principiorum).  The principles of "[[principle of non-contradiction|non contradiction]]", of "[[principle of identity|identity]]" and of "[[law of excluded middle|excluded middle]]", all of which are ultimately based on the notion of "[[being]]", which is the first that our reason apprehends absolutely, are all examples of those principles.

Similarly, the capacity or disposition that allows the practical reason to apprehend intuitively the principles or laws that preside over its discursive reasoning regarding human action is called ''synderesis''. Just as "being" is the first notion apprehended absolutely, so also "[[goodness and value theory|good]]" is the first thing that is apprehended by the practical reason, since everything that acts does so for an end which possesses the quality of goodness. That is why the first principle or law of the practical reason is "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided". Also the precepts of natural law can be considered object of synderesis insofar as all the things towards which the human being has a natural inclination are naturally apprehended by the intellect as good and therefore as objects to be pursued, and their opposites as evils to be avoided.

Synderesis is the capacity not only to apprehend the first principles, but also to judge every step of the practical discourse in the light of those principles. But, as an intellectual disposition concerned with knowledge of the first principles of action, synderesis provides only the [[universal premise]] of the practical syllogism. Every human ''action'', however, is singular, [[contingent]] and takes place in particular circumstances. To complete the practical discourse and reach a conclusion regarding what has to be done ''hic et nunc'' [here and now] and what means are  to be used, other capacities are necessary besides synderesis, and to actually effect the action other faculties are required besides reason. That is why the whole picture concerning human action includes powers, dispositions and acts such as conscience, desire, will, etc.

The origin of the notion of synderesis as presented here can be traced, on the one hand, to the Commentary on [[Ezechiel]] by [[Saint Jerome]] (A.D. 347–419), where ''syntéresin'' (συντήρησιν) is mentioned among the powers of the [[soul]] and is described as the spark of conscience (''scintilla conscientiae'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/s/synderes.htm | title=Synderesis &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | author=Anonymous | work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | access-date=2 January 2016 | quote="Synderesis" is a technical term from scholastic philosophy, signifying the innate principle in the moral consciousness of every person which directs the agent to good and restrains him from evil. It is first found in a single passage of St Jerome (d. 420) in his explanation of the four living creatures in Ezekiel's vision. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the other, to the interpretation of Jerome's text given, in the 13th century, by [[Albertus|Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the light of Aristotelian psychology and [[Aristotelianism|ethics]]. The word ''synderesis'' is by most scholars reckoned to be a corruption of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for shared knowledge or conscience, ''syneidêsis'' ({{lang|grc|συνείδησις}}), the corruption appearing in the medieval manuscripts of Jerome's Commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kries in ''Traditio'' vol. 57: ''Origen, Plato, and Conscience (Synderesis) in Jerome's Ezekiel Commentary'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation of synderesis was proposed by [[Bonaventure]], who considered it as the natural inclination of the ''[[will (philosophy)|will]]'' towards moral good.

The term is found applied in psychiatric studies too, with particular reference to [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Martha Stout'', (2005) ''The Sociopath Next Door'', Broadway Books, {{ISBN|0-7679-1582-8}} (term ''synderesis'' in pages 27, 28, 29, 33)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tarring and feathering''' is a form of public torture and humiliation used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge. It was used in [[early modern Europe|feudal Europe]] and [[European colonialism|its colonies]] in the [[early modern period]], as well as the early [[American frontier]], mostly as a type of [[Lynching|mob vengeance]]. Awareness of [[tarring and feathering in popular culture]] remains.

The victim would be stripped naked, or stripped to the waist. Hot [[Wood tar|tar]] was then either poured or painted onto the person while they were immobilized. Then the victim either had [[feathers]] thrown on them or was rolled around on a pile of feathers so that they stuck to the tar.

The image of the tarred-and-feathered outlaw remains a [[metaphor]] for severe public criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tar%20and%20feather |title=Tar and Feather. The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms by Christine Ammer. Houghton Mifflin Company |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=1997-05-26 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}
{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tars |title=Tars. The Free Online Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}} "To criticize severely and devastatingly; excoriate." ("[[:wikt:excoriate|to excoriate]]" [i.e. "to flay"] being itself a similar type of metaphor).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest mention of the punishment appears in orders that [[Richard I of England]] issued to his navy on starting for the [[Holy Land]] in 1189. "Concerning the lawes and ordinances appointed by King Richard for his navie the forme thereof was this ... item, a thiefe or felon that hath stolen, being lawfully convicted, shal have his head shorne, and boyling pitch poured upon his head, and feathers or downe strawed upon the same whereby he may be knowen, and so at the first landing-place they shall come to, there to be cast up" (transcript of original statute in ''[[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s Voyages'', ii. 21).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/richard.asp Tha Avalon Project documents] Accessed on 23rd June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A later instance of this penalty appears in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' (series 4, vol. v), which quotes [[James Howell]] writing in Madrid in 1623 of the "boisterous [[Bishop of Halberstadt]] ... having taken a place where there were two monasteries of nuns and friars, he caused divers feather beds to be ripped, and all the feathers thrown into a great hall, whither the nuns and friars were thrust naked with their bodies oiled and pitched and to tumble among these feathers, which makes them here (Madrid) presage him an ill-death."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} (The Bishop was apparently [[Christian the Younger of Brunswick]].)

In 1696, a London [[bailiff]] attempted to serve process on a [[debtor]] who had taken refuge within the precincts of the [[Liberties of the Savoy|Savoy]]. The bailiff was tarred and feathered and taken in a wheelbarrow to [[Strand, London|the Strand]], where he was tied to a [[maypole]] that stood by what is now [[Somerset House]] as an improvised [[pillory]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Coming of the American Revolution===
In 1766, Captain William Smith was tarred, feathered, and dumped into the harbor of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] by a mob that included the town's mayor. A vessel picked him out of the water just as his strength was giving out. He survived and was later quoted as saying that they "dawbed my body and face all over with tar and afterwards threw feathers on me." Smith was suspected of informing on smugglers to the British customs agents, as was the case with most other tar-and-feathers victims in the following decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author="Letters of Governor Francis Fauquier"|title= ''The William and Mary Quarterly''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vikjAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167|volume=21|year=1912|pages=166–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice appeared in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1767, when mobs attacked low-level employees of the customs service with tar and feathers. In October 1769, a mob in Boston attacked a customs service sailor the same way, and a few similar attacks followed through 1774. The tarring and feathering of customs worker [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] received particular attention in 1774. Such acts associated the punishment with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] side of the [[American Revolution]]. An exception occurred in March 1775 when a British regiment inflicted the same treatment on Thomas Ditson, a [[Billerica, Massachusetts]] man who attempted to buy a musket from one of the regiment's soldiers. There is no known case of a person dying from being tarred and feathered in this period. During the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], local farmers inflicted the punishment on federal tax agents.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Irvin, "Tar, feathers, and the enemies of American liberties, 1768-1776."

===19th century===
Beginning on September 11, 1791, western Pennsylvania farmers rebelled against the federal government's taxation on western Pennsylvania whiskey distillers during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. Their first victim was reportedly a recently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson. He was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]]. Other officials who attempted to serve court warrants on Johnson's attackers were whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Slaughter | first = Thomas P. | title = The Whiskey Rebellion: Frontier Epilogue to the American Revolution | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 1986 | isbn = 0195051912 }} pages 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], was dragged from his home during the night of March 24, 1832 by a group of men who stripped and beat him before tarring and feathering him. His wife and infant child were knocked from their bed by the attackers and were forced from the home and threatened. (The infant died several days later from exposure.) Smith was left for dead, but limped back to the home of friends. They spent much of the night scraping the tar from his body, leaving his skin raw and bloody. The following day, Smith spoke at a church devotional meeting and was reported to have been covered with raw wounds and still weak from the attack.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Life of Joseph Smith from 1831 to 1834#Life in Kirtland, Ohio]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, a [[Know-Nothing]] mob in [[Ellsworth, Maine]] tarred and feathered Swiss-born [[Jesuit]] priest Father [[John Bapst]] in the midst of a local controversy over religious education in grammar schools. Bapst fled Ellsworth to settle in nearby [[Bangor, Maine]], where there was a large [[Irish-Catholic]] community, and a local high school there is named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|id=02258a|title=John Bapst|first=Thomas|last=Campbell|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The tarring and feathering of Mrs Lowry.png|thumb|Image accompanying story of "Female Whitecaps Chastise Woman" from Ada Evening News November 27, 1906. The article describes an incident in East Sandy, Pennsylvania where four married women tarred and feathered Mrs. Hattie Lowry.]]
Tarring and feathering was not restricted to men. The November 27, 1906 Ada, Oklahoma ''Evening News'' reports that a vigilance committee consisting of four young married women from East Sandy, Pennsylvania corrected the alleged evil conduct of their neighbor Mrs. Hattie Lowry in [[Whitecapping|whitecap style]]. One of the women was a sister-in-law of the victim. The women appeared at Mrs. Lowry's home in open day and announced that she had not heeded the spokeswoman and leader. Two women held Mrs. Lowry to the floor while the other two smeared her face with stove polish until it was completely covered. They then poured thick molasses upon her head and emptied the contents of a feather pillow over the molasses. The women then marched the victim to a railroad camp, tied by the wrists, where two hundred workmen stopped work to watch the spectacle. After parading Mrs. Lowry through the camp, the women tied her to a large box where she remained until a man released her. Three of the women involved were arrested, pleaded guilty and each paid a $10.00 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026853/1906-11-21/ed-1/seq-7/#date1=11%2F01%2F1906&amp;index=2&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Hattie+Lowry&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=11%2F31%2F1906&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=Hattie+Lowry&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;page=1 The Abbeville press and banner., November 21, 1906, Image 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
A group of black-robed Knights of Liberty (a faction of the [[KKK]]) tarred and feathered seventeen members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in Oklahoma in 1917, during an incident known as the [[Tulsa Outrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chapman |first=Lee Roy |url=http://thislandpress.com/09/01/2011/tate-brady-battle-greenwood/ |title=The Nightmare of Dreamland This Land |date=September 2011 |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, vigilantes were opposed to [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] organizers at California's harbor of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]]. They kidnapped at least one organizer, subjected him to tarring and feathering, and left him in a remote location.

The Wednesday, May 28, 1930 edition of the ''Miami Daily News-Record'' contains on its front page the arrests of five brothers (Isaac, Newton, Henry, Gordon and Charles Starns) from Louisiana accused of tarring and feathering Dr. S. L. Newsome, who was a prominent dentist. This was in retaliation for the dentist having an affair with one of the brother's wives.

There were several examples of tarring and feathering of African-Americans in the lead-up to [[World War I]] in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; According to William Harris, this was a relatively rare form of mob punishment to Republican African-Americans in the post-bellum U.S. South, as its goal was typically pain and humiliation rather than death.&lt;ref name=harris&gt;Harris, William J. "Etiquette, Lynching, and Racial Boundaries in Southern History: A Mississippi Example". ''[[The American Historical Review]]''. Vol. 100, No. 2 (Apr., 1995), pp. 387–410&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, [[anti-German sentiment]] was widespread and many German-Americans were attacked. For example, in August 1918 a German-American farmer, John Meints of Luverne, Minnesota (pictured above), was captured by a group of men, taken to the nearby South Dakota border and tarred and feathered – for allegedly not supporting [[war bond]]s. Meints sued his assailants and lost, but on appeal to a federal court he won, and  in 1922 settled out of court for $6,000.&lt;ref name="startribune.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/blogs/70155507.html |title=Nov. 16, 1919: Tarred and feathered |publisher=StarTribune.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1922, a German-born Catholic priest in Slaton, Texas, Joseph M. Keller, who had been harassed by local residents during World War I due to his ethnicity, was accused of breaking the [[Seal of the Confessional (Catholic Church)|seal of confession]] and tarred and feathered. Thereafter Keller served a Catholic parish in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bills|first1=E.

Similar tactics were also used by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) during the early years of [[The Troubles]]. Many of the victims were women accused of sexual relationships with policemen or British soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 13, 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/13/paul-theroux-this-was-england |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |title=This was England |first=Paul |last=Theroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1100 CE and 1400 CE [[Kannada script]] and [[Telugu script]] separated from Old-Kannada script ([[Halegannada]] script) or [[Kadamba script]] or [[Bhattiprolu script]]. The [[Chalukyas]] influenced the modern form of Telugu script and its similarity with modern Kannada script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~adluri/telugu/language/script/script1d.html | title=Evolution of Telugu Character Graphs | accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Kannada]] script is the continuation of the [[Kadamba script]], which was used for writing [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] languages. Telugu and Kannada Scripts are strikingly similar. 

The Dravidian family comprising about ''73 languages'' including Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. Kannada [[abugida]] was developed between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE from '''Chalukya and Kadamba scripts''', descendants of Brahmi. Old Kannada script is about 1800 years old, developed into Modern Telugu and Modern Kannada scripts. The Telugu script is closely related to Kannada, earliest known inscriptions dates back to the 6th century CE, poetry begins to appear in the 11th century. New written standard emerged in Telugu during the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/unger26/Wrtg%20sys%20exhibit.pdf | title=A sampler of the world’s writing systems | publisher=J.

==History==
During 4th to 7th centuries AD the Early [[Chalukyas|Bādāmi Chālukyās]] and Early [[Kadambas|Banavasi Kadambās]] used early form of ''Kannada script'' in inscriptions. The early [[Eastern Chalukyas]] and  [[Salankayana]] who ruled the [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_epigraphical_sans_indiaabroad.asp | title=Epigraphical Studies in India - Sanskrit and Dravidian, Scripts used in India, Scripts Abroad | accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Kannada-Telugu Script==
Kannada and Telugu belongs to Dravidian family of languages in southern India, Saatavaahanas introduced the Brahmi to present day Telugu and Kannada speaking regions. Kannada and Telugu scripts are categorized under Old Kannada script. Kannada became a literate language much ahead of Telugu language. Both Kannada and Telugu produced the poetry during the eighth century. The full-fledged literary works in Kannada produced in ninth century, two centuries before the works available in Telugu&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kavirajamarga-a-tour-with-a-difference/article20919519.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavirajamarga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Hans/2014-11-12/Aadi-Kavi-Nannayas-brilliant-translation-of-the-Mahabharata/115876&lt;/ref&gt;. The combined Kannada-Telugu script called as ''Old Kannada''. Telugu writers waited till 11th century because of socio-political factors (royal patronage, influence of Buddhism and Jainism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~adluri/telugu/language/script/script1a.html | title=Origins of Telugu Script | accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26798">'''The Irascibles''' or '''Irascible 18''' were the labels given to a group of American abstract artists who put name to an [[open letter]], written in 1950, to the president of [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], rejecting the museum's exhibition ''American Painting Today - 1950'' and boycotting the accompanying competition. The subsequent media coverage of the protest and a now iconic group photograph, that appeared in ''Life'' magazine, gave them notoriety, popularised the term [[Abstract Expressionist]] and established them as the so-called first generation of the putative movement.

==The emergence of the New York School==
The emergence of abstract art coincided with the invention of [[Cubism]] in Paris in the first decade of the 20th Century. Paris remained the centre of gravity for later art movements like [[Futurism]], [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Vorticism]], [[Cubo-Futurism]], [[Dada]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Surrealism]] until the outbreak of World War II and the Nazi persecution of "[[degenerate art]]", which precipitated a mass migration of artists and performers to the United States. New York became home to the transplanted avant-garde.&lt;ref name=Barnes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Lucinda|title=A Proclamation of Moment: Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rottko and Barnett Newman and the letter to ''The New York Times''|journal=Allen Memorial Art Museum Bulletin|year=1993|volume=XLVII|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 1940s was of particular importance in American art as American scene painting ([[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]]) came to be seen as an inadequate mode of artistic expression in a tumultuous time.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt; In 1942, [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who had fled Europe with her husband, Surrealist artist [[Max Ernst]], opened her gallery [[Art of This Century gallery|Art of This Century]], showing European and promising American avant-garde artists. [[Jackson Pollock]] had his first one-man show there in 1943 and, in 1945, Guggenheim showed [[Mark Rothko]].&lt;ref name=Barnes /&gt;

When Guggenheim closed her gallery in 1947 to move to Venice, artists like Pollock had to find new representation. The Betty Parsons Gallery, which opened the previous year, began representing Pollock, [[Barnett Newman]], Mark Rothko and [[Clyfford Still]]. Parsons was already representing [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hedda Sterne]] and [[Theodoros Stamos]]. It was while Pollock showed at Parsons' gallery that he started making his iconic drip-paintings in 1947. It was also here that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950. Rothko, who had arrived at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947, first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt;

At the time, the only galleries who were prepared to show the so-called [[New York School (art)|New York School]] ([[Robert Motherwell]]'s term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the [[Charles Egan Gallery]]. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with the sale of a $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, [[Hans Hoffman]], [[William Baziotes]] and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 as a result of the financial strain.&lt;ref name=Robson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robson|first=Deirdre|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415228671|pages=290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vp-eUH_ogUsC|editor=Francis Frascina|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;

==The preamble to the protest==
Since January 1943 an agreement existed between the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] on a coalition which would culminate in the combining of their collections of American art in a new building, paid for from the endowment of [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]]. By this unwritten agreement, the Whitney acquired American art while the Metropolitan concentrated their acquisitions on what they termed "classic" art.&lt;ref name=Hale /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hale1957 /&gt;

Juliana Force, the Whitney's director since 1931 until her death on August 28, 1948, harboured grave concerns and advocated the abandonment of the coalition. On October 1, 1948, the Whitney trustees cited "serious divergences" especially with regard to the showing of advanced trends in art, something the Whitney made a special point of doing. They unilaterally withdrew the Whitney from the coalition.&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;{{cite news|title=Whitney Drops Proposal for Combining its Collections with the Metropolitan's|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/10/01/96599374.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 October 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1948, the Met announced it would form its own Department of American Art,&lt;ref name=NYT1948&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=Art Museum adds a Modern Section|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/12/07/96606328.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 December 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it did on January 1, 1949.&lt;ref name=Hale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hale|first=Robert Beverly|title=A Report on American Painting Today: 1950|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=February 1951|volume=9|series=New series|issue=6|pages=162–172|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|jstor=3257446|doi=10.2307/3257446}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Beverly Hale]] was appointed as Associate Curator of American Painting and Sculpture and head of the department.&lt;ref name=NYT1948 /&gt; A Trustees' Committee on American Art was set up to advise the Associate Curator. The members of this committee were Elihu Root, Jr., Chairman, Walter C. Baker, and [[Sam A. Lewisohn]].&lt;ref name=Hale1957&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hale|first=Robert Beverly|title=The American Moderns|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|year=1957|volume=16|issue=1|pages=18–28|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257721.pdf.bannered.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2012|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Knox /&gt; Lewisohn, although a highly respected collector of [[Impressionists]], was noted for calling avant-garde abstract art "unhuman".&lt;ref name=Louchheim&gt;{{cite news|last=Louchheim|first=Aline|title=Sam A.

In July 1949, Roland J. McKinney, formerly Director of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] and of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], was appointed as a consultant.&lt;ref name=Knox /&gt; On his advice, it was decided The Met would host a series of open national competitive exhibitions with five regional juries. The first of these, ''American Painting Today - 1950'', was announced as part of a statement of policy on January 1, 1950.&lt;ref name=Knox&gt;{{cite news|last=Knox|first=Sanka|title=Competition for American Artists Planned by Metropolitan Museum|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/01/01/109354653.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 January 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five regional juries, meeting respectively in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Dallas]], [[Chicago]], Richmond and [[New York City|New York]] would make selections, which would be submitted to a National Jury, composed of five regional jurors and two jurors appointment by the Metropolitan.&lt;ref name=Hale /&gt;

==The Studio 35 symposium==
In 1948, William Baziotes, [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and Mark Rothko founded the Subjects of the Artist School, which held artists' discussions in a loft at 35 East Eighth Street, [[Manhattan]] which came to be known as Studio 35. A closed panel symposium took place from April 21 to 23, 1950. It was organised by [[Robert Goodnough]] and moderated by [[Richard Lippold]], Robert Motherwell and [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]] director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA). The purpose was the framing of an [[art movement]].&lt;ref name=Swan&gt;{{cite book|title=de Kooning: American Master|year=2005|publisher=Alfred A.

At the end of the closed session it was suggested by Adolph Gottlieb that the assembled artists protest the conservative bias of the jury for the upcoming competition at the Metropolitan.&lt;ref name=Alloway&gt;{{cite book|last=Alloway|first=Lawrence|title=Adolph Gottlieb: A Retrospective|year=1995|publisher=Hudson Hills|isbn=9781555951252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_XppsXbW5AC&amp;dq=Adolph+Gottlieb:+A+Retrospective&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|author2=MacNaughton, Mary |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}}

==The open letter==
[[File:Open Letter to Roland Redmond.jpg|thumb|320px|alt=A letter with a small section of body text followed by two sections of typed signatures, one for painters, the other for sculptors|Open letter to Roland L.

Gottlieb spent the better part of three weeks drafting an [[open letter]] to the president of the Metropolitan, conferring with [[Ad Reinhardt]] and Barnett Newman while soliciting consensus among other artists by mail or phone. The final version was sent to the individual artists to sign; 28 doing so. Newman called Jackson Pollock from Gottlieb's apartment in Brooklyn, asking him to come into the city immediately to sign the letter. Pollock sent a telegram instead:&lt;ref name=Pollock&gt;{{cite book|title=Jackson Pollock: An American Saga|year=1989|publisher=Clarkson N.

{{quote|I ENDORSED THE LETTER OPPOSING THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART 1950 JURIED SHOW STOP JACKSON POLLOCK}}

The letter was underwritten by [[Jimmy Ernst]], Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell, William Baziotes, Hans Hofmann, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], Theodoros Stamos, [[Ad Reinhardt]], Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Weldon Kees]] and [[Fritz Bultman]]. The supporting sculptors were [[Herbert Ferber]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Mary Callery]], Day Schnabel, [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Peter Grippe]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], David Hare and [[Louise Bourgeois]].&lt;ref name=NYT1950 /&gt;

On Sunday May 21, 1950, Barnett Newman took the signed statement to the [[city editor]] of the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Alloway /&gt; Newman had run for mayor of New York as a [[write-in candidate]] in 1933 and knew Monday to be a slow news day at the ''Times''.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Barnett|title=Barnett Newman: Selected Writings and Interviews|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520078178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaJ1niWLPHMC&amp;dq=Barnett+Newman+mayor&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|editor=John Philip O'Neill|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement, entitled OPEN LETTER TO ROLAND L. REDMOND, dated May 20, appeared on the front page of the ''Times'' of May 22.&lt;ref name=NYT1950&gt;{{cite news|title=18 Painters Boycott Metropolitan; Charge 'Hostility to Advanced Art'|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/05/22/94259585.pdf|accessdate=25 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 May 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman told the ''Times'' that they were critical of the membership of the five regional juries and especially opposed to the New York jury, the National Jury of Selection and the Jury of Awards. The New York jurors were [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Leon Kroll]], [[Ogden Pleissner]], Vaclav Vytlacil and [[Paul Sample (artist)|Paul Sample]]. The national jury consisted of Robert Beverly Hale, Ogden Pleissner, [[Maurice Sterne]], [[Millard Sheets]], [[Howard Cook]], [[Lamar Dodd]], [[Francis Chapin]], Zoltan Sepeshy and Esther Williams. The jury of awards included William M. Milliken, Franklin C. Watkins and [[Eugene Speicher]].&lt;ref name=NYT1950 /&gt;

==The resulting polemic==
The first response to the letter came on the editorial page of ''[[New York Herald Tribune|The Herald Tribune]]'' of May 23, 1950. The editorial attacked the artists for "distortion of fact" in claiming the Metropolitan had "contempt" for modern painting.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite news|title=The Irascible Eighteen|newspaper=The New York Herald Tribune|date=23 May 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Herald Tribune's'' art critic at the time was [[Emily Genauer]]. It was widely assumed that she had written the editorial, which gave name to the group.&lt;ref name=Rubenfeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubenfeld|first=Florence|title=Clement Greenberg: a life|year=1997|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=9780684191102|pages=144|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL689412M/Clement_Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boxer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=Sarah|title=The Last Irascible|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=23 December 2010|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/dec/23/last-irascible/?pagination=false|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gottlieb, aided by Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which was signed by 12 painters and three sculptors, and addressed to the editor of the ''Tribune''. It was never published. Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of ''[[The Nation]]'', calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, [[Francis Henry Taylor]] a [[Philistinism|philistine]].&lt;ref name=Kees&gt;{{cite book|last=Kees|first=Weldon|title=Weldon Kees and the Mid-Century Generation: Letters, 1935-1955|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803278080|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsdhebykYgUC&amp;dq=Weldon+Kees+the+Nation+June+3+1950&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|editor=Robert E.

Alfred Barr, seeking to distinguish the MoMA, further electrified the situation by selecting [[Arshile Gorky]], Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock for the American pavilion of the 25th [[Venice Biennale]], held from June to October 1950. In the June 1950 issue of ''[[ARTnews]]'', he referred to the painters as "leaders" of a "predominant vanguard". Barr's act signalled to the art world that [[abstract expressionism]] should be given serious consideration by museums.&lt;ref name=Swan /&gt;{{rp|305–306}}

On July 3, 1950, a group of 75 artists issued a statement via an open letter to the president of the Met, defending the museum. Signers included [[Milton Avery]], [[Will Barnet]], [[Philip Evergood]], [[Xavier Gonzalez]], [[George Grosz]], [[Henry Koerner]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Waldo Peirce]], [[Manfred Schwartz]] and [[Harry Sternberg]].&lt;ref name=75artists&gt;{{cite news|title=75 Painters Deny Museum is Hostile|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/07/04/84661775.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 July 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Life'' magazine decided to publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document the results of the competition and feature a photograph of the protesters.&lt;ref name=Life&gt;{{cite journal|title=IRASCIBLE GROUP OF ADVANCED ARTISTS LED FIGHT AGAINST SHOW|journal=Life|date=15 January 1951|pages=34–38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20sEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life'' initially wanted to photograph the painters on the steps of the ''Metropolitan'', with their paintings.

The caption to the published photograph referred to the group as ''solemn''. It was true that many of the group had reservations at appearing in a [[mainstream media]] publication; Rothko especially.&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|272}} Yet none could have mistaken the consequences of Pollock's three-page spread in ''Life'' of August 8, 1949.&lt;ref name=LifeJP&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jackson Pollock: Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?|journal=Life|date=8 August 1949|volume=27|issue=6|pages=42–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y04EAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=Life+jackson+pollock+is+he+the+greatest&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=29 November 2012|publisher=Time Inc.|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock's next show, opening November 21, 1949, at ''Betty Parsons Gallery'', was an unmistakable triumph.&lt;ref name=Pollock /&gt;{{rp|597}} Famously, Willem de Kooning was heard to say to [[Milton Resnick]]: "Look around.

==The legacy of the polemic==
The subsequent ''Life'' article did more than provide the public with an image of the group, looking more "like bankers" than irascible. It placed the picture larger and before the pictures of the Metropolitans competition winning art works. It also reiterated the word ''advanced'', echoing the [[Madison Avenue]] advertising speak of the day.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; The picture caption also referred to the protest as in keeping with [[avant-garde]] tradition, mentioning the [[Salon des Refusés]] of 1863 and the [[Ashcan School]].&lt;ref name=Life /&gt;

[[Irving Sandler]], a historian of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and Abstract Expressionism wrote that the Leen photograph "has become ''the'' image whereby we invision the artists who achieved the triumph of American painting".&lt;ref name=Sandler&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandler|first=Irving|title=Weldon Kees and the Arts at Midcentury|year=2003|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803242951|pages=39–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHuqFs0f9TsC&amp;dq|editor=Daniel A. Siedell|accessdate=29 November 2012|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}

The artists' discomfort with being labelled, individually or as a group, was clear. At the end of the three-day symposium at Studio 35 in 1950, Alfred Barr challenged the group to name themselves, to which de Kooning responded: "it is disastrous to name ourselves".&lt;ref name=Swan /&gt;{{rp|305}} Pollock, on his part, refused to sign the ''Times'' letter unless it was clear that they were not a group; it is noteworthy that he did not.&lt;ref name=Sandler /&gt;{{rp|42}}

Already in 1951, relationships had deteriorated enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons with the idea of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves.&lt;ref name=Tomkins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomkins|first=Calvin|title=A Keeper of the Treasure|journal=The New Yorker|date=9 June 1975|pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the [[Sidney Janis Gallery]].&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt; After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not being included in the 1952 ''Fifteen Americans'' show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|346}}

In 1954, Ad Reinhardt engaged in a public ridiculing of Rothko, Newman, de Kooning, Gottlieb and Still, resulting in Newman suing him for libel.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|347}} Clyfford Still repudiated Mark Rothko for "living an evil, an untrue life".&lt;ref name=Rothko /&gt;{{rp|348}} "It all went from love to hate in four years", Betty Parsons recalled in 1975.&lt;ref name=Tomkins /&gt;

Nina Leen's 1951 ''Life'' photograph has become the [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] for [[Western canon|canonical]] lists of the New York School. Irving Sandler used it as the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] and rear [[dust jacket]] photograph of his ''The Triumph of American Painting: A History of Abstract Expressionism'', published in 1970.&lt;ref name=Triumph&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandler|first=Irving|title=The Triumph of American Painting: a History of Abstract Expressionism|year=1970|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=New York|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL17754003M/The_triumph_of_American_painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book defined Abstract Expressionism for a generation of scholars.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Ann Eden|title=Abstract Expressionism: Other Politics|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=0300063393|pages=29|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1006293M/Abstract_expressionism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty sidebar}}

A '''theory''' is a [[contemplation|contemplative]] and [[reason|rational]] type of [[abstraction|abstract]] or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4y4DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;ots=gRlsPCgq1L&amp;dq=A%20theory%20is%20a%20contemplative%20and%20rational%20type%20of%20abstract%20or%20generalizing%20thinking,%20or%20the%20results%20of%20such%20thinking&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20theory%20is%20a%20contemplative%20and%20rational%20type%20of%20abstract%20or%20generalizing%20thinking,%20or%20the%20results%20of%20such%20thinking&amp;f=false|title=Human Motivation, Metaphors, Theories, and Research|last=Reviews|first=C.

The word has its roots in [[ancient Greek]], but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings.

Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMurray|first1=Foster |title=Preface to an Autonomous Discipline of Education |journal=Educational Theory |date=July 1955 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=129–140 |doi = 10.1111/j.1741-5446.1955.tb01131.x |accessdate=3 March 2017 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5446.1955.tb01131.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}} A theory can be a [[body of knowledge]], which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory [[Conceptual model|models]]. To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Gary |title=Education and theory : strangers in paradigms |year=2007 |publisher=Open Univ. Press |location=Maidenhead |isbn=9780335211791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}}

As already in Aristotle's definitions, theory is very often contrasted to "[[praxis (process)|practice]]" (from Greek ''[[Wiktionary:praxis|praxis]]'', πρᾶξις) a Greek term for ''doing'', which is opposed to theory because pure theory involves no doing apart from itself.{{reference needed|date=October 2018}} A classical example of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: [[medical theory]] involves trying to understand the [[Causality|causes]] and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.{{efn|1= See for example [[Hippocrates]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&amp;highlight=medical%2Ctheory Praeceptiones, Part 1].  {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140912175614/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&amp;highlight=medical%2Ctheory |date = September 12, 2014 }} }}

In modern [[science]], the term "theory" refers to [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], a well-confirmed type of explanation of [[nature]], made in a way [[Consistency|consistent]] with [[scientific method]], and fulfilling the [[Scientific theory#Characteristics of theories|criteria]] required by [[modern science]]. Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] support for, or empirically contradict ("[[Falsifiability|falsify]]") it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schafersman |first=Steven D. |title=An Introduction to Science |url = http://www.geo.sunysb.edu/esp/files/scientific-method.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word ''[[hypothesis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medicine|first1=National Academy of Sciences, Institute of|title=Science, evolution, and creationism|date=2008|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0309105862|page=11|edition=|url=http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable [[conjecture]]s, and from [[scientific laws]], which are descriptive accounts of how nature behaves under certain conditions.

== Ancient uses ==
The English word ''theory'' derives from a technical term in [[philosophy]] in [[Classical Greece|Ancient Greek]]. As an everyday word, ''[[theoria]]'', {{lang|grc|θεωρία}}, meant "a looking at, viewing, beholding", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to [[contemplation|contemplative]] or [[speculative reason|speculative]] understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|natural things]], such as those of [[natural philosopher]]s, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans.{{efn|1=The word ''theoria'' occurs in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]], for example, that of [[Plato]]. It is a statement of how and why particular facts are related. It is related to words for {{lang|grc|θεωρός}} "spectator", {{lang|grc|θέα}} ''thea'' "a view" + {{lang|grc|ὁρᾶν}} ''horan'' "to see", literally "looking at a show". See for example [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=qewr&amp;lang=greek dictionary entries at Perseus website].}} English-speakers have used the word ''theory'' since at least the late [[16th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|theory|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern uses of the word ''theory'' derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and [[reason|rational]] explanation of the general [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of things.

Although it has more mundane meanings in Greek, the word {{lang|grc|θεωρία}} apparently developed special uses early in the recorded history of the [[Greek language]]. In the book ''From Religion to Philosophy'', [[F. M. Cornford|Francis Cornford]] suggests that the [[Orphics]] used the word ''theoria'' to mean "passionate sympathetic contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From religion to philosophy: a study in the origins of western speculation |last=Cornford |first=Francis Macdonald |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=November 8, 1991 |isbn=978-0-691-02076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] changed the word to mean a passionate sympathetic contemplation of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence. Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory. Thus, it was Pythagoras who gave the word ''theory'' the specific meaning that led to the classical and modern concept of a distinction between theory (as uninvolved, neutral thinking) and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Bertrand Russell |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]] |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's terminology, as already mentioned, contrasts theory with ''praxis'' or practice, and this contrast remains today. For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different. Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as [[nature (philosophy)|nature]], so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create. On the other hand, ''praxis'' involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends. Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of ''praxis'' or doing.{{efn|1= 
The [[A Greek–English Lexicon|LSJ]] cites two passages of Aristotle as examples, both from the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and involving the definition of [[natural science]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1064a 11.1064a17], "it is clear that natural science (φυσικὴν ἐπιστήμην) must be neither practical (πρακτικὴν) nor productive (ποιητικὴν), but speculative (θεωρητικὴν)" and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D1025b 6.1025b25], "Thus if every intellectual activity [διάνοια] is either practical or productive or speculative (θεωρητική), physics (φυσικὴ) will be a speculative [θεωρητική] science." So Aristotle actually made a three way distinction between practical, theoretical and productive or technical—or between doing, contemplating or making. All three types involve thinking, but are distinguished by what causes the objects of thought to move or change.}}

== Theories formally and scientifically ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}
Theories are [[analysis|analytical]] tools for [[understanding]], [[explanation|explaining]], and making [[prediction]]s about a given subject matter. There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the [[art]]s and [[science]]s. A formal theory is [[syntax (logic)|syntactic]] in nature and is only meaningful when given a [[semantics|semantic]] component by applying it to some content (e.g., [[fact]]s and relationships of the actual historical world as it is unfolding). Theories in various fields of study are expressed in [[natural language]], but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the [[formal language]] of [[mathematical logic]]. Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of [[reason|rational thought]] or [[logic]].

Theory is constructed of a set of [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] that are entirely true statements about the subject under consideration. However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory. Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is, in ordinary language, where statements such as "He is a terrible person" cannot be judged as true or false without reference to some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of who "He" is and for that matter what a "terrible person" is under the theory.&lt;ref name="curry"&gt;Curry, Haskell, ''Foundations of Mathematical Logic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes two theories have exactly the same [[explanatory power]] because they make the same predictions. A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or [[observational equivalence|observationally equivalent]], and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference.

The [[metatheory|form of theories]] is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in [[model theory]]. When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under application of certain procedures called [[rules of inference]]. A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of [[axioms]] (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference. A [[theorem]] is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference. Theories used in applications are [[abstraction]]s of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems. Obvious examples include [[arithmetic]] (abstracting concepts of number), [[geometry]] (concepts of space), and [[probability]] (concepts of randomness and likelihood).

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that no consistent, [[recursively enumerable]] theory (that is, one whose theorems form a recursively enumerable set) in which the concept of [[natural numbers]] can be expressed, can include all [[truth|true]] statements about them. As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories. (Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.) This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge.

===Underdetermination===
{{Main|Underdetermination}}
A theory is ''underdetermined'' (also called ''indeterminacy of data to theory'') if a rival, inconsistent theory is at least as consistent with the evidence. Underdetermination is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] issue about the relation of [[evidence]] to conclusions.

A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a [[hypothesis]].

===Intertheoretic reduction and elimination===
{{Main|Intertheoretic reduction}}
If a new theory better explains and predicts a phenomenon than an old theory (i.e., it has more [[explanatory power]]), we are [[Theory of justification|justified]] in believing that the newer theory describes reality more correctly. This is called an ''intertheoretic reduction'' because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our historical understanding about ''sound'', "light" and ''heat'' have been reduced to ''wave compressions and rarefactions'', ''electromagnetic waves'', and ''molecular kinetic energy'', respectively. These terms, which are identified with each other, are called ''intertheoretic identities.'' When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely.

When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an ''intertheoretic elimination.'' For instance, the [[superseded scientific theories|obsolete scientific theory]] that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of [[caloric fluid]] was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that [[phlogiston]] is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen.

===Theories vs. theorems===
Theories are distinct from [[theorem]]s. A ''theorem'' is [[formal proof|derived]] deductively from [[axiom]]s (basic assumptions) according to a [[formal system]] of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms. ''Theories'' are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are '[[rigor]]ously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made. An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.

==Scientific theories==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}
In science, the term "theory" refers to "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been [[Reproducibility|repeatedly confirmed]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=2 National Academy of Sciences], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution/qanda.shtml AAAS Evolution Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources ([[consilience]]).

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictions]] with respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing [[technology]] or curing [[disease]].

===Definitions from scientific organizations===
The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] defines scientific theories as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The formal scientific definition of "theory" is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence.  Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=11 National Academy of Sciences] (2008), ''Science, Evolution, and Creationism.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory." It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.&lt;ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that the term ''theory'' would not be appropriate for describing untested but intricate hypotheses or even [[Scientific modelling|scientific models.]]

=== Philosophical views===
The [[logical positivist]]s thought of scientific theories as ''deductive theories''—that a theory's content is based on some [[formal system|formal system of logic]] and on basic [[axioms]]. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a [[logical consequence]] of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory.&lt;ref name="curry"/&gt; This is called the [[received view of theories]].

In the [[semantic view of theories]],  which has largely replaced the received view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppe |first1=Frederick |year=1998 |title=Understanding Scientific Theories: An Assessment of Developments, 1969-1998 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=67 |pages=S102–S115 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/392812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halvorson |first1=Hans |year=2012 |title=What Scientific Theories Could Not Be |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/halvorson2012.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/664745}}&lt;/ref&gt; theories are viewed as [[scientific models]]. A [[Scientific model|model]] is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria. (See [[Scientific theory#Theories as models|Theories as models]] for further discussion.)

===In physics===
In [[physics]] the term ''theory'' is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic [[postulates]] (usually symmetries, like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. One good example is [[classical electromagnetism]], which encompasses results derived from [[gauge symmetry]] (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called [[Maxwell's equations]]. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of electromagnetism", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested.

=== Regarding the term ''theoretical'' ===
Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, if it is already supported by sufficiently strong evidence. For example, certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally using the term "theoretical." These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory.

== Philosophical theories ==
{{Main|Philosophical theory}}
A theory can be either ''descriptive'' as in science, or ''prescriptive'' ([[normative ethics|normative]]) as in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kneller|first1=George Frederick|title=Introduction to the philosophy of education|date=1964|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OQhAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:UOM39015026974538|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of [[idea]]s. At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through [[empiricism|empirical observation]].

A field of study is sometimes named a "theory" because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject. These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples include [[set theory]] and [[number theory]]; however [[literary theory]], [[critical theory]], and [[music theory]] are also of the same form.

=== Metatheory ===
{{Main|Metatheory}}
One form of philosophical theory is a ''metatheory'' or ''meta-theory''. A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories. In other words, it is a theory about theories. [[Statement (logic)|Statements]] made in the metatheory about the theory are called [[metatheorem]]s.

== Political theories ==
{{Main|Political theory}}
A political theory is an [[ethics|ethical]] theory about the law and government. Often the term "political theory" refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about [[politics]].

== Jurisprudential theories ==
{{Main|Jurisprudence|Law}}
In social science, [[jurisprudence]] is the philosophical theory of law. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">'''Transformative arts''' is the use of artistic activities, such as [[Storytelling|story-telling]], [[painting]], and [[Musical composition|music-making]], to precipitate constructive individual and social change.

The individual changes effected through transformative arts are commonly [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Emotion|emotional]]. This results from the way participation in a [[Creativity|creative process]] and pursuit of an artistic practice can promote a critical re-evaluation of previously held [[Belief|beliefs]], accompanied by unfamiliar [[Feeling|feelings]], which alters [[Social perception|perception]] of the world, oneself, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, S., 2012. Transformative art: art as means for long-term neurocognitive change. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 6, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social changes effected through transformative arts occurs when this altered perception manifests in new ways of interacting with others.&lt;ref&gt;Vail, J. and Hollands, R., 2013. Creative democracy and the arts: The participatory democracy of the Amber Collective. Cultural Sociology, 7(3), pp.352-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although engagement in artistic activities has been integral to the means by which individuals and communities have sought [[Comfort|personal comfort]], [[Self-reflection|self-reflection]], and [[Group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] for thousands of years, the origin of transformative arts as a modern formal concept is commonly attributed to the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, P., 2006. How John Dewey's theories underpin art and art education. Education and culture, pp.17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey espoused four main ideas around which transformative arts pivot. Firstly, art is not an object but an experience, in which one or more persons participate. Secondly, every individual is potentially an artist by way of his or her capacity to participate in this experience, through any artistic activity. Thirdly, such participation inevitably precipitates some kind of transformative change to how the participants think, feel, and [[behave]]. Fourthly, art is therefore both psychological and social, transforming not only individual intrapersonal processes, but also interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;John, D., 1934. Art as experience. New York: Minton, Balch, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, transformative arts are facilitated by artists with the psychological purpose of promoting individual [[introspection]],&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, S.L. and Myers, C.E. eds., 2015. Therapists Creating a Cultural Tapestry: Using the Creative Therapies Across Cultures. Charles C Thomas Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the social purpose of promoting [[Social_exclusion#Social_inclusion|inclusion]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[social justice|justice]].&lt;ref&gt;LeBaron, M. and Sarra, J. eds., 2018.

The term '''tribe''' or '''digital tribe'''&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digital Tribes - Creating Behaviour Change in Users - The UX Review|url = http://theuxreview.co.uk/digital-tribes-creating-behaviour-change-users/|website = The UX Review|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used as a [[slang]] term for an unofficial [[community]] of people who share a common interest, and usually who are loosely affiliated with each other through [[social media]] or other [[Internet]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;mechanisms. The term is related to "''[[tribe]]''", which traditionally refers to people closely associated in both [[geography]] and [[genealogy]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tribes and Tribal: Origin, Use, and Future of the Concept|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260405121_Tribes_and_Tribal_Origin_Use_and_Future_of_the_Concept|website = ResearchGate|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, it looks more like a [[virtual community]] or a personal network and it is often called global digital tribe. Most [[anthropologist]]s agree that a tribe is a (small) [[society]] that practices its own customs and [[culture]], and that these define the tribe. The tribes are divided into [[clan]]s, with their own customs and [[cultural values]] that differentiate them from activities that occur in 'real life' contexts. People feel more inclined to share and defend their [[idea]]s on [[social network]]s than they would dare to say to someone face to face. For example, it would be ridiculous to '[[Poke (Facebook)|poke]]' someone in real life.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning with 'e's: Global digital tribe|url = http://steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/global-digital-tribe.html|website = steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "[[tribe]]" originated around the time of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states and the early formation of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Latin]] term "tribus" has since been transformed to mean "''A group of persons forming a [[community]] and claiming descent from a common [[ancestor]]''" (Oxford English Dictionary, IX, 1933, p.&amp;nbsp;339, as cited in Fried, 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;7). As years passed by, the range of meanings have grown greater, for example, "''Any of various systems of [[social organization]] comprising several local [[village]]s, [[Tribe (Native American)|band]]s, [[districts]], lineages, or other groups and sharing a common [[Ancestor|ancestry]], [[language]], [[culture]], and [[name]]''" (Morris, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;1369). Morris (1980) also notes that a [[tribe]] is a "''group of persons with a common occupation, interest, or [[habit]],''" and "''a large family.''"&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Vestiges of ancient tribe communities were preserved in both large gatherings (like [[football]] matches) and in small ones (like [[Church (building)|church]] [[Community|communities]]). Even though nowadays the range of groups referred to as tribal is truly enormous, it wasn't until the [[industrial society]] eroded the tribal gatherings of more primitive societies and redefined [[community]]. However, the existence of [[social media]] as we know it today is due to the [[post-industrial society]] that has seen the rapid growth of [[personal computer]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and [[Internet|the Internet]]. People now can [[Collaboration|collaborate]], [[Communication|communicate]], celebrate, commemorate, give their advice and share their ideas around these virtual clans that have once again redefined the [[Social behavior|social behaviour]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The first attempt of such social [[Community|communities]] dates back to at least 2003, when [[tribe.net]] was launched.

=== tribe.net starting point ===
Tribe Networks is the driving force behind [[tribe.net]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = tribe.net|url = http://www.tribe.com/|website = tribe.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[website]] similar to other [[Social networking websites|social networking]] sites. Users can create their own profiles and join networks, called 'tribes', based on common interests. Moreover, members can post job offers and event recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why did tribe.net (Mark Pincus) not work out? - Quora|url = https://www.quora.com/Why-did-tribe.net-(Mark-Pincus)-not-work-out|website = www.quora.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribe serves 50 metropolitan [[market (place)|market]]s, its largest being the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New York City]]. The firm was found in July 2003 by [[Mark Pincus]], Paul Martino and Valerie Syme, with the goal of connecting local people for what Pincus described as "''an online cocktail party where people are getting leads through their friends. So people are there to have fun and connect and meet new people.''" Soon the site caught the attention of [[Knight Ridder]], The Washington Post Company and blue chip venture firm Mayfield, which both totally invested around $6.3 million in [[venture capital]]. After three months of activity, Tribe brought together 48,000 registered users and 6,900 distinct tribes, earning revenue from job postings and class fields.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Vault Guide to the Top Internet Industry Employers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OPjwN9_FmkYC|publisher = Vault Inc.|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9781581313840|first = Laurie|last = Pasiuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes from a technical perspective ==
Not only do [[Twitter]] tribes have mutual interests,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The rise of the Twitter tribes|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/02/twitter-tribes-lady-gaga-rihanna|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-01|first = Michael|last = Cragg}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also share potentially [[subconscious]] [[language]] features as found in the 2013 study by researchers from [[Royal Holloway University of London]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Dr. John Bryden from the School of Biological Sciences at Royal Holloway states that it is possible to anticipate which community somebody is likely to belong to,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Which Twitter tribe are you? Researchers discover new wave of online communities which even have their own languages|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2293912/Twitters-online-tribes-revealed-Users-forming-distinct-communities-languages-study-shows.html|website = Mail Online|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 80 percent accuracy. This research shows that people try to join [[Society|societies]] based on the same interests and [[Hobby|hobbies]]. In order to achieve this, publicly available messages were sent via Twitter to record conversations between two or more participants. As a result, each community can be characterised by their most used words. This approach can enrich new communities detection based on word analysis in order to automatically classify people inside [[social network]]s. The methods of identification of tribes relied heavily on [[algorithm]]s and techniques from [[statistical physics]], [[computational biology]] and [[network science]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network Twitter|url = http://www.epjdatascience.com/content/2/1/3|journal = EPJ Data Science|date = 2013-02-25|issn = 2193-1127|pages = 3|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1140/epjds15|first = John|last = Bryden|first2 = Sebastian|last2 = Funk|first3 = Vincent AA|last3 = Jansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twitter users forming tribes with own language, tweet analysis shows|url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/twitter-users-tribes-language-analysis-tweets|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-31|first = Jason|last = Rodrigues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = People with same interests or occupation form 'tribes' on Twitter {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report-people-with-same-interests-or-occupation-form-tribes-on-twitter-1811627|website = dna|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ickn.org/documents/Tribefinder_COINs18.pdf|title=Identifying Tribes on Twitter through Shared Context|last=Gloor|first=P.|last2=Fronzetti Colladon|first2=A.|date=|website=ICKN Intelligent Collaborative Knowledge Networks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11|last3=de Oliveira|first3=J.|last4=Rovelli|first4=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach is taken by Tribefinder.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The system is able to identify tribal affiliations of [[Twitter]] users using [[deep learning]] and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The system establishes to which tribes individuals belong through the analysis of their tweets and the comparison of their [[vocabulary]]. These tribal vocabularies are previously generated based on the vocabulary of tribal influencers and leaders using keywords expressing concepts, ideas and beliefs. 

The final step to make the system learn on how to associate random individuals with specific tribes consists of the analysis of the language these influential tribal leaders use through deep learning. In so doing, classifiers are created using embedding and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] (long short-term memory) models. Specifically, these classifiers work by collecting the Twitter feeds of all the users from the tribes that Tribefinder is training on. On these, [[embedding]] is applied to map words into vectors, which are then used as input for the following LSTM models. Tribefinder analyzes the individual’s word usage in their tweets and then assigns the corresponding alternative realities, lifestyle, and recreation tribal affiliation based on the similarities with the specific tribal vocabularies. 

== An in-depth look into the research ==
The research had four main stages on which it focused: background, results, conclusions and methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Background ===
The [[language]] is a system of [[communication]] consisting of [[phoneme|sounds]], words, and [[grammar]], or the system of [[communication]] used by people in a particular [[country]] or type of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = language Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/language|website = dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is perhaps the most important characteristic that distinguishes human beings from other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M.A, Jansen, V.A.A., and Plotkin, J.B 2000. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v404/n6777/abs/404495a0.html] Nature, 404, pp.495-498.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has a wide range of social implications that can be associated with [[Social group|social or cultural groups]]. People usually group in communities with the same interests. This will result in a variation of the words they use because of the differentiation of terms from each domain. Therefore, the [[Hypothesis of a theorem|hypothesis]] of this study would be that this variation should closely match the community structure of the [[Social network|network]]. To test this theory, around 250,000 users from the [[List of social networking websites|social networking]] and [[microblogging]] site Twitter were monitored in order to analyse whether the groups identified had the same language features or not. As Twitter uses unstructured data and users can send messages to any other users, the study had to be based on complex algorithms. These algorithms had to determine the word frequency inside messages between people and make a link to the groups they usually visited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Results and discussion ===
[[File:Word usage based tribes on Twitter, Bryden et al.png|thumb|517x517px|Communication between and within tribes of [[Twitter]] users [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] based on word usage. '''Tribes''' tend to communicate more within than between themselves.]]
The problem of detecting the community features is one of the main issues in the study of networking systems. [[Social network]]s naturally tend to divide themselves into communities or [[modules]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modularity and community structure in networks|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2006-06-06|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 1482622|pmid = 16723398|pages = 8577–8582|volume = 103|issue = 23|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0601602103|first = M. E. J.|last = Newman|arxiv = physics/0602124|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.8577N}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some world networks are too big so they must be simplified before information can be extracted.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = mapequation.org - publications|url = http://www.mapequation.org/publications.html|website = www.mapequation.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an effective way of dealing with this drawback for smaller communities is by using ''[[Modularity (programming)|modularity]]'' [[algorithm]]s in order to partition users into even smaller [[Social group|groups]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For larger ones, a more efficient algorithm called 'map equation' decomposes a [[Network topology|network]] into [[Modularity|modules]] by optimally compressing a description of information flows on the network.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Each community was therefore characterised according to the words they used the most, based on a ranking algorithm. To determine the significance of word usage differences, word endings and word lengths were also measured and showed that the [[pattern]] found was the correct one. Moreover, these studies also helped in predicting community membership of users, by comparing their own word frequencies with community word usage. This helped in forecasting which community a certain user is going to access based on the words that they are using.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Proportion of users whose community is correctly predicted.png|thumb|The proportion of users whose topological community association is correctly predicted by the study.|700x700px|none]]

=== Conclusions ===
[[File:An illustration of the method for predicting which community a user is embedded in.png|thumb|An illustration of the method for predicting which community a user is embedded in.|333x333px]]
The aim of this research was to study the bond between community structure in a social network environment and language use within the community . The striking pattern that was found suggests that people from different clans tend to use different words based on their own interests and hobbies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This study can show how people make friends based on the same [[vocabulary]] range that they use.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Even though this approach didn't manage to cover all people inside Twitter, it has several advantages over ordinary surveys that cover a smaller scale of groups: it is systematic, it is non-intrusive and it easily produces large volumes of rich [[data]]. Moreover, other cultural characteristics can be found out when extending this study. For example, whether individuals that belong to multiple communities use different word sets in each of them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methods ===
A process called [[Snowball sampling|snowball-sampling]] helped forming the sample [[Network topology|network]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network Twitter - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds15/fulltext.html|doi = 10.1140/epjds15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each user's [[Twitter|tweets]] and messages were recorded and any new users referenced were added to a list from where they were picked to be sampled. Messages that were copies have been ignored. In order to find out the words that characterise each clan, the fraction of people that use a certain word was compared with the fraction of people that use that word globally. The difference between communities has also been measured by comparing the relative word usage frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Last but not least, individual word usage was compared with each community word usage to pick the best matching clan for individual users.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Different language misspellings within tribes ==
[[Word]]s, and the way we [[Spelling|spell]] them are in a continuous change, as we find new ways to communicate. Despite the fact that traditional [[Dictionary|dictionaries]] don't take into account the changes, online ones have adopted many of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Misspellings show language's evolution, but does that mean they're OK for journalists to use? {{!}} Poynter.|url = http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/161298/misspellings-show-languages-evolution-but-does-that-mean-theyre-ok-for-journalists-to-use/|website = www.poynter.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting fact outlined in the research above is that communities tend to use their own misspelt words. According to Professor Vincent Jansen from [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] communities would misspell words in different ways, just as people have different regional [[Diacritic|accents]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, [[Justin Bieber]] fans tend to end words in ''"ee"'' as in ''"pleasee"'', while school teachers tend to use long words. Moreover, the largest group found in the study was composed of [[African American]]s who were using the words ''"[[nigga]]"'', ''"poppin"'', and ''"chillin"''. Members of this community also had the common habit of shortening the ends of the words, replacing ''"ing"'' with ''"in"'' and ''"er"'' with ''"a"''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== The campfire ==
Each tribe has an [[Electronic trading platform|online-platform]] (such as [[Flickr]] or [[Tumblr]]), called campfire around which they gather. These campfires tend to enable one or more of the following three tribal activities:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* [[Cooperation]] (e.g. [[Wikipedia]])
* [[Communication]] (e.g. [[Social network]]s)
* [[Cognition]] (e.g. [[Blogs]])
However, some brands are building their own tribes around [[Platforms (computing)|platforms]] outside of these.

== Cooperation ==
[[Cooperation]] is the action of working together to the same end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cooperation - definition of cooperation in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cooperation|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation developed naturally over time, as it helped companies to streamline their research costs and to better answer to users' requirements. As a result, nowadays organisations are looking for flexible structures that can easily adapt to this rapidly changing environment. [[Collaborative software|Groupware]] systems perfectly cater to these needs of companies. Informal [[communication]] predominates and specialists in certain domains exchange their experience with other people within the groupware environment. [[Collaboration]] and cooperation are available through instant messages; people can discuss, chat and swap ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Software Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_SklFgSidxQC|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2009-03-31|isbn = 9781605660615|first = Tiako, Pierre|last = F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, people can work together while they are located remotely from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is groupware? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchdomino.techtarget.com/definition/groupware|website = SearchDomino|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groupware can be split into three categories: '''communication''', '''collaboration''' and '''coordination''', depending on the level of cooperation and technology involved in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Groupware: Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest and well-known cooperation software is Wikipedia.
[[File:Wikipedia-logo-v2-en.svg|thumb|The logo of Wikipedia]]

=== Wikipedia ===
[[Wikipedia]] is a [[Collaborative real-time editor|collaborative software]] because anyone can edit it. You can edit articles, view past revisions and discuss through a forum the current state of each article. Due to the fact that anyone can change it and find [[information]] very quickly, it has become one of the 10 most accessed sites on the Internet.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Advantages ====
Wikipedia has many advantages over other encyclopedias:&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using the Web to Get Stuff Done: What is Wikipedia?|url = http://www.gcflearnfree.org/using-the-web-to-get-stuff-done/what-is-wikipedia|website = GCFLearnFree.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Advantages and Disadvantages Of Using Wikipedia For Research  - Youth Village|url = http://www.youthvillage.co.za/2014/10/advantages-disadvantages-using-wikipedia-research/|website = Youth Village|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It's free and open for anyone on the Internet;
* All past edits and chats from the forum are public and everyone can see them;
* Updates happen frequently;
* It contains millions of articles;
* Easy to use and learn;

==== Disadvantages ====
However, there are also some drawbacks:&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* Information can be inaccurate;
* It is open to [[Spamming|spam]] and [[vandalism]];
* Some articles can contain omissions and be hard to understand;
* It can be too open sometimes (for [[Confidentiality|confidential]] documentation);
* It requires Internet connectivity.

== Communication ==
[[Communication]] is the act or an instance of communicating; the imparting or exchange of [[information]], [[idea]]s, or [[feeling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "communication" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/communication|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication has drastically changed over time and [[social network]]s have changed the way people [[Communication|communicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.solari.net/documents/position-papers/Solari-Social-Media-and-Communication.pdf|title = Social Media and Its Effect on Communication|date = 2014|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = http://www.solari.net/|publisher = Solari Communication|last = Maggiani|first = Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though people]can interact with each other 24/7, there is a new wave of barriers and [[threat]]s. In the [[workplace]] environment, electronic Communication has overtaken face-to-face and voice-to-voice Communication by far. This major shift has been done in advantage of [[Millennials|Generation Y]], who prefer [[instant messaging]] than talking directly to someone. It is often said that it could become an ironic twist, but [[social media]] has the real potential of making us less social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Social Media Sabotaging Real Communication?|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/susantardanico/2012/04/30/is-social-media-sabotaging-real-communication/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are studies that confirm that people are becoming more social, but the style in which they interact with each other has changed a lot. One of the major drawbacks of social networks is [[privacy]], as people tend to trust others more rapidly and send more open [[message]]s about themselves. As a result, personal information can be easily exposed to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Media and Interpersonal Communication|url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/051313p10.shtml|website = www.socialworktoday.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] are two of the biggest social networks in the world.

=== Facebook ===
{{essay|section|date=December 2015}}
[[Facebook]] is currently the largest social network in the world with more than 1 billion people using this website. This actually means that one in seven people on Earth use Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From relationships to revolutions: seven ways Facebook has changed the world|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/28/from-relationships-to-revolutions-seven-ways-facebook-has-changed-the-world|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-01|first = Jessica|last = Elgot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook users share their stories, images and videos in order to celebrate and commemorate events together. They can also play [[social network game|social games]] and like other Facebook pages.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Moreover, there is also a section called {{'}}''News Feed''{{'}} where users can see social information from their [[Friendship|friends]] or from the pages that they liked or shared. Each user has their own profile page that is called 'wall', where they can post all the above-mentioned materials (their friends can do this as well).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=etd_mas_theses|title = The Virtual Campfire: An Ethnography of Online Social Networking|date = May 2008|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/|publisher = Wesleyan University|last = Ryan|first = Jennifer Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage of Facebook is that you can make new friends, as well as find old [[Interpersonal relationship|acquaintances]] and restart [[Socialization|socialising]] with them. One of the most useful feature of Facebook is the existence of [[Social group|groups]]. Users with the same interests can create a new group or take part in already existing ones to debate information and exchange their ideas. However, there are also groups that are created to declare an affiliation, such as an obsession for different subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Group Dilemma|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/the-group-dilemma/2249512130|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] is another social network that allows users to send and read short messages called 'tweets'. Even though messages can contain only 140 characters, this is the perfect length for sending status updates to followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New user FAQs|url = https://support.twitter.com/articles/13920|website = Twitter Help Center|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of Twitter is that people can gain followers quickly and share ideas and [[links (web browser)|links]] very fast. There are [[Social network|network]]s of influential people who can be connected via Twitter.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twitter: Top 5 Ways to Find Your Tribe|url = http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2012/01/twitter-top-5-ways-to-find-your-tribe/|website = The Book Designer|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Twitter, tribes manifest themselves as followers of either a person, a company or an institution. As a result, it can be used as a [[marketing]] tool to make someone's [[product (business)|product]] visible, on condition that a big tribe of followers is created. In order to do this, the right community must be built, as finding the right people can be a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Build Your Twitter Tribe|url = http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-build-your-twitter-tribe/|website = Social Media Examiner|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some steps that users could take into account in order to make connections and therefore make people follow them: search using Twitter search, follow the followers of other users, look at Twitter Lists, use #[[Hashtag]]s and find [[Third-party developer|third-party]] programs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Cognition ==
[[Cognition]] is the mental action or process of acquiring [[knowledge]] and understanding through [[thought]], [[experience]] and [[sense]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cognition - definition of cognition in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cognition|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; People like to share their ideas and gather together via [[blog]]s. A blog is an online [[Diary|journal]] where people express themselves and want to get their voice heard. People tend to frequent blog communities due to the fact that they offer specific information in which the reader is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|url = http://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|website = Blog Basics|publisher = https://www.google.com/+Blogbasics|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[business]] blogs that can be used to share information within a company. These can be used as a flexible medium, where employees can be informed about topics that can range from the use of new [[technology]] to the company policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Help - IBM Connections|url = https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/help/index.jsp?topic=%252Fcom.ibm.lotus.connections.blogs.help%252Fc_welcome_blogs.html|website = www.ibm.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On blogs, people tend to gather in tribes or [[clan]]s if they find information that can satisfy their interests. In order to accomplish this goal, bloggers title their postings in such way that they can catch people's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Medical Web Design {{!}} Medical Marketing {{!}} Medical Web Development|url = http://www.mednet-tech.com/newsletter/blogs/what-are-blogs|website = www.mednet-tech.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage of blogs is that bloggers tend to help each other when someone feels at a loss due to the fact that some bonds might have been created inside the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Blog Tip Friday: Create your blogging tribe|url = http://www.honestmom.com/2013/04/05/blog-tip-friday-create-your-blogging-tribe/|website = Honest Mom|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = Find a Tribe-Kirsten Oliphant|last = says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
As [[Seth Godin]] states, "''The Internet eliminated geography''".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People join tribes or clans because they find and share the same ideas and interests with other people.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The main disadvantage of old tribes is that they couldn't influence group behaviour. On the other hand, new tribes are self-sustaining and can survive without a leader, they are not necessarily dialogue based and they are long lasting. As it has been demonstrated within this article, tribes have influenced the way languages, organisations and cultures work.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; They have redefined old concepts with the help of social media and have changed the way people will interact in the future.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
