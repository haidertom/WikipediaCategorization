[[File:Angel f-artificial intelligence.svg|thumb|right|200px|Angel_F]]
'''Angel_F''' is a fictional child [[artificial intelligence]] that has been used in worldwide art performances focused on the issues of digital liberties, [[intellectual property]] and on the evolution of language and behaviour in information society. The character was created by [[Salvatore Iaconesi]] in 2007 as a hack to the '''Biodoll''' art performance by Italian artist '''Franca Formenti'''. 

The project revolves around the story of the technological sensual relationship between the Biodoll, a digital prostitute, and professor '''[[Derrick de Kerckhove]]''', culminating in the birth of the young artificial intelligence. The digital child morphed from a [[spyware]] program capturing internet users' browsing activities in order to gather text to feed an algorithmic language generating system (thus letting the "child" learn how to speak) and became a digital personality used by the artists for both online and real-world performances.

The project was later joined by '''Oriana Persico''' who curated communication and part of the theoretical approaches of the action.

The Angel_F project has been featured in books, magazines, national televisions, and has been invited to many worldwide conferences and events, both academic and artistic. 

On one occasion, in October 2007, Angel_F attended the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) in Rio de Janeiro as the only digital being invited to speak: the young artificial intelligence was featured with a video message concerning the struggles for digital liberties, privacy, knowledge sharing and access to networks and technologies.

==History==

Angel_F is an acronym which stads for ''Autonomous Non Generative E-volitive Life_Form''. The project was born in 2007 and resulted from the fusion of two contemporary art performances.

Franca Formenti, an Italian artist living in Varese, invented the Biodoll  &lt;ref name="bazzichelli"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bazzichelli | first1 = Tatiana | title = [[Networking. La rete come arte]] | publisher = [[Costa &amp; Nolan]] | year= 2006 | isbn = 88-7437-047-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; character in 2002 which began making its appearances first on the network and later in the physical world by using what were called "clones": young women, prostitutes, pornographic starlets, transsexuals and models interpreting the role of a digital prostitute. The Biodoll was an art performance focused on research emerging from the network of new forms of sexualities, and on the analysis of changes brought on by this transformation to the concepts of private and public spaces, privacy, and the possibility of creating multiple fluid identities through language and digital media. At the time the Biodoll character claimed a role in professor Derrick de Kerckhove's life, narratively seducing him and alluring him into joining in the performance, becoming the Biodoll's favourite lover.

The theme of fertility has always been central to the Biodoll performance: the digital prostitute was a wombless clone but desired giving birth to a son, the '''Bloki'''.

In a process starting in 2006 and ending in February 2007, Salvatore Iaconesi (xDxD.vs.xDxD) used his '''Talker''' &lt;ref name="pagliarini"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pagliarini | first = Luigi | first2 = Elisa |last2=Frauenfelder |first3=Clementina |last3=Gily |first4=Domenico |last4=Jervolino |first5=Iginio Sisto |last5=Lancia |first6=Francesca |last6=Marone |first7=Alberto |last7=Oliviero |first8=Santa |last8=Palumbo |first9=Dunia |last9=Pepe |first10=Rocco |last10=Pititto |first11=Franco |last11=Rubinacci |first12=Francesca |last12=Serra |first13=Rosetta |last13=Zan | title = Intelligenza Polimorfa on Scienze cognitive e aperture pedagogiche. Nuovi orizzonti nella formazione degli insegnanti | publisher = Franco Angeli | year = 2007 | location = Rome | isbn = 978-88-464-9547-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; linguistic artificial intelligence to animate the digital child conceived with prof. Derrick de Kerckhove: ''Angel_F''.

Iaconesi and Persico met in November 2006 and immediately started collaborating on the birth of Angel_F.

Angel_F was designed as a synthetic digital being composed through narrative, technological and [[cognitive psychology]] layers. The objective was to create iconic characteristics that resulted in being evocative and able to mimic human life up to a level in which bringing up a symbolic dialogue was possible. On the other side, the artificial identity was to implement and expose the cultural, emotional and relational ways that were typical of networked [[Ecology#Ecosystem|social ecosystems]], among those technologies, systems and infrastructures that entered and shaped people's daily lives.

The young '''[[Artificial life|digital being]]''' mimicked the evolution of a human baby: initially conceived inside the website of its digital mother it emulated the birth of a child by using the metaphor of a virus developing inside a website, taking progressively more space in the domain's databases and interfaces. Content was produced through the software by using small browser-based spyware techniques, through which Angel_F could [[Inference|infer]] the list of major portals that had been visited by the website's users.

The Biodoll website was invaded by this growing presence and, thus, Angel_F was born.

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) component of Angel_F was derived from another project, Talker,&lt;ref name="talker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iaconesi |first=Salvatore |title=Talker |url=http://www.artisopensource.net/talkers/index2.html |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620081106/http://www.artisopensource.net/talkers/index2.html |archivedate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through which internet users could build up the AI's linguistic network by feeding it their text and web clips. Angel_F used this component to generate sentences and phrases, publishing them on the interface and on selected blogs.

The parallel between the growth of the AI and that of a child kept building up and, just as children learn how to speak and act by observing their parents and the people around them, Angel_F used its spyware and AI components to learn, to navigate websites and web portals using '''[[web crawler]]''' based techniques, and to interact with other people by using the contents hosted and generated in its database to create surreal dialogues in blogs and websites.

A virtual school was created, called '''Talker Mind''',&lt;ref name="talkermind"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iaconesi |first=Salvatore |title=Talker Mind |url=http://www.artisopensource.net/talker_mind/ |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620083741/http://www.artisopensource.net/talker_mind/ |archivedate=20 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to narratively continue the AI's growth. Five professors ([[Massimo Canevacci]], [[Antonio Caronia]], [[Carlo Formenti]], [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] and [[Luigi Pagliarini]]) fed their texts and academic articles to Angel_F, simulating virtual asynchronous lessons by using a multi-blog structure.&lt;ref name="blogart"&gt;{{cite web|last=Agricola de Cologne |first=Wilfred |title=a+b blogart? |url=http://www.javamuseum.org/blog/?page_id=41 |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212161016/http://www.javamuseum.org/blog/?page_id=41 |archivedate=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[peer-to-peer]] system was also created at the time, named '''Presence'''. Its interface resembled the one of [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit videogames]] and the peer to peer users travelled in a starry space and were able to perform standard [[Instant messaging|Instant Messaging]] tasks, such as [[Online chat|chat]] and [[file sharing]]. The interactions were possible both among humans and digital beings. Angel_F was the first user of the Presence peer to peer system.

Angel_F entered the physical world as a baby-stroller mounted laptop computer that was used to let the digital child join events and conferences held worldwide.

The first public space performance was held in [[Milan]], when the Biodoll distributed a generative ''free press'' publication &lt;ref name="bloki1"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Bloki FreePreXXX | date = 20 February 2007 | url = http://www.digicult.it/2007/biodoll.asp | accessdate = 4 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091023080104/http://www.digicult.it/2007/biodoll.asp| archivedate= 23 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called the '''Bloki FreePreXXX''', its text was generated algorithmically and inserted into a prepared graphic layout).

The second performance was held in [[Rome]], at the '''[[Forte Prenestino]]''' on June 14, 2007, with a massive playroom created through computational graphics that people could interact with and that were generated by the AI.

Angel_F performed all over the world, both in artistic contexts and in academic ones. It was also used for the communication strategy of several activist groups on the themes of intellectual property and digital freedoms.

On '''June 22, 2007''' Angel_F presented the closing remarks for an '''Ipotesi per Assurdo''' &lt;ref name="ipotesi"&gt;{{cite web | last = Iaconesi | first = Salvatore | title = Ipotesi per Assurdo | url = http://www.slideshare.net/xdxd/ipotesi-per-assurdo | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorello"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cortiana | first = Fiorello | title = Condividi la Conoscenza | url = http://db.formez.it/ArchivioNews.nsf/7fab7a7a86803f49c1256ae800400917/e0fe4b680b8434cac12572f700334708/Testo/M2/condividi_conoscenza3_programma.pdf?OpenElement&amp;ei=7-TJSp_AO86OsAb085ThDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHk5FlR8u4tI39Rv-PQAro3_D_0KQ&amp;sig2=oDMREwxxZ76tCx919Tpuww | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Absurd Hypothesis) with Salvatore Iaconesi and Oriana Persico at the [[IULM| IULM University in Milan]], discussing the possibilities for an ecosystemic, sustainable reinvention of corporations.

On '''July 28, 2007''', hundreds of people at '''LiberaFesta''' (Free Party) in Rome listened to Angel_F in a speech discussing new politics and ''hacker ethics''.

On '''October 2007''', Angel_F was presented live at the ''FE/MALE 2'' event, as an example of an atypical family during a public debate on new sexualities and social change.

Again in '''October 2007''', Angel_F made a series of public performances [[Florence]]'s '''Festival della Creatività''' (Festival of Creativity), an institutional event held periodically to showcase Italy's and other countries' best technological projects. During the festival Derrick de Kerckhove publicly recognized the little AI as his digital son.&lt;ref name="derickpapa"&gt;{{cite web | last = de Kerckhove | first = Derrick | title = Festival della Creatività | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD3UVluoF0c | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''October 2008''', Angel_F was used at a public event on a European scale called '''Freedom not Fear''' discussing privacy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="fnf"&gt;{{cite web | title = Freedom Not Fear | url = http://www.artsblog.it/post/2428/incursione-digitale-di-angel_f-e-del-super-avatar-al-freedom-not-fear-in-esclusiva-per-i-lettori-di-artsblog | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately ('''July 2009''') Angel_F has been seen with its digital father Derrick de Kerckhove to protest against Italy's harsh politics on freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="angelino"&gt;{{cite web | title = Blogger Strike in Piazza Navona | url = http://www.artsblog.it/post/3645/angelino-is-watching-you | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case of censorship saw Angel_F involved, when it was not allowed to post its contribution to the '''DFIR''' (Dialogue Forum for Internet Rights) held in ''Rome'' on '''September 2007''' in preparation for Rio de Janeiro's Internet Governance Forum (IGF) edition.&lt;ref name="vetere"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vetere |first=Guido |title=L'identità di Angel_F |url=http://guidovetere.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/2007/09/angel_f.html |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114081406/http://guidovetere.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/2007/09/angel_f.html |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case quickly turned into a collaboration among the involved parties &lt;ref name="dicorinto"&gt;[[:it:Arturo Di Corinto|Arturo di Corinto]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Angel_F was invited to the global event in Brazil where it was the only present digital being: on that occasion Angel_F contributed a videomessage, in the digital freedoms workshop, which suggested some ideas for action to the [[United Nations]] and to all the parties involved in the global ''IGF'' organization.

==Background==

Angel_F mixes real technologically advanced systems with a poetic, narrative approach. In the performance real and not-real are constantly intermixed, and the concepts, techniques and characteristics of the whole project have been analyzed multiple times in several international academic events and research projects.

Angel_F's authors coined the term '''[[NeoRealismo Virtuale]]''' (Virtual NeoRealism) to identify the practices created and used in the project. Its intent is to describe and represent the contemporary world in its hybrid analog/digital form, with digital technologies progressively interacting and integrating to the physical world, even on the level of personal identity and private/public space definitions.

The '''Glocal &amp; Outsiders conference''' &lt;ref name="kera"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kera | first = Denisa | title = Glocal and Outsiders | url = http://glocaloutsiders.wordpress.com/ | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in '''[[Prague]]''' at the ''[[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Academy of Sciences]]'' in '''2007''' was the first academic presentation of the Angel_F project, together with the ''Biodoll''.

By '''December 2007''' several international associations,&lt;ref name="frontiere"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontiere Digitali |url=http://tv.frontieredigitali.net/convegni/liberazione-2007/angel_f-liberafesta-roma-luglio-2007 |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723132210/http://tv.frontieredigitali.net/convegni/liberazione-2007/angel_f-liberafesta-roma-luglio-2007 |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arcoiris"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arcoiris TV |url=http://www.arcoiris.tv/modules.php?name=Lettere&amp;op=esteso&amp;id=3328 |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723054811/http://www.arcoiris.tv/modules.php?name=Lettere&amp;op=esteso&amp;id=3328 |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and scientific researchers had been involved with Angel_F, eventually producing the system and process used to set up the ''Talker Mind'' digital school for the AI with Angel_F's professors.

On '''March 2008''' the [[Tecnológico de Monterrey]] university in [[Mexico City]] organized the '''Computer Art Congress 2''' &lt;ref name="cac2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Computer Art Congress | url = http://europia.org/CAC2/ | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; international event, featuring Angel_F's project among with the ones by scientific researchers worldwide.&lt;ref name="cac2book"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Zreik | first1 = Khaldoun | last2 = Reyes García | first2 = Everardo | first3 = Marc |last3=Veyrat |first4=Daniel |last4=Bouillot |first5=Jacques |last5=Ibanez Bueno |first6=Oriana |last6=Persico |first7=Salvatore |last7=Iaconesi | title = Angel_f, in Computer art congress: CAC 2 | publisher = Europia | year = 2008 | location = Mexico City | id = {{Listed Invalid ISBN|978-2-909285-45-0}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''July 2008''', the project was presented in [[Austria]] at the ''[[Planetary Collegium]]'''s '''[[Planetary_Collegium#The_Consciousness_Reframed_Conferences|Consciousness Reframed 9]]''' conference, together with the ''NeoRealismo Virtuale''.&lt;ref name="cr9"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ascott | first1 = Roy | last2 = Bast | first2 = Gerald | last3= Fiel | first3= Wolfgang  | first4 = Roy |last4=Ascott |first5=Gerald |last5=Bast |first6=Wolfgang |last6=Fiel |first7=Margarete |last7=Jahrmann |first8=Ruth |last8=Schnell |first9=Oriana |last9=Persico |first10=Salvatore |last10=Iaconesi | title = Technologically-aware ecosystems in Art and Society, New realities: Being Syncretic | publisher = Springer | year = 2008 | location = New York | isbn = 978-3-211-78890-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of 2009, the project continues, both artistically and academically.

A book is about to be published in '''November 2009''' by ''Castelvecchi Editore'' in Italy, titled '''Angel F. Diario di una intelligenza artificiale''' &lt;ref name="angel"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Iaconesi | first1 = Salvatore | last2 = Persico | first2 = Oriana | title = Angel F.

'''Basic Interoperable Scrambling System''', usually known as '''BISS''', is a satellite signal scrambling system developed by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] and a consortium of hardware manufacturers.
[[File:One News satellite ute, Mt Allan fire, NZ 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Mobile equipment to send news over a satellite link used by [[TVNZ]] news reporters.]]
Prior to its development, "''ad hoc''" or "occasional use" [[satellite]] news feeds were transmitted either using proprietary encryption methods (e.g. RAS, or PowerVu), or without any [[encryption]]. Unencrypted satellite feeds allowed anyone with the correct equipment to view the program material.

Proprietary encryption methods were determined by encoder manufacturers, and placed major compatibility limitations on the type of satellite receiver ([[Integrated receiver/decoder|IRD]]) that could be used for each feed. BISS was an attempt to create an "open platform" encryption system, which could be used across a range of manufacturers equipment.

[[File:BISSkeyscreen.jpg|thumb|Fields for entering BISS-keys on an Ericsson RX8200 IRD]]

There are mainly two different types of BISS encryption used:

* '''BISS-1''' transmissions are protected by a 12 digit [[hexadecimal]] "session key" that is agreed by the transmitting and receiving parties prior to transmission. The key is entered into both the encoder and decoder, this key then forms part of the encryption of the digital TV signal and any receiver with BISS-support with the correct key will decrypt the signal.
* '''BISS-E (E for encrypted)''' is a variation where the decoder has stored one secret BISS-key entered by for example a rightsholder. This is unknown to the user of the decoder. The user is then sent a 16-digit hexadecimal code, which is entered as a "session key". This session key is then mathematically combined internally to calculate a BISS-1 key that can decrypt the signal.
Only a decoder with the correct secret BISS-key will be able to decrypt a BISS-E feed. This gives rightsholder control as to exactly which decoder can be used to decrypt/decode a specific feed. Any BISS-E encrypted feed will have a corresponding BISS-1 key that will unlock it.

BISS-E is amongst others used by EBU to protect [[UEFA Champions League]] and other high-profile satellite feeds.

== Rationale ==
Traditional node-link methods for visualizing networks deteriorate in terms of legibility when dealing with large networks, due to the proliferation of edge crossings amassing as what are disparagingly termed 'hairballs'.&lt;ref name="KrzywinskiBirol2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krzywinski|first1=M.|last2=Birol|first2=I.|last3=Jones|first3=S. J.|last4=Marra|first4=M. A.|title=Hive plots--rational approach to visualizing networks|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=13|issue=5|year=2011|pages=627–644|issn=1467-5463|doi=10.1093/bib/bbr069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kosara | first = Robert | title = Graphs Beyond the Hairball | date = 2012-02-01 | url = https://eagereyes.org/techniques/graphs-hairball | accessdate = 2015-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BioFabric is one of a number of alternative approaches designed explicitly to tackle this scalability issue,&lt;ref name="KrzywinskiBirol2011" /&gt; choosing to do so by depicting nodes as lines on the horizontal axis, one per row; edges as lines on the vertical axis, one per column, terminating at the two rows associated with the endpoint nodes. As such, nodes and edges are each provided their own dimension (as opposed to solely the edges with nodes being non-dimensional points). BioFabric exploits the additional degree of freedom thus produced to place ends of incident edges in groups. This placement can potentially carry semantic information, whereas in node-link graphics the placement is often arbitrarily generated within constraints for aesthetics, such as during force-directed graph drawing, and may result in apparently informative artifacts.

Edges are drawn (vertically) in a darker shade than (horizontal) nodes, creating visual distinction. Additional edges increase the width of the graph.

Both ends of a link are represented as a square to reinforce the above effect even at small scales. Directed graphs also incorporate arrowheads.

== Development ==
The first version, 1.0.0, was released in July 2012. Development work on BioFabric is ongoing. An open source R implementation was released in 2013, ''RBioFabric'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/wjrl/RBioFabric |title=GitHub: wjrl/RBioFabric |last=Longabaugh |first=William |date= 2013-07-01 |accessdate=2015-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for use with the igraph package,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igraph.org/r/ |title=igraph R package |author=The igraph core team |accessdate=2015-03-07 |quote=Install and start using the igraph R package }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently described on the project weblog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biofabric.blogspot.co.uk/2013_07_01_archive.html |title=Combing the hairball: July 2013 |last=Longabaugh |first=William |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2015-03-07 |quote=Commentary about BioFabric (www.BioFabric.org), a new way to visualize networks. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach attaches semantic meaning to the length of the edge lines, and can be used to visualize the [[assortativity]] or dissortativity of a network.

'''Brain training''' (also called '''cognitive training''') is a program of regular mental activities purported to maintain or improve one's [[cognitive]] abilities. It reflects a [[hypothesis]] that cognitive abilities can be maintained or improved by exercising the [[brain]], analogous to the way [[physical fitness]] is improved by exercising the body.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;

Although there is strong evidence that aspects of brain structure remain "plastic" throughout life and that high levels of mental activity are associated with reduced risks of age-related [[dementia]], scientific support for the concept of "brain fitness" is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soveri |first1=Anna |last2=Antfolk |first2=Jan |last3=Karlsson |first3=Linda |last4=Salo |first4=Benny |last5=Laine |first5=Matti |title=Working memory training revisited: A multi-level meta-analysis of n-back training studies |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |date=23 January 2017 |volume=24|issue=4|pages=1077–1096|doi=10.3758/s13423-016-1217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/10/03/496120962/brain-game-claims-fail-a-big-scientific-test Brain Game Claims Fail A Big Scientific Test]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is infrequently used in academic literature, but is commonly used in the context of [[self-help]] books and commercial products.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exercise on the brain |author1=Sandra Aamodt |author2=Sam Wang |date=November 8, 2007 |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/08/opinion/08aamodt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Cognitive reserve]] is the capacity of a person to meet the various cognitive demands of life and is evident in an ability to assimilate information, comprehend relationships, and develop reasonable conclusions and plans. Cognitive training is a hypothesis that certain activities, done regularly, might help maintain or improve cognitive reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scarmeas|first=N|author2=Y Stern|title=Cognitive reserve and lifestyle|journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol|volume=25|pages=625–33|year=2003|doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.625.14576|pmid=12815500|issue=5|pmc=3024591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, companies offering products and services for cognitive training have marketed them as improving educational outcomes for children, and for adults as [[memory improvement|improving memory]], processing speed, and problem-solving, and even as preventing dementia or Alzheimers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yong|first1=Ed|title=The Weak Evidence Behind Brain-Training Games|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/the-weak-evidence-behind-brain-training-games/502559/|website=The Atlantic|date=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They often support their marketing with discussion about the educational or professional background of their founders, some discuss neuroscience that supports their approach—especially concepts of [[neuroplasticity]] and [[transfer of learning]], and some cite evidence from clinical trials.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;  The key claim made by these companies is that the specific training that they offer generalizes to other fields—academic or professional performance generally or everyday life.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;

As of 2016, there was some evidence that some of these programs improved performance on tasks in which users were trained, less evidence that improvements in performance generalize to related tasks, and almost no evidence that "brain training" generalizes to everyday cognitive performance; in addition most clinical studies were flawed.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simons |first1=DJ |last2=Boot |first2=WR |last3=Charness |first3=N |last4=Gathercole |first4=SE |last5=Chabris |first5=CF |last6=Hambrick |first6=DZ |last7=Stine-Morrow |first7=EA |title=Do "Brain-Training" Programs Work?|journal=Psychological science in the public interest  |publisher=Association for Psychological Science |date=October 2016|volume=17|issue=3|pages=103–86|pmid=27697851|url=http://psi.sagepub.com/content/17/3/103.full.pdf|doi=10.1177/1529100616661983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial programs==
[[Cogmed]] was founded in 2001, [[Posit Science Corporation|Posit Science]] in 2002, and ''[[Brain Age]]'' was first released in 2005,&lt;ref name=Conversation2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hurley|first1=Dan|title=The Science Behind 'Brain Training'|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/the-science-behind-brain-training/283634/|work=The Atlantic|date=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all capitalizing on the growing interest within the public in neuroscience, along with heightened worries by parents about ADHD and other learning disabilities in their children, and concern about their own cognitive health as they aged.&lt;ref name=Gunter2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunter|first1=Tracy D.|title=Can We Trust Consumers With Their Brains?

The launch of ''Brain Age'' in 2005 marked a change in the field, as prior to this products or services were marketed to fairly narrow populations (for example, students with learning problems), but ''Brain Age'' was marketed to everyone, with a significant media budget.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;   In 2005, consumers in the US spent $2 million on cognitive training products; in 2007 they spent about $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aamodt|first1=Sandra|last2=Wang|first2=Sam|title=Exercise on the Brain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/08/opinion/08aamodt.html|work=The New York Times|date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, "brain training" was a $1 billion industry.&lt;ref name=Conversation2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Benjamin|title=Brain-training isn't just a modern phenomenon, the Edwardians were also fans|url=http://theconversation.com/brain-training-isnt-just-a-modern-phenomenon-the-edwardians-were-also-fans-29515|work=The Conversation|date=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 the market was $1.3 billion, and software products made up about 55% of those sales.&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt;  By that time neuroscientists and others had a growing concern about the general trend toward what they called "neurofication", "neurohype", "neuromania", [[Educational neuroscience#Neuromyths|neuromyths]].&lt;ref name=Gunter2014/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
To address growing public concerns with regard to aggressive online marketing of brain games to older population, a group of neuroscientists published a letter in 2008 warning the general public that there is a lack of research showing effectiveness of brain games in elderly.&lt;ref name=ScienceNews2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Underwood |first1=Emily |title=Neuroscientists speak out against brain game hype |journal=Science |date=22 October 2014|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/neuroscientists-speak-out-against-brain-game-hype}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] found that there was insufficient evidence to recommend any method of preventing age-related memory deficits or [[Alzheimer's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = JW | date = Apr 2010 | title = Preventing Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/alzcog-evidence-report.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Evid Rep Technol Assess | volume = 193 | issue = 193| pages = 1–727 | pmid = 21500874 | pmc=4781578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 another group of scientists published a similar warning.&lt;ref name=ScienceNews2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Consensus on the Brain Training Industry from the Scientific Community|url=http://longevity3.stanford.edu/blog/2014/10/15/the-consensus-on-the-brain-training-industry-from-the-scientific-community-2/|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Stanford Center on Longevity|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, another group of scientists made a counter statement,&lt;ref name=Simons2016rev/&gt; organized and maintained by the Chief Scientific Officer of Posit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Cognitive Training Data|url=http://www.cognitivetrainingdata.org/about/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation and lawsuits==
Starting in January 2015, the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) sued companies selling "brain training" programs or other products marketed as improving cognitive function, including WordSmart Corporation, the company that makes [[Lumosity]], and Brain Research Labs (which sold [[dietary supplement]]s) for deceptive advertising;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Austin|first1=Neil|title=Brainstorm: FTC Continues Enforcement Trend Against Cognitive Function Claims|url=http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2016/05/brainstorm-ftc-continues-enforcement-trend-against-cognitive-function-claims/|work=Trademark and Copyright Law|date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  later that year the FTC also sued [[LearningRx]].&lt;ref name=CNN2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howard|first1=Jacqueline|title=Do brain-training exercises really work?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/health/brain-training-exercises/|work=CNN|date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTC found that Lumosity's marketing "preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive decline, suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, [[dementia]], and even [[Alzheimer's disease]]", without providing any scientific evidence to back its claims. The company was ordered not to make any claims that its products can "[improve] performance in school, at work, or in athletics" or "[delay or protect] against age-related decline in memory or other cognitive function, including mild cognitive impairment, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease", or "[reduce] cognitive impairment caused by health conditions, including Turner syndrome, [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI), stroke, or side effects of [[chemotherapy]]", without "competent and reliable scientific evidence", and agreed to pay a $50 million settlement (reduced to $2 million).&lt;ref name="FTC press release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumosity to Pay $2 Million to Settle FTC Deceptive Advertising Charges for Its "Brain Training" Program|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/01/lumosity-pay-2-million-settle-ftc-deceptive-advertising-charges|website=ftc.gov|publisher=U.S. Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=17 January 2016|date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-settlement&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumosity pays $2 million to FTC to settle bogus "Brain Training" claims|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/lumosity-pays-2-million-to-ftc-to-settle-bogus-brain-training-claims/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its lawsuit against LearningRx, the FTC said LearningRx had been "deceptively claim[ing] their programs were clinically proven to permanently improve serious health conditions like ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and concussions".&lt;ref name="Morran2016-05-18"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morran |first=Chris |date=2016-05-18 |title=LearningRx To Pay $200K For Allegedly Unproven Claims That Brain Training Can Improve Income, Treat Autism &amp; ADHD |url=https://consumerist.com/2016/05/18/learningrx-to-pay-200k-for-allegedly-unproven-claims-that-brain-training-can-improve-income-treat-autism-adhd/ |newspaper=[[Consumerist]] |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6leqfrVon?url=https://consumerist.com/2016/05/18/learningrx-to-pay-200k-for-allegedly-unproven-claims-that-brain-training-can-improve-income-treat-autism-adhd/ |archivedate=2016-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, LearningRx settled with the FTC by agreeing not to make the disputed assertions unless they had "competent and reliable scientific evidence" which was defined as [[randomized controlled trial]]s done by competent scientists." For the judgment's monetary component, LearningRx agreed to pay $200,000 of a $4 million settlement.&lt;ref name="Heilman2016-10-16"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heilman |first=Wayne |date=2016-10-16 |title=Lessons for LearningRx on comeback from federal lawsuit |url=http://gazette.com/lessons-for-learningrx-on-comeback-from-federal-lawsuit/article/1587895 |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] |accessdate=2016-10-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6leqL7kXw?url=http://gazette.com/lessons-for-learningrx-on-comeback-from-federal-lawsuit/article/1587895 |archivedate=2016-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business game''' (also called '''business simulation game''') refers to [[simulation game]]s that are used as an [[education]]al tool for teaching business. Business games may be carried out for various business training such as: general management, finance, organizational behaviour, human resources, etc. Often, the term "[[business simulation]]" is used with the same meaning.

A business game has been defined as "a game with a business environment that can lead to one or both of the following results: the training of players in business skills (hard and/or soft) or the evaluation of players' performances (quantitatively and/or qualitatively)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greco|first=Marco|author2=Baldissin, Nicola |author3=Nonino, Fabio |title=An Exploratory Taxonomy of Business Games|journal=Simulation &amp; Gaming|date=2013|volume=44|issue=5|pages=645–682|url=http://sag.sagepub.com/content/44/5/645.full.pdf+html|accessdate=4 May 2015|doi=10.1177/1046878113501464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business games are used as a [[teaching method]] in [[universities]], and more particularly in [[business schools]], but also for [[executive education]].

Simulation are considered to be an innovative learning method {{Harv|Aldrich|2004}}, and are often computer-based.

== History ==
Computer-supported business simulation originated from military war games and came into existence during the late 1950s {{Harv|Wells|1990}}. [[Business simulation game]]s, including non-computer-based board games and experiential activities, have since been used as a learning tool for teaching management {{Harv|Jackson|1959}} {{Harv|Andlinger|1958}}. It is regularly in use at Universities, and in particularly by major business schools. As an example, the [[University of Washington]] has been using business simulation game in classes since 1957 {{Harv|Saunders|1996|p=49}}.

The INTOP tool was developed at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1963, and was employed for teaching in 160 institutions worldwide over the period 1963–1995.  Its successor [[Intopia|INTOPIA]] was first released in 1995, and it has been used by universities in over 55 countries around the world, including 18 in the U.S.

Business games are also used within companies for management training and development {{Harv|Faria|1990}}.

'''CISV International''' (''Formerly'' '''''Children's International Summer Villages''''') was founded in 1951&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/about-cisv-int/founder/&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Doris Twitchell Allen]] and aims to educate and inspire action for a more just and peaceful world.

The organisation operates international educational programmes on an annual basis to bring together participants from member countries. CISV also operates in smaller communities through its around 200 local Chapters in 69 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisv.org/mycisv/national-chapter-officials-directory/about-us/our-world/|title="Our World"|last=|first=|date=1 March 2017|website=CISV International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CISV International is a [[UNESCO]] partner Non Governmental Organization (NGO), holds participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]] and is a candidate member of the [[European Youth Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/our-partners/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CISV was founded in 1951, after [[World War II]], by [[Doris Twitchell Allen]]. Since then, the organisation has expanded into around 69 countries, and over 150,000 delegates have participated in more than four thousand international CISV activities that delegates have made up over the course of these years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

For Dr. Allen and the CISV organisation, children and youth were seen as the ideal starting point for peace education.  Programmes were developed which offered young people opportunities to meet their peers from other countries and to form intercultural friendships and to learn about what life is really like where they come from. Local programmes give people the chance to learn about the cultures in their own communities and explore important themes related to peace and understanding.

The first village was held in 1951 in Glendale, Ohio; commissioned for its 50th anniversary, the sculpture "How Alike I Am to You” was created in 2000 by Tim Werrell and stands on the property of the Harry Whiting Brown Community Center in Glendale, Ohio.

==CISV programmes==
The CISV International delivers its education through its seven official programmes:

* Village: Today, delegations composed of four children and one adult "Leader" from 10–12 countries come together for a four-week programme for 11-year-old children, who participate in activities based around simple activities that indirectly promote peace and understanding of each other.  Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader. Additionally, there are five or six Junior Counsellors (JCs, age 16–17) invited, who should be a care-taking "older sibling" for the 11-year-old. There is also a STAFF that takes cares of the camp and it is, usually, a group of 5-6 adults. The staff is responsible for organizing all the structure so the camp can happen.
* Step Up: A three-week programme for participants 14–15 years of age. Delegations include 4 participants and an adult leader. In Step Up's participants can think of new rules for the camp, these will be discussed and voted upon in a so-called 'camp meeting'. Also, the delegates are largely responsible for putting together activities to promote social and leadership skills. Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader.
* Interchange: Involving only two countries, this programme spans up to two years. A delegation of 6–12 youth, aged 12–14, is selected from each participating country. In the programme one delegation will travel to visit for two or four weeks with the other's family.  After those weeks and a little time in between, the delegations reciprocate. Each delegation has one adult leader, and may also have a Junior Leader.
* Youth Meeting: An 8 or 15 day programme for either 12–13, 14–15, 16–18 or 19+. This programme is based on a specific theme. For youth 12–15 each delegation consists of six young people, and an adult leader. People at the age 16+ travel alone.
* Seminar Camp: A three-week programme for youth 17–18 in which there is one or more (but not more than four) delegates from each participating country.  Seminar Camps have a more direct educational approach, and youth are encouraged to form opinions on various world issues. Usually youth-directed, this program has only thirty participants in total.
* International People's Project:  CISV's newest international programme is open to people aged 19+ and is three weeks long. Participants participate in hands-on work contributing to a community project.
* Mosaic: Mosaic is a programme that consists of projects with educational content, developed by local CISV Chapters worldwide.  These projects empower individuals to be agents of change, reach out, and involve as many people as possible.

The CISV International website provides more detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/cisv-programmes/&lt;/ref&gt;

CISV Chapters also hold activities that aim to share the CISV experience within their local community.

In addition to this CISV International delivers its education through:

* '''Junior Branch (JB)''': Junior Branch is an integral, but self-governing youth-based part of the structure of CISV. Junior Branch develops intercultural skills and attitude through educational and administrative activities consistent with CISV Goals.
* '''Mini Camp''': A weekend long camp within the local chapter. It is planned and run by local Juniors and leaders, often the older members of the chapter. It is a chance for participants to have a camp like experience locally and allows potential delegates and JCs to have a taste what a few days at camp may be like. Often delegate, leader and JC selection takes place at Mini Camps and activities can range from sports, to simulation activities to guest speakers and much more. 
* CISV also has other things you can do, such as being a leader, more commonly meant for the Village, Step-Up, and Interchange (Also for NYM). They are the ones who take the delegations to the Camp/Village. There are also usually 6 Junior Counselors (JC's) on a Village picked from chapters around the world who provide a link between children and adults on Villages. They are age 16-17 and it is common for there to be 2 JCs from the country the camp is being held in. On every programme there is a Staff team, usually from the hosting country although there are sometimes international staff. They are incharge of all the doings of the camp with the help of the JC's and the Leaders. When a camp is being run there is always a need for Host Families. These are families who have participants to stay at their houses when the camp has either not begun yet, has ended and participants have some time to wait before their flights leave or, in the case of a Village, when the leaders weekend off is underway. Another thing which is important is Junior Branch. There are many roles to be taken on throughout your local and national Junior Branch, these vary from country to country and national junior branch roles are usually taken on by Juniors aged 16+, however, you can contribute in many ways; from helping to plan your Junior Branch meetings to helping to raise money to host programmes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21358">A '''catch bond''' is a type of [[noncovalent bond]] whose [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] lifetime increases with tensile force applied to the bond. Normally, bond lifetimes are expected to diminish with force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell GI |title=Models for the specific adhesion of cells to cells |journal=Science |volume=200 |issue=4342 |pages=618–27 |date=May 1978 |pmid=347575 |doi=10.1126/science.347575|bibcode=1978Sci...200..618B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of catch bonds, the lifetime of the bond actually increases up to a maximum before it decreases like in a normal bond. Catch bonds work in a way that is conceptually similar to that of a [[Chinese finger trap]]. While catch bonds are strengthened by an increase in force, the force increase is not necessary for the bond to work. Catch bonds were suspected for many years to play a role in the rolling of [[leukocyte]]s, being strong enough to roll in presence of high forces caused by high [[shear stress]]es, while avoiding getting stuck in capillaries where the fluid flow, and therefore shear stress, is low. The existence of catch bonds was debated for many years until strong evidence of their existence was found in bacteria.&lt;ref name="Thomas WE, Trintchina E, Forero M, Vogel V, Sokurenko EV 2002 913–23"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas WE, Trintchina E, Forero M, Vogel V, Sokurenko EV |title=Bacterial adhesion to target cells enhanced by shear force |journal=Cell |volume=109 |issue=7 |pages=913–23 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12110187 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00796-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definite proof of their existence came shortly thereafter in leukocytes.&lt;ref name="Marshall BT, Long M, Piper JW, Yago T, McEver RP, Zhu C 2003 190–3"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall BT, Long M, Piper JW, Yago T, McEver RP, Zhu C |title=Direct observation of catch bonds involving cell-adhesion molecules |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6936 |pages=190–3 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12736689 |doi=10.1038/nature01605|bibcode=2003Natur.423..190M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Catch bonds were first proposed in 1988 in the [[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] by M. Dembo et al. while at [[Harvard University]]. While studying the critical tension required to detach a membrane bound to a surface through adhesion molecules, it was found that some adhesion molecules bound more tightly in response to tensions higher than the critical tension. The term "catch bonds" was coined by Dembo to explain these unexpected observations.&lt;ref name="reaction-limited kinetics"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dembo M, Torney DC, Saxman K, Hammer D |title=The reaction-limited kinetics of membrane-to-surface adhesion and detachment |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B |volume=234 |issue=1274 |pages=55–83 |date=June 1988 |pmid=2901109 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1988.0038|bibcode=1988RSPSB.234...55D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No decisive evidence of catch bonds was found until 2003. This is due to experimental conditions that were unfavorable for detecting catch bonds, as well as the counterintuitive nature of the bonds themselves. For example, most early experiments were conducted in 96 well plates, an environment that does not provide any flow. Some experiments failed to produce shear stress that is now known to be critical to lengthen the lifetimes of catch bonds, while other experiments conducted under flow conditions too weak or too strong for optimal shear-induced strengthening of these bonds. Finally, Marshall and coworkers found that [[L-selectin]]:[[PSGL-1]] bonds exhibited increasing bond lifetime as step loads were applied between 0 and ~25 pN, and fell exponentially at higher loads.&lt;ref name="Marshall BT, Long M, Piper JW, Yago T, McEver RP, Zhu C 2003 190–3"/&gt; These data were collected using an [[atomic force microscope]], and have subsequently been duplicated using a biomembrane force probe and in shear flow assays. L-selectin:PSGL-1 bonds display catch bond behavior at low loads, and slip bond behavior (meaning that bond lifetime decreases with increasing load) at high loads ("catch-slip" bonds). Catch-slip behavior has also been reported for dissociation of L-selectin from endoglycan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sarangapani KK, Yago T, Klopocki AG |title=Low force decelerates L-selectin dissociation from P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and endoglycan |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=279 |issue=3 |pages=2291–8 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14573602 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M310396200|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; P-selectin from PSGL-1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Evans E, Leung A, Heinrich V, Zhu C |title=Mechanical switching and coupling between two dissociation pathways in a P-selectin adhesion bond |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=101 |issue=31 |pages=11281–6 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15277675 |pmc=509195 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0401870101|bibcode=2004PNAS..10111281E }}&lt;/ref&gt; FimH from mannose,&lt;ref name="Thomas WE, Trintchina E, Forero M, Vogel V, Sokurenko EV 2002 913–23"/&gt; and myosin from actin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guo B, Guilford WH |title=Mechanics of actomyosin bonds in different nucleotide states are tuned to muscle contraction |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=26 |pages=9844–9 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16785439 |pmc=1502541 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0601255103|bibcode=2006PNAS..103.9844G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing their importance and general acceptance, in the three years following their discovery there were at least 24 articles published on catch bonds.

Recently, Sivasankar and his research team have found that the mechanism behind the puzzling phenomenon is due to long-lived, force-induced hydrogen bonds. Using data from previous experiments, the team used molecular dynamics to discover that two rod-shaped cadherins in an X-dimer formed catch bonds when pulled and in the presence of calcium ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sivasankar|first1=Sanjeevi|title=Resolving the molecular mechanism of cadherin catch bond formation|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140602/ncomms4941/full/ncomms4941.html|website=Nature.com|publisher=Nature Communications|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calcium ions keep the cadherins rigid, while pulling brings the proteins closer together, allowing for hydrogen bonds to form. The mechanism behind catch bonds helps to explain the biophysics behind cell-cell adhesion. According to the researchers, "Robust cadherin adhesion is essential for maintaining the integrity of tissue such as the skin, blood vessels, cartilage and muscle that are exposed to continuous mechanical assault."

==Types==

===Selectin bond===

====Background====
[[Leukocytes]], as well as other types of white blood cells, normally form weak and short-lived bonds with other cells via [[selectin]]. Coated outside the membrane of leukocytes are [[microvilli]], which have various types of adhesive molecules, including [[P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1]] (PSGL-1), a glycoprotein that is normally decorated with sulfated sialyl-Lewis x. the sulfated-sialyl-Lewis-x-contained PSGL-1 molecule has the ability to bind to any type of selectin. Leukocytes also exhibit L-selectin that binds to other cells or other leukocytes that contain PSGL-1 molecules.&lt;ref name="Thomas W 2008"&gt;Thomas W. Catch Bond in Adhesion. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. (2008); 10:39-57&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shear Threshold Phenomenon.png|thumb|335x335px|Top: Under normal blood flow conditions, leukocytes (gray circles) float freely in the bloodstream. Bottom: Under conditions of infection and inflammation, high shear stress causes leukocytes to bind and roll along blood vessel walls (red lines). This is known as the shear-threshold phenomenon.
]]
An important example of catch bonds is their role in [[leukocyte extravasation]]. During this process, leukocytes move through the circulatory system to sites of infection, and in doing so they 'roll' and bind to selectin molecules on the vessel wall. While able to float freely in the blood under normal circumstances, [[shear stress]] induced by [[inflammation]] causes leukocytes to attach to the endothelial vessel wall and begin rolling rather than floating downstream. This “shear-threshold phenomenon” was initially characterized in 1996 by Finger et al. who showed that leukocyte binding and rolling through L-selectin is only maintained when a critical shear-threshold is applied to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finger|first=E. B.|last2=Puri|first2=K. D.|last3=Alon|first3=R.|last4=Lawrence|first4=M. B.|last5=von Andrian|first5=U. H.|last6=Springer|first6=T. A.|date=1996-01-18|title=Adhesion through L-selectin requires a threshold hydrodynamic shear|journal=Nature|volume=379|issue=6562|pages=266–269|doi=10.1038/379266a0|issn=0028-0836|pmid=8538793|bibcode=1996Natur.379..266F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple sources of evidence have shown that catch bonds are responsible for the tether and roll mechanism that allows this critical process to occur. Catch bonds allow increasing force to convert short-lived tethers into stronger, longer-lived binding interactions, thus decreasing the rolling velocity and increasing the regularity of rolling steps. However, this mechanism only works at an optimal force. As shear force increases past this force, bonds revert to slip bonds, creating an increase in velocity and irregularity of rolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Cheng|last2=Lou|first2=Jizhong|last3=McEver|first3=Robert P.|title=Catch bonds: Physical models, structural bases, biological function and rheological relevance|journal=Biorheology|date=2005|volume=42|pages=443–462|url=file:///Users/joani_11/Downloads/Zhu%20Biorheology%2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leukocytes adhesion mediated by shear stress====
In blood vessel, at very low shear stress of ~.3 dynes per squared centimeter, leukocytes do not adhere to the blood vessel [[endothelial cells]]. Cells move along the blood vessel at a rate proportional to the blood flow rate. Once the shear stress pass that shear threshold value, leukocytes start to accumulate via selectin binding. At low shear stress above the threshold of about .3 to 5 dynes per squared centimeter, leukocytes alternate between binding and non-binding.&lt;ref name="Thomas W 2008"/&gt; Because one leukocyte has many selectins around the surface, these selectin binding/ unbinding cause a rolling motion on the blood vessel. As the shear stress continue to increase, the selectin bonds becomes stronger, causing the rolling velocity to be slower. This reduction in leukocytes rolling velocity allow cells to stop and perform firm binding via [[integrin]] binding.&lt;ref name="Thomas W 2008"/&gt; 
Selectin binding do not exhibit "true" catch bond property. Experiments show that at very high shear stress (passing a second threshold), the selectin binding transit between a catch bond to a [[slip bond]] binding, in which the rolling velocity increases as the shear force increases.

==== Leukocyte rolling mediated by catch-slip transition ====
[[File:Leukocyte rolling.png|thumb|513x513px|Catch-slip transition allows leukocytes to roll along blood vessel walls.]]
Researchers have hypothesized that the ability of leukocytes to maintain attachment and rolling on the blood vessel wall can be explained by a combination of many factors, including cell flattening to maintain a larger binding surface-area and reduce [[hydrodynamic drag]], as well as tethers holding the rear of the rolling cell to the [[endothelium]] breaking and slinging to the front of the rolling cell to reattach to the endothelial wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sundd|first=Prithu|last2=Pospieszalska|first2=Maria K.|last3=Ley|first3=Klaus|date=2013-08-01|title=Neutrophil rolling at high shear: flattening, catch bond behavior, tethers and slings|journal=Molecular Immunology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=59–69|doi=10.1016/j.molimm.2012.10.025|issn=1872-9142|pmc=3601566|pmid=23141302}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hypotheses work well with Marshall’s 2003 findings that selectin bonds go through a catch-slip transition in which initial increases in shear force strengthen the bond, but with enough applied force bond lifetimes begin to [[Decays exponentially|decay exponentially]].&lt;ref name="Marshall BT, Long M, Piper JW, Yago T, McEver RP, Zhu C 2003 190–3" /&gt; Therefore, the weak binding of a sling at the leading edge of a rolling leukocyte would initially be strengthened as the cell rolls farther and the tension on the bond increases, preventing the cell from dissociating from the endothelial wall and floating freely in the bloodstream despite high shear forces. However, at the trailing edge of the cell, tension becomes high enough to transition the bond from catch to slip, and the bonds tethering the trailing edge eventually break, allowing the cell to roll further instead of remaining stationary.

==== Proposed mechanisms of action ====

===== Allosteric model =====
[[File:Allosteric figure.png|thumb|359x359px|Allosteric model states that applied tension results in an extended conformation of the EGF domain, causing a conformational change to the lectin domain, resulting in increased binding affinity.
]]
Though catch bonds are now widely recognized, their mechanism of action is still under dispute. Two leading hypotheses dominate the discussion. The first hypothesis, the allosteric model, stems from evidence that [[x-ray crystallography]] of selectin proteins shows two conformational states: a bent conformation in the absence of [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]], and an extended conformation in the presence of the ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somers|first=W. S.|last2=Tang|first2=J.|last3=Shaw|first3=G. D.|last4=Camphausen|first4=R. T.|date=2000-10-27|title=Insights into the molecular basis of leukocyte tethering and rolling revealed by structures of P- and E-selectin bound to SLe(X) and PSGL-1|journal=Cell|volume=103|issue=3|pages=467–479|issn=0092-8674|pmid=11081633|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)00138-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main [[Domain (protein)|domains]] involved in these states are a [[lectin]] domain which contains the ligand binding site and an [[EGF domain]] which can shift between bent and extended conformations. The allosteric model claims that tension on the EGF domain favors the extended conformation, and extension of this domain causes a conformational shift in the lectin domain, resulting in greater [[binding affinity]] for the ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldron|first=Travis T.|last2=Springer|first2=Timothy A.|date=2009-01-06|title=Transmission of allostery through the lectin domain in selectin-mediated cell adhesion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=106|issue=1|pages=85–90|doi=10.1073/pnas.0810620105|issn=1091-6490|pmc=2629216|pmid=19118202|bibcode=2009PNAS..106...85W}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this conformational change, the ligand is effectively locked in place despite tension exerted on the bond.

===== Sliding-rebinding model =====
The sliding-rebinding model differs from the allosteric model in that the allosteric model posits that only one binding site exists and can be altered, but the sliding-rebinding model states that multiple binding sites exist and aren’t changed by EGF extension. Rather, in the bent conformation which is favored at low applied forces, the applied force is [[perpendicular]] to the line of possible binding sites. Thus, when the association between ligand and lectin domain is interrupted, the bond quickly dissociates. At larger applied forces, however, the protein is extended and the line of possible binding sites is aligned with the applied force, allowing the ligand to quickly re-associate with a new binding site after the initial interaction is disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lou|first=Jizhong|last2=Yago|first2=Tadayuki|last3=Klopocki|first3=Arkadiusz G.|last4=Mehta|first4=Padmaja|last5=Chen|first5=Wei|last6=Zarnitsyna|first6=Veronika I.|last7=Bovin|first7=Nicolai V.|last8=Zhu|first8=Cheng|last9=McEver|first9=Rodger P.|date=2006-09-25|title=Flow-enhanced adhesion regulated by a selectin interdomain hinge|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=174|issue=7|pages=1107–1117|doi=10.1083/jcb.200606056|issn=0021-9525|pmc=2064400|pmid=17000883}}&lt;/ref&gt; With multiple binding sites, and even the ability to re-associate with the original binding site, the rate of ligand dissociation would be decreased as is typical of catch bonds.

=====Mechanism of a single selectin binding=====
A single PSGL-1 and selectin binding is similar to conventional protein binding when the force is kept constant, with a dissociation constant. As the force exerted starts to increase, the dissociation constant decreases, causing binding to become stronger. As the force reach a threshold level of 11 pN, the dissociation constant starts to increase again, weakening the bond, causing the bond to exhibit a slip bond property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marshall | first1 = BT | last2 = Long | first2 = M | last3 = Piper | first3 = JW | last4 = Yago | first4 = T | last5 = McEver | first5 = RP | last6 = Zhu | first6 = C | year = 2003 | title = Direct observation of catch bonds involving cell-adhesion molecules | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = | pages = 190–93 | doi=10.1038/nature01605 | pmid=12736689| bibcode = 2003Natur.423..190M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FimH bond===

====Background====
Catch bonds also play a significant role in bacterial adhesion, most notably in [[Escherichia coli]]. E. coli and other bacteria residing in the intestine must be able to adhere to intestinal walls or risk being eliminated from the body through urine. This is possible due to the bacterial protein FimH, which mediates high adhesion in response to high flow. The lectin domain is one that provides FimH binding the catch bond property when binding to [[mannose]] residues from other cells. Experiments have shown that when force is loaded rapidly, bonds were able to survive high forces, thus pointing to catch bond behavior. Catch bonds are responsible for the failure of E. coli in the urinary tract to be eliminated during urination, thus leading to a urinary tract infection. This knowledge is important not only in understanding bacteria, but also for learning how anti-adhesive technologies can be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yakovenko|first1=Olga|last2=Sharma|first2=Shivani|last3=Forero|first3=Manu|last4=Tchesnokova|first4=Veronika|last5=Aprikian|first5=Pavel|last6=Kidd|first6=Brian|last7=Mach|first7=Albert|last8=Vogel|first8=Viola|last9=Sokurenko|first9=Evgeni|last10=Thomas|first10=Wendy E.|title=FimH Forms Catch Bonds That Are Enhanced by Mechanical Force Due to Allosteric Regulation|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=2008|volume=283|pages=11596–11605|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/283/17/11596.full|doi=10.1074/jbc.m707815200|pmid=18292092|pmc=2431072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bacteria adhesion mediated by shear stress====
Similar to selectin binding, FimH binding also have a threshold where it only starts binding to the host cells above this threshold. This shear stress threshold is about 1 dynes per squared centimeter, slightly larger than that of selectin binding.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas WE. 2005. Using a Laminar Flow System to Explain Shear-Enhanced Bacterial Adhesion. Presented at Int. Conf. Microchannels Minichannels (ICMM2005), 3rd, Toronto, Ontario, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Above this threshold, FimH also alternate between binding, pause and unbinding with the mannose residues.&lt;ref name="Thomas WE 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = WE | last2 = Nilsson | first2 = L | last3 = Forero | first3 = M | last4 = Sokurenko | first4 = EV | last5 = Vogel | first5 = V | year = 2004 | title = 'Stick-and-roll' bacterial adhesion mediated by catch-bonds | url = | journal = Mol. Microbiol. | volume = 53 | issue = | page = 1545 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04226.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different from selectin binding, FimH binding to mannose-BSA can either have a very long or very short pauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = WE | last2 = Forero | first2 = M | last3 = Yakovenko | first3 = O | last4 = Nilsson | first4 = L | last5 = Vicini | first5 = P | display-authors = 5 | last6 = et al | year = 2006 | title = Catch bond model derived from allostery explains force-activated bacterial adhesion | url = | journal = Biophys.

All of this is mediated by shear stress level: at shear stress higher than 20 dynes per squared centimeter, FimH binding is stationary. At shear stress higher than 100 dynes per squared centimeter, slow rolling is observed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4496">The '''Centre for Human Bioethics''' is a research and teaching centre at [[Monash University]], based in the Faculty of [[Monash University Faculty of Arts|Arts]]. It focusses on the branch of [[ethics]] known as [[bioethics]], a field relating to biological science and medicine. It was founded in October 1980 by Professors [[Peter Singer]] and [[Helga Kuhse]],&lt;ref name="books.publishing.monash.edu"&gt;http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/51/xhtml/chapter12a.html#chapter12sec16{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the first centre in Australia devoted to bioethics, and one of the first in the world.&lt;ref name=artsmonash&gt;{{cite web

It became well known during the 1980s as one of the leading bodies studying the ethical implications of the rapid advances in science and technology, such as [[in-vitro fertilisation]]. The Centre's founder, [[Peter Singer]], is probably the world's best-known bioethicist, and while Director of the Centre, he produced a number of ground-breaking publications in the field. This included ''The Reproduction Revolution'', ''Should the Baby Live?'' and ''[[Practical Ethics]]''. He also founded the journal [[Bioethics (journal)|''Bioethics'']] with [[Helga Kuhse]], and established the [[International Association for Bioethics]].&lt;ref name=artsmonash/&gt;

Today, it continues its strong focus on research, but also provides undergraduate, postgraduate and industry-based education. It undertakes extensive teaching to health professionals. It is particularly well known for its Master of Bioethics degree, founded in 1989 as one of the first of its kind in the world. In June 2014, the length of this course was increased to become a two-year full-time course. The current Director of the Centre is Professor [[Michael Selgelid]]. Previous to this, Dr [[Justin Oakley]], a [[virtue ethicist]] who was one of the first graduates of the Centre's Master of Bioethics program, was Director, but become Deputy Director in the 2010s to spend more time on his research.

In addition to their teaching and research commitments, staff from the Centre also carry out consultancy work for numerous government bodies and law reform agencies, including the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=monashwho&gt;{{cite web

The Centre is also home to the ''Monash Bioethics Review'', the only peer-reviewed bioethics journal in Australia.&lt;ref name=artsmonash/&gt;

The Centre is part of an international network established by the [[University of Tokyo]] to promote collaborative research and teaching links between eight of the world's leading bioethics centres, including the Hastings Centre in New York and the Ethox Centre at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="books.publishing.monash.edu"/&gt;

'''Church history''' or '''ecclesiastical history''' as an [[academic discipline]] studies the [[history of Christianity]] and the way the [[Christian Church]] has developed since its inception. 

[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]] defined church history as "the spiritual side of the history of civilized people ever since our Master's coming".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]], ''Early Church History to A.D. 313'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A. M. Renwick, however, defines it as an account of the Church's success and failure in carrying out Christ's [[Great Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Renwick and [[Allan Harman|A. M. Harman]], ''The Story of the Church'' (3rd ed.), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Renwick suggests a fourfold division of church history into [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary activity]], [[Ecclesiastical polity|church organization]], [[Christian theology|doctrine]] and "the effect on human life".

Church history is often, but not always, studied from a Christian perspective. Writers from different Christian traditions will often highlight people and events particularly relevant to their own [[denominational]] history. Catholic and Orthodox writers often highlight the achievements of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]], while [[evangelical]] historians may focus on the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Great Awakening]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9727">In [[philology]], a '''commentary''' is a line-by-line or even word-by-word explication usually attached to an [[edition (book)|edition]] of a text in the same or an accompanying volume. It may draw on [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[close reading]] and [[literary criticism]], but its primary purpose is to elucidate the language of the text and the specific culture that produced it, both of which may be foreign to the reader. Such a commentary usually takes the form of [[footnote]]s, [[footnote|endnotes]], or separate text cross-referenced by line, paragraph or page.

Means of providing commentary on the language of the text include notes on [[textual criticism]], [[syntax]] and [[semantics]], and the analysis of [[rhetoric]], literary [[trope (linguistics)|tropes]], and [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]]. The aim is to remove, lessen or point out [[linguistics|linguistic]] obstacles to reading and understanding the text.

If a text is historical, or is produced within a culture assumed to be of limited familiarity to a reader, a broader range of issues may require elucidation. These include, but are by no means limited to, biographical data pertaining to the author, historical events, customs and laws, technical terminology and facts of daily life, religious beliefs and philosophical perspectives, literary allusions, geographical settings, and cross-references to related passages in the same work, other works by the author, or sources used by the author.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Cheney, "'Jog on, jog on': European Career Paths," in ''European Literary Careers: The Author from Antiquity to the Renaissance'' (University of Toronto Press, 2002), p. 6 [https://books.google.be/books?id=N8kufnGjol0C&amp;printsec=references&amp;dq=cites:ISBN+0-19-814372-9&amp;vq=%22Scribes+and+Scholars%22&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Scribes%20and%20Scholars%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentaries from [[Classical Antiquity]] or the [[Middle Ages]] (more strictly referred to as [[scholium|scholia]]) are a valuable source of information otherwise unknown, including references to works that are now lost.  [[Jerome]] provides a list of several commentaries that were in use during his days as a student in the 350s A.D.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], ''Apology for Himself against the Books of Rufinus'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.vi.xii.html 1.16]; Alan Cameron, ''Greek Mythography in the Roman World'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most used of the ancient scholia today is that of [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil|Vergil]]’s ''[[Aeneid]]'', written in the 4th century.

The production of commentaries began to flourish in the 16th century as part of the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] project to recover the texts of antiquity, with its related boom in publishing. In the modern era, a commentary differs from an annotated edition aimed at students or the casual reader in that it attempts to address an exhaustive range of [[scholarly method|scholarly questions]], many of which may be of concern or interest primarily to specialists. The commentator may take a position on variant readings of the text or on a point of scholarly dispute, but arguments are usually succinct, a paragraph or less than a page in length.

==Mesopotamian Commentaries==
The earliest examples, and also one of the largest corpora of text commentaries from the ancient world, comes from first-millennium-BCE Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Known from over 860 manuscripts, the majority of which date to the period 700-100 BCE, most of these commentaries explore numerous types of texts, including literary works (such as the [[Enûma Eliš|Babylonian Epic of Creation]]), medical treatises, magical texts, ancient dictionaries, and law collections (the [[Code of Hammurabi]]). Most of them, however, comment on divination treatises, in particular treatises that predict the future from the appearance and movement of celestial bodies on the one hand ([[Enūma Anu Enlil]]), and from the appearance of a sacrificed sheep’s liver on the other ([[Bārûtu]]).

As with the majority of the thousands of texts from the [[ancient Near East]] that have survived to the present day, Mesopotamian text commentaries are written on clay tablets in [[cuneiform script]]. Text commentaries are written in the East Semitic language of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], but due to the influence of lexical lists written in [[Sumerian language]] on cuneiform scholarship, they often contain Sumerian words or phrases as well.

Cuneiform commentaries are important because they provide information about Mesopotamian languages and culture that are not available elsewhere in the cuneiform record. To give but one example, the pronunciation of the cryptically written name of Gilgamesh, the hero of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], was discovered in a cuneiform commentary on a medical text.&lt;ref&gt;BM 54595 ([http://ccp.yale.edu/P461257 ''CCP'' 4.2.R]). See T. G. Pinches, “Exit Gišṭubar!”, ''The Babylonian and Oriental Record'', vol. 4, p. 264, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the significance of cuneiform commentaries extends beyond the light they shed on specific details of Mesopotamian civilization. They open a window onto what the concerns of the Mesopotamian literate elite were when they read some of the most widely studied texts in the Mesopotamian intellectual tradition, a perspective that is important for “seeing things their way.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Pollock, [http://doi.org/10.1086/599594 “Future Philology? The Fate of a Soft Science in a Hard World”, ''Critical Inquiry'' 35/4, pp. 931-961], here p. 954.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, cuneiform commentaries are also the earliest examples of textual interpretation. It has been repeatedly argued that they influenced rabbinical [[exegesis]]. See [http://ccp.yale.edu/introduction/akkadian-hebrew-exegesis Akkadian Commentaries and Early Hebrew Exegesis]

The publication and interpretation of these texts began in the mid-nineteenth century, with the discovery of the royal Assyrian libraries at Nineveh, from which ca. 454 text commentaries have been recovered. The study of cuneiform commentaries is, however, far from complete. It is the subject of on-going research by the small, international community of scholars who specialize in the field of [[Assyriology]].

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex characteristics]], such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex | date = 2015 | url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071043/https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because their bodies are seen as different, intersex children and adults are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt;

[[United Nations]], [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], and other human rights institutions, have called for countries to ban discrimination and combat stigma.&lt;ref name="un-2016" /&gt; Few countries so far protect intersex people from discrimination or provide access to reparations for harmful practices.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]], found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide: "Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society."&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223221/http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | archivedate = 2015-09-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015158/http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | archivedate = 4 July 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations states that intersex people suffer stigma on the basis of physical characteristics, "including violations of their rights to health and physical integrity, to be free from torture and ill-treatment, and to equality and non- discrimination."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt; The UN has called for governments to end discrimination against intersex people:
{{quotation|Ban discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics, intersex traits or status, including in education, health care, employment, sports and access to public services, and consult intersex people and organizations when developing legislation and policies that impact their rights.&lt;ref name="unfe-2016"&gt;{{cite web | title = United Nations for Intersex Awareness | url = https://www.unfe.org/intersex-awareness/ | last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | authorlink = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | accessdate = 2016-11-12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212215/https://www.unfe.org/intersex-awareness/ | archivedate = 2016-11-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A handful of jurisdictions so far provide explicit protection from discrimination for intersex people. [[Intersex rights in South Africa|South Africa]] was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of 'sex'.&lt;ref name="zagaz"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-022.pdf | title = Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 22 of 2005, Republic of South Africa, Vol. 487, Cape Town | date = 11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] was the first country to add an independent attribute, of 'intersex status'.&lt;ref name="com law"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013A00098 | title = Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013, No. 98, 2013, C2013A00098 | work = ComLaw | date = 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122244/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013A00098 | archivedate = 2014-10-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] was the first to adopt a broader framework of "[[sex characteristics]]", through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transactivists.org/2015/04/08/making-depathologization-a-matter-of-law-a-comment-from-gate-on-the-maltese-act-on-gender-identity-gender-expression-and-sex-characteristics/ |title=Making depathologization a matter of law.

{{further|Genetic diagnosis of intersex}}
Intersex people face genetic de-selection via pregnancy terminations and [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], as well as abandonment, neglect, infanticide and murder due to their [[sex characteristics]]. In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory "sex selection" and "preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics".

A 2016 Australian study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60% had received medical treatment on the basis of their sex characteristics, half receiving such treatments aged under 18 years, "most commonly genital surgeries (many of which occurred in infancy) and hormone treatments", and the "majority experienced at least one negative impact".&lt;ref name="oiidemo-2016"&gt;{{cite web | title = Demographics | url = https://oii.org.au/demographics/ | last = Organisation Intersex International Australia | authorlink = Organisation Intersex International Australia | date = July 28, 2016 | accessdate = 2016-11-12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161001215740/https://oii.org.au/demographics/ | archivedate = October 1, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, while some parents and physicians had attempted to empower participants, the study found "strong evidence suggesting a pattern of institutionalised shaming and coercive treatment" and poor (or no) information provision.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016" /&gt; 16% of study participants were not provided with information on options of having no treatment, and some were provided with misinformation about the nature of their treatment, and information about peer support was also lacking. [[OII Europe]] reports:

{{quotation|A German study conducted by a medical team between 2005 and 2007 covered the experiences of 439 intersex individuals of all ages, from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 81% had been subjected to one or multiple surgeries due to their DSD diagnosis. Almost 50% of the participating adults reported psychological problems and a variety of problems related to their physical well-being and their sex life. Two-thirds made a connection between those problems and the medical and surgical treatment they had been subjected to.

Rationales for medical intervention frequently focus on parental distress, or problematize future gender identity and sexuality, and subjective judgements are made about the acceptability of risk of future [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P.

Decision-making on any cancer and other physical risks may be intertwined with "normalizing" rationales. In a major Parliamentary report in Australia, published in October 2013, the Senate Community Affairs References committee was "disturbed" by the possible implications of current practices in the treatment of cancer risk. The committee stated: "clinical intervention pathways stated to be based on probabilities of cancer risk may be encapsulating treatment decisions based on other factors, such as the desire to conduct normalising surgery... Treating cancer may be regarded as unambiguously therapeutic treatment, while normalising surgery may not.

=== Medical photography and display ===

Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes, and individuals with intersex traits may be subjected to repeated genital examinations and display to medical teams. Sharon Preves described this as a form of humiliation and stigmatization, leading to an "inability to deflect negative associations of self" where "genitalia must be revealed in order to allow for stigmatization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preves|first=Sharon Elaine|title=Negotiating the Constraints of Gender Binarism: Intersexuals' Challenge to Gender Categorization|journal=Current Sociology|date=July 2000|volume=48|issue=3|pages=27–50|doi=10.1177/0011392100048003004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PREV&gt;{{Cite book| last =  Preves| first =  Sharon| title = Intersex and Identity, the Contested Self| year = 2003| publisher = Rutgers| isbn = 0-8135-3229-9}} p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRPH" /&gt; According to Creighton ''et al'', the "experience of being photographed has exemplified for many people with intersex conditions the powerlessness and humiliation felt during medical investigations and interventions".&lt;ref name=CRPH&gt;{{Cite news| last1 =  Creighton| first1 =  Sarah| last2 =  Alderson| first2 =  J| last3 =  Brown| first3 =  S| last4 =  Minto| first4 =  Cathy| year = 2002| title = Medical photography: ethics, consent and the intersex patient|periodical = BJU International| issue = 89| pages = 67–71| url =  http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118927929/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0}}p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Australian study participants stated a need to educate their physicians.

== Inciting hate crimes by allegations of sex crimes ==
One increasingly common cause of [[hate crime]]s against intersex people is the neurological claim that male and female brains have fundamentally different sexualities, in particular the claim that men are sexually impulsive and aggressive and bound to act on their sexual fantasies while most women are said to have a wider range of sexual fantasies than most men, including fantasies that it would be unacceptable to act on. The claim that a combination of one trait that most men have and one trait that most women have would produce a sex criminal adds up to allegations that intersex people are sex offenders. To decrease such severe discrimination against intersex people, some researchers advocate more public information about the error sources in the sexological studies that are said to show such sex differences. This includes the possibility that societal double standards may scare more men than women into not talking about or otherwise revealing their sex fantasies (corroborated by the existence of characteristics that differ between male volunteers and male nonvolunteers, but not between female volunteers and female nonvolunteers, in erotica research) giving a false appearance of men having narrower ranges of sexual fantasies than women, and the possibility that men who want to be castrated out of their spiritual beliefs may have to commit sex crimes and claim that it was due to uncontrollable urges to get castrated since such surgery is not off the shelf (corroborated by the overrepresentation of religious groups in child sexual abuse scandals that cannot be explained by biopsychiatric correlations) creating a false appearance of men being less able to control their sexual impulses than women. Certain intersex rights advocates argue that this may dispel the myth that intersex people are "hybrid degenerated" to be sex criminals, creating more understanding for intersex people.&lt;ref&gt;Trans and Intersex People: Discrimination on the Grounds of Sex, Gender Identity and Gender Expression, 2012, Christa Tobler and Silvan Agius&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Between the Sexes: A Preliminary Study on the Life Situations of Inter*individuals, 2013, Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide and self-harm ==

The impact of discrimination and stigma can also be seen in high rates of suicidal tendencies and self harm. Multiple anecdotal reports, including from [[Intersex rights in China|Hong Kong]] and [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]] point to high levels of suicidality amongst intersex people.&lt;ref name="luk-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="odhiambo-2016" /&gt; The Australian sociological study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60% had thought about suicide, and 42% thought about self-harm, "on the basis of issues related to having an intersex variation ... 19% had attempted suicide"; causes identified included stigma, discrimination, family rejection and school bullying.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt;

A 2013 German clinical study found high rates of distress, with "prevalence rates of self-harming behavior and suicidal tendencies ... comparable to traumatized women with a history of physical or sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="schutzmann"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9241-9| issn = 0004-0002| volume = 38| issue = 1| pages = 16–33| last1 = Schützmann| first1 = Karsten| last2 = Brinkmann| first2 = Lisa| last3 = Schacht| first3 = Melanie| last4 = Richter-Appelt| first4 = Hertha| title = Psychological Distress, Self-Harming Behavior, and Suicidal Tendencies in Adults with Disorders of Sex Development| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| date = February 2009 | url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10508-007-9241-9| pmid=17943433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results have been reported in Australia&lt;ref name="schutzmann" /&gt; and Denmark.&lt;ref name="liao-2013" /&gt;

== Education ==

An [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australian]] sociological survey of 272 persons born with atypical sex characteristics, published in 2016, found that 18% of respondents (compared to an Australian average of 2%) failed to complete secondary school, with early school leaving coincident with pubertal medical interventions, bullying on the basis of physical characteristics, and other factors.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808| issn = 1468-1811 | pages = 1–17| last = Jones| first = Tiffany| title = The needs of students with intersex variations| journal = Sex Education| accessdate = 2016-05-28| date = March 11, 2016 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenyan]] news report suggests high rates of early school leaving, with the organisation Gama Africa reporting that 60% of 132 known intersex people had dropped out of school "because of the harassment and treatment they received from their peers and their teachers".&lt;ref name="odhiambo-2016"/&gt;

The Australian study found that schools lacked inclusive services such as relevant puberty and sex education curricula and counselling, for example, not representing a full range of human bodily diversity. Only a quarter of respondents felt positive about their schooling experiences, schooling coincided with disclosure of an intersex condition, associated with well-being risks, and early school leaving peaked "during the years most associated with puberty and hormone therapy interventions".&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt; Cognitive differences may also be associated with some traits such as sex chromosome variations.&lt;ref name="hong-2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2790-13.2014| issn = 0270-6474| volume = 34| issue = 10| pages = 3509–3516| last1 = Hong| first1 = D.

== Poverty and employment discrimination ==

The impact of discrimination and stigma can be seen in high rates of poverty. A 2015 Australian survey of people born with atypical sex characteristics found high levels of poverty, in addition to very high levels of early school leaving, and higher than average rates of disability.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Open Book Publishers| isbn = 978-1-78374-208-0| last1 = Jones| first1 = Tiffany| last2 = Hart| first2 = Bonnie| last3 = Carpenter| first3 = Morgan| last4 = Ansara| first4 = Gavi| last5 = Leonard| first5 = William| last6 = Lucke| first6 = Jayne| title = Intersex: Stories and Statistics from Australia| location = Cambridge, UK| accessdate = 2016-02-02| date = February 2016| url = http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160914152729/http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| archivedate = 2016-09-14| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 6% of the 272 survey participants reported being homeless or couch surfing.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt;

Intersex people may face discrimination within [[LGBT]] settings and multiple organizations have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition that fail to address the issue of unnecessary "normalising" treatments on intersex children, using the portmanteau term "[[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]".

An '''engineering apprenticeship''' in the [[United Kingdom]] is an [[apprenticeship]] in [[mechanical engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]] or [[aeronautical engineering]] to train craftsmen, technicians, senior technicians, [[Incorporated Engineer]]s and [[Chartered Engineer]] for vocational oriented work and professional practice. Chartered Engineers are usually formed through a university degree programme at the Masters Engineering level and may undertake a short form of post graduate apprenticeship. A typical example is the apprenticeships formerly available at the [[British Thomson-Houston]] and [[English Electric]] companies at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] in England. Subjects covered included mathematics, engineering sciences, [[limits and fits]], [[metallurgy]], [[foundry]] technology, [[engineering drawing]], [[design]], [[materials science]] for engineering materials, [[metalworking]] by hand, operating [[machine tool]]s, and basic features of engineering design. Also refer to [[apprenticeship]] and the UK and German section. Elite technical apprenticeships (4-6 years long) have been a decades long tradition at UK companies such as [[BAE Systems]], [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[Short Brothers]]), and  [[Babcock International]].

'''Environmental policy''' is the commitment of an organization or government to the laws, regulations, and other policy mechanisms concerning [[environmental issue]]s. These issues generally include [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution]], [[waste management]], [[ecosystem management]], maintenance of [[biodiversity]], the protection of [[natural resource]]s, [[wildlife]] and [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Global-Environmental-Policy-Concepts-Principles-ebook/dp/B005H6M86Q/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice]. {{ISBN|978-1439847664}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerning environmental policy, the importance of implementation of an eco-energy-oriented policy at a global level to address the issues of global warming and climate changes should be accentuated.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac, Marinko Stojkov, Dražan Kozak. Designing a global energy policy model, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Energy, Vol. 170, Issue 1, February, 2017, pp. 2-11. https://doi.org/10.1680/jener.16.00005&lt;/ref&gt;
Policies concerning energy or regulation of [[toxic substances]] including [[pesticide]]s and many types of [[industrial waste]] are part of the topic of environmental policy. This policy can be deliberately taken to direct and oversee human activities and thereby prevent harmful effects on the [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical environment]] and natural resources, as well as to make sure that changes in the environment do not have harmful effects on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Definition==
It is useful to consider that environmental policy comprises two major terms: [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[policy]]. Environment refers to the physical ecosystems, but can also take into consideration the social dimension (quality of life, health) and an economic dimension (resource management, biodiversity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Environmental issues]] generally addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution]], [[waste management]], [[ecosystem]] management, [[biodiversity]] protection, the protection of [[natural resource]]s, [[wildlife]] and [[endangered species]], and the preservation of these natural resources for future generations. Relatively recently, environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;A major article outlining and analyzing the history of environmental communication policy within the European Union has recently come out in ''The Information Society'', a journal based in the United States.  See Mathur, Piyush.  "Environmental Communication in the Information Society:  The Blueprint from Europe," ''The Information Society:  An International Journal'', 25: 2, March 2009 , pp. 119–38.  Accessible:  http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a909229825~db=all~jumptype=rss&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The rationale for governmental involvement in the environment is [[market failure]] in the form of forces beyond the control of one person, including the [[free rider problem]] and the [[tragedy of the commons]]. An example of an externality is when a factory produces waste [[water pollution|pollution]] which may be dumped into a river, ultimately contaminating water. The cost of such action is paid by society-at-large, when they must clean the water before drinking it and is external to the costs of the factory. The free rider problem is when the private marginal cost of taking action to protect the environment is greater than the private marginal benefit, but the social marginal cost is less than the social marginal benefit. The tragedy of the commons is the problem that, because no one person owns the commons, each individual has an incentive to utilize common resources as much as possible. Without governmental involvement, the commons is overused.  Examples of tragedies of the commons are [[overfishing]] and [[overgrazing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Instruments, problems, and issues==
Environmental policy instruments are tools used by governments to implement their environmental policies. Governments may use a number of different types of instruments. For example, economic incentives and [[market-based instruments]] such as taxes and tax exemptions, tradable permits, and fees can be very effective to encourage compliance with environmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_1,00.html http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347,en_2649_34295_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate companies who engage in efficient environmental management and are transparent about their environmental data and reporting benefit from improved business performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emisoft.com/environmental-compliance-corporate-performance-can-you-have-it-all/|title=Environmental Compliance &amp; Corporate Performance - Can You Have It All?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.emisoft.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilateral agreements between the government and private firms and commitments made by firms independent of government requirement are examples of voluntary environmental measures. Another instrument is the implementation of greener public purchasing programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347 en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_ 1,00.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610225031/http://www.oecd.org/about/0,3347 |date=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instruments are sometimes combined in a policy mix to address a certain environmental problem. Since environmental issues have many aspects, several policy instruments may be needed to adequately address each one. Furthermore, a combination of different policies may give firms greater flexibility in policy compliance and reduce uncertainty as to the cost of such compliance.

Government policies must be carefully formulated so that the individual measures do not undermine one another, or create a rigid and cost-ineffective framework. Overlapping policies result in unnecessary administrative costs, increasing the cost of implementation.&lt;ref&gt;"Instrument Mixes for Environmental Policy" (Paris: OECD Publications, 2007) 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; To help governments realize their policy goals, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Environment Directorate collects data on the efficiency and consequences of environmental policies implemented by the national governments.&lt;ref&gt;“Environmental Policies and Instruments,” http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_34281_1_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The website, www.economicinstruments.com, [http://www.economicinstruments.com] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economicinstruments.com |title=Economic Instruments |publisher=Economic Instruments |date=2011-01-26 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides database detailing countries' experiences with their environmental policies. The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]], through [[UNECE Environmental Performance Reviews]], evaluates progress made by its member countries in improving their environmental policies.

The current reliance on a market-based framework is controversial, however, and many environmentalists contend that a more radical, overarching approach is needed than a set of specific initiatives, to deal with [[climate change]]. For example, energy efficiency measures may actually increase energy consumption in the absence of a cap on fossil fuel use, as people might drive more fuel-efficient cars. Thus, Aubrey Meyer calls for a 'framework-based market' of [[contraction and convergence]]. The [[Cap and Share]] and the Sky Trust are proposals based on the idea.

Environmental impact assessments (EIA) are conducted to compare impacts of various policy alternatives. Moreover, it is assumed that policymakers make rational decisions based on the merits of the project. Eccleston and March argue that although policymakers normally have access to reasonably accurate information, political and economic factors often lead to environmentally destructive decisions in the long run.

The decision-making theory casts doubt on this premise. Irrational decisions are reached based on unconscious biases, illogical assumptions, and the desire to avoid ambiguity and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston C. and Doub P., Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments:  A Users Guide to Best Professional Practices, CRC Press Inc., 300 pages (publication date: March 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles H. Eccleston|Eccleston]] identifies and describes four of the most critical environmental policy issues facing humanity: [[water scarcity]], [[food scarcity]], [[climate change]], and the [[Income and fertility|population paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston C. and March F., Global Environmental Policy: Principles, Concepts And Practice, CRC Press Inc. 412 pages (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/the-population-paradox&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and innovation policy==
Synergic to the environmental policy is the [[environmental research]] and [[innovation policy]]. An example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Europe is particularly active in this field, via a set of strategies, actions and programmes to promote more and better research and innovation for building a resource-efficient, climate resilient society and thriving economy in sync with its natural environment. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1960s marked the beginning of modern environmental policy making. Although mainstream America remained oblivious to environmental concerns, the stage had been set for change by the publication of Rachel Carson's New York Times bestseller Silent Spring in 1962. Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson, then a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, California. Administrator Ruckelshaus was confirmed by the Senate on December 2, 1970, which is the traditional date used as the birth of the agency. Five months earlier, in July 1970, President Nixon had signed Reorganization Plan No. 3 calling for the establishment of EPA in July 1970. At the time, Environmental Policy was a bipartisan issue and the efforts of the [[United States of America]] helped spark countries around the world to create environmental policies.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://search.proquest.com/docview/207664697/ Managing the Environment, Managing Ourselves: A History of American Environmental Policy]”&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, legislation was passed to regulate pollutants that go into the air, water tables, and solid waste disposal. President Nixon signed the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] in 1970 which set the USA as one of the world leaders in environmental conservation.

In the European Union, the very first Environmental Action Programmed was adopted by national government representatives in July 1973 during the first meeting of the Council of Environmental Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Knill, C. and Liefferink, D. (2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy. In: Jordan, A.J. and C. Adelle (ed.) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e).  Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an increasingly dense network of legislation has developed, which now extends to all areas of [[environmental protection]] including air pollution control, water protection and waste policy but also nature conservation and the control of chemicals, biotechnology and other industrial risks. [[EU environmental policy]] has thus become a core area of European politics.

Overall organizations are becoming more aware of their environmental risks and performance requirements. In line with the [[ISO 14001]] standard they are developing environmental policies suitable for their organization.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Global-Environmental-Policy-Concepts-Principles-ebook/dp/B005H6M86Q/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice]. Chapter 7. {{ISBN|978-1439847664}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement outlines environmental performance of the organization as well as its environmental objectives. Written by top management of the organization they document a commitment to continuous improvement and complying with legal and other requirements, such as the environmental policy objectives set by their governments.

== Environmental policy integration ==

The concept of '''environmental policy integration''' (EPI) refers to the process of integrating environmental objectives into non-environmental policy areas, such as energy, agriculture and transport, rather than leaving them to be pursued solely through purely environmental policy practices. This is oftentimes particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Rossi|first2=Piercarlo|title=National Energy Policies and Energy Security in the Context of Climate Change and Global Environmental Risks: A Theoretical Framework for Reconciling Domestic and International Law Through a Multiscalar and Multilevel Approach|journal=European Energy and Environmental Law Review|date=December 2, 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=232–244|ssrn=1970698|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPI is widely recognised as one of the key elements of sustainable development. More recently, the notion of ‘climate policy integration’, also denoted as ‘mainstreaming’, has been applied to indicate the integration of climate considerations (both mitigation and adaptation) into the normal (often economically focused) activity of government.&lt;ref&gt;Taskforce on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/?page_id=144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental policy studies==
Given the growing need for trained environmental practitioners, [[graduate school]]s throughout the world offer specialized [[professional degree]]s in environmental policy studies. While there is not a standard [[curriculum]], students typically take classes in [[policy analysis]], [[environmental science]], [[environmental law]] and [[environmental politics|politics]], [[ecology]], [[energy]], and [[natural resource management]]. Graduates of these programs are employed by [[government]]s, [[international organizations]], [[private sector]], [[think tanks]], [[universities]], and so on.

Due to the lack of standard [[nomenclature]], institutions use varying designations to refer to academic degrees they award. However, the degrees typically fall in one of four broad categories: [[master of arts]], [[master of science]], [[master of public administration]], and [[PhD]] in environmental policy. Sometimes, more specific names are used to reflect the focus of the academic program. For example, the [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey]] awards master of arts in international environmental policy (MAIEP) to emphasize the international orientation of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Monterey Institute of International Studies|url=http://www.miis.edu/academics/programs/environmentalpolicy |title=MA in International Environmental Policy |publisher=Miis.edu |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4208">The '''environmental revolution''' is the ongoing process of switching from [[pollution]]-causing and [[Climate Change|climate-changing]] technology to efficient and clean technology.&lt;ref name="catholicnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp /&gt;&lt;ref name=jt /&gt;&lt;ref name=janes /&gt;

The environmental revolution follows other technological revolutions such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Digital Revolution]].
[[Image:Enten und Gänse als Gartenhelfer.jpg|thumb|right|400px|An example of '''permaculture''', a [[sustainable]] form of [[farming]], using animals and gardens.]]

==History==

The environmental movement has its roots in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="mtmultipleuse1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtmultipleuse.org/endangered/esahistory.htm |title=History of Environmentalism |publisher=Mtmultipleuse.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] and [[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892 after successfully lobbying Congress to create [[Yosemite National Park]].

The modern environmental movement began in the mid-to-late 1960s.&lt;ref name="mtmultipleuse1"/&gt; Environmental problems had been illustrated in books such as [[Silent Spring]] and there was a [[back-to-the-land movement]], closely associated with the [[Hippie movement]] and [[Counterculture]].

By the 1990s, the need for [[green technology]] was realized, and the development of [[electric cars]] and [[alternative energy]] gradually began to become mainstream. In the first decades of the 21st century, significant progress has been made. The first new electric cars were released to the public in 2010, and environmentalism has gone from being fringe to being completely mainstream, even embraced by [[Conservatism|conservative]] institutions such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==New technologies==

Many environmentally friendly technologies, such as electric cars, [[solar power]], [[geothermal energy]], [[wind power]], [[vertical farming]], [[recycling]], [[permaculture]], [[hydroponics]], [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] technology such as [[fluorescent lighting]] and [[LEDs]] and [[high-speed rail]] have been implemented or have become mainstream in Western nations since 1980. Developing nations have also embraced these technologies, and China has become the world's leading manufacturer of wind turbines and solar-electric panels in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/business/energy-environment/31renew.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=China Leading Global Race to Make Clean Energy « |publisher=nytimes.org |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8763">'''European Architecture Student Assembly''' was founded in 1981 by architect students like Geoff Haslam and [[Richard Murphy (architect)|Richard Murphy]] and is closely related to the Winterschool concept, which organises similar events for UK students of architecture.
'''EASA''' takes place each summer in a different country, with the event usually lasting two weeks. It is organised by students of architecture for students of architecture and the concept is operated on a cooperative basis. In fall at INCM, Intermediate National Contact Meeting, the location for EASA is decided one and a half years in advance. Typically 400 students take part in the event and engage in '''workshops''', '''exhibitions''', '''lectures''' and social events loosely based around a specific theme. These events are run by a combination of academics and students and encompass a wide variety of activities with a greater or lesser relationship to architecture. The event is funded through a combination of attendance fees (which vary for each country based upon ability to pay), grants and sponsorship, all arranged by the organising committee for each event.

'''EASA''' has little or no formal structure in that each event is organised as a unique occurrence- though a system of '''National Contacts''', '''NC's''', that ensures, that the event each year is well supported. NC's also typically meet once a year to discuss the previous '''EASA''' and prepare for the next. Students come from over 40 European countries to the event each year. Recent Assemblies have seen students participating from the USA, India and Central American countries.

===SESAM (Small European Architecture Students Assembly Meeting)===
The '''SESAM''' is an event arranged by the '''EASA''' network. Like the basic idea of the '''EASA''', a '''SESAM''' can give an addition and/or alternative to the education of the students. The independence and off-university-character creates an informal atmosphere. The '''SESAM''' is a '''workshop''' with a small number of participants. Through this concentrated character the '''SESAM''' allows to work on a tight theme. After a number of similar events in the year before in Italy, the [[Netherlands]], [[Czechoslovakia]], etc., the first '''EASA''' workshop with the name '''SESAM''' was realized 1992 in [[Villafames]]  (Valencia, Spain, October 1992, 50 participants). SESAM2007 was held in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]] on 23–25 November 2007.

===Pivo SESAM ===
The event is an excuse to meet with the other members of the network. It usually takes place during the New Year celebrations.

==EASA Newspaper: Umbrella==
Each year, during '''EASA''', one of the workshops is dedicated to cover the event by reporting about events and workshops in a newspaper-like fashion. This workshop and hence the newspaper is typically called umbrella, or variation of the local word for umbrella. This newspaper is usually published on a daily basis and has been an integral part of '''EASA''' since the early 1980s. In recent years, The Umbrella Workshop has also embraced new media, and has run EASA TV during the event. In 2009 EASA TV was a workshop of its own for the first time, but with integral co-operation with Umbrella.

==EASA TV==
EASA.TV tries to cover as much of the assembly as possible and the material is then edited, screened on site at the assembly and uploaded online. The participants will learn how to plan episodes, write scripts, draw storyboards, record with DSLR cameras and edit and export with software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. But most of all they will get the chance to document the very essence of EASA, the EASA spirit. Since 2007

==EASA FM==
EASA FM is a temporary radio station that was started in EASA011, Cadiz/Spain.

[[File:ESO Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer of the European Southern Observatory]]

The '''European Southern Observatory''' ('''ESO'''), formally the '''European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/about-eso/organisation/ | title = ESO's Organisational Structure | accessdate = 2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a 16-nation [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental research organization]] for ground-based [[astronomy]]. Created in 1962, ESO has provided astronomers with state-of-the-art research facilities and access to the southern sky. The organisation employs about 730 staff members and receives annual member state contributions of approximately €162&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/usa/about-eso/memberstates/ | title = Member States | date=2017-04-02 | accessdate = 2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its observatories are located in northern [[Chile]].

ESO has built and operated some of the largest and most technologically advanced [[telescope]]s. These include the 3.6 m [[New Technology Telescope]], an early pioneer in the use of [[active optics]], and the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT), which consists of four individual 8.2 m telescopes and four smaller auxiliary telescopes which can all work together or separately. The [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] observes the [[universe]] in the [[Terahertz radiation|millimetre and submillimetre]] wavelength ranges, and is the world's largest ground-based astronomy project to date. It was completed in March 2013 in an international collaboration by Europe (represented by ESO), North America, East Asia and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en | title = ALMA website | accessdate = 2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/alma/ | title = Welcome to ALMA! | accessdate = 2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently under construction is the [[Extremely Large Telescope]]. It will use a 39.3-metre-diameter [[segmented mirror]], and become the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|world's largest]] optical reflecting telescope when operational in 2024. Its light-gathering power will allow detailed studies of planets around other stars, the first objects in the universe, [[supermassive black hole]]s, and the nature and distribution of the [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] which dominate the universe.

ESO's observing facilities have made astronomical discoveries and produced several [[astronomical catalogue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.eso.org/starcat/astrocat/astrocat_screen_list.html | title = ESO Archive | accessdate = 2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its findings include the discovery of the most distant [[gamma-ray burst]] and evidence for a [[black hole]] at the centre of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7268/full/nature08459.html | title = A gamma-ray burst at a redshift of 8.2| accessdate = 2011-09-21 | volume=461 | doi = 10.1038/nature08459 | journal=Nature | pages=1254–1257|arxiv = 0906.1577 |bibcode = 2009Natur.461.1254T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Monitoring stellar orbits around the Massive Black Hole in the Galactic Center| date = 1970| last1 = Gillessen| first1 = S.| display-authors = 4| last2 = Eisenhauer| first2 = F.| last3 = Trippe| first3 = S.| last4 = Alexander| first4 = T.| last5 = Genzel| first5 = R.| last6 = Martins| first6 = F.| last7 = Ott| first7 = T.| doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/692/2/1075| journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]]| volume = 692| issue = 2| pages = 1075|arxiv=0810.4674|bibcode = 2009ApJ...692.1075G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the VLT allowed astronomers to obtain the first picture of an [[extrasolar planet]] ([[2M1207b]]) orbiting a [[brown dwarf]] 173 light-years away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A giant planet candidate near a young brown dwarf.

[[File:Gala Event Celebrates 50 Years of the European Southern Observatory.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|ESO golden-anniversary celebrants&lt;ref name=eso1240&gt;{{cite news|title=Gala Event Celebrates 50 Years of the European Southern Observatory|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1240/|accessdate=14 October 2012|newspaper=ESO Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The idea that European astronomers should establish a common large observatory was broached by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Jan Oort]] at the [[Leiden Observatory]] in the Netherlands in spring 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was pursued by Oort, who gathered a group of astronomers in Leiden to consider it on June 21 that year. Immediately thereafter, the subject was further discussed at the Groningen conference in the Netherlands. On January 26, 1954, an ESO declaration was signed by astronomers from six European countries expressing the wish that a joint European observatory be established in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="ESO Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/about-eso/timeline.html | title = ESO Timeline | accessdate = 2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, all [[reflector telescope]]s with an [[aperture]] of 2 metres or more were located in the northern hemisphere. The decision to build the observatory in the southern hemisphere resulted from the necessity of observing the southern sky; some research subjects (such as the central parts of the [[Milky Way]] and the [[Magellanic Clouds]]) were accessible only from the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Europe's Quest for the Universe |author=Lodewijk Woltjer |publisher=EDP Sciences |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was initially planned to set up telescopes in South Africa (where several European observatories were located), tests from 1955 to 1963 demonstrated that a site in the [[Andes]] was preferable. On November 15, 1963 [[Chile]] was chosen as the site for ESO's observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was preceded by the ESO Convention, signed 5 October 1962 by Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. [[Otto Heckmann]] was nominated as the organisation's first director general on 1 November 1962.

A preliminary proposal for a convention of astronomy organisations in these five countries was drafted in 1954. Although some amendments were made in the initial document, the convention proceeded slowly until 1960 when it was discussed during that year's committee meeting. The new draft was examined in detail, and a council member of [[CERN]] (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) highlighted the need for a convention between governments (in addition to organisations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention and government involvement became pressing due to rapidly rising costs of site-testing expeditions. The final 1962 version was largely adopted from the CERN convention, due to similarities between the organisations and the dual membership of some members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the first ESO telescope at the La Silla site in Chile began operating.&lt;ref name="ESO Timeline"/&gt; Because CERN (like ESO) had sophisticated instrumentation, the astronomy organisation frequently turned to the nuclear-research body for advice and a collaborative agreement between ESO and CERN was signed in 1970. Several months later, ESO's telescope division moved into a CERN building in [[Geneva]] and ESO's Sky Atlas Laboratory was established on CERN property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991 |pages=169, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESO's European departments moved into the new ESO headquarters in [[Garching bei München|Garching]] (near [[Munich]]), Germany in 1980.

Although ESO is headquartered in Germany, its telescopes and observatories are in northern Chile, where the organisation operates advanced [[Observatory|ground-based]] astronomical facilities:
* [[La Silla Observatory|La Silla]], which hosts the [[New Technology Telescope]] (NTT)
* [[Paranal Observatory|Paranal]], where the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) is located
* [[Llano de Chajnantor Observatory|Llano de Chajnantor]], which hosts the APEX ([[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]]) [[submillimetre astronomy|submillimetre telescope]] and where ALMA, the [[Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array]], is located

These are among the best locations for astronomical observations in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/location/why-chile | title = The best observing sites on Earth | accessdate = 2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ESO project is the [[Extremely Large Telescope]] (ELT), a 40-metre-class telescope based on a five-mirror design and the formerly planned [[Overwhelmingly Large Telescope]]. The ELT will be the largest visible and near-infrared telescope in the world. ESO began its design in early 2006, and aimed to begin construction in 2012.&lt;ref name="The E-ELT project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/ | title = The E-ELT project | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction work at the ELT site started in June 2014.&lt;ref name=beginning&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/european-extremely-large-telescope-to-break-ground-using-dynamite-live-later-today-9548123.html|title=European Extremely Large Telescope to break ground (using dynamite) live later today |author=James Vincent|publisher=The Independent|date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As decided by the ESO council on 26 April 2010, a fourth site ([[Cerro Armazones]]) is to be home to ELT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 April 2010 |title=E-ELT Site Chosen |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1018/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site2010.sai.msu.ru/section/4| title = Comprehensive characterization of astronomical sites| accessdate = 2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dfa.uv.cl/sitetestingdata/index.htm/4| title = Conference Astronomical Site Testing Data in Chile| accessdate = 2011-10-04}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year about 2,000 requests are made for the use of ESO telescopes, for four to six times more nights than are available. Observations made with these instruments appear in a number of peer-reviewed publications annually; in 2017, more than 1,000 reviewed papers based on ESO data were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/libraries/edocs/ESO/ESOstats.pdf| title = ESO Publication Statistics| accessdate = 2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESO telescopes generate large amounts of data at a high rate, which are stored in a permanent archive facility at ESO headquarters. The archive contains more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million images (or spectra) with a total volume of about 65&amp;nbsp;terabytes (65,000,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;bytes) of data.

La Silla, located in the southern [[Atacama Desert]] {{convert|600|km}} north of [[Santiago de Chile]] at an altitude of {{convert|2400|m}}, is the home of ESO's original observation site. Like other observatories in the area, La Silla is far from sources of [[light pollution]] and has one of the darkest night skies on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chile.travel/en/what-to-do/astronomy/touristic-observatories.html |title=Observatories in Chile |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923095254/http://chile.travel/en/what-to-do/astronomy/touristic-observatories.html |archivedate=2011-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In La Silla, ESO operates three telescopes: a 3.6-metre telescope, the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and the 2.2-metre Max-Planck-ESO Telescope.

The observatory hosts visitor instruments, attached to a telescope for the duration of an observational run and then removed. La Silla also hosts national telescopes, such as the 1.2-metre Swiss and the 1.5-metre Danish telescopes.

About 300 reviewed publications annually are attributable to the work of the observatory. Discoveries made with La Silla telescopes include the [[High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher|HARPS-spectrograph]] detection of the planets orbiting within the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]], which contains the first known rocky planet in a habitable zone outside the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=25 April 2007|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0722/ | publisher=ESO | title = Astronomers Find First Earth-like Planet in Habitable Zone | accessdate = 2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obswww.unige.ch/%7Eudry/udry_preprint.pdf | title = The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets | accessdate = 2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several telescopes at La Silla played a role in linking [[gamma-ray burst]]s, the most energetic explosions in the universe since the [[Big Bang]], with the explosions of massive stars. The ESO La Silla Observatory also played a role in the study of supernova [[SN 1987A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 February 2007 |title=SN 1987A's Twentieth Anniversary |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0708/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ESO 3.6-metre telescope ====
{{Main|ESO 3.6 m Telescope}}
The ESO 3.6-metre telescope began operations in 1977. It has been upgraded, including the installation of a new [[secondary mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/telescopes/3p6/ | title = The ESO 3.6m Telescope | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventionally designed [[Telescope#Telescope mountings|horseshoe-mount]] telescope was primarily used for [[infrared]] [[spectroscopy]]; it now hosts the HARPS spectrograph, used in search of [[extra-solar planets]] and for [[asteroseismology]]. The telescope was designed for very high long-term [[radial velocity]] accuracy (on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps/overview.html | title = HARPS: The Planet Hunter | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Technology Telescope ====
{{Main|New Technology Telescope}}

The New Technology Telescope (NTT) is an [[Altazimuth mount|altazimuth]], 3.58-metre [[Ritchey-Chrétien telescope]], inaugurated in 1989 and the first in the world with a computer-controlled main mirror. The flexible mirror's shape is adjusted during observation to preserve optimal image quality. The secondary mirror position is also adjustable in three directions. This technology (developed by ESO and known as [[active optics]]) is now applied to all major telescopes, including the VLT and the future ELT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.142-dec10/messenger-no142-41-41.pdf| title = Raymond Wilson honoured with two prestigious prizes | accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the octagonal enclosure housing the NTT is innovative. The telescope dome is relatively small and ventilated by a system of flaps directing airflow smoothly across the mirror, reducing turbulence and resulting in sharper images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/ntt.html | title = ESO NTT | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope ====
{{Main|MPG/ESO telescope}}

The 2.2-metre telescope has been in operation at La Silla since early 1984, and is on indefinite loan to ESO from the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften'', or MPG, in German). Telescope time is shared between MPG and ESO observing programmes, while operation and maintenance of the telescope are ESO's responsibility.

Its instrumentation includes a 67-million-pixel wide-field imager (WFI) with a [[Field of view#Astronomy|field of view]] as large as the full moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/lasilla/instruments/wfi/index.html | title = WFI—Wide Field Imager | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has taken many images of celestial objects. Other instruments used are [[GROND]] (Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Near-Infrared Detector), which seeks the afterglow of gamma-ray bursts—the most powerful explosions in the universe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=6 July 2007 |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0730/ | title = GROND Takes Off |publisher=ESO| accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the high-resolution spectrograph FEROS (Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph), used to make detailed studies of stars.

La Silla also hosts several national and project telescopes not operated by ESO. Among them are the Swiss Euler Telescope, the Danish National Telescope and the REM, TRAPPIST and TAROT telescopes.&lt;ref name="National and Project Telescopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/telescopes/national.html | title = National and Project Telescopes | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Euler Telescope]] is a 1.2-metre telescope built and operated by the [[Geneva Observatory]] in Switzerland. It is used to conduct high-precision radial velocity measurements primarily used in the search for large extrasolar planets in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its first discovery was a planet orbiting [[Gliese 86]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 November 1998|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9855/ | title = Extrasolar Planet in Double Star System Discovered from La Silla |publisher=ESO| accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observing programmes focus on [[variable star]]s, [[asteroseismology]], gamma-ray bursts, monitoring [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) and [[gravitational lens]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obswww.unige.ch/exoplanets/coralie.html| title = Southern Sky extrasolar Planet search Programme | accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1.54-metre ''Danish National Telescope'' was built by [[Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co|Grubb-Parsons]] and has been in use at La Silla since 1979. The telescope has an [[Off-axis optical system|off-axis]] mount, and the optics are a Ritchey-Chrétien design. Because of the telescope's mount and limited space inside the dome, it has significant pointing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/telescopes/d1p5/ |title = The Danish Telescope at La Silla | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Rapid Eye Mount telescope]] is a small rapid-reaction automatic telescope with a primary {{convert|60|cm|in|adj=on}} mirror. The telescope, in an [[altazimuth mount]], began operation in October 2002. The primary purpose of the telescope is to follow the afterglow of the GRBs detected by the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] satellite.&lt;ref name="National and Project Telescopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rem.inaf.it/ | title = Rapid Eye Mount | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Belgian [[TRAPPIST]] is a joint venture between the [[University of Liège]] and Geneva Observatory. The 0.60-metre telescope is specialized in [[comets]], exoplanets, and was one of the few telescopes that observed a [[stellar occultation]] of the dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], revealing that it may be smaller than [[Pluto]].&lt;ref name=beatty&gt;Newscientist.com, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19697-former-tenth-planet-may-be-smaller-than-pluto.html Kelly Beatty - Former 'tenth planet' may be smaller than Pluto], November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Quick-action telescope for transient objects'', [[TAROT-South robotic observatory|TAROT]], is a very fast-moving optical robotic telescope able to observe a gamma-ray burst from its beginning. Satellites detecting GRBs send signals to TAROT, which can provide a [[Minute of arc#Astronomy|sub-arc second]] position to the astronomical community. Data from the TAROT telescope is also useful in studying the evolution of GRBs, the physics of a [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]] and its surrounding material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tarot.obs-hp.fr/tarot/ |title=TAROT website |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830125651/http://tarot.obs-hp.fr/tarot/ |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is operated from the [[Haute-Provence Observatory]] in France.

=== Paranal ===
{{Main|Paranal Observatory}}

The Paranal Observatory is located atop [[Cerro Paranal]] in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Cerro Paranal is a {{convert|2635|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} mountain about {{convert|120|km}} south of [[Antofagasta]] and {{convert|12|km}} from the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/site/paranal.html | title = Paranal Site Details | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory has seven major telescopes operating in visible and infrared light: the four {{convert|8.2|m|adj=on}} telescopes of the Very Large Telescope, the {{convert|2.6|m|adj=on}} VLT Survey Telescope (VST) and the {{convert|4.1|m|adj=on}} Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy. In addition, there are four {{convert|1.8|m|adj=on}} auxiliary telescopes forming an array used for [[interferometric]] observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr.html | title = Telescopes and Instrumentation | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Paranal was the location for several scenes of the 22nd James Bond film, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 March 2008 |title=A Giant of Astronomy and a Quantum of Solace |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso08007/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830515/ | title = IMDB—Quantum of Solace (2008) | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main facility at Paranal is the VLT, which consists of four nearly identical {{convert|8.2|m|adj=on}} unit telescopes (UTs), each hosting two or three instruments. These large telescopes can also work together in groups of two or three as a giant [[Interferometry|interferometer]]. The ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) allows astronomers to see details up to 25 times finer than those seen with the individual telescopes. The light beams are combined in the VLTI with a complex system of mirrors in underground tunnels, where the light paths must diverge less than 1/1000&amp;nbsp;mm over 100 metres. The VLTI can achieve an [[angular resolution]] of milliarcseconds, equivalent to the ability to see the headlights of a car on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt.html | title = The Very Large Telescope | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the UTs had its [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] in May 1998, and was offered to the astronomical community on 1 April 1999.&lt;ref name="A Great Moment for Astronomy"&gt;{{cite news |date=27 May 1998 |title=A Great Moment for Astronomy|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9820/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other telescopes followed suit in 1999 and 2000, making the VLT fully operational. Four 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes (ATs), installed between 2004 and 2007, have been added to the VLTI for accessibility when the UTs are used for other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 December 2006 |title=Little Brother Joins the Large Family |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0651/|publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the VLT have led to the publication of an average of more than one peer-reviewed scientific paper per day; in 2017, over 600 reviewed scientific papers were published based on VLT data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/libraries/edocs/ESO/ESOstats.pdf| title = ESO Publication Statistics| accessdate = 2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VLT's scientific discoveries include imaging an extrasolar planet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=21 November 2008 |title=Beta Pictoris planet finally imaged? |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0842/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; tracking individual stars moving around the [[supermassive black hole]] at the centre of the Milky Way&lt;ref name="eso.org"&gt;{{cite news |date=10 December 2008 |title=Unprecedented 16-Year Long Study Tracks Stars Orbiting Milky Way Black Hole |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0846/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observing the afterglow of the furthest known gamma-ray burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 September 2008 |title=NASA's Swift Catches Farthest Ever Gamma-Ray Burst |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/farthest_grb.html |publisher=NASA | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Paranal inauguration in March 1999, names of celestial objects in the [[Mapuche language]] were chosen to replace the technical designations of the four VLT Unit Telescopes (UT1–UT4). An essay contest was prior arranged for schoolchildren in the region concerning the meaning of these names which attracted many entries dealing with the cultural heritage of ESO's host country. A 17-year-old adolescent from [[Chuquicamata]], near [[Calama, Chile|Calama]], submitted the winning essay and was awarded an amateur telescope during the inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 March 1999 |title=VLT Unit Telescopes Named at Paranal Inauguration |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9921/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four unit telescopes, UT1, UT2, UT3 and UT4, are since known as ''Antu'' (sun), ''Kueyen'' (moon), ''Melipal'' (Southern Cross), and ''Yepun'' (Evening Star),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/vlt-names.html | title = Names of VLT Unit Telescopes | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter having been originally mistranslated as "Sirius", instead of "Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/yepun.html | title = On the Meaning of "YEPUN" | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

[[Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy]] (VISTA) is housed on the peak adjacent to the one hosting the VLT, sharing observational conditions. VISTA's main mirror is {{convert|4.1|m}} across, a highly curved mirror for its size and quality. Its deviations from a perfect surface are less than a few thousandths the thickness of a human hair, and its construction and polishing presented a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 December 2009 |title=VISTA: Pioneering New Survey Telescope Starts Work |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0949/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VISTA was conceived and developed by a consortium of 18 universities in the United Kingdom led by [[Queen Mary, University of London]], and it became an in-kind contribution to ESO as part of the UK's ratification agreement. The telescope's design and construction were managed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council's [[UK Astronomy Technology Centre]] (STFC, UK ATC). Provisional acceptance of VISTA was formally granted by ESO at the December 2009 ceremony at ESO headquarters in Garching, which was attended by representatives of Queen Mary, University of London and STFC. Since then the telescope has been operated by ESO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 December 2009 |title=First stunning images captured by VISTA Telescope |url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/News+and+Events/13651.aspx |publisher=STFC |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308055042/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/News+and+Events/13651.aspx |archivedate=8 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; capturing quality images since it began operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 February 2010 |title=Orion in a New Light |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1006/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 January 2011 |title=VISTA Stares Deeply into the Blue Lagoon |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1101/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[VLT Survey Telescope]] (VST) is a state-of-the-art, {{convert|2.6|m|adj=on}} telescope equipped with OmegaCAM, a 268-megapixel CCD camera with a field of view four times the area of the full moon. It complements VISTA by surveying the sky in visible light. The VST (which became operational in 2011) is the result of a joint venture between ESO and the [[Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte]] (Naples), a research centre at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics [[INAF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1119/| title = First Images from the VLT Survey Telescope | accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vstportal.oacn.inaf.it/ |title=VLT Survey Telescope Center at Naples Web Portal |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305031627/http://vstportal.oacn.inaf.it/ |archivedate=2007-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific goals of both surveys range from the nature of dark energy to assessing [[near-Earth object]]s. Teams of European astronomers will conduct the surveys; some will cover most of the southern sky, while others will focus on smaller areas. VISTA and the VST are expected to produce large amounts of data; a single picture taken by VISTA has 67&amp;nbsp;megapixels, and images from OmegaCam (on the VST) will have 268&amp;nbsp;megapixels. The two survey telescopes collect more data every night than all the other instruments on the VLT combined. The VST and VISTA produce more than 100 terabytes of data per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/surveytelescopes.html | title = The ESO Survey Telescopes | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Llano de Chajnantor is a {{convert|5100|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} plateau in the Atacama Desert, about {{convert|50|km}} east of [[San Pedro de Atacama]]. The site is {{convert|750|m}} higher than the [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] and {{convert|2400|m}} higher than the VLT in Cerro Paranal. It is dry and inhospitable to humans, but a good site for [[submillimetre astronomy]]; because [[water vapor]] molecules in [[Earth's atmosphere]] absorb and attenuate [[submillimetre radiation]], a dry site is required for this type of [[radio astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alma.nrao.edu/projectbk/construction/chap14/chap14.html|title = ALMA Site Characterization and Monitoring| accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telescopes are:
* [[Atacama Cosmology Telescope]] (ACT; not operated by ESO)
* [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] 
* [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] 
* [[QUIET|Q/U Imaging Experiment]] (QUIET; not operated by ESO) &lt;!-- Though the Wikipedia article is horribly outdated --&gt;
* [[POLARBEAR]] (on the Huan Tran Telescope; not operated by ESO)

APEX and ALMA are telescopes designed for millimetre and submillimetre astronomy. This type of astronomy is a relatively unexplored frontier, revealing a universe which cannot be seen in more-familiar visible or infrared light and ideal for studying the "cold universe"; light at these wavelengths shines from vast cold clouds in interstellar space at temperatures only a few tens of degrees above [[absolute zero]]. Astronomers use this light to study the chemical and physical conditions in these [[molecular cloud]]s, the dense regions of gas and cosmic dust where new stars are being born. Seen in visible light, these regions of the universe are often dark and obscure due to dust; however, they shine brightly in the millimetre and submillimetre portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This wavelength range is also ideal for studying some of the earliest (and most distant) galaxies in the universe, whose light has been [[redshift]]ed into longer wavelengths from the expansion of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/apex.html |title = ESO APEX | accessdate = 2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://almascience.nrao.edu/about-alma/alma-site |title = ALMA Site – ALMA Science Portal | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ====

The Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope is operated by ESO in collaboration with the [[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]] in [[Bonn]], Germany and the [[Onsala Space Observatory]] in [[Onsala]], Sweden. It is a {{convert|12|m|adj=on}}-diameter telescope operating at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths, the largest of its kind in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apex-telescope.org/|title = Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment APEX| accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/apex.html |title = ESO APEX | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; APEX is a precursor of ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter Array), an [[astronomical interferometer]] which ESO and its international partners is building on the Chajnantor plateau. APEX is based on a prototype ALMA antenna that is modified to be operated as single dish [[radio telescope]].

==== Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ====
{{Main|Atacama Large Millimeter Array}}

ALMA is an astronomical interferometer of innovative design, initially composed of 66 high-precision antennas and operating at wavelengths of 0.3 to 3.6&amp;nbsp;mm. Its main array will have 50 {{convert|12|m|adj=on}} antennas acting as a single [[interferometer]]. An additional compact array of four 12-metre and twelve {{convert|7|m|adj=on}} antennas is also planned. The antennas can be arranged across the desert plateau over distances from 150 metres to {{convert|16|km}}, which will give ALMA a variable "zoom". The array will be able to probe the universe at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, with vision up to ten times sharper than the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. These images will complement those made with the [[VLT Interferometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/alma.html |title = ESO ALMA | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALMA is a collaboration between East Asia (Japan and [[Taiwan]]), Europe (ESO), North America (USA and Canada) and Chile.

The scientific goals of ALMA include studying the origin and formation of stars, galaxies, and planets with observations of molecular gas and dust, studying distant galaxies towards the edge of the observable universe and studying [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|relic radiation]] from the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://almascience.nrao.edu/alma-science |title = ALMA Science—ALMA Science Portal | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A call for ALMA science proposals was issued on 31 March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://almascience.nrao.edu/call-for-proposals |title=Call for Proposals—ALMA Science Portal |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114071735/https://almascience.nrao.edu/call-for-proposals |archivedate=2011-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and early observations began on 3 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ALMA Early Science Cycle 0 Call for Proposals |url=https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma |publisher=NRAO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1137/|title = ALMA Opens its Eyes| accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Search for extrasolar planets ===
[[File:ESO OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb.jpg|thumb|alt=Icy planet and its very-distant star|Artist's impression of an icy [[exoplanet]]]]

"Is there life elsewhere in the universe?" is one of humankind's most profound unanswered questions. A step in the attempt to answer this question is the search for planets outside the Solar System. ESO's observatories are equipped with an arsenal of instruments for finding, studying, and monitoring [[extrasolar planet]]s. In 2004, the Very Large Telescope detected a faint glow from an apparent planet orbiting a star about 200 light-years from earth. A year later, this detection was confirmed as the first picture of an exoplanet ever recorded. Although the planet is large (five times more massive than [[Jupiter]]), this observation is a first step toward identifying the physical structure and chemical composition of exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 April 2005 |title=Yes, it is the Image of an Exoplanet |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0515/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/04/29/first-exoplanet-imaged/ | title = Bad Astronomy, FIRST EXOPLANET IMAGE CONFIRMED! | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that planets seem very common in the universe they are tiny, faint objects at cosmic scales; this makes their detection difficult with current technology. For this reason, most exoplanets have been detected with indirect methods. Of these, the most successful has been the [[radial velocity method]]. HARPS (the High Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher) has allowed the discovery of a number of planets with masses below that of [[Neptune]] orbiting nearby stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 September 2011 |title=Fifty New Exoplanets Discovered by HARPS |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1134/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few of these planets are among the smallest ever discovered, or reside in its star's [[habitable zone]]. The possibility exists that one of these planets is covered by oceans; this discovery is an encouraging result in the search for planets which could support life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/science/exoplanets.html | title = ESO Exoplanets | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish 1.54-metre telescope at La Silla participated in the discovery of one of the most Earth-like planets found to date. The planet, detected using the [[microlensing]] technique and about five times as massive as Earth, circles its parent star in about 10 years and most certainly has a rocky and icy surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7075/full/nature04441.html| title = Discovery of a cool planet of 5.5 Earth masses through gravitational microlensing | accessdate = 2011-05-05 | volume=439| doi = 10.1038/nature04441| pmid=16437108| date=January 2006| journal=Nature| pages=437–40 | last1 = Beaulieu | first1 = JP | last2 = Bennett | first2 = DP | last3 = Fouqué | first3 = P | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al|arxiv = astro-ph/0601563 |bibcode = 2006Natur.439..437B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 January 2006 |title=It's Far, It's Small, It's Cool: It's an Icy Exoplanet! |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0603/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Breakthrough Initiatives and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) entered a collaboration&lt;ref name="VLT ESO"&gt;{{cite web|title=VLT to Search for Planets in Alpha Centauri System - ESO Signs Agreement with Breakthrough Initiatives|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1702/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakthrough Initiatives|url=http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/News/8|website=breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enable and implement a search for habitable planets in the nearby star system, Alpha Centauri. The agreement involves Breakthrough Initiatives providing funding for an upgrade to the VISIR (VLT Imager and Spectrometer for mid-Infrared)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VISIR|url=https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/vlt-instr/visir/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=July 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; instrument on ESO's [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) in Chile. This upgrade will greatly increase the likelihood of planet detection in the system.

[[File:The Very Large Telescope and the star system Alpha Centauri.jpg|thumb|The Very Large Telescope and the star system Alpha Centauri.&lt;ref name="VLT ESO"/&gt;]]

In August 2016, the European Southern Observatory announced the detection of a planet orbiting the third star in the [[Alpha Centauri system]], [[Proxima Centauri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet Found in Habitable Zone Around Nearest Star - Pale Red Dot campaign reveals Earth-mass world in orbit around Proxima Centauri|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1629/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Witze|first1=Alexandra|title=Earth-sized planet around nearby star is astronomy dream come true|url=http://www.nature.com/news/earth-sized-planet-around-nearby-star-is-astronomy-dream-come-true-1.20445|website=Nature|accessdate=10 January 2017|pages=381–382|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20445|date=25 August 2016|bibcode = 2016Natur.536..381W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The planet, called Proxima Centauri b, could be a potential target for one of the projects of Breakthrough Initiatives.

[[Breakthrough Starshot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakthrough Initiatives|url=https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3|website=breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proof of concept mission to send a fleet of ultra-fast light-driven nanocraft to explore the Alpha Centauri star system, which could pave the way for a first launch within the next generation. An objective of the mission would be to make a fly-by of and possibly photograph any Earth-like worlds that might exist in the system.

=== Age of the universe ===
[[File:The Globular Cluster 47 Tu.jpg|thumb|alt=Cluster of stars|Globular Cluster [[47 Tucanae]]]]

With the Very Large Telescope, astronomers have made an independent determination of the age of the universe and shed new light on the earliest stages of the Milky Way. For the first time, they measured the amount of the [[radioactive isotope]] uranium-238 in a star born when the Milky Way was still forming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 February 2001 |title=How Old is the Universe? |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0106/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[carbon dating]] over longer timescales, the uranium clock measures the age of a star. It shows that this star is 12.5&amp;nbsp;billion years old. Because the star cannot be older than the universe itself, the universe must be older than this. This agrees with known [[cosmology]], which gives an [[age of the universe]] of 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years. The star (and the Milky Way) must have formed soon after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/science/stars.html | title = ESO Very Old Stars | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another result is the first measurement of the [[beryllium]] content of two stars in a Milky Way [[globular cluster]]. With this measurement, astronomers found that the first generation of stars in our galaxy must have formed soon after the end of the 200-million-year "[[Chronology of the universe#Dark Ages|Dark Age]]" following the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="How Old is the Milky Way"&gt;{{cite news |date=17 August 2004 |title=How Old is the Milky Way? |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0425/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milky Way black hole ===

Astronomers long suspected that a black hole exists at the center of the Milky Way, but their theory was unproven. Conclusive evidence was obtained after 16 years of monitoring the [[Galactic Center]] with ESO telescopes at the La Silla and Paranal observatories.

Stars at the centre of the Milky Way are so densely packed that special imaging techniques (such as [[adaptive optics]]) were needed to boost the resolution of the VLT. Thanks to these techniques, astronomers were able to watch individual stars with unprecedented accuracy as they circled the Galactic Center.&lt;ref name="Surfing a Black Hole"&gt;{{cite news |date=16 October 2002 |title=Surfing a Black Hole |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0226/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their paths conclusively demonstrated that they were orbiting in the immense gravitational grip of a supermassive black hole nearly three million times more massive than the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 October 2003 |title=Messages from the Abyss |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0330/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VLT observations also revealed flashes of infrared light emerging from the region at regular intervals. While the cause of this phenomenon is unknown, observers have suggested that the black hole may be spinning rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 October 2008 |title=Unprecedented 16-Year Long Study Tracks Stars Orbiting Milky Way Black Hole |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0846/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VLT has also peered into the centre of galaxies beyond our own, where clear signs of activity produced by supermassive black holes are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 March 2001 |title=A Supermassive Black Hole in a Nearby Galaxy |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0109/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[active galaxy]] NGC 1097, a complex network of filaments spiraling from the main part of the galaxy to its centre was seen in great detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 October 2005 |title=Feeding the Monster |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0534/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gamma-ray bursts ===

[[Gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs) are bursts of highly energetic gamma rays lasting from less than one second to several minutes. They are known to occur at great distances from earth, near the limits of the observable universe.

The VLT has observed the afterglow of the farthest known gamma-ray burst. With a measured redshift of 8.2, the light from this very remote astronomical source has taken more than 13&amp;nbsp;billion years to reach the earth. It occurred when the universe was less than 600&amp;nbsp;million years old (less than five percent of its present age), and released 300 times as much energy in a few seconds as the sun will in its entire lifetime (more than 10&amp;nbsp;billion years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 April 2009 |title=The Most Distant Object Yet Discovered in the Universe |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0917/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of these explosions has long been a mystery. Observations show that GRBs are one of two types: short- (less than a few seconds) and long-duration. Until 2003, it was suspected that two different types of cosmic event caused them. In 2003, ESO telescopes followed the aftermath of an explosion for one month. Their data showed that the light had similar properties to that of a supernova, and allowed astronomers to link long-duration GRBs with the ultimate explosions of massive stars ([[hypernova]]e).&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news |date=18 June 2003 |title=Cosmological Gamma-Ray Bursts and Hypernovae Conclusively Linked |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0318/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ESO telescopes detected visible light after a short-duration burst and tracked this light for three weeks. The conclusion was that short-duration bursts could not be caused by a hypernova; instead, it is thought that they originate in the violent merges of neutron stars or black holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=14 December 2005 |title=Witnessing the Flash from a Black Hole's Cannibal Act |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0541/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Observations of gamma-ray-burst afterglows were coordinated between the VLT and the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] (APEX) to identify the possible counterpart (and its decay) at submillimeter wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/11098.gcn3 |title = GCN CIRCULAR, GRB 100814A: Submm observations from APEX, NASA email message}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital archives ===
[[File:Science-archive-data.jpg|alt=Two men standing in front of a bank of computers|ESO science archive|thumb]]

The Science Archive Operation Group receives and redistributes ESO data and provides archival support. About 200&amp;nbsp;Terabytes (TB) of public data are distributed per year through the ESO archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Archive and the Digital Universe|url=https://www.eso.org/public/science/archive/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=5 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive is about 1.01&amp;nbsp;Petabytes (PB), with an input rate of about 131&amp;nbsp;TB per year; this is being increased by a factor of 10 or so due to the survey telescopes' data-production rate.

Breakthroughs in telescope, detector and computer technology now allow astronomical surveys to produce large numbers of images, spectra and catalogues. These data sets cover the sky at all wavelengths, from gamma- and X-rays through optical, infrared and radio waves. Astronomers are developing ways to make the large amount of data easily accessible. These techniques use the grid paradigm of distributed computing with seamless, transparent access to data through virtual observatories (VOs). As a physical observatory has telescopes with unique astronomical instruments, a VO consists of data centres with unique collections of astronomical data, software systems and processing capabilities. This global, community-based initiative is being developed under the International Virtual Observatory Alliance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivoa.net/ International Virtual Observatory Alliance]. Ivoa.net. Retrieved on 2011-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Europe as part of the EURO-VO project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro-vo.org/ European Virtual Observatory]. Euro-vo.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

VOs have proven their effectiveness in a number of ways, including discovering 31 optically faint, obscured [[quasar]] candidates in existing [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]](GOODS) fields (quadrupling the number previously found). The discovery means that surveys of supermassive black holes have underestimated their numbers by a factor of two to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 May 2004 |title=Missing Black Holes Driven Out |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0418/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publications ===
[[File:Esocast hd.jpg|thumb|alt=ESOcast logo: "ESO" in a blue square, with blue radio waves emanating from it|ESOcast is a video [[podcast]] series with the latest news and research in astronomy.&lt;ref name=esocast&gt;{{cite web |title=ESOcast |url=http://www.eso.org/public/videos/archive/category/esocast/ |work=ESO Videos |publisher=ESO |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

ESO press releases describe scientific, technical and organisational developments and achievements and results obtained by scientists with ESO facilities. The organisation publishes three types of press releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/pressmedia.html | title = ESO Press Room | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science releases describe results (usually appearing in a peer-reviewed journal) involving data from ESO observatories or staff. Organisational releases cover a range of themes related to ESO operations, including news on current and future observatories, new astronomical instruments and announcements of exhibitions worldwide. ESO also selects its best astronomical images, and presents them publicly in periodic photo releases. All press releases (dating back to 1985) are available online. There are child-friendly versions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 April 2011 |title=Space Scoop: Astronomy News for Children  |url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann11018/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and press releases translated into the languages of ESO's member countries.

''The Messenger'' is a quarterly journal which has presented ESO's activities to the public since May 1974. All back copies are available for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/ | title=The Messenger | publisher=ESO | accessdate=December 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESO also publishes announcements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ | title = ESO Announcements | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pictures of the Week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.so.org/public/images/potw/ | title = ESO Picture of the Week | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; on its website. Announcements are shorter than press releases (typically less than 200 words) highlighting stories and events of interest to the community. Pictures of the Week show beautiful (or interesting) photos from ESO telescopes, and may highlight recent events or archival photos. All former entries are available on the website.

ESOcast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/videos/archive/category/esocast/ | title = ESOcast| accessdate = 2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a video-podcast series dedicated to reporting news and research from ESO. The universe's frontier is explored with "Doctor J" (Dr. Joe Liske, a German astronomer at ESO). Liske's scientific interests are in cosmology, particularly [[galaxy evolution]] and [[quasars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eso.org/~jliske/ |title=Joe Liske's home |accessdate=2011-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726210211/http://www.eso.org/~jliske/ |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[IMAX]] documentary ''[[Hidden Universe 3D]]'' was produced in cooperation of Cinema Productions, [[Film Victoria]], [[Swinburne University of Technology]], and the European Southern Observatory.

      <comment>/* Types of exposure */ move removed image to more appropriate section... As much as I hate to say it, this article could probably use an extra image or two, for illustration. Not everything is potentially clear to someone unfamiliar with the practices. Of course, that's not me. I know ALL ABOUT exposing myself in pub-okay, I'll shut up now.</comment>

'''Exhibitionism''' is the act of exposing in a public or semi-public context those parts of one's body that are not normally exposed &amp;ndash; for example, the [[breast]]s, [[Sex organ|genitals]] or [[buttocks]]. The practice may arise from a desire or compulsion to expose themselves in such a manner to groups of friends or acquaintances, or to strangers for their amusement or sexual satisfaction or to shock the bystander.&lt;ref name="baunach"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baunach|first1=Dawn Michelle|title=Sex and Society|date=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7614-7906-2|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;lpg=PA220|accessdate=22 May 2017|chapter=Exhibitionism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing oneself only to an [[intimate partner]] is normally not regarded as exhibitionism. In law, the act of exhibitionism may be called [[indecent exposure]], "exposing one's person", or other expressions.

==History==

Public exhibitionism by women has been recorded since classical times, often in the context of women shaming groups of men into committing, or inciting them to commit, some public action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/Author/Blackledge/excerpt.html |title=Origin of the world |publisher=Rutgerspress.rutgers.edu |date=1977-09-23 |accessdate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120094326/http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/Author/Blackledge/excerpt.html |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] gives an account of exhibitionistic behaviors from the fifth century BC in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]''. Herodotus writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;When people travel to [[Bubastis]] for the festival, this is what they do. Every ''baris'' carrying them there overflows with people, a huge crowd of them, men and women together. Some of the women have clappers, while some of the men have pipes which they play throughout the voyage. The rest of the men and women sing and clap their hands. When in the course of their journey they reach a community — not the city of their destination, but somewhere else — they steer the ''bareis'' close to the bank. Some of the women carry on doing what I have already described them as doing, but others shout out scornful remarks to the women in the town, or dance, or stand and pull up their clothes to expose themselves. Every riverside community receives this treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''The Histories''. Trans. R. Waterfield. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. Book Two, Chapter 60, Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A case of what appears to be exhibitionism in a clinical sense was recorded in a report by the Commission against Blasphemy in Venice in 1550.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloch|first=Iwan|title=Fall von Exhibitionismus im 16. Jahrhundert|journal=Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft|year=1914|issue=Born|page=i.289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the 4th draft of the revised Vagrancy Act of 1824 included an additional clause 'or openly and indecently exposing their persons' which gave rise to difficulties because of its ill-defined scope. During the course of a subsequent debate on the topic in Parliament, the then Home Secretary, Mr Peel, observed that 'there was not a more flagrant offence than that of indecently exposing the person which had been carried to an immense extent in the parks...wanton exposure was a very different thing from accidental exposure'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rooth|first=F.G.|title=Some Historical Notes on Indecent Exposure and Exhibitionism|journal=The Medico-Legal Journal|year=1970|volume=38|issue=4|series=Part 4|pages=135–139|pmid=4923872}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of new technologies such as smartphones and tablets has permitted some exhibitionists to reorient their methods such as with nude selfies.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Matt. "Being naked on the internet: young people’s selfies as intimate edgework." Journal of Youth Studies (2016): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological aspects==
[[File:Charles Lasegue.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lasègue]] was the first to describe exhibitionism as a disorder in 1877.]]
Exhibitionism was first described as a disorder in 1877 by French physician and psychiatrist [[Charles Lasègue]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasègue C. Les Exhibitionistes. L'Union Médicale (Paris), series 3, vol. 23; 1877. Pages 709–714.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn | Aggrawal | 2009 | p=388 }} When exhibitionistic sexual interest is acted on with a non-consenting person or interferes with a person's quality of life or [[normality (behavior)|normal]] functioning, it can be diagnosed as ''exhibitionistic disorder'' in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', fifth edition ([[DSM-5]]). The DSM states that the highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic disorder in men is 2% to 4%. It is thought to be much less common in women.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Exhibitionistic Disorder, 302.4 (F65.2) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 689–691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Swedish survey, 2.1% of women and 4.1% of men admitted to becoming sexually aroused from the exposure of their genitals to a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan | year = 2014 | title = Abnormal Psychology | edition = 6th | location = New York City, NY | publisher = McGraw-Hill Education | page = 384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research team asked a sample of 185 exhibitionists, "How would you have preferred a person to react if you were to expose your privates to him or her?" The most common response was "Would want to have sexual intercourse" (35.1%), followed by "No reaction necessary at all" (19.5%), "To show their privates also" (15.1%), "Admiration" (14.1%), and "Any reaction" (11.9%). Only very few exhibitionists chose "Anger and disgust" (3.8%) or "Fear" (0.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freund, K. |author2=Watson, R. |author3= Rienzo, D. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 1988 | title = The value of self-reports in the study of voyeurism and exhibitionism | journal = Annals of Sex Research | volume = 2 | pages = 243–262 | url = http://sax.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/2/243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of exposure==
[[File:Mardi Gras Flashing - Color.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A woman publicly exposing her bare breasts at [[Mardi Gras]], USA, 2008]]
Various types of behavior are classified as exhibitionism,&lt;ref name="baunach"/&gt; including:
*'''[[Anasyrma]]''': the lifting of the [[skirt]] when not wearing [[underwear]], to expose genitals.
*'''[[Candaulism]]''': when a person exposes his or her partner in a sexually provocative manner.
*'''Flashing''': the momentary display of bare female [[breasts]] by a woman with an up-and-down lifting of the shirt or [[bra]] or the exposure of a man's or woman's [[genitalia]].

[[File:Mooning.jpg|thumb|250px|Students mooning at [[Stanford University]], intended as both an unspecified protest and also a [[world record]] attempt of most number of people simultaneously mooning others.]]

*'''Martymachlia''': a [[paraphilia]] which involves [[sexual attraction]] to having others watch the execution of a sexual act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/sexual_problems_pyschologist/psychologist_exhibitionism.htm |title=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime |publisher=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mooning]]''': the display of bare [[buttocks]] by pulling down of [[trousers]] and underwear. The act is most often done for the sake of humour, disparagement, or mockery.
*'''Reflectoporn''': the act of stripping and taking a photograph using an object with a reflective surface as a mirror, then posting the image on the Internet in a public forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Reflectoporn' Hits Auction Site|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/latest/content_objectid=13386628_method=full_siteid=50143_headline=-Get-your-bids-out-name_page.html|publisher=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date=2003-09-09|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "images of naked men and women reflected in kettles, TVs, toasters and even knives and forks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Today's media stories from the papers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/sep/09/1|publisher=The Guardian|date=2003-09-09|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instance generally credited with starting the trend involved a man selling a [[kettle]] on an Australian auction site featuring a photograph where his naked body is clearly visible;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/risque/kettle.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Indecent Exposure |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; other instances followed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nude eBayer flashes 19in monitor|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/01/ebay_monitor_flash/|publisher=The Register|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBayer goes for bust in ashtray auction|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/19/ashtray_offer/|publisher=The Register|date=2006-06-19|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBay in wing-mirror reflectoporn shocker|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/14/ebay_wing_mirror/|publisher=The Register|date=2006-07-14|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the specific term "reflectoporn" was coined by Chris Stevens of [[Internet Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1490886 |title=Reflectoporn@Everything2.com |publisher=Everything2.com |date=2003-09-10 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Streaking]]''': the act of running naked through a public place. The intent is not usually sexual but for shock value.
*'''[[Telephone scatologia]]''': the act of making obscene phone calls to random or known recipients. Some researchers have claimed that this is a variant of exhibitionism, even though it has no in-person physical component.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, M. (1938). ''Sexual anomalies and perversions: Physical and psychological development, diagnosis and treatment'' (new and revised ed.). London: Encyclopaedic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, R. P. (1968). Approach to psychodynamics of obscene telephone calls. ''New York State Journal of Medicine, 68,'' 521–526.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-5 diagnosis for exhibitionistic disorder has three subtypes: exhibitionists interested in exposing themselves to adults, to prepubescent children, or to both.&lt;ref name="DSM-5" /&gt;

A '''helium flash''' is a very brief [[thermal runaway]] [[nuclear fusion]] of large quantities of [[helium]] into [[carbon]] through the [[triple-alpha process]] in the core of low mass [[star]]s (between 0.8 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=yes}}) and 2.0 {{Solar mass}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/ssescript/new/chapter9.pdf Chapter 9: Post-main sequence evolution through helium burning]&lt;/ref&gt;) during their [[red giant]] phase (the [[Sun]] is predicted to experience a flash 1.2 billion years after it leaves the [[main sequence]]). A much rarer runaway helium fusion process can also occur on the surface of [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] [[white dwarf]] stars.

Low mass stars do not produce enough [[gravity|gravitational]] pressure to initiate normal helium fusion. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into [[degenerate matter]], supported against [[gravitational collapse]] by [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] pressure rather than [[ideal gas law|thermal pressure]]. This increases the density and temperature of the core until it reaches approximately 100 million [[kelvin]], which is hot enough to cause helium fusion (or "helium burning") in the core.

However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that changes in temperature do not produce a change of volume of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes so very high that it exceeds degeneracy pressure. In main sequence stars, [[hydrostatic equilibrium|thermal expansion]] regulates the core temperature, but in degenerate cores this does not occur. Helium fusion increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate, which further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction. This produces a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but briefly emits energy at a rate comparable to the entire [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

In the case of normal low mass stars, the vast energy release causes much of the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to thermally expand, however, consuming as much energy as the total energy released by the helium flash, and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers. Thus the helium flash is mostly undetectable to observation, and is described solely by astrophysical models. After the core's expansion and cooling, the star's surface rapidly cools and contracts in as little as 10,000 years until it is roughly 2% of its former radius and luminosity. It is estimated that the electron-degenerate helium core weighs about 40% of the star mass and that 6% of the core is converted into carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html |title= The End Of The Sun |first= David |last= Taylor |website= North Western }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red giants==
[[File:White Dwarf Resurrection.jpg|thumb|[[Sakurai's Object]] is a [[white dwarf]] undergoing a helium flash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Dwarf Resurrection|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1531a/|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the [[red giant]] phase of [[stellar evolution]] in stars with less than 2.0 {{Solar mass}} the [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen ceases in the core as it is depleted, leaving a helium-rich core. While fusion of hydrogen continues in the star’s shell causing a continuation of the accumulation of helium ash in the core, making the core denser, the temperature still is unable to reach the level required for helium fusion, as happens in more massive stars. Thus the thermal pressure from fusion is no longer sufficient to counter the gravitational collapse and create the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] found in most stars. This causes the star to start contracting and increasing in temperature until it eventually becomes compressed enough for the helium core to become [[degenerate matter]]. This degeneracy pressure is finally sufficient to stop further collapse of the most central material but the rest of the core continues to contract and the temperature continues to rise until it reaches a point ({{val|p=≈|1|e=8|ul=K}}) at which the helium can ignite and start to fuse.&lt;ref name=Hansen2004&gt;{{cite book|title=Stellar Interiors - Physical Principles, Structure, and Evolution|last=Hansen|first=Carl J.|last2=Kawaler|first2=Steven D.|last3=Trimble|first3=Virginia|isbn=978-0387200897 |date=2004|edition=2|publisher=Springer|pages=62–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seeds2012&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Astronomy|last=Seeds|first=Michael A.|last2=Backman|first2=Dana E.|pages=249–51|date=2012|edition=12|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1133103769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karttunen2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamental Astronomy|isbn=978-3540341437|edition=5|page=249|editor-first=Hannu|editor-last=Karttunen|editor2-first=Pekka|editor2-last=Kröger|editor3-first=Heikki|editor3-last=Oja|editor4-first=Markku|editor4-last=Poutanen|editor5-first=Karl Johan|editor5-last=Donner|publisher=Springer|date=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosive nature of the helium flash arises from its taking place in degenerate matter. Once the temperature reaches 100 million–200 million [[kelvin]] and helium fusion begins using the [[triple-alpha process]], the temperature rapidly increases, further raising the helium fusion rate and, because degenerate matter is a good [[Thermal conduction|conductor of heat]], widening the reaction region.

However, since degeneracy pressure (which is purely a function of density) is dominating thermal pressure (proportional to the product of density and temperature), the total pressure is only weakly dependent on temperature.  Thus, the dramatic increase in temperature only causes a slight increase in pressure, so there is no stabilizing cooling expansion of the core.

This runaway reaction quickly climbs to about 100 billion times the star's normal energy production (for a few seconds) until the temperature increases to the point that thermal pressure again becomes dominant, eliminating the degeneracy. The core can then expand and cool down and a stable burning of helium will continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 317| pages = 724–732| last = Deupree| first = R. G.|author2=R. K. Wallace| title = The core helium flash and surface abundance anomalies| journal = Astrophysical Journal| date = 1987|bibcode = 1987ApJ...317..724D| doi = 10.1086/165319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star with mass greater than about 2.25 {{Solar mass}} starts to burn helium without its core becoming degenerate, and so does not exhibit this type of helium flash. In a very low-mass star (less than about 0.5 {{Solar mass}}), the core is never hot enough to ignite helium. The degenerate helium core will keep on contracting, and finally becomes a [[White dwarf#Stars with very low mass|helium white dwarf]].

The helium flash is not directly observable on the surface by electromagnetic radiation. The flash occurs in the core deep inside the star, and the net effect will be that all released energy is absorbed by the entire core, leaving the degenerate state to become nondegenerate. Earlier computations indicated that a nondisruptive mass loss would be possible in some cases,&lt;ref name="Deupree1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Deupree|first1= R.

==Binary white dwarfs==

When hydrogen gas is accreted onto a ''white dwarf'' from a binary companion star, the hydrogen can fuse to form helium for a narrow range of accretion rates, but most systems develop a layer of hydrogen over the degenerate white dwarf interior. This hydrogen can build up to form a shell near the surface of the star. When the mass of hydrogen becomes sufficiently large, runaway fusion causes a [[nova]]. In a few binary systems where the hydrogen fuses on the surface, the mass of helium built up can burn in an unstable helium flash. In certain binary systems the companion star may have lost most of its hydrogen and donate helium-rich material to the compact star. Note that similar flashes occur on [[X-ray burster|neutron stars]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=={{Anchor|shell helium flash}}Shell helium flash==

'''Shell helium flashes''' are a somewhat analogous but much less violent, nonrunaway helium ignition event, taking place in the absence of degenerate matter. They occur periodically in [[asymptotic giant branch]] stars in a shell outside the core. This is late in the life of a star in its giant phase. The star has burnt most of the helium available in the core, which is now composed of carbon and oxygen. Helium fusion continues in a thin shell around this core, but then turns off as helium becomes depleted. This allows hydrogen fusion to start in a layer above the helium layer. After enough additional helium accumulates, helium fusion is reignited, leading to a thermal pulse which eventually causes the star to expand and brighten temporarily (the pulse in luminosity is delayed because it takes a number of years for the energy from restarted helium fusion to reach the surface&lt;ref name = "Wood"/&gt;). Such pulses may last a few hundred years, and are thought to occur periodically every 10,000 to 100,000 years.&lt;ref name = "Wood"&gt;{{Cite journal

After the flash, helium fusion continues at an exponentially decaying rate for about 40% of the cycle as the helium shell is consumed.&lt;ref name = "Wood"/&gt; Thermal pulses may cause a star to shed circumstellar shells of gas and dust.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The '''huff and puff apparatus''' is used in school [[biology]] labs to demonstrate that [[carbon dioxide]] is a product of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]].  A pupil breathes in and out of the middle tube. The glass tubing is arranged in such a way that one flask bubbles as the pupils breathes in, the other as the pupil breathes out. A suitable carbon dioxide indicator, such as [[limewater]] or [[bicarbonate indicator]] shows the increased presence of carbon dioxide in the outgoing breath.This turns the bicarbonate into milky white substance.

Over the centuries the roles of rivers as part of the [[city]] has altered many times from the original use for the [[irrigation|irrigating]] crops in nearby fields, as well as being an essential resource in establishing a permanent settlement. 
However, when the industrial revolution took place in the 19th century the role of the rivers in cities altered and it became a far more valuable [[Natural resource|resource]] as it allowed not only for the [[transportation]] of goods from town to town but also became the basis for the expansion and improvement of the trading prowess of the city.  This transportation of goods was done through the construction of a canal network spreading across the country which tamed the rivers sufficiently and so therefore allowed for the movement of goods such as [[coal]] to move from place to place.
Furthermore, after the advancement of the railway network which now took over most of the movement of goods throughout the country, this left the rivers and canals of Britain without a role in Britain’s transport network. This allowed areas of the canal and river networks to become polluted through chemical waste and public misuse, which caused difficulties for the animals for which the river and its surrounding wetlands and marshes were their [[natural habitat]]s. 
Yet since the 1950s there has been a dramatic increase in the number of riverside developments which have not only brought increased money into the area but have also redeveloped and enhanced the natural environment and increased the aesthetic qualities of these areas on the whole.

Further examples of these developments are [[Bede Island]] in [[Leicester]] and the [[London Docklands]].

==Leicester==

===Bede Island===
Bede Island [http://www.le.ac.uk/emoha/leicester/bedeislandimagemap.html] is a 130,000 square metre site, 1.5 miles (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) outside Leicester’s Central Business District. It is an area of [[brownfield land]] located between the [[River Soar]] to the West and the [[Grand Union Canal]] to the East. It was a run down area which has suffered from [[urban decay|inner city decline]], the site is not easily accessible by road and so was not heavily industrialised. Most of the Bede Island area used to be occupied by scrap yards which led to both [[noise pollution]] and the release of [[asbestos]] into the air. The City Challenge schemes were established in 1993 to help regeneration of the social, economic and environmental aspects of 30 city schemes. The City Challenge partnership has greatly improved the natural environment through the cleaning up of the riversides and making them more attractive, as well as recontouring the banks of the River Soar and the diversifying of wildlife habitats through the planting of [[shrub]]s and [[tree]]s.

===Parks===

The council attempted to incorporate nature into the city through public involvement schemes. These schemes aim to encourage and educate locals to help maintain existing green spaces, such as [[park]] life.

The [[Leicester City Council]] are yet again an example of an area which has successfully achieved this and have gained recognition for their efforts at the 2005 [[Green Flag awards]]. The strategies used in order to accomplish this include the following:

* £50 sponsorship scheme where local businesses and the public plant more trees in their nearest park, particularly during tree planting week.
* Asking schools in the community to bring their children along to help plant bulbs and tidy up their green spaces.
* Further [[incentives]] to attain and retain titles, such as the winners of the 2005 ‘Britain in Bloom’ competition.
* Park staff has also installed a number of posts and netting enclosures and ridge tile shelters in order to protect many different species of birds during the breeding season.
* Getting locals to participate in festive activities, such as planting flowers and picking their own flower arrangements or to buy a bird (love) nest box, found in the park in the name of their loved ones for Valentine's Day.
* Encouraging people to become volunteer park wardens for their local communities.

==London Docklands==
The London docklands was until the 1960s the largest [[port]] in the United Kingdom employing up to 50,000 people in its peak. However, due to being devastated by bombing during the [[Second World War]] and the introduction of containerisation of shipping in the 1970s for which the London docks were ill-adapted. This decline of London as a shipping port has led to the dereliction of the docklands area and also the loss of over 200,000 jobs. However, in 1981 the London Dockland Development Corporation was established to help with the redevelopment of the docklands area through the development of new high-class riverside apartments and the conversion of waterfront warehouses into accommodation and new office blocks such as Canary Wharf. Another aspect of the LDDC’s development plan was to increase the attractiveness of the area as a whole through the planting of trees and the implementing of communal spaces to help encourage people to interact with the natural environment.

In conclusion the role of rivers has altered and this is correct as they have changed from being used for agriculture to being a way to transport goods through the [[canal]] networks. However this role has now changed again to a more commercial one as a way of making new houses more appealing through including a riverside view. This shows that in urban areas rivers have always been an important and valuable resource.

== New York City ==

Nature and the environment have been incorporated into city life through the use of community garden schemes. Community gardens are plots of land that have been allocated to be used as allotments. In general, institutional response to community gardening has been piecemeal, like a handing out of green band-aids. Public land is made available by [[municipal]] governments to both neighbourhood organizations and private agencies who lease it on a temporary basis, usually for one year. Extensive public pressure has compelled some city agencies to extend leases by a few years. 
Community gardening not only produces Healthy food close to home but also cultivates a sense of community among neighbours. Many surveys indicate that people participate in community gardening because they enjoy the opportunity to meet and make friends. Many community gardens incorporate sociability settings — arbours, picnic tables, benches, and barbecues. The growing sense of community fostered by these modern-day commons empowers neighbourhood residents and strengthens their social, physical, and mental health. A vacant lot transformed into a community garden filled with vegetable crops and blossoming flowers or the vibrant colours of a mural painted on the wall of a dilapidated building instantly, almost magically, transform the image of a rundown urban area. 
[[New York City]] is home to a system of about 750 community gardens that have sprouted since the mid-1970s on vacant city-owned lots in low-to-moderate income neighbourhoods. After existing for more than 20 years, many community gardens have come to be seen by community development corporations as a key aspect of “community building.”... Despite this growing recognition of their importance, these gardens have a very tenuous hold on their land. Most have short-term license agreements with the Parks Department’s Green Thumb Program. An ACGA survey conducted in 1997 by Monroe and Santos revealed that fewer than 2% of community gardens are considered permanent by their managers.
Due to this aspect of ‘Nature in the City’ being so effective, the government agencies involved have drawn up plans to further implement Community Gardens, i.e. to create more of them and help them to become permanent.

Their intended actions include:

* Secure more land and create long-term stability for community garden through purchase of land and long-term leases or other agreements.
* Increase support for community gardens through partnerships with other government agencies, neighbourhood groups, and businesses, civic and gardening organizations.
* Integrate community gardens into existing open spaces near areas of higher density residences that do not currently have community garden space, while balancing other open space needs.
* Provide administrative resources and agreements that enable community gardening groups to manage the gardens to the extent practicable.

== Singapore ==

===Parks and gardens===
[[Singapore]] has over 42 parks and gardens in and around the city such as the Woodlands Park and Bukit Timah nature reserve. The Woodlands Park is designed in traditional Malay/Chinese themes. There is a river that runs through the park and under the council project; part of the river was enlarged to form a lake. There are a number of attractions including a playground and an amphitheatre. The Bukit Timah nature reserve is 12&amp;nbsp;km from city centre with an area of 1.64 square kilometres. It contains primary rainforest. There are more species of tree in this nature reserve than there are in the whole of North America. There are also other nature reserves, like the Sungei Buloh nature reserve which contains mangrove forests, swamps, ponds and prawn farms. The parks, gardens and nature reserves cover many aspects of nature and are all found in one city.

===Organisations, projects, and plans===

Singapore has many environmental watchdogs (known as Peckhams) and committees that look after the environment within Singapore. The Nature Society Singapore is a conservation committee that promotes public awareness of conservation and conducts biodiversity surveys to provide data for the Nature society to help with plans and projects. Singapore also has a National Parks board tree management program that encourages a sense of ownership of trees in peoples care. Roadside trees are carefully selected for their suitability for the roadside. Durability and stability are key for this. Vegetation is pruned to make it look presentable. Tree inspections are carried out that log the health of trees in a database so there is a complete history of trees in Singapore that have had treatment and when. Singapore also has a green plan 2012. This was drawn up in 2002 and is a 10-year plan to create a sustainable environment for future generations. Awards are given to organisations and individuals that have made outstanding contributions towards environmental protection and care. Training is given to the large workforce that cares for the existing gardens and for those spearheading new projects.

The '''Institute for Transuranium Elements''' ('''ITU''') was a [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] [[research]] institute in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]]. The ITU was one of the seven institutes of the [[Joint Research Centre]], a Directorate-General of the [[European Commission]].  The ITU had about 300 staff. Its specialists have access to an extensive range of advanced facilities, many unavailable elsewhere in Europe.

== Mission statement ==
The Directorate General-Joint Research Centre is the European Commission's science and knowledge service. Its mission is to support EU policies with independent evidence throughout the whole policy cycle. Its work has a direct impact on the lives of citizens by contributing with its research outcomes to a healthy and safe environment, secure energy supplies, sustainable mobility and consumer health and safety. The JRC hosts specialist laboratories and unique research facilities and is home to thousands of scientists working to support EU policy. The JRC has ten Directorates and is located across five EU Member States (Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain).

The Directorate involved in this project is Directorate G – Nuclear Safety and Security within which the JRC's nuclear work programme, funded by the EURATOM Research and Training Programme, is carried out. It contributes to the scientific foundation for the protection of the European citizen against risks associated with the handling and storage of highly radioactive material, and scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation, and monitoring of community policies related to nuclear energy. Research and policy support activities of Directorate G contribute towards achieving effective safety and safeguards systems for the nuclear fuel cycle, to enhance nuclear security then contributing to achieving the goal of low carbon energy production.

The research programmes are carried out at the JRC sites in Germany (Karlsruhe), Belgium (Geel), The Netherlands (Petten) and Italy (Ispra) and consist of research, knowledge management and training activities on nuclear safety and security. They are performed in collaboration and/or in support to the EU Member States and relevant international organizations.  Today the Directorate G is one of the leading nuclear research establishments for nuclear science and technology and a unique provider of nuclear data measurements. Typical research and policy support activities are experimental and modelling studies covering nuclear reactor and fuel cycle safety, including current and innovative nuclear energy systems. Fundamental properties, irradiation effects and behaviour under normal and accident conditions of nuclear fuels and structural materials are studied. The activities cover also studies of structural integrity and functioning of nuclear components, emergency preparedness and radioactivity environmental monitoring, nuclear waste management and decommissioning, as well as the study of non-energy technological and medical applications of radionuclides. A dedicated functional entity is devoted to the management and dissemination of knowledge and to facilitate open access to JRC nuclear facilities including training and education.

== Security ==
Normally entry for visitors to the ITU was by prior invitation only for security reasons; a person wishing to enter the site as a visitor will be required to hand over their passport, before passing through a combined metal and radiation detector. The details of the devices used to test visitors for radioactive and nuclear materials are not public knowledge (for security reasons). Also on entry visitors are subject to a search by a security officer. All bags are examined using an [[x-ray]] machine similar to that used in an airport.

== Activities ==
The work of the ITU could be divided into a series of smaller activities.

=== Alpha-immunotherapy ===
A [[cancer]] treatment involving the production of [[antibodies]] bearing  [[alpha particle]]-emitting radioisotopes which bind to [[cancer cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=270 Methods]. Itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu (2009-07-13). Retrieved on 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is to create a "magic bullet" which will seek and destroy cancer wherever it is hidden within the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=202 Targeted Alpha-Radionuclide Therapy]. Itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu (2009-07-13). Retrieved on 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment has reached clinical trials.

[[Bismuth]]-213 is one of the isotopes which has been used: this is made by the alpha decay of [[actinium]]-225, which in turn is made by the irradiation of [[radium]]-226 with a [[cyclotron]].

=== Basic actinide research ===
Work has included the [[superconductivity]] and magnetic properties of actinides such as [[plutonium]] and [[americium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Safety of nuclear fuel ===
The ITU is involved in a range of different areas of research on [[nuclear safety]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=27 Nuclear Fuels]. Itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu. Retrieved on 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Accidents ====
The ITU's work includes the study of fuel behaviour during "out of control nuclear-reactor" conditions.

In the 2004 annual report from the ITU some results of the PIE on PHEBUS (FPT2) fuel are reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/media/Activity_Report_2004.pdf "ITU04_Vorspann_end]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=217&amp;type=10#370 Topics]. Itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu. Retrieved on 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; PHEBUS is a series of experiments where fuel was overheated and damaged under very strictly controlled conditions, in order to obtain data on what would happen in a serious nuclear power reactor accident.

==== Waste forms ====
The long-term performance of waste and the systems designed to isolate it from "man and his environment" are studied here. For instance the [[corrosion]] of [[uranium dioxide]] is studied at the ITU.

=== Spent fuel characterisation ===
The ITU performs [[Post Irradiation Examination]] of spent nuclear fuel.

=== Partitioning and transmutation ===
Partitioning is the separation of nuclear wastes into different elements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=168 Partitioning]. Itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu (2009-05-15). Retrieved on 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; see [[nuclear reprocessing]] for more details. The ITU is involved in both [[aqueous]] and pyro separation methods. They have published papers on the DIAMEX process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[nuclear transmutation]] for details.

=== Measurement of radioactivity in the environment ===
The ITU is funded by the [[European Union]], and theoretically has no "pro-" or "anti-nuclear" policy. The ITU is able to examine environmental samples in order to decide if dangerous levels of radioactive [[contamination]] are present. For instance [[hot particles]] found on a beach in [[Scotland]] near [[Dounreay]] were examined at the ITU.Page 375 of http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1169_web.pdf

Much of this work is aimed at the measurement of very low levels of radioactivity; the ITU's analytical service uses [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] to measure most radioactive isotopes with greater sensitivity than those possible with direct [[radiometric]] measurements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=184 Radioactivity in the Environment]. Itu.jrc.ec.europa.eu. Retrieved on 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear security and safeguards ===
The ITU has a service which assists police and other law enforcement organisations by examining any seized radioactive or nuclear material. Materials are analysed to discover what they are, where they come from, and what possible use they might have been.

===Karlsruhe Nuclide Chart===
The ITU manages the various versions and editions of the Karlsruhe Nuclide Chart.

'''Island tameness''' is the tendency of many populations and [[species]] of animals living on isolated [[island]]s to lose their wariness of potential [[predation|predators]], particularly of large animals. The term is partly synonymous with '''ecological naïvete''', which also has a wider meaning referring to the loss of defensive behaviors and [[adaptation]]s needed to deal with these "new" predators. Species retain such wariness of predators that exist in their environment, for example a [[Hawaiian goose]] retains its wariness of hawks, but lose such behaviors associated with mammals or other predators not found in their historical range. The most famous example is that of the dodo bird, which owed its extinction in a large part to a lack of fear of humans, and many species of [[penguin]] - which although wary of sea predators have no real land predator, and therefore are very unafraid and curious towards humans.

A recent comparison of 66 species of [[lizards]] found that flight initiation distance (how close a lizard allows a human "predator" to approach before it flees) decreases as distance from the mainland increases and is shorter in island than mainland populations.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, W. E., Jr., R. A. Pyron, and [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|T. Garland, Jr.]] 2014. Island tameness: living on islands reduces flight initiation distance. Proceedings of the Royal Society B Volume 281 no. 1777 20133019. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.3019&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the authors, [[Charles Darwin]] believed that escape behavior evolved to be lower where [[predator]]s were rare or absent on remote islands because unnecessary escape responses are costly in terms of time and energy.

Island tameness can be highly maladaptive in situations where humans have [[introduced species|introduced]] predators, intentionally or accidentally, such as pigs, dogs, rats or cats, to islands where [[ecology|ecologically]] naïve fauna lives.  It has also made many [[Island biogeography|island species]], such as the long-extinct [[dodo]] or the [[short-tailed albatross]], vulnerable to human hunting. In many instances the native species are unable to learn to avoid new predators, or change their behavior to minimize their risk. This tameness is eventually lost or reduced in some species, but many island populations are too small or breed too slowly for the affected species to adapt quickly enough. When combined with other threats, such as habitat loss, this has led to the extinction of many species (such as the [[Laysan rail]] and [[Lyall's wren]]) and continues to threaten others. The only [[conservation biology|conservation]] techniques that can help endangered species threatened by novel introduced species are creating barriers to exclude predators or [[island restoration|eradicating]] those species. [[New Zealand]] has pioneered the use of offshore islands free of introduced species to serve as wildlife refuges for ecologically naïve species.

'''Marlboro College''' is a small, private, academically rigorous [[liberal-arts college]] located in [[Marlboro, Vermont|Marlboro]], [[Vermont]], United States, with an enrollment of 195 students. The College received a perfect academics rating of 99 from The Princeton Review in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vtdigger.org/2013/08/07/marlboro-college-professors-ranked-1-nationally-by-princeton-review/|title=Marlboro College professors ranked #1 nationally by Princeton Review|date=2013-08-07|website=VTDigger|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at Marlboro create an individualized course of study in collaboration with faculty members and participate in a self-governed (self-run) community. Students pursue a self-designed, often inter-disciplinary thesis, the Plan of Concentration, based on their academic interests that culminates in a major body of scholarship.

Marlboro was ranked #117 (out of 1,611 institutions) among liberal arts colleges in the United States by U.S. News &amp; World Report in 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/5125/Marlboro%20Continues%20to%20Rise%20in%20U.S.%20News%20Ranking|title=Marlboro Continues to Rise in U.S. News Ranking|last=|first=|date=|website=Marlboro College website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college's unique facilities that can be used by students include an organic farm, a solar greenhouse, Marlboro's own nature forestland preserve, and an aviary. Weekly "[[town meeting]]s" are held to vote for and change the College's bylaws.

==History==
Marlboro College was founded in 1946 by Walter Hendricks on Potash Hill in Marlboro, Vermont, and many of the first students were returning [[World War II]] veterans. The school's operation was initially financed using money received from the [[GI Bill]], as well as loans from Brattleboro Savings and Loan. The campus incorporates the buildings of three old farms that once operated on the college site, along with more modern buildings. Marlboro has grown steadily since its inception, and 195 students currently attend, with an average enrollment of 250 students. The College, however, is kept "intentionally small."

In 1997 Marlboro College founded the [[Marlboro College Graduate School]] to apply the same educational principles of Marlboro College to advance the careers of working professionals. The Graduate School also offers an accelerated Master's track to undergraduates in select programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/5085/Marlboro%20Launches%20Accelerated%20Master’s%20Track|title=Marlboro Launches Accelerated Master’s Track|last=|first=|date=|website=Marlboro College website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Graduate School was initially located in nearby Brattleboro, it moved to the main college campus in Marlboro in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reformer.com/stories/marlboro-college-consolidates-campuses,503176|title=Marlboro College consolidates campuses|last=|first=|date=April 2, 2017|website=Brattleboro Reformer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marlboro College campus has also been the summer home for more than 50 years to the [[Marlboro Music Festival]].

==Campus==
===Location===
The Marlboro College campus is located on South Road in the small town of Marlboro, Vermont, in the wooded [[Green Mountains]]. Marlboro is just off Route 9, which runs east-west across southern Vermont, ten miles from [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]] to the east with [[Wilmington, Vermont|Wilmington]] and [[Bennington, Vermont|Bennington]] further to the west. Boston is two and a half hours to the east, Burlington is two and a half hours to the north, [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford, CT]] is one and a half hours to the south, and New York City is four hours to the south.

The closest major town is Brattleboro, and students frequently make the 20-minute drive along Route 9 to hang out there at night and on weekends. Brattleboro, like Marlboro College, is liberal in its social life and politics. The town features a well-preserved historic main street with a strong gallery scene, boutiques, ethnic and health food, and a historic arthouse movie theater. The similar but much larger [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]]–[[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] area of western [[Massachusetts]], easily accessible via Interstate 91, is also a favorite hangout.

===Facilities===
[[File:Marlboro College dining hall and Mather.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The dining hall and Mather building at Marlboro College]]

Marlboro's facilities are relatively small because of its size. Many of the buildings—including the main classroom building, the dining hall, the admissions building and the administration building—are converted farm buildings that predate the college. Students and faculty worked together to convert these historic buildings for use by the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/about/history|title=OUR HISTORY|last=|first=|date=|website=Marlboro College website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through grants from federal, state and private entities, the college improved the energy-efficiency of the Dining Hall, Dalrymple classroom building, Mather administration building, and the Admissions building since 2008, as well as the student residences. In the summer of 2011, the half-circle driveway at the campus entrance was converted to green space and walking paths.
[[File:Marlboro library 112896728.jpg|left|thumb|Marlboro College Library]]

Recently, the school has added a new performing arts center with a 125-seat auditorium, an electronic music lab, practice rooms with baby grand pianos and a 5,000-square foot dance studio, as well as a new dormitory called Out-of-the-Way. The college also expanded the library, the sculpture studio, and added a new Total Health Center (or THC) and exercise facility to the campus center. These additions made room for the world studies program in the old music building, a new student residence in the old health center, an expansion of the outdoor program into the old exercise room, and athletic space in the old dance studio.

The school recently completed an addition to the Outdoor Programs Building, to centralize the equipment that the OP maintains and loans out, as well as a new Greenhouse designed by a recent graduate and built by the community on the school farm (Marlboro Victory Garden).

The Snyder Center for the Visual Arts, a $3.5-million dollar, 14,000-square-foot visual arts center that houses studios, classrooms, and gallery spaces, opened in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/4572/community-dedicates-visual-arts-center|title=Community Dedicates Visual Arts Center|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=Marlboro College website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
===The Clear Writing Requirement===
Freshman students usually take one or more classes designed to boost their writing skills to an acceptable undergraduate level. All freshmen must submit 20 pages (4,000 words) of nonfiction writing to the English Committee by the end of their second semester. If the committee decides that a student's writing skills need more work, they recommend a class to help, and the student must prepare another portfolio, at least 10 pages of which must be new, at the end of the next semester for re-evaluation. In the event that a student fails the writing requirement for three consecutive semesters, the school will ask the student to leave with the caveat that they can return after receiving high marks from an English class at another school. However, virtually all students pass the writing requirement within two semesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marlboro College|title=Clear Writing Program|url=https://nook.marlboro.edu/public/academics/clear_writing|website=nook.marlboro.edu|publisher=Marlboro College|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Plan of Concentration===
Juniors and seniors focus on developing an individualized Plan of Concentration rather than on heavy coursework. "Plan" is a large, self-designed project often involving a combination of disciplines. Juniors and seniors focus on independent work and increasingly take tutorial classes (one or two students and a faculty member). For most students Plan culminates in a written thesis, although art and science students may pursue other projects. All Plans must include a written portion constituting at least 20 percent of the total plan work. In addition, all Plans must include an independent project prepared without direct faculty input, also constituting at least 20 percent of the total plan. Plans that consist entirely of academic writing usually range from one hundred to two hundred pages, double-spaced.

The results of this work are defended in an oral examination before two Marlboro professors, and one outside evaluator who has expertise in the student's field of study but is not connected with the college. The presence of the outside evaluator is meant to ensure that the grading process is fair and objective. The final plan is then put on permanent file as a reference work in the college library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marlboro College|title=PLAN OF CONCENTRATION|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/academics/undergraduate/plan-of-concentration|website=marlboro.edu|publisher=Marlboro College|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic honors===
Loren Pope, original author of the ''Colleges that Change Lives'' college guide and former education editor for ''The New York Times'', writes about Marlboro, "You will find the Marlboro adventure far more intense and intellectually demanding than Harvard, any other Ivy, or Ivy clone. There simply is no comparison."&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Loren. ''Colleges That Change Lives'', 3rd edition, 2006, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marlboro College received a perfect academics rating of 99 and was also ranked #1 nationally for its quality of professors ("Professors Get High Marks") in The Princeton Review's 2014 annual college guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vtdigger.org/2013/08/07/marlboro-college-professors-ranked-1-nationally-by-princeton-review/|title=Marlboro College professors ranked #1 nationally by Princeton Review|date=7 August 2013|website=vtdigger.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beautiful Minds Challenge ===
Since 2012 the college has offered the Beautiful Minds Challenge, an essay contest for high school students that rewards winners with 12 full or partial scholarships and other prizes. Essays may take the form of text, images, audio, or video. Submissions are judged by Marlboro faculty, staff, and students. Finalists are flown to the Marlboro campus for a Symposium where they present their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/news/story/5123/Marlboro%20launches%202017%20Beautiful%20Minds%20Challenge|title=Marlboro launches 2017 Beautiful Minds Challenge|last=|first=|date=|website=Marlboro College website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
[[Open mic]] nights at the Campus Center happen several times a semester in addition to events like President's Ball, Gender Bender, Queer Homecoming and other events. A "Farm to Fork" community dinner is held every September. During the Spring and Fall, students are encouraged to "plant, weed, landscape, and harvest on a regular basis" on the school farm. They also participate in other events, such as the harvesting of pine trees in the College's own forestland. "Midnight Breakfast" is an event celebrated each semester during the eve before writing portfolios are due.

The school was founded on and continues to encourage a tradition of community participation and values. A bi-monthly "[[town meeting]]" allows all community members to gather and vote to change the college bylaws. An elected community court dispenses justice when necessary. Different elected committees, consisting of students, faculty and staff, help to hire faculty (or even college presidents) and steer the curriculum, among many other responsibilities.

The school's security measures are designed to cultivate attitudes of trust and responsibility on campus. The library is also open all night and uses a self-checkout honor system to keep track of borrowed materials.

Athletics are also shaped by Marlboro's location, and by Vermont's long winters &amp;ndash; the coldest weather coincides with the academic year. Though few organized sports teams exist, the school's "Outdoor Program" promotes activities such as rock climbing, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, white-water kayaking, caving, canoeing, hiking, and the annual February broomball tournament, played on a frozen pond, a collegiate tradition maintained since 1998. In addition, the College is just 15 miles from the [[Mount Snow]] ski resort.

==Student Publications==
Editors-in-chief of the College's different magazines are elected during town meetings. The administration of the school publishes a biannual magazine, ''Potash Hill''. A [[student newspaper]], ''The Citizen'', is published biweekly on campus. "Articles in The Citizen vary from serious editorials to tongue-in-cheek campus news, from oblique photo-essays to “Horrorscopes” like “Sagittarius: Money from strangers can be expected. Red is your color. Watch where you put your thumb.”&lt;ref name="marlboro.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/community/undergraduate/student_publications|title=Student Publications - Marlboro College|website=www.marlboro.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student literary magazine composed of selected essays, poetry, and short stories, is published once per semester. The magazine "reflect[s] the strong and adventurous writing skills of Marlboro community members."

For example, this poem by student Joanna Moyer-Battick:&lt;ref name="marlboro.edu"/&gt;

'''Winter Coat by Day'''

but when I get up to pee

the shadow of a man

bending to pull up his boots

==Statistics==
* An average of 67% of the school's applicant pool is accepted. The middle 50% range of [[SAT I]] scores (for 2005) was 1040–1310 out of 1600 possible points.
* 75% of Marlboro College alumni attend graduate school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboro.edu/community/alumni/survey_results|title=Alumni Survey Substantiates Positive Image|last=|first=|date=2012|website=www.marlboro.edu|publisher=|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four most frequently attended institutions are [[Antioch University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Boston University]] and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Institutional Data {{!}} Marlboro College|url = https://www.marlboro.edu/about/institutional_data|website = www.marlboro.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marlboro is only 1 of 3 national liberal arts colleges in which 100% of its classes have fewer than 20 students.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Monoicous''' plants are those species that bear both sperm and eggs on the same [[gametophyte]]. '''Dioicous''' plants are those that have gametophytes that produce only sperm or eggs but never both.&lt;ref name=Crandall-Stotler&gt;Crandall-Stotler, B.J. &amp; Bartholomew-Began, S.E. (2007). ''Morphology of Mosses (Phylum Bryophyta)''. In: Flora of North America Editorial Committee, eds. (1993+).  ''Flora of North America North of Mexico''.  16+  vols.  New York and Oxford. Volume 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BellHelmsley&gt;Bell, P.R. &amp; Helmsley, A.R. (2000). ''Green plants, their origin and diversity'' (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are used largely but not exclusively in the context of [[bryophyte]]s. Both monoicous and dioicous gametophytes produce gametes in gametangia by [[mitosis]] rather than [[meiosis]], so that sperm and eggs are genetically identical with their parent gametophyte. The states of being monoicous or dioicous are called '''monoicy''' and '''dioicy''' respectively.

==Etymology and history==
The word '''monoicous''' and the related forms '''mon(o)ecious''' are derived from the Greek mόνος (''mónos''), ''single'', and οἶκος (''oîkos'') or οἰκία (''oikía''), ''house''.  The words '''dioicous''' and '''di(o)ecious''' are derived from οἶκος or οἰκία and δι- (di-), twice, double. (''(o)e'' is [[Iotacism|the Latin way of transliterating Greek οι]], whereas ''oi'' is a more straightforward modern way.) Generally, the terms "monoicous" and "dioicous" have been restricted to description of haploid sexuality ([[gametophytic]] sexuality), and are thus used primarily to describe [[bryophytes]] in which the gametophyte is the dominant generation.  Meanwhile, "monoecious" and "dioecious" are used to describe diploid sexuality ([[sporophytic]] sexuality), and thus are used to describe [[tracheophytes]] (vascular plants) in which the [[sporophyte]] is the dominant generation.&lt;ref name=Shaw&amp;Goffinet&gt;Shaw, A. Jonathan &amp; Goffinet, Bernard eds. (2000). ''Bryophyte Biology''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage, although precise, is not universal, and "monoecious" and "dioecious" are still used by some bryologists for the gametophyte.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{Harvnb|Taylor|Eppley|Jesson|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bryophyte sexuality==

[[Bryophyte]]s have life cycles that are [[gametophyte]] dominated. The longer lived, more prominent [[autotrophic]] plant is the gametophyte. The sporophyte in mosses and liverworts consists of an unbranched stalk (a seta) bearing a single [[sporangium]] or spore-producing capsule. Even when capable of photosynthesis, as in mosses and hornworts, bryophyte sporophytes require additional photosynthate from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and are dependent on the gametophyte for their supplies of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Thomas1978&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Stanton | first2 = D.S. | last3 = Longendorfer | first3 = D.H. | last4 = Farr | first4 = M.E. | year = 1978 | title = Physiological evaluation of the nutritional autonomy of a hornwort sporophyte | url = | journal = Botanical Gazette | volume = 139 | issue = 3| pages = 306–311 | doi=10.1086/337006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glime2007&gt;Glime, J.M.

Accessed on 4 March 2013 at http://www.bryoecol.mtu.edu/chapters/5-9Sporophyte.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antheridia]] and [[archegonia]] are often clustered. A cluster of antheridia is called an androecium while a cluster of archegonia is called a gynoecium. (Note these terms have a different meaning when used to refer to flower structures.)

Bryophytes have the most elaborate gametophytes of all living land plants, and thus have a wide variety of gametangium positions and developmental patterns.

Gametangia are typically borne on the tips of shoots, but may also be found in the axils of leaves, under thalli or on elaborate structures called gametangiophores.

Bryophyte species may be:

* '''Autoicous''' meaning that androecia and gynoecia are found on the same individual (monoicous) but in distinctly separate locations. If these are on separate branches, the term '''cladautoicous''' can be applied.
* '''Synoicous''' (also called '''androgynous''') bryophytes produce antheridia and archegonia interspersed in the same cluster.
*'''Paroicous''' bryophytes produce antheridia and archegonia in separate clusters in different leaf axils.
* '''Heteroicous''' bryophyte species may be either monoicous or sequentially dioicous depending on environmental conditions.  This condition is also called '''polygamous''' or '''polyoicous'''.

==Role in survival==
There can be both selective advantages and selective disadvantages for organisms that are monoicous or dioicous.  Monoicous bryophytes can easily reproduce sexually, since both sexes can be found on the same organism.  On the other hand, this can lead to inbreeding and reduce genetic variation within populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=P.J. |last2=Eppley |first2=S.M. |last3=Jesson |first3=L.K. |year=2007 |title=Sporophytic inbreeding depression in mosses occurs in a species with separate sexes but not in a species with combined sexes |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=94 |issue=11 |pages=1853–9 |url=http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/94/11/1853 |lastauthoramp=yes | doi = 10.3732/ajb.94.11.1853 |pmid=21636380}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dioicous organisms necessarily exchange [[genes]] with other organisms of the species during sexual reproduction, increasing [[zygosity|heterozygosity]] and variability (given a sufficiently large variable mating population).  If isolated, however, organisms may only reproduce asexually, which could present a severe selective disadvantage over time.  Bryophyte sperm dispersal can therefore be key to species longevity, particularly in dioicous species.  While sperm dispersal is typically passive, with sperm dispersing through water, certain species exhibit very active dispersal mechanisms, such as aerial dispersal recently described in the liverwort ''Conocephalum conicum''.&lt;ref name=Shimamuraetal&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shimamura | first1 = Masaki | last2 = Yamaguchi | first2 = Tomio | last3 = Deguchi | first3 = Hironori | year = 2007 | title = Airborne sperm of ''Conocephalum conicum'' (Conocephalaceae)" | url = | journal = Journal of Plant Research | volume = 121 | issue = 1| pages = 69–71 | doi=10.1007/s10265-007-0128-6| pmid = 18058191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was founded in 1918 by Sir [[Robert McCarrison]]. It was originally a single room laboratory at the Pasteur Institute, [[Coonoor]], [[Tamil Nadu]] for the study of [[Beriberi]], and was called the ''Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit''.&lt;ref name=NINorigins&gt;{{citation |title=Down the memory lane |publisher=National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India |url=http://www.ninindia.org/nin.htm |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarrison was invalided to Britain from 1920–1922, and in 1923 the enquiry was axed on financial grounds. It was restored two years later as the ''Deficiency Disease Inquiry'', which McCarrison headed from 1925-1929.&lt;ref name=Arnold2000&gt;{{citation |year=2000 |author=Arnold, David |title=Science, technology, and medicine in Colonial India |series=[[The New Cambridge History of India]].

Ackroyd.&lt;ref name=NINorigins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnold2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarrisonObituary28051960&gt;{{citation |date=May 28, 1960 |author=NIN origins |title=Obituary: Sir ROBERT McCARRISON, C.I.E., M.D., D.Sc.

{{Criminology and penology|theory}}

'''Neurocriminology''' is an emerging sub-discipline of biocriminology and criminology that applies brain imaging techniques and principles from neuroscience to understand, predict, and prevent crime.

== Concept ==

The main idea behind neurocriminology is that crime is only partially a social and environmental problem, and biological factors along with medical conditions play a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=217 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deviant brain theories have always been part of biocriminology, which explains crime with biological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|pages=19–121 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurocriminology has become mainstream during the past two decades,&lt;ref name="Raine, Adrian 2014 367"&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=367|publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; since contemporary biocriminologists focus almost exclusively on brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=241 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to significant advances in neuroscience. Even though neurocriminology is still at odds with traditional sociological theories of crime,&lt;ref name="Raine, Adrian 2014 367"/&gt; it is becoming more popular in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530"&gt;{{cite web |last=Raine |first=Adrian |title=The Criminal Mind |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The origins of neurocriminology go back to one of the founders of modern criminology, 19th-century Italian psychiatrist and prison doctor Cesare Lombroso, whose beliefs that the crime originated from brain abnormalities were partly based on phrenological theories about the shape and size of the human head. Lombroso conducted a postmortem on a serial killer and rapist, who had an unusual indentation at the base of the skull. Lombroso discovered a hollow part in the killer’s brain where the cerebellum would be. Lombroso’s theory was that crime originated in part from abnormal brain physiology and that violent criminals where throwbacks to less evolved human types identifiable by ape-like physical characteristics. Criminals, he believed, could be identified by physical traits, such as a large jaw and sloping forehead.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; The contemporary neuroscientists further developed his idea that physiology and traits of the brain underlie all crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Tim |title=How to Spot a Murderer's Brain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/12/how-to-spot-a-murderers-brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term “neurocriminology” was first introduced by James Hilborn (Cognitive Centre of Canada) and adopted by the leading researcher in the field, Dr. Adrian Raine, the chair of the Criminology Department at University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Seligman |first=Marty |title=Three Scholars Worth Your Time: Part 4 |url=http://lawmindscience.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/three-interesting-mind-scientists/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to conduct brain imaging study on violent criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Criminologist Believes Violent Behavior Is Biological, Adrian Raine's Interview with NPR Fresh Air's Terry Gross |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/21/292375166/criminologist-believes-violent-behavior-is-biological}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major studies ==

Many recent studies have revealed that sometimes structural and functional abnormalities are so striking that anyone can see them. Some violent offenders, however, have subtle structural or functional abnormalities and even highly experienced neuroradiologists cannot detect these irregularities right away. Yet, the abnormalities can be detected using brain imaging and state-of-the-art analytic tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=136 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurophysiological studies ==

Studies on structural deficiencies suggest that people consistently behaving antisocially have structurally impaired brains. The abnormalities can be either of general character or affect specific regions of the brain that control emotions, aggression or are responsible for ethical decisions:

''Low number of neurons in the prefrontal cortex''.
A study in 2000 determined that people with a history of persistent antisocial behavior had an 11 percent reduction in the volume of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex, while white matter volume was normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced prefrontal gray matter volume and reduced autonomic activity in antisocial personality disorder |author=Raine, A., Lencz, T., Bihrle, S., Lacasse, L. &amp; Colletti, P.|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=2000 |volume=57 |pages=119–27 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.57.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, A 2009 meta-analysis study, which pooled together the findings of 12 anatomical brain-imaging studies conducted on offender populations, found that the prefrontal cortex of the brain is indeed structurally impaired in offenders.&lt;ref name="j.pscychresns.2009.03.012"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prefrontal structural and functional brain imaging findings in antisocial, violent, and psychopathic individuals: A meta-analysis |author1=Yang, Y.  |author2=Raine, A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging |year=2009 |volume=174 |pages=81–88 |doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.03.012 |pmid=19833485 |pmc=2784035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Underdeveloped amygdalae''. Two studies found that both the left and especially the right amygdalae are impaired in psychopaths. The psychopaths had on average 18 percent reduction in the volume of the right amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Localization of deformations within the amygdala in individuals with psychopathy |author=Yang, Y., Raine, A., Karr, K. L., Colletti, P. &amp; Toga, A.|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |year=2009 |volume=66 |pages=986–94 |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.110 |pmid=19736355 |pmc=3192811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lower Amygdala Volume in Men is Associated with Childhood Aggression, Early Psychopathic Traits, and Future Violence |author=Pardini, Dustin A.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=75 |pages=73–80 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.04.003|display-authors=etal |pmid=23647988 |pmc=3751993 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cavum septi pellucidi maldevelopment''. A study in 2010 suggested that people with [[Cave of septum pellucidum|cavum septi pellucidi]] were prone to psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, and had more charges and convictions for criminal offenses. This brain maldevelopment was especially linked to lifelong antisocial behavior, i.e. a reckless disregarded for self and others, lack of remorse, and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Presence of a neurodevelopmental marker for limbic maldevelopment in antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy |author=Raine, A., Lee, L., Yang, Y. &amp; Colletti, P. |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |year=2010 |volume=197 |pages=186–92 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.110.078485 |pmid=20807962 |pmc=2930915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bigger right hippocampus''. A 2004 study suggested that the psychopaths’ right hippocampus that partially controls emotions and regulates aggression was significantly bigger than the left. This asymmetry was also true in normal people, but it was much more noticeable in psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hippocampal structural asymmetry in unsuccessful psychopaths |author=Raine, A., Ishikawa, S. S., Arce, E., Lencz, T., Knuth, K. H.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=55 |pages=185–91 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(03)00727-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Increase in the volume of the striatum''. A study in 2010 found that psychopathic individuals showed a 10 percent increase in the volume of the striatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Increased volume of the striatum in psychopathic individuals |author=Glenn, A. L., Raine, A., Yaralian, P. S. &amp; Yang, Y. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2010 |volume=67 |pages=52–58 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.06.018|pmc=2794920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Damage by foreign objects''. A large number of studies on structural damage by foreign objects convincingly shows that adults suffering head injuries damaging the prefrontal cortex show impulsive and antisocial behavior that does not conform to the norms of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Glenn, A. L.  |author2=Raine, A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Neural circuits underlying morality and antisocial behavior, in The Moral Brain |year=2009 |pages=45–68 |publisher=New York: Springer, J. Verplaetse and J. Braeckman (eds.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a number of famous life stories showing the same causal connection. For example, P. Gage was a well-respected, well-liked, and responsible gentleman. In 1848 because of a construction accident he suffered a serious damage to his brain when a metal rod propelled by an explosive entered his lower left cheek and exited from the top-middle part of his head. Gage healed quickly. After that accident, however, he became erratic, disrespectful, and vulgar. Gage had been transformed from a well-controlled, well-respected person to an individual with psychopathic traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|pages=143–45 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Damage by tumors''. There is also a number of famous U.S. criminal cases showing that damage of the brain by tumors can result in the same transformation as the damage by foreign objects. 
Charles Whitman, for instance, was a young man who studied architectural engineering at the University of Texas. Whitman had no history of violence or crime. As a child, he scored 138 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test, placing in the 99th percentile. He was an Eagle Scout, volunteered as a scoutmaster, and served in Marine Corps. In 1966 Whitman unexpectedly killed his mother as well as wife, ascended the belltower of the University of Texas, Austin, and fired a rifle at students below. He killed 15 people and wounding 31 more before police officers shot him. Whitman in his final note complained of inability to control his thoughts and requested an autopsy, which revealed a brain tumor in the hypothalamus region of his brain, a growth that, some hypothesized, put pressure on his amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=204 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eagleman |first=David |title=The Brain on Trial |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/308520/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Michael Oft’s was a teacher in Virginia who had no prior psychiatric nor deviant behavior history. At the age of forty, his behavior suddenly changed. He began to frequent massage parlors, collect child pornography, abuse his step-daughter, and was soon found guilty of child molestation. Mr. Oft opted for a treatment program for pedophiles, but still couldn’t resist soliciting sexual favors from staff and other clients at the rehabilitation center. A neurologist advised a brain scan, which showed a tumor growing at the base of his orbitofrontal cortex, compressing the right prefrontal region of his brain. After the tumor was removed, Mr. Oft’s emotion, behavior and sexual activity returned to normal. But after several months of normal behavior Mr. Oft again began to collect child pornography. Neurologists rescanned his brain and found that the tumor had grown back. After the second surgery removing the tumor, his behavior have been totally appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=303 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurofunctional studies ==

Similarly to neurophysiological studies neurofunctional showed that brains of criminals and psychopaths not only are structures differently but also operate in a different way. As you can see below, both structural and functional abnormalities tend to affect the same areas of the brain. These are the major abnormalities found:

''Lack of Activation in the Prefrontal Cortex''. A number of studies replicated the observance that violent criminals’ brains showed a significant reduction in prefrontal glucose metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain abnormalities in murderers indicated by positron emission tomography |author=Raine, A., Buchsbaum, M. S. &amp; LaCasse, L. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=1997 |volume=42|pages=495–508 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(96)00362-9 |pmid=9285085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="j.pscychresns.2009.03.012" /&gt;

''Reduced Activity In The Amygdala''. A study found that individuals with high psychopathy scores showed reduced activity in the amygdala during emotional, personal moral decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The neural correlates of moral decision-making in psychopathy |author=Glenn, A. L., Raine, A. &amp; Schug, R. A. |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |year=2009|volume=14 |pages=5–6 |doi=10.1038/mp.2008.104}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
''Dysfunctional Posterior Cingulate''. Two studies found that posterior cingulate functions poorly in adult criminal psychopaths and aggressive patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Limbic abnormalities in affective processing by criminal psychopaths as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging |author=Kiehl, K. A., Smith, A. M., Hare, R. D., Mendrek, A., Forster, B. B., Brink, J. &amp; Liddle, P. F. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2001 |volume=50 |pages=677–84 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(01)01222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Blunted prefrontal cortical fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography response to meta-chlorophenylpiperazine in impulsive aggression |author=New, A.

''Reduced Cerebral Blood Flow in Angular Gyrus''. A couple of studies found reduced cerebral blood flow in angular gyrus of murderers and impulsive, violent criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced frontotemporal perfusion in psychopathic personality |author=Soderstrom, H., Hultin, L., Tullberg, M., Wikkelso, C., Ekholm, S.|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging |year=2002|volume=114 |pages=81–94 |doi=10.1016/s0925-4927(02)00006-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neuroimaging studies of violence and antisocial behavior |author=Hoptman, M.

''Higher Activation of Subcortical Limbic Regions''. A 1998 study showed higher activation of subcortical limbic regions of two groups of reactive and proactive murderers, especially in the more “emotional” right hemisphere of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced prefrontal and increased subcortical brain functioning assessed using positron emission tomography in predatory and affective murderers |author=Raine, A., Meloy, J.

== Free will ==

Unlike the founding father of criminology, Cesare Lombroso, who thought that crime was fundamentally biological in its origin and criminals lacked free will altogether, contemporary neurocriminologists seem to take the middle ground approach. They do not argue that biological factors alone cause behavioral problems, but recognize that behavior results from interaction between biology and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=244 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|pages=306–15 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, however, are more determinist in their views. As one author writes: ''"Free will may exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), but one thing seems clear: if free will does exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment. In fact, free will may end up being so small that we eventually think about bad decision-making in the same way we think about any physical process, such as diabetes or lung disease."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eagleman |first=David |title=The Brain on Trial | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/308520/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal use ==

US legal defense teams increasingly use brain scans as mitigating evidence in trials of violent criminals and sex offenders. See [[Neurolaw]] for more. Here are some of the most famous cases:

===Herbert Weinstein===
In 1991, a sixty-five-year-old advertising executive with no prior history of crime or violence after an argument strangled his wife, opened the window and threw her out of their 12th-floor apartment. His defense team had a structural brain scan done using MRI and PET scan. The images showed a big piece missing from the prefrontal cortex of the brain, i.e., a subarachnoid cyst was growing in his left frontal lobe. The defense team used these images to argue that Weinstein had an impaired ability to regulate his emotions and make rational decisions. The team went with an insanity defense, and the prosecution and defense agreed to a plea of manslaughter. As a result, Weinstein was given a seven-year sentence in contrast to the twenty-five-year sentence he would have served if he had been convicted of second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jeffrey |title=The Brain on the Stand |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/magazine/11Neurolaw.t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antonio Bustamante===
Bustamante was a well-behaved teenager who suddenly at the age of 22 became a career criminal. His crimes included theft, breaking and entering, drug offenses, and robbery. In 1990 Bustamante was charged with a homicide. The defense team discovered that the client had suffered a head injury from a crowbar at the age of twenty. Bustamante’s behavior changed fundamentally after that, transforming him from a normal individual into an impulsive and emotionally labile criminal. The defense team had his client’s brain scanned, which revealed malfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex. At the end the jury believed that Bustamante’s brain was not normal and spared him from the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=69 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donta Page===
In 1999, Page robbed, raped and killed a female student in Denver. He later was found guilty of first-degree murder and was a candidate for the death penalty. Professor A. Raine from the University of Pennsylvania was an expert witness for defense and brought Page into a laboratory to assess his brain function. Brain imaging scans revealed a distinct lack of activation in the ventral prefrontal cortex. Professor Raine argued for a deep-rooted biological explanation for Mr. Page’s violence, who escaped death penalty partly on the basis of his brain pathology.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt;

== Crime prevention ==

Even though currently there are no preventive programs in place utilizing the recent discoveries in neurocriminology, there are a number of offender rehabilitation programs (Cognitive Centre of Canada).

===Decisions based on brain imaging===
Some scientists propose using brain imaging to help decide which soon-to-be-released offenders are at greater risk for reoffending. The brain imaging data would be used along with common factors like age, prior arrests, and marital status.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; To support this idea, in a 2013 study, Professor Kent Kiehl from the University of New Mexico studying the population of 96 male offenders in the state’s prisons found that offenders with low activity in the anterior cingulate cortex where twice as likely to commit an offense in the four years after their release as those who had high activity in this region.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; Similarly, Dustin Pardini conducted that which shows that men with a smaller amygdala are three times more likely to commit violence three years after their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lower Amygdala Volume in Men is Associated with Childhood Aggression, Early Psychopathic Traits, and Future Violence|author=Pardini, Dustin A.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2013|volume=75 |pages=73–80 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.04.003|display-authors=etal |pmid=23647988 |pmc=3751993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurochemistry===
Trials demonstrated the efficacy of a number of medications, i.e. stimulants antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers, in diminishing aggression in adolescents and children.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt;
Even a simple omega-3 supplements in the diets of young offenders reduces offending and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of nutritional supplements on aggression, rule-breaking, and psychopathology among young adult prisoners |author=Zaalberg, A., Nijman, H., Bulten, E., Stroosma, L. &amp; Van der Staak, C. |journal=Aggressive Behavior |year=2010 |volume=36 |pages=117–26 |doi=10.1002/ab.20335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cognitive and physiological effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in healthy subjects |author=Fontani, G., Corradeschi, F., Felici, A., Alfatti, F., Migliorini, S.|journal=European Journal of Clinical Investigation |year=2005 |volume=35 |pages=691–99 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2362.2005.01570.x |pmid=16269019|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation===
Meditation can also affect brains, and even change them permanently. In 2003 Professor Richie Davidson from the University of Wisconsin performed a revolutionary study. People were randomly selected into either a mindfulness training group or a control group that was put on a waiting list for training. Davidson showed that even eight weekly sessions of meditation enhanced left frontal EEG functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alterations in brain and immune function produced by mindfulness meditation |author=Davidson, R.

{{Science with neutrons}}
The '''Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor''' ('''OPAL''') is a 20&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MW) [[Pool-type reactor|pool-type]] nuclear [[research reactor]]. Officially opened in April 2007, it replaced the [[High Flux Australian Reactor]] as Australia's only nuclear reactor, and is located at the [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]] (ANSTO) Research Establishment in [[Lucas Heights, New South Wales]], a suburb of [[Sydney]]. Both OPAL and its predecessor have been commonly known as simply the '''Lucas Heights reactor''', after their location.

==Functions==
The main reactor uses are:

* Irradiation of target materials to produce [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]] for medical and industrial applications
* Research in the fields of [[materials science]] and [[structural biology]] using neutron beams and its sophisticated suite of experimental equipment
* Analysis of minerals and samples using the [[Neutron activation analysis|neutron activation technique]] and the delay neutron activation technique
* Irradiation of [[Boule (crystal)|silicon ingots]] in order to dope them with phosphorus and produce the basic material used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices

The reactor runs on an operation cycle of 30 days non-stop at full power, followed by a stop of 5 days to reshuffle the fuel.

During year 2014 OPAL ran a total of 290 days at power, and over 300 days in 2015, which represents a world-leading level of availability.

==History==
The [[Argentina|Argentine]] company [[INVAP]] was fully responsible through a [[turnkey]] contract, signed in June 2000, for the delivery of the reactor, performing the design, construction and commissioning. Local civil construction was performed by INVAP's partner, [[John Holland Group|John Holland]]-[[Evans Deakin]] Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leighton.com.au/our-business/projects/completed-projects/ansto-replacement-research-reactor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318134231/http://www.leighton.com.au/our-business/projects/completed-projects/ansto-replacement-research-reactor |title=ANSTO Replacement Research Reactor |work=Leighton Holdings |archivedate=18 March 2015 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility features a large (20-litre) liquid-deuterium cold neutron source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/AboutANSTO/OPAL/Capabilities/ColdNeutronSource/ |title=Cold Neutron Source |author=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation |work=ansto.gov.au |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[supermirror]] guides, and a 35&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;65&amp;nbsp;m guide hall.  The cold source was designed by the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnpi.spb.ru/ |title=Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute. National Research Centre "Kurchatov Institute" |work=pnpi.spb.ru |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cryogenic system designed and supplied by [[Air Liquide]] and the initial set of four supermirror guides supplied by Mirrotron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrotron.kfkipark.hu/ |title=Mirrotron Multilayer Laboratory |author=Szimandl Béla |work=kfkipark.hu |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists occupied the Lucas Heights facility to protest the construction of OPAL. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of radioactive waste from the facility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2001/12/18/443080.htm|title=Greenpeace raid on Australian nuclear reactor|date=2001-12-18|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

OPAL was opened on 20 April 2007 by then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |publisher=[[ANSTO]] |date=20 April 2007 |title=PM Opens Australia’s New Nuclear Reactor |url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/9662/OPAL_opening_release.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the replacement for the [[HIFAR]] reactor.  ANSTO received an operating licence from the [[Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency]] (ARPANSA) in July 2006, allowing commencement of hot commissioning, where fuel is first loaded into the reactor core. OPAL went [[Critical mass|critical]] for the first time on the evening of 12 August 2006 and reached full power for the first time on the morning of 3 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |publisher=[[INVAP]] |date=10 November 2006 |title=Sydney Opal reactor at full power |url=http://www.invap.net/news/novedades-e.php?id=20061110183244 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility details==
[[File:OPAL reactorpools.jpg|right|thumb|The OPAL reactor pools. Made of stainless steel and 4.5&amp;nbsp;m wide, it contains demineralised water used for shielding and cooling.]]

The [[Nuclear reactor core|reactor core]] consists of 16 low-enriched plate-type [[Nuclear fuel|fuel assemblies]] and is located under 13 metres of water in an open pool. Light water (normal H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is used as the coolant and [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] while [[heavy water]] (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is used as the [[neutron]] reflector. The purpose of the neutron reflector is to improve neutron economy in the reactor, and hence to increase the maximum neutron flux.

OPAL is the centrepiece of the facilities at ANSTO, providing efficient and rapid [[Radiopharmacology|radiopharmaceutical]] and [[radioisotope]] production, [[irradiation]] services (including neutron [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] doping of silicon), [[neutron activation analysis]] and [[Particle beam|neutron beam]] research. OPAL is able to produce four times as many radioisotopes for [[nuclear medicine]] treatments as the old [[HIFAR]] reactor, and a wider array of radioisotopes for the treatment of disease. The modern design includes a [[Cold neutron|cold]] [[neutron source]] (CNS).

The OPAL reactor already has received seven awards in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |publisher=[[INVAP]] |date=14 November 2006 |title=The OPAL reactor already has received seven awards in Australia |url=http://www.invap.net/news/novedades-e.php?id=20061114194744 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutron scattering at OPAL==
The [[Bragg Institute]] at [[ANSTO]] hosts OPAL's [[neutron scattering]] facility. It is now running as a user facility serving the scientific community in Australia and around the world. New funding was received in 2009 in order to install further competitive instruments and beamlines. The actual facility comprises the following instruments:

===ECHIDNA===
[[File:ECHIDNA HRPD design.jpg|thumb|right|240|Engineering drawing of the ECHIDNA High-Resolution Powder Diffractometer (August 2003)]]
[[File:NeutronMonochromatorBNL.jpg|thumb|right|240|The Ge-115 monochromator has been acquired from the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].]]
'''ECHIDNA''' is the name of the high-resolution [[neutron diffraction|neutron]]  [[powder diffraction|powder diffractometer]]. The instrument serves to determine the crystalline structures of materials using [[neutron radiation]] analogous to X-ray techniques. It is named after the Australian [[monotreme]] ''[[echidna]]'', as the spiny peaks of the instrument looks like an echidna.

It operates with [[neutron temperature|thermal neutron]]s. One of the main features is the array of 128 collimators and position sensitive detectors for rapid data acquisition. ECHIDNA allows for structure determinations, texture measurements and reciprocal space mapping of single crystals in most different sample environments serving the physics, chemistry, materials, minerals and earth-science communities. ECHIDNA is part of the [[Bragg Institute]]'s park of [[neutron scattering]] instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liss |first=L. |last2=Hunter |first2=B. |last3=Hagen |first3=M. |last4=Noakes |first4=T. |last5=Kennedy |first5=S. |year=2006 |title=Echidna—the new high-resolution powder diffractometer being built at OPAL |url=http://liss.freeshell.org/KDL/papers/LissEchidnaICNS2005.pdf |journal=[[Physica B]] |volume=385-386 |issue= |pages=1010 |doi=10.1016/j.physb.2006.05.322 |bibcode=2006PhyB..385.1010L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Components====
* Neutron guide
*: The instrument is located on the TG1 [[neutron temperature|thermal neutron]] guide of the OPAL reactor. The distance from the reactor is 58&amp;nbsp;m. The position is the second on the guide after the [[WOMBAT - High Intensity Powder Diffractometer|WOMBAT]] instrument. The size of the guide is 300&amp;nbsp;mm high by 50&amp;nbsp;mm wide, and it is plated with [[neutron supermirror|supermirror]] coatings.
* Primary [[collimator]]
*: There are Söller [[collimator]]s prior to the monochromator in order to reduce the divergence of the beam and to increase the angular resolution of the instrument. Since this is an intensity compromise, two items of [[Minute of arc|5']] and [[Minute of arc|10']], respectively, can be interchanged or fully removed by an automated mechanism. The collimators cover the full size of the beam delivered by the neutron guide.
* [[Crystal monochromator|Monochromator]]
*: The monochromator is made by slabs of [[Miller index|&lt;nowiki&gt;[115]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] oriented Germanium crystals which are inclined towards each other in order to focus down the Bragg reflected beam. The device has been acquired from the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in the USA after the shutdown of their neutron facility.
* Secondary collimator
*: Optionally a secondary collimator with [[Minute of arc|10']] angular acceptance and 200&amp;nbsp;mm &amp;times; 20&amp;nbsp;mm can be placed in the monochromatic beam between the monochromator and the sample, which again influences the resolution function of the instrument.
* Slit system
*: Two automated sets of horizontal and vertical pairs of absorbing plates allow to cut down the size of the monochromatic beam prior to the secondary collimator and sample size. They remove unwanted neutrons and reduce the background near the detector. In addition, they allow selection of the sample position to be studied.
* Beam monitor
*: A [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] [[neutron detector|fission monitor]] measures the amount of neutrons incident to the sample. The efficiency is [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)|10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;]] and most neutrons traverse the device undisturbed. The monitor counts are important to correct for beam flux variations due to changes in the reactor or at the upstream instrument.
* Sample stage
*:The sample is supported by a heavy load [[goniometer]] consisting of a 360° vertical omega rotation axis, x-y translation tables and a chi-phi cross tilt stage of ±20° range. It can hold a few hundred kilograms in order to support heavier sample environments, such as cryostats, furnaces, magnets, load frames, reaction chambers and others. A typical powder sample is filled into vanadium cans which give little unstructured background. The mentioned sample environment allows measurement of changes in the sample as a function of external parameters, like temperature, pressure, magnetic field, etc. The goniometer stage is redundant for most powder diffraction measurements, but will be important for single crystal and texture measurements, where the orientation of the sample plays a role.
* Detector [[collimator]]s
*:A set of 128 detectors each equipped which a 5' collimator in front are arranged in a 160° sector focusing to the sample. The collimators select the scattered radiation into the well defined ranges of 128 angular positions. The whole collimator and detector setup is mounted on a common table which is scanned in finer steps around the sample, to be combined further into a continuous diffraction pattern.
* Detector tubes
*:The 128 linear position-sensitive [[Helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]] gas detector tubes cover the full opening height of 300&amp;nbsp;mm behind the collimators. They determine the position of the neutron event by charge division over the resistive anode towards each end of the detector. Overall and local count rates lie in the several 10000&amp;nbsp;Hz range.

===PLATYPUS===
PLATYPUS is a [[time-of-flight]] [[Neutron reflectometry|reflectometer]] built on the [[neutron temperature|cold neutron]] source. The instrument serves to determine the structure of interfaces using highly collimated [[neutron radiation|neutron beams]]. These beams are shone on to the surface at low angles (typically less than 2 degrees) and the intensity of the reflected radiation is measured as a function of angle of incidence.

It operates using cold neutrons with a wavelength band of 0.2–2.0&amp;nbsp;nm.  Although up to three different angles of incidence are required for each reflectivity curve, the time-of-flight nature means that timescales of kinetic processes are accessible. By analysing the reflected signal one builds a picture of the chemical structure of the interface.  This instrument can be used for examining biomembranes, lipid bilayers, magnetism, adsorbed surfactant layers, etc.

it is named after [[Platypus|''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'']], the semi-aquatic mammal native to Australia.

===WOMBAT===
WOMBAT is a high-intensity [[neutron diffraction|neutron]] [[powder diffraction|powder diffractometer]]. The instrument serves to determine the crystalline structures of materials using neutron radiation analogous to X-ray techniques. It is named after the [[wombat]], a [[marsupial]] indigenous to Australia.

It will operate with [[thermal neutron]]s. It has been designed for highest flux and data acquisition speed in order to deliver time resolved diffraction patterns in a fraction of a second. Wombat will concentrate on ''in-situ'' studies and time critical investigations, such as structure determinations, texture measurements and reciprocal space mapping of single crystals in most different sample environments serving the physics, chemistry, materials, minerals and earth-science communities.

===KOWARI===
'''KOWARI''' is a [[neutron diffraction|neutron]] [[residual stress]] diffractometer. [[Strain (materials science)|Strain]] scanning using [[thermal neutron]]s is a [[powder diffraction]] technique in a polycrystalline block of material probing the change of atomic spacing due to internal or external [[Stress (physics)|stress]]. It is named after the [[kowari]], an Australian marsupial.

It provides a diagnostic non-destructive tool to optimise e.g. [[post weld heat treatment]] (PWHT, similar to [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]) of welded structures. Tensile stresses for example drive crack growth in engineering components and compressive stresses inhibit crack growth (for example cold-expanded holes subject to fatigue cycling). Life extension strategies have high economic impact and strain scanning provides the stresses needed to calculate remaining life as well as the means to monitor the condition of components since it is non-destructive. One of the main features is the sample table that will allow examination of large engineering components while orienting and positioning them very accurately.

==Performance==
During the initial testing and commissioning stages each equipment and system was tested isolated and then in an integrated manner. First tests were carried out without nuclear fuel loaded into the core, and then a careful plan was followed for loading nuclear fuel in the reactor core and reaching a nuclear chain for the first time. Successive increasing power steps were followed to get the reactor to run at full power. Once commissioning was completed, the Australian Nuclear regulatory Body (ARPANSA) issued a licence that authorize its operation at full power. During the first operation cycles a typical teething period of a [[first of a kind design]] followed.&lt;ref&gt;

Since commissioned the reactor has been running with a very high availability, during the term 2012-13 it operated 265 days at full power (including an extended routine maintenance period), during 2013-14 for 294 days at full power, and during 2014-15 it operated 307 days at full power.

As per Sept 2016 it has accumulated a total of 2200 equivalent Full Power Days. Each 30 days operating cycle more than 150 batches of Silicon are irradiated, Mo99 is produced on a regular basis for the nuclear medicine market. OPAL has delivered 4 million doses.  Regarding research with neutrons the world class Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering (formerly Bragg Institute) features more than 120 scientists and 13 neutron beam operational instruments, and has produced more than 600 scientific research papers using the neutrons coming from OPAL core.

A '''parallel universe''' is a hypothetical self-contained [[reality]] co-existing with one's own. A specific group of parallel universes are called a "[[multiverse]]", although this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that constitute reality. While the terms "parallel universe" and "alternative reality" are generally [[synonym]]ous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term "alternative reality" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own. The term "parallel universe" is more general, without implying a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe. A universe where the very [[Physical law|laws of nature]] are different – for example, one in which there are no Laws of Motion – would in general count as a parallel universe but not an alternative reality and a concept between both fantasy world and earth.

The actual [[many-worlds interpretation|quantum-mechanical]] hypothesis of parallel universes is "universes that are separated from each other by a single quantum event."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Overview==
Fantasy has long borrowed an idea of "another world" from [[mythology|myth]], [[legend]] and [[religion]]. [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]], and [[Valhalla]] are all "alternative universes" different from the familiar material realm. [[Plato]] reflected deeply on the parallel realities, resulting in [[Platonism]], in which the upper reality is perfect while the lower earthly reality is an imperfect shadow of the heavenly. The lower reality is similar but with flaws.

Modern [[fantasy]] often presents the concept as a series of planes of existence where the laws of nature differ, allowing [[magic in fiction|magical]] phenomena of some sort on some planes. This concept was also found in ancient [[Hindu mythology]], in texts such as the [[Puranas]], which expressed an infinite number of universes, each with its own gods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Similarly in [[Persian literature]], "The Adventures of Bulukiya", a tale in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', describes the protagonist Bulukiya learning of alternative worlds/universes that are similar to but still distinct from his own.&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin|first1=Robert|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|date=2005|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|location=London|isbn=1860649831}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} In other cases, in both fantasy and [[science fiction]], a parallel universe is a single other material reality, and its co-existence with ours is a rationale to bring a protagonist from the author's reality into the fantasy's reality, such as in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]] or even the beyond-the-reflection travel in the two main works of [[Lewis Carroll]]. Or this single other reality can invade our own, as when [[Margaret Cavendish]]'s English heroine sends submarines and "birdmen" armed with "fire stones" back through the portal from ''[[The Blazing World]]'' to Earth and wreaks havoc on England's enemies. In [[dark fantasy]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]] the parallel world is often a hiding place for unpleasant things, and often the protagonist is forced to confront effects of this other world leaking into his own, as in most of the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and the ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'' computer game series, or ''[[Warhammer 40,000|Warhammer 40K]]'' miniature and computer games. In such stories, the nature of this other reality is often left mysterious, known only by its effect on our own world.

The concept also arises outside the framework of quantum mechanics, as is found in [[Jorge Luis Borges]] short story ''El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' ("[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]"), published in 1941 before the many-worlds interpretation had been invented. In the story, a [[Sinology|Sinologist]] discovers a manuscript by a Chinese writer where the same tale is recounted in several ways, often contradictory, and then explains to his visitor (the writer's grandson) that his relative conceived time as a "garden of forking paths", where things happen in parallel in infinitely branching ways. One of the first [[Science fiction]] examples is [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''[[Sidewise in Time]]'', in which portions of alternative universes replace corresponding geographical regions in this universe. ''[[Sidewise in Time]]'' describes it in the manner that similar to requiring both [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] coordinates in order to mark your location on Earth, so too does time: travelling along latitude is akin to [[time travel]] moving through past, present and future, while travelling along latitude is to travel perpendicular to time and to other realities, hence the name of the short story. Thus, another common term for a parallel universe is "another dimension", stemming from the idea that if the 4th [[dimension]] is time, the 5th dimension - a direction at a right angle to the fourth - are alternate realities.

While this is a common treatment in Science fiction, it is by no means the only presentation of the idea, even in [[hard science fiction]]. Sometimes the parallel universe bears no historical relationship to any other world; instead, the laws of nature are simply different from those in our own, as in the novel ''[[Raft (novel)|Raft]]'' by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], which posits a reality where the [[gravitational constant]] is much larger than in our universe. (Note, however, that Baxter explains later in ''[[Vacuum Diagrams]]'' that the protagonists in ''Raft'' are descended from people who came from the [[Xeelee Sequence]] universe.)

One motif is that the way time flows in a parallel universe may be very different, so that a character returning to one might find the time passed very differently for those he left behind. This is found in folklore: King Herla visited Fairy and returned three centuries later; although only some of his men crumbled to dust on dismounting, Herla and his men who did not dismount were trapped on horseback, this being one folkloric account of the origin of the [[Wild Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1967) p.50-1&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[C. S. Lewis]] made use of this in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''; indeed, a character points out to two skeptics that there is no need for the time between the worlds to match up, but it would be very odd for the girl who claims to have visited a parallel universe to have dreamed up such a different time flow - from their perspective, the girl had only been gone for a few minutes though she was in Narnia for hours, and if she was making it up surely she would have spent a while longer hiding than a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassham|first1=Gregory|title=Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: The Lion, the Witch, and the Worldview|date=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=0812695887|page=171|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The division between science fiction and fantasy becomes fuzzier than usual when dealing with stories that explicitly leave the universe we are familiar with, especially when our familiar universe is portrayed as a subset of a multiverse. Picking a genre becomes less a matter of setting, and more a matter of theme and emphasis; the parts of the story the author wishes to explain and how they are explained. ''[[Narnia]]'' is clearly a fantasy, and the TV series ''[[Sliders]]'' is clearly science fiction, but works like the ''[[World of Tiers]]'' series or ''[[Glory Road]]'' tend to occupy a much broader middle ground.

==Science fiction==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
While technically incorrect, and looked down upon by hard science-fiction fans and authors, the idea of another "[[dimension]]" has become synonymous with the term "parallel universe". The usage is particularly common in [[movies]], television and [[comic books]] and much less so in modern prose science fiction. The idea of a parallel world was first introduced in comic books with the publication of ''The Flash'' #123, "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In written science fiction, "new dimension" more commonly – and more accurately – refer to additional [[Coordinate axis|coordinate axes]], beyond the three spatial axes with which we are familiar. By proposing travel along these extra axes, which are not normally [[perceptible]], the traveler can reach worlds that are otherwise unreachable and invisible.

[[File:Flatland cover detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin A. Abbott]]'s ''[[Flatland]]'' is set in a world of two dimensions.]]
In 1884, [[Edwin A. Abbott]] wrote the seminal novel exploring this concept called ''[[Flatland|Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions]]''. It describes a world of two dimensions inhabited by living squares, triangles, and circles, called Flatland, as well as Pointland (0 dimensions), Lineland (1 dimension), and Spaceland (three dimensions) and finally posits the possibilities of even greater dimensions. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions."

In 1895, ''[[The Time Machine]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]] used time as an additional "dimension" in this sense, taking the [[Spacetime|four-dimensional]] model of [[classical physics]] and interpreting time as a space-like dimension in which humans could travel with the right equipment. Wells also used the concept of parallel universes as a consequence of time as the fourth dimension in stories like ''[[The Wonderful Visit]]'' and ''[[Men Like Gods]]'', an idea proposed by the astronomer [[Simon Newcomb]], who talked about both time and parallel universes; "Add a fourth dimension to space, and there is room for an indefinite number of universes, all alongside of each other, as there is for an indefinite number of sheets of paper when we pile them upon each other".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are many examples where authors have explicitly created additional spatial dimensions for their characters to travel in, to reach parallel universes. In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the Doctor accidentally enters a parallel universe while attempting to repair the [[TARDIS]] console in "[[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]]". The parallel universe was similar to the real universe but with some different aspects, Britain has a fascist government and the royal family has been executed. [[Douglas Adams]], in the last book of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', uses the idea of [[probability]] as an extra [[Coordinate axis|axis]] in addition to the classical four dimensions of space and time similar to the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]]. Though, according to the novel, they're not really parallel universes at all but only a model to capture the continuity of space, time and probability. [[Robert A. Heinlein]], in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', postulated a six-dimensional universe. In addition to the three spatial dimensions, he invoked [[symmetry]] to add two new temporal dimensions, so there would be two sets of three. Like the fourth dimension of H. G. Wells' [[The Time Traveller (character)|"Time Traveller"]], these extra dimensions can be traveled by persons using the right equipment.

===Hyperspace===
{{main article|Hyperspace (science fiction)}}

Perhaps the most common use of the concept of a parallel universe in science fiction is the concept of hyperspace. Used in science fiction, the concept of "hyperspace" often refers to a parallel universe that can be used as a [[faster-than-light]] shortcut for [[interstellar travel]]. Rationales for this form of hyperspace vary from work to work, but the two common elements are:
#at least some (if not all) locations in the hyperspace universe map to locations in our universe, providing the "entry" and "exit" points for travellers.
#the travel time between two points in the hyperspace universe is much shorter than the time to travel to the analogous points in our universe. This can be because of a different speed of light, different speed at which time passes, or the analogous points in the hyperspace universe simply being much closer to each other.

Sometimes "hyperspace" is used to refer to the concept of additional coordinate axes. In this model, the universe is thought to be "crumpled" in some higher spatial dimension and that traveling in this higher spatial dimension, a ship can move vast distances in the common spatial dimensions. An analogy is to crumple a newspaper into a ball and stick a needle straight through, the needle will make widely spaced holes in the two-dimensional surface of the paper. While this idea invokes a "new dimension", it is not an example of a parallel universe.  It ''is'' a more scientifically plausible use of hyperspace. (See [[wormhole]].)

While use of hyperspace is common, it is mostly used as a [[plot device]] and thus of secondary importance. While a parallel universe may be invoked by the concept, the nature of the universe is not often explored. So, while stories involving hyperspace might be the most common use of the parallel universe concept in fiction, it is not the most common source of fiction ''about'' parallel universes.

===Time travel and alternative history===
[[File:H G Wells pre 1922.jpg|thumb|right|British author [[H. G. Wells]]' 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'', an early example of [[time travel]] in modern fiction]]
{{Main article|Time travel|Alternate history}}

Parallel universes may be the backdrop to or the consequence of time travel, their most common use in [[Time travel in fiction|fiction]] if the concept is central to the story. A seminal example of both is in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s novel ''[[The Big Time]]'' where there's a war across time between two [[alternative future]]s manipulating history to create a timeline that results in or realizes their own world.

Time travelers in fiction often accidentally or deliberately create [[alternative history|alternative histories]], such as in ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] where the [[Confederate Army]] is given thousands of [[AK-47]] rifles and ends up winning the [[American Civil War]]. (However, [[Ward Moore]] reversed this staple of alternative history fiction in his ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), where an alternative world where the [[Confederate States of America]] won the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and the [[American Civil War]] is destroyed after a historian and time traveler from the defeated United States of that world travels back to the scene of the battle and, by inadvertently causing the death of the Confederate officer whose troops occupied [[Little Round Top]], changes the result so that the Union forces are victorious.) The alternative history novel ''[[1632 (novel)|1632]]'' by [[Eric Flint]] explicitly states, albeit briefly in a prologue, that the time travelers in the novel (an entire town from [[West Virginia]]) have created a new and separate universe when they're transported into the midst of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 17th century [[Germany]]. (This sort of thing is known as an ISOT among alternative history fans, after [[S. M. Stirling]]'s ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'': an ISOT is when territory or a large group of people is transported back in time to another historical period or place.){{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Ordinarily, [[alternative history|alternative histories]] are not technically parallel universes. The concepts are similar but there are significant differences. Where characters travel to the past, they may cause changes in the timeline (creating a point of divergence) that result in changes to the present. The alternative present will be similar in different degrees to the original present as would be the case with a parallel universe. The main difference is that parallel universes co-exist whereas only one history or alternative history can exist at any one moment.&lt;!--maybe not the best term here but i introduce 'moment' below--&gt; Another difference is that moving to a parallel universe involves some inter-dimensional travel whereas &lt;!--moving between?--&gt;alternative histories involve some type of time travel. (However, since the future is only potential and not actual, it is often conceived that more than one future may exist simultaneously.)

The concept of "sidewise" time travel, a term taken from Murray Leinster's "[[Sidewise in Time]]", is often used to allow characters to pass through many different alternative histories, all descendant from some common branch point. Often worlds that are similar to each other are considered closer to each other in terms of this sidewise travel. For example, a universe where World War II ended differently would be "closer" to us than one where Imperial China colonized the New World in the 15th century. [[H. Beam Piper]] used this concept, naming it "paratime" and writing a series of stories involving the Paratime Police who regulated travel between these alternative realities as well as the technology to do so. [[Keith Laumer]] used the same concept of "sideways" time travel in his 1962 novel ''[[Worlds of the Imperium]]''. More recently, novels such as [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[The Coming of the Quantum Cats]]'' and [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Anathem]]'' explore human-scale readings of the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation|"many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics]], postulating that historical events or human consciousness spawns or allows "travel" among alternative universes.

Universe 'types' frequently explored in sidewise and alternative history works include worlds whose [[Axis victory in World War II|Nazis won the Second World War]], as in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], ''[[SS-GB]]'' by [[Len Deighton]], and ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], and worlds whose Roman Empire never fell, as in ''[[Roma Eterna]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]] and ''[[Romanitas (novel)|Romanitas]]'' by [[Sophia McDougall]]. The novel ''[[Warlords of Utopia]]'' by [[Lance Parkin]] explored a multiverse in which the universes whose Rome never fell go to war with all those whose Nazis won World War II. It fits loosely in the [[Faction Paradox]] series initiated by [[Lawrence Miles]], several of whose novels featured an artificially created universe existing within another; specifically, within a bottle. ''[[Dead Romance]]'' explored the consequences of inhabitants of the 'real' universe entering the Universe-in-a-Bottle.

In [[Philip Pullman]]'s trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', the protagonist begins in a world that is a Victorian counterpart to ours, although it takes place at the same time.&lt;!--is contemporary to ours?--&gt; It also appears that the [[Protestant Reformation]] happened differently with John Calvin becoming the last Pope.

===Counter-Earth===
The concept of [[Counter-Earth]] is typically similar to that of parallel universes but is actually a distinct idea. A counter-earth is a planet that shares [[Earth's orbit]] but is on the opposite side of the Sun and, therefore, cannot be seen from Earth. There would be no necessity that such a planet would be like [[Earth]] in any way though typically in fiction; it is usually nearly identical to Earth. Since Counter-Earth is always within the [[universe]] (and the [[Solar System]]), travel to it can be accomplished with ordinary space travel.

Gerry and Sylvia Anderson used this concept in their 1969 movie ''[[Doppelgänger (1969 film)|Doppelgänger]]'' (released outside Europe as ''Journey to the Far Side of the Sun''), in which a Counter-Earth is detected by astronomers and a manned mission launched by a US-European space consortium to explore it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Convergent evolution===
[[Convergent evolution]] is a biological concept whereby unrelated species acquire similar traits because they adapted to a similar environment and/or played similar roles in their ecosystems. In fiction, the concept is extended whereby similar planets will result in races with similar cultures and/or histories.

Technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel, but the stories are similar in some respects. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' frequently explored such worlds:

*In "[[Bread and Circuses (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Bread and Circuses]]" the ''Enterprise'' encounters a planet called Magna Roma, which has many physical resemblances to Earth such as its atmosphere, land to ocean ratio, and size. The landing party discovers that the planet is at roughly a late 20th-century level of technology but its society is similar to the Roman Empire, as if the Empire had not fallen but had continued to that time: there is also a reference to the Roman god [[Jupiter]] as the namesake of a new line of automobile, and gladiator fights are televised in [[primetime]]. [[Slavery]] on this world has also developed into an institution, with slaves guaranteed medical benefits and old-age pensions, so the workers grew more content and never rebelled. At the end of the episode, it is discovered that the society has just found their own version of [[Jesus]], referred simply as "the son" (whose followers they had previously mistaken for [[Solar deity|sun worshipers]]).
*In "[[The Omega Glory]]", the crew visit a planet on which there is a conflict between two peoples called the Yangs and the Kohms. They discover that the Yangs are like Earth's "Yankees" (in other words, Americans) and the Kohms are like Earth's Communists; the Yangs, who had at some point in the past been conquered by the Kohms, had a ritual speech that was word for word identical to the American [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], and treated the [[U.S. Constitution]] as a sacred text. (A deleted scene from the episode, however, implied that both the Yangs and Kohms were actually descendants of human colonists.)
*In "[[Miri (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Miri]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew encounter a planet that is physically identical to Earth. Histories on the two planets were apparently identical until the 20th century when scientists had accidentally created a deadly virus that killed all the adults but extended the lives of the children (who call themselves the "Onlies").

===Convergent evolution due to contamination===
A similar concept in biology is [[gene flow]]. In this case, a planet may start as different from Earth, but due to the influence of Earth culture, the planet comes to resemble Earth in some way; technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel, but the stories are similar in some respects. ''Star Trek'' used this theory as well: in "[[Patterns of Force (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Patterns of Force]]", a planet is discovered that has become very similar to Nazi Germany due to the influence of a historian that came to reside there (believing that the Nazi fascism itself was not evil and under benevolent leadership could be "good government"), while in "[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew visits a planet that, 100 years after a book ''Chicago Mobs of the Twenties'' that had been left behind by previous Earth craft, their society resembles mob ruled cities of the [[Prohibition era]] United States.

===Simulated reality===

{{main article|Simulated reality in fiction}}

Simulated realities are digital constructs featured in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]''.

==Fantasy==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}

===Stranger in a strange land===
[[Image:Oz-and-surrounding-countrie.jpg|right|thumb|[[Land of Oz|Oz]] and its surroundings.]]
Fantasy authors often want to bring characters from the author's (and the reader's) reality into their created world. Before the mid-20th century, this was most often done by hiding fantastic worlds within hidden parts of the author's own universe. Peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an [[ogre]] or other fantastical beings could live an hour away, but increasing geographical knowledge meant that such locations had to be farther and farther off.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=C. S.|last2=Hooper|first2=Walter|title=Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0156678977|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in the author's world could board a ship and find themselves on a fantastic island, as [[Jonathan Swift]] does in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' or in the 1949 novel ''[[Silverlock]]'' by [[John Myers Myers]], or be sucked up into a [[tornado]] and land in [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. These "[[Lost World (genre)|lost world]]" stories can be seen as geographic equivalents of a "parallel universe", as the worlds portrayed are separate from our own, and hidden to everyone except those who take the difficult journey there. The geographic "lost world" can blur into a more explicit "parallel universe" when the fantasy realm overlaps a section of the "real" world, but is much larger inside than out, as in [[Robert Holdstock]]'s novel ''[[Mythago Wood]]''. Madeleine L'engle, "Wrinkle in Time" series: characters go from the present time to places in the universe.

After the mid-20th century, perhaps influenced by ideas from science fiction, perhaps because exploration had made many places on the map too clear to write "[[Here be dragons|Here there be dragons]]", many fantasy worlds became completely separate from the author's world.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; A common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] is a [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] or [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifact]] that connects worlds together, prototypical examples being the wardrobe in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', or the sigil in [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[The Cream of the Jest]]''. In [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]'', [[Chihiro Ogino]] and her parents climb over a small stream into the spirit world. The main difference between this type of story and the "lost world" above, is that the fantasy realm can only be reached by certain people, or at certain times, or after following certain rituals, or with the proper artifact.

In some cases, physical travel is not even possible, and the character in our reality travels in a dream or some other [[altered state of consciousness]]. Examples include the ''[[Dream Cycle]]'' stories by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] or the ''[[Thomas Covenant]]'' stories of [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]. Often, stories of this type have as a major theme the nature of reality itself, questioning if the dream-world can have the same "reality" as the waking world. Science fiction often employs this theme (usually without the dream-world being "another" universe) in the ideas of [[cyberspace]] and [[virtual reality]].

===Between the worlds===
[[Image:Šachovnice.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' -- and the parallel universe [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] found there]]
Most stories in this mold simply transport a character from the real world into the [[fantasy world]] where the bulk of the action takes place. Whatever gate is used &amp;ndash; such as the tollbooth in ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' by [[Norton Juster]], or the mirror in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' &amp;ndash; is left behind for the duration of the story, until the end, and then only if the protagonists will return.

However, in a few cases the interaction between the worlds is an important element, so that the focus is not on one world or the other, but on both, and their interaction. After [[Rick Cook]] introduced a computer programmer into a [[high fantasy]] world, his ''[[Rick Cook#Wizardry series|Wizardry]]'' series steadily acquired more interactions between this world and ours. In [[Aaron Allston]]'s ''[[Aaron Allston#Doc Sidhe|Doc Sidhe]]'' our "grim world" is paralleled by a "fair world" where the elves live and history echoes ours. A major portion of the plot deals with preventing a change in interactions between the worlds. [[Margaret Ball (writer)|Margaret Ball]], in ''No Earthly Sunne'', depicts the interaction of our world with Faerie, and the efforts of the Queen of Faerie to deal with the slow drifting apart of Earth and Faerie. [[Poul Anderson]] depicts Hell as a parallel universe in ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'', and the need to transfer equivalent amounts of mass between the worlds explains why a [[changeling]] is left for a kidnapped child. Interactions between magical and scientific universes, and the protagonists' attempts to restore and maintain the balance between them, are major plot points in [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Apprentice Adept]]'' series; he depicts two worlds, the "SF" planet Proton and the fantasy-based Phaze, such that every person born in either world has a physical duplicate on the other world. Only when one duplicate has died can the other cross between the worlds. Several of his ''[[Xanth]]'' novels also revolve around interactions between the magical realm of Xanth and "[[mundane|Mundania]]".

Multiple worlds, rather than a pair, increase the importance of the relationships. In ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', there are only our world and [[Narnia]], but in other of C. S. Lewis's works, there are hints of other worlds, and in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', the [[Wood between the Worlds]] shows many possibilities, and the plot is governed by transportation between worlds, and the effort to right problems stemming from them. In [[His Dark Materials]] by [[Philip Pullman]], the two protagonist Lyra and Will find themselves lost amongst many worlds, and travel them looking for the other. In [[Andre Norton]]'s [[Witch World]], begun with a man from Earth being transported to this world, gates frequently lead to other worlds – or come from them. While an abundance of illusions, disguises, and magic that repels attention make certain parts of Witch World look like parallel worlds, some are clearly parallel in that time runs differently in them, and such gates pose a repeated problem in Witch World. In the radio sitcom ''[[Undone (radio series)|Undone]]'', the main character, Edna Turner, prevents people from a parallel version of [[London]] called "Undone" from moving to London and making the city too weird. There are other parallel versions of London, and one of the main plots in the series is the attempt by The Prince to unite all versions of London together. Travel between the [[many-worlds interpretation|manyworlds]] is the central conceit of [[Ian McDonald (British author)|Ian McDonald]]'s ''[[Everness (series)|Everness]]'', where the protagonist travels to a parallel London in a world without fossil fuels.

[[Linking room]]s of various types (not all actual rooms) can hook together any number of worlds. The characters may chose only one, but the choice is all important in determining the worlds.

===Fantasy multiverses===
The idea of a [[multiverse]] is as fertile a subject for fantasy as it is for science fiction, allowing for epic settings and godlike protagonists. Among the most epic and far-ranging fantasy "multiverses" is that of [[Michael Moorcock]].  Like many authors after him, Moorcock was inspired by the [[many worlds]] interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]], saying: {{cquote|It was an idea in the air, as most of these are, and I would have come across a reference to it in ''New Scientist'' (one of my best friends was then editor) ... [or] physicist friends would have been talking about it. ... Sometimes what happens is that you are imagining these things in the context of fiction while the physicists and mathematicians are imagining them in terms of science. I suspect it is the romantic imagination working, as it often does, perfectly efficiently in both the arts and the sciences.''{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}}}
Unlike many science-fiction interpretations, Moorcock's ''[[The Eternal Champion (novel)|Eternal Champion]]'' stories go far beyond [[alternative history]] to include [[mythology|mythic]] and [[sword and sorcery]] settings as well as some worlds more similar to our own. However, the Eternal Champion himself is incarnate in all of them.

[[Roger Zelazny]] used a mythic [[cosmology]] in his ''[[Chronicles of Amber]]'' series. His protagonist is a member of the royal family of Amber, whose members represent a godlike [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] ruling over a prototypical universe that represents Order. All other universes are increasingly distorted "shadows" of it, ending finally at the other extreme, Chaos, which is the complete negation of the prototype. Travel between these "shadow" universes is only possible by beings descended from the blood of this pantheon. Those "of the blood" can walk through Shadow, imagining any possible reality and then walk to it, making their environment more similar to their desire as they go. It is argued between the characters whether these "shadows" even exist before they're imagined by a member of the royal family of Amber, or if the "shadows'" existence can be seen as an act of godlike creation.

In the ''[[World of Tiers]]'' novels by [[Philip José Farmer]], the idea of godlike protagonists is even more explicit. The background of the stories is a multiverse where godlike beings have created a number of [[pocket universe]]s that represent their own desires. Our own world is part of this series, but our own universe is revealed to be much smaller than it appears, ending at the edge of the Solar System.

The term 'polycosmos' was coined as an alternative to 'multiverse' by the author and editor [[Paul le Page Barnett]], best known by the pseudonym John Grant, and is built from [[Greek language|Greek]] rather than [[Latin]] [[morpheme]]s. It is used by Barnett to describe a concept binding together a number of his works, its nature meaning that "all characters, real or fictional [...] have to co-exist in all possible real, created or dreamt worlds; [...] they're playing hugely different roles in their various manifestations, and the relationships between them can vary quite dramatically, but the essence of them remains the same."{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There also are multiverses in the [[Warcraft universe]], ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series, and [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Chrestomanci]]'', ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Deep Secret]]'' books and standalone book ''[[A Sudden Wild Magic]]''.

===Fictional universe as alternative universe===
{{main article|Fictional universe}}
There are many examples of the [[meta-fiction]]al idea of having the author's created universe (or any author's universe) rise to the same level of "reality" as the universe we're familiar with. The theme is present in works as diverse as H.G. Wells' ''[[Men Like Gods]]'', Myers' ''Silverlock'', and Heinlein's ''Number of the Beast''. [[Fletcher Pratt]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] took the protagonist of the [[Harold Shea]] series through the worlds of Norse myth, [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and the ''[[Kalevala]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moorcock|first1=Michael|title=Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy|date=2004|publisher=MonkeyBrain|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=1932265074|page=88|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; – without ever quite settling whether writers created these parallel worlds by writing these works, or received impressions from the worlds and wrote them down. In an interlude set in "[[Kubla Khan|Xanadu]]", a character claims that the universe is dangerous because the poem went unfinished, but whether this was his misapprehension or not is not established.

Some fictional approaches definitively establish the independence of the parallel world, sometimes by having the world differ from the book's account; other approaches have works of fiction create and affect the parallel world: [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', taking place on an astral plane, is populated by the daydreams of mundane people, and in [[Rebecca Lickiss]]'s ''[[Eccentric Circles]]'', an elf is grateful to [[Tolkien]] for transforming elves from dainty little creatures.  These stories often place the author, or authors in general, in the same position as Zelazny's characters in Amber. Questioning, in a literal fashion, if writing is an act of creating a new world, or an act of discovery of a pre-existing world.

Occasionally, this approach becomes self-referential, treating the literary universe of the work itself as explicitly parallel to the universe where the work was created. [[Stephen King]]'s seven-volume ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series hinges upon the existence of multiple parallel worlds, many of which are King's own literary creations. Ultimately the characters become aware that they are only "real" in King's literary universe (this can be debated as an example of [[breaking the fourth wall]]), and even travel to a world – twice – in which (again, within the novel) they meet Stephen King and alter events in the real Stephen King's world outside of the books.  An early instance of this was in works by [[Gardner Fox]] for DC Comics in the 1960s, in which characters from the Golden Age (which was supposed to be a series of comic books within the DC Comics universe) would cross over into the main DC Comics universe. One comic book did provide an explanation for a fictional universe existing as a parallel universe. The parallel world does "exist" and it resonates into the "real world." Some people in the "real world" pick up on this resonance, gaining information about the parallel world which they then use &lt;!--'use to' here is not an error for 'used to'; this comment is to repel well-meaning bots--&gt; to write stories.

[[Robert Heinlein]], in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', quantizes the many parallel fictional universes - in terms of ''fictons''.  A number of fictional universes are accessible along one of the three axes of time which Dr. Jacob Burroughs' "time twister" can access. Each quantum level change - a ''ficton'' - along this time axis corresponds to a different universe from one of several bodies of fiction known to all four travellers in the inter-universal, time travelling vehicle ''Gay Deceiver''.  Heinlein also "[[breaks the fourth wall]]" by having "both Heinleins" (Robert and his wife [[Virginia Heinlein|Virginia]]) visit an inter-universal science-fiction and fantasy convention in the book's last chapter. The convention was convened on Heinlein character [[Lazarus Long]]'s estate on the planet "Tertius" to attract the evil "Black Hats" who pursued the main characters of ''[[The Number of the Beast]]'' through space and time in order to destroy Dr. Burroughs and his invention.  Heinlein continues this literary conceit in ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'', using characters from throughout his science-fictional career, hauled forth from their own "fictons" to unite in the war against the "Black Hats."

Heinlein also wrote a stand-alone novel, ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'', whose two protagonists fall from alternative universe into alternative universe (often naked), and after a number of such adventures die and enter a stereotypically [[Fundamentalist Christian]] Heaven (with many of its internal contradictions explored in the novel). Their harrowing adventures through the universes are then revealed to have been "destruction testing" of their souls by [[Loki]], sanctioned by the Creator person of the Christian God ([[Yahweh]]). The Devil appears as the most sympathetic of the gods in the story, who expresses contempt for the other gods' cavalier treatment of the story's main characters.
 
Thus, ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'' rings in the theological dimension (if only for the purpose of satirizing evangelical Christianity) of parallel universes, that their existence can be used by God (or a number of gods, Loki seems to have made himself available to do Yahweh's dirty work in this novel).  It manages also to have a fictional multiverse angle in that references are made to Heinlein's early SF/fantasy short story "[[They (Heinlein)|They]]," a solipistic tale in which reality is constantly being transmogrified behind the scenes to throw the central character off his guard and keep him from seeing reality as it is, which was set in the same Heinlein fictional universe as ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]''.

===Elfland===
{{main article|Álfheim}}

[[Álfheim|Elfland]], or Faerie, the otherworldly home not only of [[Elf|elves]] and [[Fairy|fairies]] but [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, and other folkloric creatures, has an ambiguous appearance in folklore.

On one hand, the land often appears to be contiguous with 'ordinary' land. [[Thomas the Rhymer]] might, on being taken by the Queen of Faerie, be taken on a road like one leading to Heaven or Hell.

This is not exclusive to English or French folklore. In [[Norse mythology]], Elfland ([[Alfheim]]) was also the name of what today is the Swedish province of [[Bohuslän]]. In the sagas, it said that the people of this petty kingdom were more beautiful than other people, as they were related to the [[elves]], showing that not only the territory was associated with elves, but also the race of its people.

While sometimes folklore seems to show fairy intrusion into human lands – "[[Tam Lin]]" does not show any otherworldly aspects about the land in which the confrontation takes place – at other times the otherworldly aspects are clear. Most frequently, time can flow differently for those trapped by the fairy dance than in the lands they come from; although, in an additional complication, it may only be an appearance, as many returning from Faerie, such as [[Oisín]], have found that time "catches up" with them as soon as they have contact with ordinary lands.

Fantasy writers have taken up the ambiguity. Some writers depict the land of the elves as a full-blown parallel universe, with portals the only entry – as in [[Josepha Sherman]]'s [[Josepha Sherman#Prince of the Sidhe|Prince of the Sidhe]] series or [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''[[Elf Defense]]'' – and others have depicted it as the next land over, possibly difficult to reach for magical reasons – [[Hope Mirrlees]]'s ''[[Lud-in-the-Mist]]'', or [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''. In some cases, the boundary between Elfland and more ordinary lands is not fixed. Not only the inhabitants but Faerie itself can pour into more mundane regions. [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series proposes that the world of the Elves is a "parasite" universe, that drifts between and latches onto others such as Discworld and our own world (referred to as "Roundworld" in the novels). In the young teenage book ''[[Mist]]'' by [[Kathryn James]], the Elven world lies through a patch of mist in the woods. It was constructed when the Elven were thrown out of our world. Travel to and fro is possible by those in the know, but can have lethal consequences.

===Isekai===
{{main|Isekai}}
[[Isekai]], is a subgenre of Japanese fantasy light novels, manga, anime, and video games revolving around a normal person being transported to or trapped in a parallel universe. Often, this universe already exists in the protagonist's world as a fictional universe, but it may also be unbeknownst to them.

==Films==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
The most famous treatment of the alternative universe concept in film could be considered ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which portrays a parallel world, famously separating the magical realm of the [[Land of Oz]] from the mundane world by filming it in [[Technicolor]] while filming the scenes set in [[Kansas]] in [[sepia tone|sepia]]. At times, alternative universes have been featured in small scale independent productions such as Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's ''[[It Happened Here]]'' (1964), featuring an alternative United Kingdom which had undergone [[Operation Sea Lion]] in 1940 and had been defeated and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. It focused on moral questions related to the professional ethics of Pauline, a nurse forced into Nazi collaboration.

Another common use of the theme is as a prison for [[villain]]s or [[demons]]. The idea is used in the first two ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' movies starring [[Christopher Reeve]] where [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] villains were sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]] from where they eventually escaped. An almost exactly parallel use of the idea is presented in the campy cult film ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension]]'', where the "8th dimension" is essentially a "phantom zone" used to imprison the villainous Red Lectroids. Uses in [[horror films]] include the 1986 film ''[[From Beyond (film)|From Beyond]]'' (based on the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] [[From Beyond (short story)|story]] of the same name) where a scientific experiment induces the experimenters to perceive [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] from a parallel universe, with bad results. The 1987 [[John Carpenter]] film ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' is based on the premise that the essence of a being described as [[Satan]], trapped in a glass canister and found in an abandoned church in [[Los Angeles]], is actually an alien being that is the 'son' of something even more evil and powerful, trapped in another universe. The protagonists accidentally free the creature, who then attempts to release his "father" by reaching in through a [[mirror]].

Some films present parallel realities that are actually different contrasting versions of the narrative itself.  Commonly this motif is presented as different points of view revolving around a central (but sometimes unknowable) "truth", the seminal example being [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]''. Conversely, often in [[film noir]] and [[crime film|crime dramas]], the alternative narrative is a fiction created by a central character, intentionally – as in ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' – or unintentionally – as in ''[[Angel Heart]]''. Less often, the alternative narratives are given equal weight in the story, making them truly alternative universes, such as in the [[Germany|German]] film ''[[Run Lola Run]]'', the short-lived British [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[Our House (musical)|Our House]]'' and the [[Great Britain|British]] film ''[[Sliding Doors]]''.

More recent films that have explicitly explored parallel universes are: the 2000 film ''[[The Family Man]]'', the 2001 [[cult movie]] ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', which deals with what it terms a "tangent universe" that erupts from our own universe; ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1993) has the eponymous heroes cross over into a parallel universe ruled by humanoids who evolved from dinosaurs; ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'' (2001) starring [[Jet Li]], in which there is a complex system of realities in which Jet Li's character is a police officer in one universe and a [[serial killer]] in another, who travels to other universes to destroy versions of himself, so that he can take their energy; and ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'' (2004), the main character runs away from a totalitarian nightmare, and he enters into a cyber-afterlife alternative reality. The current  ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' films are set in an alternative universe created by the first film's villain traveling back in time, thus allowing the franchise to be [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] without affecting the continuity of any other ''Star Trek'' film or show. The 2011 science-fiction thriller ''[[Source Code]]'' employs the concepts of quantum reality and parallel universes. The characters in ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', the third installment of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|franchise]], accidentally create a ripple in the time-space continuum and travel into an alternate universe, where the [[Clover (creature)|monster]] and the events in the [[Cloverfield (film)|first film]] transpired. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] has also experimented with this through some of their animated films such as ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' and ''[[Zootopia]]'', where anthropomorphic animals take on the role of (in this case, nonexistent) humans and emulating the latter's characteristics, without abandoning their hereditary own.

==Television==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
The idea of parallel universes have received treatment in a number of television series, usually as a single story or episode in a more general [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] storyline.

The 1990s TV series ''[[Sliders]]'' depicts a group of adventurers visiting assorted parallel universes, as they attempt to find their "home" universe. Included in the 1st season is a universe where the world is stuck in the ice age, with no life anywhere. Another episode includes 'Honest Abe' never to be president, in which the United States loses World War I and World War II, and they are controlled by a senator, and technology is at an all-time low.

One of the earliest television plots to feature parallel time was a 1970 storyline on soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]''. Vampire Barnabas Collins found a room in Collinwood which served as a portal to parallel time, and he entered the room in order to escape from his current problems. A year later, the show again traveled to parallel time, the setting this time being 1841.

A well known and often imitated example is the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode entitled "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]".  The episode introduced an [[Mirror Universe|alternative version of the ''Star Trek'' universe]] where the main characters were barbaric and cruel to the point of being [[evil]].  When the parallel universe concept is [[parody|parodied]], the allusion is often to this ''Star Trek'' episode.  A previous episode for the ''Trek'' series first hinted at the potential of differing reality planes (and their occupants), titled "[[The Alternative Factor]]". A mad scientist from "our" universe, named Lazarus B., hunts down the sane Lazarus A.; resident of an [[antimatter]]-comprised continuum.  His counterpart, in a state of paranoia, claims the double threatens his and the very cosmos' existence. With help from Captain [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], A traps B along with him in a "anti"-universe, for eternity, thus bringing balance to both [[matter]] oriented realms. A similar plot was used in the ''Codename: Kids Next Door'' episode Operation: P.O.O.L..

The mirror universe of ''Star Trek'' was further developed by later series in the franchise. In several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', the later evolution of the mirror universe is explored. A two-part episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', entitled "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]", serves as a [[prequel]], introducing the early developments of the Mirror Universe.

In the 1970s young adult British SF series [[The Tomorrow People]], its second-season episode, ''A Rift in Time'' (March–April 1974) pitted the three telepath core characters and allies against time travelling interlopers from an [[alternative history]] where the [[Roman Empire]] developed the [[steam engine]] in the first century CE, had a technological headstart, did not fragment during the fifth century and underwent accelerated technological development. The Roman eagle standard was planted on the Moon in the fifth century and by its alternative twentieth century, it had mastered interstellar travel, had a galactic empire and time travel. Consequently, the Tomorrow People had to rectify this aberrant timeline by dismantling and disabling the anomalous steam engine.

Multiple episodes of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' use the concept.  In "Parallel Universe" the crew meet alternative versions of themselves: the analogues of Lister, Rimmer and Holly are female, while the Cat's alternative is a dog.  "Dimension Jump" introduces a heroic alternative [[Ace Rimmer|Rimmer]], a version of whom reappears in "Stoke Me a Clipper".  The next episode, "Ouroboros", makes contact with a timeline in which Kochanski, rather than Lister, was the sole survivor of the original disaster; this alternative Kochanski then joins the crew for the remaining episodes.

''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' experienced a Parallel universe where she was a mental patient in ''[[Normal Again]]'' and not really "The Slayer" at all.  In the end, she has to choose between a universe where her mother and father are together and alive (mother) or one with her friends and sister in it where she has to fight for her life daily. In [[The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)]], Cordelia Chase inadvertently created a dystopian alternative reality in which Buffy had never moved from LA to Sunnydale. Her core-universe allies [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]] had become vampires in that timeline.

The plot of the [[Charmed (season 4)|season four]] episode of ''[[Charmed]]'', entitled "Brain Drain", features [[The Source (Charmed)|The Source of All Evil]] kidnapping Piper Halliwell and forcing her into a deep coma, where she experiences an alternative reality in which the Halliwell manor is actually a mental institution. She and her sisters serve as patients in this universe, their powers only a manifestation of their minds, a ruse put up to trick Piper into willingly relinquishing the sisters' magic.

The animated series, ''[[Futurama]]'', had [[The Farnsworth Parabox|an episode]] where the characters travel between "Universe 1" and "Universe A" via boxes containing each universe; and one of the major jokes is an extended argument between the two sets of characters over which set were the "evil" ones.

The idea of a parallel universe and the concept of [[déjà vu]] was a major plot line of the first-season finale of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', guest-starring [[Leonard Nimoy]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. The show has gone on to feature the parallel universe prominently.

In the 2010 season of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', the result of characters traveling back in time to prevent the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 apparently creates a parallel reality in which the Flight never crashed, rather than resetting time itself in the characters' original timeline. The show continued to show two "sets" of the characters following different destinies, until it was revealed in the series finale that there was really only one reality created by the characters themselves to assist themselves in leaving behind the physical world and passing on to an afterlife after their respective deaths.

In the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', in the Androids Saga, Future Trunks returns to the past to give Goku medicine to prevent him from dying of a heart disease and warns him of the Androids, in the process creating parallel realities, leading to the appearance of Cell, who killed the same Future Trunks from a different splitting timeline to come back to the main timeline when the Androids are still alive for him to absorb. The Majin Buu Saga later depicts Kaio-Shin Realms and the Afterlife. Its sequel, ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', later features separate universes that are in pairs whose numbers add up to the total number of the universe: 13 in this case. Previously there were 18 universes, but Zen'o (the supreme ruler of the Dragon Ball Multiverse) destroyed 6 of them in a rage. Previously, Daizenshuu 7 stated that the typical Dragon Ball Universe had only 4 galaxies, but ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' effectively retcons this, where Whis says that the universe contains endless galaxies.

The [[anime]] ''[[Turn A Gundam]]'' attempted to combine all the parallel [[Gundam]] universes (other incarnations of the series, with similar themes but differing stories and characters, that had played out at different times since the debut of the concept in the 1970s) of the [[metaseries]] into one single reality.

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Eureka Seven: AO]]'' takes place in a parallel universe that is different from the one in the series' predecessor ''[[Eureka Seven]]''. The ''E7'' series started off in the year 12005, and the ''AO'' world, which takes place in the year 2025, would be the home of the two main characters' son.

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Katekyo Hitman Reborn!]]'' by Akira Amano features this idea in its third main arc, known as Future arc.

The anime ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' features a parallel world in one of the final episodes. This parallel world is a sharp contrast to the harsh, dark "reality" of the show and presents a world where all the characters enjoy a much happier life. This parallel world would become the basis for the new Evangelion manga series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]''.

The anime series ''[[Bakugan]]'' features a parallel universe called Vestroia and is the homeworld of fantastic creatures called Bakugan. The series' hero Dan Kuso alongside his friends and teammates must save Earth and Vestroia from total destruction. Season 2 &amp; 3 feature another universe where Dan and his team save the day. They go to another dimension or universe through a pathway. The other universe has also other life forms and other types of technology.

In another anime series, ''[[Digimon]]'', there is parallel universe called "digital world". The show's child protagonists meet digital monsters, or digimon, from this world and becomes partners and friends. In the third story arc of ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'', the Clockmaker (who is later revealed to be Bagramon) and his partner Clockmon travel through space-time to recruit heroes from previous series so they can help the Fusion Fighters to defeat Quartzmon before DigiQuartz can absorb each human and digital world in the multiverse.

In the anime series ''[[Umineko no Naku Koro ni]]'' the rounds of the battle between Battler and Beatrice take place in different dimensions, in order to show all kinds of possibilities (much to Battler's dismay) also the character Bernkastel is known for her ability to travel into different worlds by the usage of "fragments".

In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Parallels]]", Lt. [[Worf]] traveled to several parallel universes when his shuttlecraft went through a time space fissure.

The ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' episode [[Remedial Chaos Theory]], six different timelines and one "prime" timeline are explored, each having a different outcome based on which member of the study group goes to get the [[pizza]]. One timeline, dubbed the "Darkest Timeline", results in the greatest amount of terrible incidents and ends with Abed donning a felt goatee bearing resemblance to Spock's in "Mirror, Mirror".

In the 2003 anime series of ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist (anime)|Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', there exists a gateway that can be conjured by alchemists that acts as a source of all knowledge and energy; towards the end of the series, it is revealed that this gateway connects the world of the anime with the real world, set during the first decades of the 20th century. It is revealed that the two worlds shared a common history until their histories [[Point of divergence|diverged]], apparently due to the success of alchemy in one world and that of modern physics in the other.

===As an ongoing subplot===
Sometimes a television series will use parallel universes as an ongoing subplot.  ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' elaborated on the premise of the original series' "Mirror" universe and developed multi-episode story arcs based on the premise.  Other examples are the science fiction series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the fantasy/horror series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and the romance/fantasy ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

Following the precedent set by ''Star Trek'', these story arcs show alternative universes that have turned out "worse" than the "original" universe: in ''Stargate SG-1'' the first two encountered parallel realities featured Earth being overwhelmed by an unstoppable [[Goa'uld]] onslaught; in ''Buffy'', two episodes concern a timeline in which Buffy came to [[Sunnydale]] too late to stop the vampires from taking control; ''Lois &amp; Clark'' repeatedly visits an alternative universe where [[Clark Kent]]'s adoptive parents, [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], died when he was ten years of age, and [[Lois Lane]] is also apparently dead.  Clark eventually becomes Superman, with help from the "original" Lois Lane, but he is immediately revealed as Clark Kent and so has no life of his own.

In addition to following ''Star Trek's'' lead, showing the "evil" variants of the main storyline gives the writers an opportunity to show what is at stake by portraying the worst that could happen and the consequences if the protagonists fail or the importance of a character's presence.

''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' often talks about alternative realms or universes in which all different forms of magic, and non-magic may occur, depending on the realm. According to the Mad Hatter (Sebastian Stan), they "touch each other in a long line of lands, each just as real as the last." He referred to our world's tendency to deny such things as arrogant.

In the season 1 finale of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]] opens a singularity that connects his world to a parallel universe called Earth-2. In the second season, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] starts facing villains from that earth who also have doppelgangers on Prime Earth sent by [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]. The array of Earth-2 villains consists of [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], Sand Demon, [[King Shark]], and [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Dr. Light]]; all are sent by Zoom to kill The Flash with the assurance of being taken back home. However, they are not the only ones who arrive from the singularity; this also includes the [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Earth-2 Flash]] after a close death and loss of speed from a confrontation with Zoom. When the Earth-2 Flash (called Jay Garrick) introduces himself to Team Flash, Barry (The Flash) distrusts him at first and places him in the metahuman pipeline at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]. When The Flash starts having a hard time facing off against Sand Demon, he frees Jay so that he could help him as well as train him in his speed. With a new trick taught by Jay, Barry defeats Sand Demon. Later on, the Earth-2 counterpart of the Reverse-Flash, [[Harrison Wells]], arrives in Prime Earth as well. He steals a weapon from Mercury Labs and saves Barry from the Earth-2 King Shark. When Jay confronts and sees Wells again, the argument gets heated between them before Barry intercedes.

The "Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon" series, created by artist Mr Doodleburger, uses footage from the Australian TV drama show [[Home and Away]], but through the use of clever overlaid audio tracks, casts one of the main characters of the show, long running character [[Alf Stewart]] as a vicious violent character in a parallel version of Home and Away.

===Television series involving parallel universes===
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
There have been a few series where parallel universes were central to the series itself.
* ''[[The Fantastic Journey]]'', in which several travelers lost in the Bermuda Triangle find themselves in another world
* ''[[Otherworld (TV series)|Otherworld]]'', in which a family gets trapped in an alternative world
* ''[[Sliders]]'', where a young man invents a worm-hole generator that allows travel to "alternative" Earths.  Several characters travel across a series of "alternative" Earths, trying to get back to their home universe
* ''[[Parallax (TV series)|Parallax]]'', in which a boy discovers portals to multiple parallel universes in his home town
* ''[[Charlie Jade]]'', in which the titular character is accidentally thrown into our universe and is looking for a way back to his own.  The series features three universes - alpha, beta and gamma
* ''[[Awake (TV series)|Awake]]'', where a man switches between realities whenever he goes to sleep: one in which his wife survived a car accident that killed their son, and one in which his son survived but his wife died
* In the TV series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', a main element of the series is the loss of balance and the eventual collision of two universes and the moral ramifications of it. Most main characters have a doppelganger who is usually slightly different from their prime selves.
* In the South Korean Drama ''[[Dr. Jin]]'' (2012), the concept of parallel universes was used. A doctor travels into the past, specifically, the Joseon era, and this results in major changes in history.
* ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', in which there is an infinite number of realities and universes.
* ''[[Stranger Things]]'', in which a small town becomes home to a gateway between dimensions.
* ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', in which Barry Allen travels to multiple parallel universes in the multiverse with the help of his super speed.
* ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', in which several episodes deal with parallel universes, particularly [[Supernatural (season 13)|the thirteenth season]] which features storylines centering around parallel universes known as Apocalypse World and The Bad Place which appears in the [[backdoor pilot]] to the proposed spinoff ''Supernatural: Wayward Sisters''. Apocalypse World is depicted as a dark post-apocalyptic universe where ''Supernatural's'' main protagonists [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] and [[Dean Winchester]] were never born and thus could not stop the end of the world.

==Comic books==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
Parallel universes in modern comics have become particularly rich and complex, in large part due to the continual problem of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] faced by the major two publishers, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. The two publishers have used the [[multiverse]] concept to fix problems arising from integrating characters from other publishers into their own canon, and from having major [[Serial (literature)|serial]] protagonists having continuous histories lasting, as in the case of [[Superman]], over 70 years. Additionally, both publishers have used new alternative universes to re-imagine their own characters. (See ''[[Multiverse (DC Comics)]]'' and ''[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)]]'')

[[DC Comics]] inaugurated its multiverse in the early 1960s, with the reintroduction of [[Golden Age]] superheroes the [[Justice Society of America]] now located on [[Earth-Two]], and devised a "mirror universe" scenario of inverted morality and supervillain domination of [[Earth-Three]] shortly afterward, several years before ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' devised its own darker alternative universe. There was a lull before DC inaugurated additional alternative universes in the seventies, such as Earth-X, where there was an [[Axis victory in World War II]], Earth-S, home to the [[Fawcett Comics]] superheroes of the forties and fifties, such as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and Earth-Prime, where superheroes only existed in fictional forms.

Therefore, comic books in general are one of the few entertainment mediums where the concept of parallel universes are a major and ongoing theme. DC in particular periodically revisits the idea in major [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storylines, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', where Marvel has a series called ''[[What If (comics)|What If...]]'' that's devoted to exploring alternative realities, which sometimes impact the "main" universe's continuity. DC's version of "What If..." is the Elseworlds imprint.

DC Comics series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' heralded the return of the Multiverse. ''52'' was a mega-crossover event tied to ''Infinite Crisis'' which was the sequel to the 1980s ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.  The aim was to yet again address many of the problems and confusions brought on by the Multiverse in the DCU.  Now 52 Earths exist and including some Elseworld tales such as ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', DC's [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[WildStorm]] and an Earth devoted to the [[Charlton Comics]] heroes of DC. ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' and ''Countdown Presents: The Search for [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]'' and the ''Tales of the Multiverse'' stories expand upon this new Multiverse.

Marvel has also had many large crossover events which depicted an alternative universe, many springing from events in the [[X-Men]] books, such as 1981's ''[[Days of Future Past]]'', 1995's ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', and 2006's ''[[House Of M]]''. In addition the [[Squadron Supreme]] is a DC inspired Marvel Universe that has been used several times, often crossing over into the mainstream Universe in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] comic. [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] is an offshoot of the ''[[X-Men]]'' franchise that allows characters to hop from one alternative reality to another, leaving the original, main [[Marvel Universe]] intact. The [[Marvel UK]] line has long had multiverse stories including the [[Jaspers' Warp]] storyline of [[Captain Britain]]'s first series (it was here that the designation [[Earth-616]] was first applied to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]]).

Marvel Comics, as of 2000, launched their most popular parallel universe, the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. It is a smaller subline to the mainstream titles and features [[Ultimate Spider-Man]], [[Ultimate X-Men]], [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] and the [[Ultimates]] (their "Avengers").

The graphic novel [[Watchmen]] is set in an alternative history, in a 1985 where superheroes exist, the Vietnam War was won by the United States, and [[Richard Nixon]] is in his fifth term as President of the United States.  The Soviet Union and the United States are still locked in an escalating "Cold War" as in our own world, but as the Soviet Union invades [[Afghanistan]] in this world and threatens Pakistan, nuclear war may be imminent.

In 1973, [[Tammy (comics)|Tammy]] published ''The Clock and Cluny Jones'', where a mysterious grandfather clock hurls bully Cluny Jones into a harsh alternative reality where she becomes the bullied. This story was reprinted in [[Misty (comics)|Misty]] annual 1985 as ''Grandfather's Clock.''

In 1978, [[Misty (comics)|Misty]] published ''The Sentinels''. The Sentinels were two crumbling apartment blocks that connected the mainstream world with an alternative reality where [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] conquered Britain in 1940.

In 1981, [[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]] published ''Worlds Apart.'' Six girls experience alternative worlds ruled by greed, sports-mania, vanity, crime, intellectualism, and fear. These are in fact their dream worlds becoming real after they are knocked out by a mysterious gas from a chemical tanker that crashed into their school. In 1977 Jinty also published ''Land of No Tears'' where a lame girl travels to a future world where people with things wrong with them are cruelly treated, and emotions are banned.

The parallel universe concept has also appeared prominently in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comic series]] from [[Archie Comics]]. The first and most oft-recurring case of this is another "mirror universe" where Sonic and his various allies are evil or anti-heroic while the counterpart of the evil Dr. Robotnik is good. Another recurring universe featured in the series is a [[perpendicular]] dimension that runs through all others, known as the No Zone. The inhabitants of this universe monitor travel between the others, often stepping in with their Zone Cop police force to punish those who travel without authorization between worlds.

In more recent years, the comic has adapted the alternative dimension from the video games [[Sonic Rush]] and [[Sonic Rush Adventure]], home to Sonic's ally Blaze the Cat. The continuities seen in various other Sonic franchises also exist in the comic, most notably those based on the cartoon series [[Sonic Underground]] and [[Sonic X]]. For some years, a number of other universes were also featured that parodied various popular franchises, such as [[Sailor Moon]], [[Godzilla]], and various titles from [[Marvel Comics]]. Archie has also used this concept as the basis for crossovers between Sonic and other titles that they publish, including [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]] and [[Mega Man]].

The various [[Transformers]] comics also feature the parallel universe concept, and feature the various continuities from different branches of the franchise as parallel worlds that occasionally make contact with each other. Quite notably, the annual [[Botcon]] fan convention introduced a comic storyline that featured [[Cliffjumper]], an [[Autobot]] from the original Transformers series, entering an alternative universe where his fellow Autobots are evil and the [[Decepticons]] are good. This universe is known as the "Shattered Glass" universe, and continued on in comics and text based stories after its initial release.

==Video games==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' after the main protagonist, Link, defeats the dark lord, Ganon, he travels back in time to his childhood. This results in two alternative histories for Hyrule. In one a younger version Link travels to the land of Termina in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]''. In the other Link is no longer present allowing Ganon to return to go on a rampage that forced the gods of Hyrule to flood the world in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]''. There is also a scenario in which Link is killed by Ganon in the final battle, resulting in an alternative history in which Hyrule is put in an era of decline, leading to the events of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dutton|first1=Fred|title=Nintendo Feature: Zelda Timeline Explained|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/|website=Official Nintendo Magazine|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=2 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155115/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/|archivedate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 psychological horror point-and-click adventure game ''[[Dark Seed (video game)|Dark Seed]]'', the main character Mike Dawson discovers a parallel universe by going through his living room mirror.

The [[Kingdom Hearts]] series features a Disney/Square Enix's [[Final Fantasy]] multiverse, in which various worlds are based on Disney films or concepts from the Final Fantasy line. The series also introduces the concepts of different "Realms" corresponding to Light, Darkness, Twilight, and Nothingness.

In the 1999 role-playing game ''[[Outcast (video game)|Outcast]]'', a probe is sent to a parallel universe and is attacked by an "entity". Cutter Slade must escort a team of scientists across to the other world in order to retrieve and repair the damaged probe before the earth is consumed by a black hole.

The ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series revolves heavily around alternate universes. [[Xen]] is a location in the first Half-Life game, accidentally discovered by scientists and described as a border world between dimensions, where the player must travel to stop an alien invasion. Half-Life 2 features a multidimensional empire called [[Combine (Half-Life)|The Combine]] which has successfully conquered Earth and subdued humanity, among countless other universes and species.

In the [[survival horror]] video game series ''[[Silent Hill]]'', the town of Silent Hill fluctuates between the real world, where Silent Hill is seemingly just an ordinary tourist town, the Fog World, which is like the real world, except the town is shrouded in thick fog and is nearly uninhabited except for monsters and a few people, and a dark and dilapidated version of the town called the "Other World".

In the 1993 adventure PC game ''[[Myst]]'', the unnamed protagonist travels to multiple alternative worlds through the use of special books, which describe a world within and transport the user to that world when a window on the front page is touched.

In the 1996 adventure PC game ''[[9: The Last Resort]]'', after resolving several mind-blowing and unique puzzles, the player gets past "The Tiki Guards"; and a door opens up to "The Void" - actually a room to another universe, which houses the entirety of space.

Both titles of the ''When They Cry'' visual novel series (''[[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni|Higurashi]]'' and ''[[Umineko]]'' for short) contain the concept of parallel worlds. These series both involve some kind of murder mystery. As soon as the main character has 'lost', another parallel world, called a Fragment, is chosen to be observed. This continues until the entire mystery is solved.

''[[EarthBound]]'' features many areas of the game that can be considered alternative dimensions. The first is an illusion created by the Mani Mani Statue that transforms the metropolis of Fourside into a bizarre neon metropolis called Moonside, filled with unusual characters and enemies. The second is Magicant, the world of Ness's subconscious that is accessed after obtaining the Eight Melodies. Finally, toward the end of the game, the protagonists arrive at the Cave to the Past, where they travel back in time to the haunting past dimension of the cave to face Giygas.

''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' features a "Magic Potion" item that when used, creates a doorway allowing the player to temporarily access "Subspace"; a mirrored silhouette version of the world where items can be found.

After the completion of the Special World in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', the overworld transforms from a green-colored springtime to an orange-colored autumnal setting. Many enemies encountered in the game are transformed into bizarre counterparts.

''[[Super Mario 64]]'' features a world called "Tiny Huge Island" which has two variants: one scaled up, the other scaled down. The player can only access certain parts of the level to obtain certain stars depending on which variant they are into. The two variants can be switched between via portals in the world.

''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' features a world called "Click Clock Wood", which has spring, summer, autumn and winter variants. The environment develops between the seasons making some areas accessible or inaccessible, and actions taken in one season affect the outcome in others.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' features a dark and twisted parallel version of [[Hyrule]] called the "Dark World".

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages]]'' use a similar concept to that which is used in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''. In those games, the player must switch between the parallel past and present worlds (Ages) and between spring, summer, autumn and winter (Seasons) to progress through the game.

In the first half of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', areas of Hyrule are veiled by the Twilight Realm. These areas are dusky and brooding in appearance, Link cannot transform out of wolf form, characters only appear as spirits that cannot be communicated with, and enemies are twilight variations of their regular forms. Otherwise, the Twilight Realm is identical to regular Hyrule.

[[Resistance: Fall of Man]] is set in alternative universe where Tsarist [[Russia]] never experienced the [[Russian Revolution]] but instead became the bridgehead for an aggressive [[alien invasion]] from a species known as the "Chimera", who then proceed to overrun [[Western Europe]], [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]] and much of the [[United States]], and where there has been no Second World War as a result. The events of the game and its sequels begin in its alternative 1951.

Each Zone in ''[[Sonic CD]]'' has four variations: Past, Present, Bad Future and Good Future, each displaying some subtle and not-so subtle alterations. The series has also seen alternative dimensions in the case of the ''[[Sonic Rush]]'' series, in which Sonic encounters a hero from another world named Blaze the Cat whose nemesis is an alternative counterpart of his own foe, Dr. Eggman. The ''Sonic'' series also makes use of the concept of alternative timelines.

The story of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' centers around travel between two alternative timelines, the original or "Another World"  and "Home World" which is a [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch]] created by the actions of the heroes of the game's predecessor, ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''.

In ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', the town "Flipside" (which acts as the game's central hub) has an alternative mirrored version called "Flopside". While Flipside appears pristine and the residents there are typically cheerful, Flopside appears somewhat dilapidated and is populated by surly characters.

The series ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' is played through several realms and timelines.

''[[Sudeki]]'' is set in a realm of light and a parallel realm of darkness.

''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' features an alternative hellish world called "Oblivion", as well as a painting you can climb into and a quest where you enter a dream world.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' takes place in Termina, a parallel world to [[Hyrule]]. Almost all of the characters from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reappear in the game.

''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' pivots around a world of darkness you travel to when you die, which is occupied by World War 1 soldiers.

''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'' involves a world, "Aether", having an alternative self in the, "Dark" realm, universe, or dimension. The protagonist, Samus, finds out that she just dropped into a hopeless war for the Luminoth, the dominant species of Light Aether against the Ing, the dominant species of Dark Aether. She also finds her counterpart, Dark Samus or Metroid Prime's essence inside Samus's Phazon Suit.

''[[Crash Twinsanity]]'' features Crash, Cortex, and Nina traveling to the "10th dimension," which could also be a parallel universe (suggested by the theme and how everything seems to be opposite).

''[[Minecraft]]'' features an alternative dimension called "The Nether", that includes a 'hell' like theme. It also contains a second alternative dimension called "The End", home world of the Endermen, a type of monster that spawns rarely in the main world.

''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]'' takes place in an alternative universe called "This Side" where in the events of Innocent Sin did not take place and the characters have never met in the past.

The ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series takes place in a subtly different universe. For example, the ship that landed the first men on the moon in 1969 is called ''Valiant 11'', rather than [[Apollo 11]]. This universe diverged from ours after [[World War II]], which resulted in a lack of advanced computers, the Cold War, VHS, etc.

The MMORPG ''[[City of Heroes]]'' features a Player vs Player (PvP) zone called Recluse's Victory. It is an alternative future in a constant state of flux, as heroes and villains battle for the future of Earth.

In the text-based science fiction MMORPG ''[[OtherSpace]]'', refugees from Earth's universe were forced to migrate to a parallel universe called ''Hiverspace'', whose quantum divergence occurred billions of years in the past, after damage to the time/space continuum began to tear their own universe apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Wes Platt]] |title=Otherspace: Down to Earth Chronicle |year=2012 |publisher= |page=139 |quote= ..."You did not 'jump' in time. You have jumped dimensions." Nix clarifies. "Hiverspace's timeline is obviously different from you own. ... Our universe, our Orion Arm, was destroyed by untold number of black holes created by a young Kamir not in control of his own powers. The rest of the Kamir gathered as many people from our universe as possible and rifted us all here. Our universe is gone, but it sound like your version of Normalspace still exists, not destroyed by some cataclysmic event. Such is similar for many others who have been brought here. You are just the newest in a long list that ever growing. But, I am not surprised that you were brought here by Kamir-influenced artifacts. In fact, I would be less surprised if you were not."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, they were able to find a means back to a past universe whose quantum divergence from their original ones was relatively minor.

2011 action-adventure video game ''[[Portal 2]]'' features a game-mode entitled "Perpetual Testing Initiative" (PeTI), where a plot item features protagonist "Bendy" through thousands of different worlds of which character Cave Johnson exist in different roles entitled "The Multiverse", and the PeTI's parallel universes are different from the main Half-Life/Portal timeline.

The 2012 visual novel/puzzle video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' heavily uses the concept of multiple realities as the basis for its plot as well as its central gameplay mechanic of traversing through realities and altering history.

The 2013 first person shooter ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' features the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. The main character is named Booker Dewitt, an homage to physicist ''[[Bryce DeWitt]]''.

The world of the classic cult adventure games of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' created by Ragnar Thornqast, along with its sequels, deals with the existence of two parallel universes&amp;nbsp;– technological (Stark) and magical (Arcadia).

The 2014 crossover video game ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' features the iconic characters of [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. In the game, heroes and villains from ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', and ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]'' have been sucked into a trans-dimensional storm called "Nexus". Stranded in a strange limbo of clashing universes, these combatants are joined by the same fate to battle for dominance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4727">'''Parts stress modelling''' is a method in [[engineering]] and especially [[electronics]] to find an expected value for the rate of [[failure]] of the mechanical and electronic components of a system. It is based upon the idea that the more components that there are in the system, and the greater stress that they undergo in operation, the more often they will fail.

'''Parts count modelling''' is a simpler variant of the method, with component stress not taken into account.

Various organisations have published standards specifying how parts stress modelling should be carried out. Some from electronics are:

* MIL-HDBK-217 (US Department of Defense)
* SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-332&amp; SR-332, Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* HRD-4 ([[British Telecom]])
* SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=SR-1171&amp; SR-1171, Methods and Procedures for System Reliability Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;
* and many others

These "standards" produce different results, often by a factor of more than two, for the same modelled system. The differences illustrate the fact that this modelling is not an exact science. System designers often have to do the modelling using a standard specified by a customer, so that the customer can compare the results with other systems modelled in the same way.

All of these standards compute an expected overall failure rate for all the components in the system, which is not necessarily the rate at which the system as a whole fails. Systems often incorporate [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] or [[fault tolerance]] so that they do not fail when an individual component fails.

Several companies provide programs for performing parts stress modelling calculations. It's also possible to do the modelling with a [[spreadsheet]].

All these models implicitly assume the idea of "random failure". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate, analogous to the process of [[nuclear decay]]. One justification for this idea is that components fail by a process of wearout, a predictable decay after manufacture, but that the wearout life of individual components is scattered widely about some very long mean. The observed "random" failures are then just the extreme outliers at the early edge of this distribution. However, this may not be the whole picture.

All the models use basically the same process, with detailed variations.
* Identify the components in the system
** Such as R123, 10kOhm carbon film resistor
* For each component, determine the '''component model''' to use from the standard
** Such as "resistor, film, &lt; 1 Megohm" or "Connector, multi-pin"
* From the standard's component model, discover what, if any, '''complexity''' parameter is needed, and find the value of that parameter for this component
** Such as pin count for a connector or gate count for a chip
* From the standard's component model, discover what '''thermal stress curve''' applies, and find the value of the '''temperature''' in operation for this component
** The failure rate of connectors may change little with temperature, while that of capacitors may change greatly
* From the standard's component model, discover what, if any, '''part stress''' parameter is needed, what '''part stress curve''' applies, and find the value of that part stress parameter for this component in this application
** A part stress might be the applied power as a fraction of the component's rated power, or the applied voltage as a fraction of the rated voltage
* From the standard's component model, find the '''base failure rate''' for this component, and modify that according to the complexity parameter, the [[operating temperature]] and thermal stress curve, the part stress parameter and part stress curve, with arithmetic specified by the standard. This now is the expected failure rate for this component in this application
* Add up all the results for every component in the system to find the overall failure rate for all components in this system.

Other global modification parameters can be employed, which are assumed to have the same effect on every component failure rate. The most usual are the environment, such as '''ground benign''' or '''airborne, commercial''', and the purchasing quality assurance process. The standards specify overall multiplier factors for these various choices.

The top section is a cross-sectional view with bordered pits shown between adjacent cells, and the bottom section is a radial view with numerous bordered pits shown.]]

'''Pits''' are thin portions of the [[cell wall]] that adjacent [[cell (biology)|cell]]s can [[Cell communication|communicate]] or exchange fluid through. Pits are characteristic of cell walls with [[Cell wall#Rigidity of cell walls|secondary layers]]. Generally each pit has a complementary pit opposite of it in the neighboring cell. These complementary pits are called "pit pairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Introduction to Plant Cell Development |author= Jeremy Burgess |edition= |publisher= CUP Archive |year= 1985 |isbn= 9780521316118 |page= 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pits are composed of three parts: the pit chamber, the pit aperture, and the pit membrane. The pit chamber is the hollow area where the secondary layers of the cell wall are absent. The pit aperture is the opening at either end of the pit chamber. The pit membrane is the primary cell wall and [[middle lamella]], or the membrane between adjacent cell walls, at the middle of the pit chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Esau's Plant Anatomy: Meristems, Cells, and Tissues of the Plant Body: Their Structure, Function, and Development |author= Ray F. Evert |edition= third, illustrated |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2006 |isbn= 9780470047378 |page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary cell wall at the pit membrane may also have depressions similar to the pit depressions of the secondary layers. These depressions are primary pit-fields, or primary pits. In the primary pit, the primordial pit provides an interruption in the primary cell wall that the [[plasmodesmata]] can cross. The primordial pit is the only aperture in the otherwise continuous primary cell wall.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of Seed Plants |series=Plant Anatomy |edition=2nd |author=Katherine Easu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=51 |year= 1977 |isbn=0-471-24520-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pit pairs are a characteristic feature of the [[xylem]], as [[sap]] flows through the pits of xylem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Three-dimensional Structure of Wood: A Scanning Electron Microscope Study; Volume 2 of Syracuse wood science series |author= B. A. Meylan, Brian Geoffrey Butterfield |edition= illustrated |publisher= Syracuse University Press |year= 1972 |isbn= 9780815650300 |page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of pits==
[[File:Simple Pit Pair.jpg|thumb|A simplified diagram of a simple pit pair]]

Though pits are usually simple and complementary, a few more pit variations can be formed:

*Simple pits: A pit pair in which the diameter of the pit chamber and the diameter of the pit aperture are equal.

*Bordered pits: A pit pair in which the pit chamber is over-arched by the cell wall, creating a larger pit chamber and smaller pit aperture.

*Half bordered pits: A pit pair in which a bordered pit has a complementary simple pit. Such a pit pair is called half bordered pit pair.

*Blind pits: A pit pair in which a simple pit has no complementary pit.

*Compound pits: A pit pair in which one cell wall has a large pit and the adjacent cell wall has numerous, small pits.

==Plasmodesmata==
{{Main|Plasmodesma}}

Plasmodesmata are thin sections of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] that traverse pits and connect adjacent cells. These sections provide an avenue of transport through the pits and facilitate communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Introduction to Plant Structure and Development: Plant Anatomy for the Twenty-First Century |author= Charles B. Beck |edition= second, revised |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2010 |isbn= 9781139486361 |page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmodesmata are not restricted to pits however, as plasmodesmata often cross a cell wall of constant width and occasionally the cell wall is even wider in areas where plasmodesmata traverse it.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

==Torus and margo==
[[File:Torus and Margo.png|thumb|A simplified diagram of a bordered pit-pair with a torus and margo. The top shows an unobstructed pit and the bottom shows an aspirated pit, with the margo flexing under stress.]]
The torus and margo are characteristic features of bordered pit-pairs in [[gymnosperms]], such as [[Coniferales]], ''[[Ginkgo]]'', and ''[[Gnetales]]''. In other [[vascular plants]], the torus is rare. The pit membrane is separated into two parts: a thick impermeable torus at the center of the pit membrane, and the permeable margo surrounding it. The torus regulates the functions of the bordered pit, and the margo is a cell wall-derived porous membrane that supports the torus. The margo is composed of bundles of [[microfibril]]s that radiate from the torus.&lt;ref name=PlantAnat/&gt;

The margo is flexible and can move towards either side of the pit while under stress. This allows the thick, impermeable torus to block the pit aperture. When the torus is displaced so that it blocks the pit aperture, the pit is said to be aspirated.

A '''protonema''' (plural: '''protonemata''') is a thread-like chain of cells that forms the earliest stage (the [[haploid]] phase) of the life cycle of [[Moss|mosses]] and [[liverworts]]. When a moss first grows from the [[spore]], it start as a ''germ tube'' which lengthens and branches into a filamentous complex known as a ''protonema'', which develops into a leafy [[gametophore]], the adult form of a [[gametophyte]] in [[bryophyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.anbg.gov.au/bryophyte/life-cycle-in-nutshell.html Life Cycle - in a nutshell - bryophyte]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moss spores germinate to form an [[algae]]-like filamentous structure called the protonema. It represents the juvenile [[gametophyte]]. While the protonema is growing by apical cell division, at some stage, under the influence of the [[phytohormone]] [[cytokinin]], [[bud]]s are induced which grow by three-faced apical cells. These give rise to [[gametophore]]s, stems and leaf like structures (bryophytes do not have true leaves ([[megaphyll]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reski|first=R.|date=1998|title=Development, Genetics and Molecular Biology of Mosses|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1438-8677.1998.tb00670.x/abstract|journal=Botanica Acta|language=en|volume=111|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.1998.tb00670.x|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protonema are characteristic of all mosses and some liverworts but are absent from hornworts.

Protonemata of mosses are composed of two cell types: '''chloronemata''', which form upon germination, and '''caulonemata''', which later differentiate from chloronemata and on which buds are formed, which then differentiate to [[gametophore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Psychopathia Sexualis''''' (''Psychopathy of Sex''), by [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]], is one of the first texts about sexual pathology. First published in 1886 in [[German language|German]] with the subtitle "with Special Reference to the Antipathic Sexual Instinct: A Medico-Forensic Study", the book details a wide range of [[paraphilia]]s, with a special emphasis on male homosexuality (the "antipathic instinct" of the subtitle). Krafft-Ebing also coined the terms [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism and masochism]] in the book.

The ''Psychopathia Sexualis'' is notable for being one of the earliest works on [[homosexuality]]. Krafft-Ebing combined Karl Ulrichs' [[Urning]] theory with [[Bénédict Morel]]'s theory of disease and concluded that most homosexuals have a [[mental illness]] caused by degenerate heredity. The book was controversial at the time, arousing the anger of the church in particular.

The book had a considerable influence on continental European forensic psychiatry in the first part of the 20th century. It is regarded as the bible of psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=

In 2006, an [[independent film]] based on the book was made in [[Atlanta]].

The '''Science and Engineering Challenge''' [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|(SEC)]] is a non-profit, [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] outreach program run throughout the schools year in [[Australia]]. The goal of the program is to challenge student’s perception of science and engineering and experience aspects of those fields that they normally would not encounter in a school environment.&lt;ref name="Challenge Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-engineering-and-built-environment/science-and-engineering-challenge|title=About Us|date=19 November 2014|website=Newcastle.edu.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] focuses on inspiring students in year 10 to consider a future career in science and engineering by choosing to study science and mathematics in years 11 and 12. The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] also includes other events such as Discovery Days and the [https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-science-and-information-technology/community-outreach/smart S.M.A.R.T] outreach program.

==History==
The SEC began at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] as an initiative of the Faculties of Engineering and Built Environment, and Science and Information Technology. Initially, information nights were conducted aimed at giving students and parents from rural areas the opportunity to find out about careers in science and engineering.  Based on the success of these information nights, the first SEC event was held on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] in the year 2000, as an activity for [[National Science Week]]. Throughout 2001, events were held around the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] area and other parts of [[NSW]].

2002 saw the first Challenge Days held outside of [[NSW]], this took place in [[Canberra]]. Over the next three years, Challenge Days were conducted in [[Queensland]], [[Tasmania]], [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In 2005 the winners from each state competed at the first National Final.

In 2017 there were 110 SMART events, 49 Discovery Days for primary-aged students, and 99 Challenge Days for year 9-10 students. Overall more than 50,000 people were involved in one or more SEC programs. Almost 2,100 teachers and 3,600 other volunteers were also involved.
Since 1998 over half a million people have taken part in a SEC event.

== Discovery Days ==

In 2005 the Challenge expanded yet again to include events for primary school students, called Discovery Days. These are largely the same as regular challenge events; however, the actives are simplified and typical run for a shorter period of time.

== Programs ==

#The Little Scientists program: Train preschool teachers to incorporate STEM into their lessons
#SMART program of science shows and workshops: Infants and Primary-aged students
#Discovery Days: Mini-Challenge Days for students in years 5-6
#Build a Future Days: A fascinating on-campus experience for year 7-8 students
#Challenge Days (our premier event): National STEM competition for year 9-10 students
#Casual work and Internships with the SEC Team
#Teacher Professional Development: For School Teachers

'''SiMERR Australia''' is an Australia-wide research body. Its National Centre is located at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], NSW, [[Australia]].

SiMERR Australia's main goal is to improve learning outcomes for students in regional and rural areas, particularly in the areas of [[science]], [[mathematics]] and [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_aims.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The National Centre of Science, ICT, and Mathematics Education for Regional and Rural Australia (SiMERR) grew out of the Centre for Cognition Research into Learning and Teaching (CRiLT), which was part of the School of Education at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_history.php&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike CRiLT, SiMERR focused on the curriculum areas of science, mathematics and ICT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

SiMERR opened its doors on 1 July 2004, with branches, or ''hubs'' opening in each state of Australia in the twelve months that followed in partnership universities, such as the [[University of Tasmania]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simerr.educ.utas.edu.au/launch.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts-ed/education/simerr/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deakin University]] in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts-ed/education/simerr/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The SiMERR National summit in 2005 brought together educators and other stakeholders for the first national meeting of its kind since the National Centre opening. The two-day summit brought together people from diverse bodies, such as teacher associations, Federal Government departments, universities, parent groups and educational authorities. Delegates discussed ways in which the educational disadvantage experienced by students in rural and regional areas may be addressed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/news/archives/000374.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
SiMERR Australia consists of a series of ''hubs'' located in each state in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/partnerships_hubs.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
SiMERR Australia's vision is to work to improve outcomes for students in science, ICT and mathematics so that:
* Parents can send their children to rural and regional schools and know they will experience equal opportunities for a quality education;
*Students can attend rural or regional schools and realise their academic potential in Science, ICT and Mathematics; and
*Teachers can work in rural and regional schools and be professionally connected and supported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_aims.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB)''' is an international association co-founded in 1972 in USA by Drs.[[George Karreman]], [[Herbert Daniel Landahl]] and (initially chaired) by [[Anthony Bartholomay]] for the furtherance of joint scientific activities between [[Mathematics]] and [[Biology]] research communities,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.org/governance/smb_history.shtml|title=SMB &amp;ndash; "Childhood, Boyhood, Youth."|last=Conrad|first=Michael|date=September 1996|publisher=Society for Mathematical Biology Newsletter|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smb.org/governance/history.shtml History of SMB&lt;/ref&gt; The society publishes the [https://www.springer.com/math/biology/journal/11538 "''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology''"] ({{ISSN|1522-9602}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/math/biology/journal/11538|title=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|publisher=Springer New York|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/PKM%20publications/170.pdf "Bulletin of Mathematical Biology—Facts, Figures and

==History of The Society for Mathematical Biology==
The Society for Mathematical Biology emerged and grew from the earlier school of [[mathematical biology|mathematical biophysics]], initiated and supported by the Founder of [[Mathematical biology|Mathematical Biology]], [[Nicolas Rashevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Robert. 1972. "''Tribute to Nicolas Rashevsky''" 1899-1972. ''Progress in Theoretical Biology'' '''2'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.org/governance/smb_history.shtml|title=SMB &amp;ndash; CHILDHOOD, BOYHOOD, YOUTH|last=Conrad|first=Michael|date=September 1996|publisher=Society for Mathematical Biology Newsletter|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the roots of SMB go back to the publication in 1939 of the first international journal of mathematical biology, previously entitled "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x513p402w52w1128/ The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics]"—which was founded by Nicolas Rashevsky, and which is currently published by SMB under the name of "''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x513p402w52w1128/ The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Rashevsky also founded in 1969 the non-profit organization "''Mathematical Biology, Incorporated''"—the precursor of SMB. Another notable member of the [[University of Chicago]] school of mathematical biology was [[Anatol Rapoport]] whose major interests were in developing basic concepts in the related area of [[mathematical sociology]], who cofounded the [[Society for General Systems Research]] and became a president of the latter society in 1965. Herbert D. Landahl was initially also a member of Rashevsky's school of mathematical biology, and became  the second president of SMB in the 1980s; both Herbert Landahl and [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] from Rashevsky's research group were focused on dynamical systems approaches to [[systems biology|complex systems biology]], with the latter researcher becoming in 1980 the president of the [[Society for General Systems Research]]. 
&lt;!---{{Society for General Systems Research Presidents}}---&gt;

==Research and educational activities==
In addition to its research and news publications, the society supports education in: [[mathematical biology]], mathematical biophysics, [[systems biology|complex systems biology]] and [[theoretical biology]] through sponsorship of several topic-focused graduate and postdoctoral courses. To encourage and stimulate young researchers in this relatively new and rapidly developing field of mathematical biology, the society awards several prizes, as well as lists regularly new open international opportunities for researchers and students in this field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smb.org/prizes/index.shtml SMB Mathematical Biology Prize Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Media Equation''' is a general [[communication theory]] that claims that people tend to treat [[Personal computer|computers]] and other [[Broadcast media|media]] as if they were either [[interpersonal communication|real people]] or real places.  The effects of this phenomenon on people experiencing these media are often profound, leading them to behave and to respond to these experiences in unexpected ways, most of which they are completely unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally based on the research of [[Clifford Nass]] and [http://www.stanford.edu/~reeves Byron Reeves] at [[Stanford University]], the theory explains that people tend to respond to media as they would either to another person (by being polite, cooperative, attributing personality characteristics such as aggressiveness, humor, expertise, and even gender) – or to places and phenomena in the physical world – depending on the cues they receive from the media. Numerous studies that have evolved from the research in [[psychology]], [[social science]] and other fields indicate that this type of reaction is automatic, unavoidable, and happens more often than people realize. Reeves and Nass (1996) argue that, “Individuals’ interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and natural, just like interactions in real life,” (p. 5).

==The Media Equation Test (1996)==
Reeves and Nass established two rules before the test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected people to be less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the dependent variable was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.

	Reeves and Nass designed an experiment in which 22 people come to a laboratory and told them they would be working with a computer to learn about random facts of American pop culture. At the end of the session they would ask them to evaluate the computer that they used. They would have to tell Reeves and Nass how they felt about that computer and how well it performed. 20 facts were presented in each session, and participants would answer if they knew “a great deal, somewhat, or very little” about the statement. After the session, participants were tested on the material and told which questions they had answered correctly or incorrectly. This computer, computer #1, then made a statement of its own performance, always stating that it “did a good job”.

	Participants were then divided into 2 groups to evaluate the computer’s performance and participants were asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives. Half of the participants were assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer across the room to evaluate computer#1’s performance.

	The conclusion resulted in evaluations done on computer #1 after testing on computer #1 yielded much more positive responses about the session. Evaluations completed on the other computer after testing on computer #1 resulted in much more varied and more negative responses about the session. For the control, the pen-and-paper questionnaire, the evaluations had similar results to that of evaluations done on computer #2. Respondents felt more comfortable being honest when a different computer or paper asked about the sessions completed on computer #1. It is as if participants were talking behind the computer 1’s back- not being honest to it, but then expressing more honesty to a third party evaluator. Reeves and Nass found that participants had automatic social reactions during the test.

	Reeves and Nass ran the test again but added a voice speaker to both computers that would verbally communicate information to make the human-social theme more explicit. The test resulted in almost exactly the same results. They concluded that people are polite to computers in both verbal and textual scenarios. The respondents did not need much of a cue to respond socially to the computers. The experiment proves that social rules can apply to media and computers can be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally polite to the computer, but the results suggest differently.

==Propositions==
The media equation relies on eight propositions derived from the research:&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

#Everyone responds socially and naturally to media – The media equation applies to everyone regardless of their experience, education level, age, technology proficiency, or cultures.
#Media are more similar than different – Psychologically speaking, a computer is not much different from a television and a sophisticated version of a technology is remarkably similar to a simpler version of the technology. As Reeves and Nass (1996) say, “social and natural responses come from people, not from media themselves,” (p.&amp;nbsp;252). In other words, the media does not make people react the way they do.
#The media equation is automatic – Since the media equation assumes that responses are “social and natural” then these reactions occur automatically without conscious effort. This can occur with minimal prompting.
#Many different responses characterize the media equation – The media equation occurs even with the most passive uses of media. When using any type of media, a person is likely to assign it a personality, pay extra attention to it, or even assess its personality.
#What seems true is more important than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality. A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to remember is that these responses are just part of being human and participating in a communication event.
#People respond to what is present – Despite knowing that the media merely provide a symbolic version of the world, people still tend to respond to what the media ''appears to be'' as if it were real and immediately present. For the most part, people are more concerned with the interpretation of cues or messages they receive, rather than trying to determine the original intention of the message's creators.
#People like simplicity – The need for simplicity and to reduce complexity is an innate human need. People are comfortable with simple. Simplicity indicates a level of predictability that makes people more comfortable.
#Social and natural is easy – When interacting with media, Reeves and Nass (1996) argue, “people should be able to use what comes naturally – rules for social relationships and rules for navigating the physical world,” (p.&amp;nbsp;255). People already know how to function in the natural world (be polite, how to handle difficult personalities) so designers should take these reactions and phenomena into consideration when designing new media.

==Research-based findings==
The assumptions and conclusions of the media equation are based on a rigorous research agenda that relies on objective empirical data using reliable social science research methods. As Reeves and Nass (1996) explain, “Our strategy for learning about media was to go to the social science section of the library, find theories and experiments about human-human interaction – and then borrow…Take out a pen, cross out ‘human’ or ‘environment’ and substitute media. When we did this, all of the predictions and experiments led to the media equation: People’s responses to media are fundamentally social and natural,” (p.&amp;nbsp;251). 
The empirical data to support the media equation is thorough and expansive. Studies have tested a wide variety of communication characteristics with the media – manners, personality, emotion, social roles and form. Below are explanations of some of the more interesting findings that support the media equation.

===Politeness===
Politeness is one measure that researchers have used to study [[human-computer interaction]]. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks a question about themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if it may be a dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Moon, and Carney, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The computer would provide them with a fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions – a pencil and paper evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that participants who were asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, &amp; Carney, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Moon, and Carney, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negativity===
In psychology there is a law of hedonic asymmetry that says evaluations of good and bad are important but not the same; negative experiences tend to dominate. In other words, people tend to dwell on the negative more than the positive.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Responses to negative situations are automatic and require more attention to process than positive experiences. Allocating more resources to process negative information takes away from resources available to process positive information, thus impeding one’s ability to remember events preceding the negative event. The media equation suggests that people have a similar experience when they encounter a negative experience with media. A study was developed to examine the idea that “negative images retroactively inhibit memory for material that precedes them, while they proactively enhance memory for material that follows them,” (Newhagen &amp; Reeves, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;25). In other words, will watching negative images on the news prevent someone from remembering information that they learned just prior to viewing the negative material? And conversely, will they better remember information they received just after viewing the negative material?

In the study,&lt;ref&gt;Newhagen and Reeves, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; researchers created two versions of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20-minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered the second half of the newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.

For a more in depth look at this study, see Newhagen &amp; Reeves, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Newhagen and Reeves, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teammates===
Psychology has demonstrated that being a part of a team has a direct influence on attitude and behavior of team members. Members of a team think they are more similar to each other than people on the outside. There are two main characteristics that define team interactions – identity and interdependence. For a group to become a team the members must identify with each other and exhibit some degree of interdependence on each other. These two characteristics were tested to determine if a computer can be a teammate.

In this study,&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Fogg, Moon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; participants were assigned to one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the participants were allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.
For a more detailed account of this study, see Nass, Fogg, &amp; Moon, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Fogg, Moon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

These are just a few of the many studies that support the media equation. For more in depth reading on this subject and past studies, see the “Further Reading” section at the end of this article.

==Alternative explanations==
Some alternative explanations for the media equation have been proposed.  But, as Nass and Moon (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Nass and Moon, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; argue, these explanations do not add up to the body of empirical evidence that supports media equation.  One explanation is that people attribute human characteristics to computers, also known as [[anthropomorphism]]. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this claim, saying, “Participants in our experiment were adult, [[experienced computer user]]s. When debriefed, they insisted that they would never respond socially to a computer, and vehemently denied the specific behavior they had in fact exhibited during the experiments,” (p.&amp;nbsp;93). A second argument against media equation is that participants are actually responding to the programmers behind the computer. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this argument by citing that studies involving multiple computers generally found differences in interactions from computer to computer. If a person was interacting with the programmer behind the computer, then there would be no difference in interaction between computers. Critics have also argued that the way the experiments and questionnaires were designed in the Stanford research may have predisposed their subjects to interact socially with technology. Nass and Moon (2000) counter-argued by saying that the experiments were not misleading. None of the computers used in the experiments were personalized; the computer never referred to itself as “I” and participants interacted with simple text on a screen.

===Grice's Maxims===
Reeves and Nass explain that [[Paul Grice|H. Paul Grice’s]] [[Cooperative principle|maxims for politeness]] are perhaps the most generally accepted rules on politeness communication and that Grice's rules are a vital basis to explaining the media equation. The four principles consist of Quality, Quantity, Clarity, and Relevance. Reeves and Nass used these principles to help explain how they believed computers could be social actors. Quality refers to how information presented in a conversation should have value, truth, and importance. Quantity refers to how speakers in interaction should present just the right amount of information to make the conversation as useful as possible. Too much or too little information may damage value of information. Reeves and Nass argue that quantity is not something social media executed very well; they feel it causes frustration because computers display too much or too little information to humans when trying to communicate. Relevance refers to the content of information being translated into an interaction- this information should be both relevant and on-topic. Reeves and Nass argue that computers should be customizable so the user has control over relevance, and they observed how computers struggle to respond to wishes or goals of the user.

	Reeves and Nass argue that Grice’s maxims are vital guidelines to the media equation because violations of these rules have a social significance. If one side of social interaction violates a rule, it may come off to the other party as a lack of attention being paid, or a diminishing of the importance of the conversation; in other words, they get offended. This leads to a negative consequence for both the party that violated a rule and to the value of conversation.

'''The Old Malthouse School''' (The '''OMH''') was a [[Preparatory School (UK)|preparatory school]] in the [[village]] of [[Langton Matravers]] near [[Swanage]] in the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Dorset]], [[United Kingdom]].

The school was founded in 1906 by Rex Corbett, an ex-England [[Football(soccer)|football]] player, and started with ten pupils in a building that was formerly a [[brewery]]. Tom Pellatt, his [[brother-in-law]] who ran [[Durnford School]] at Durnford Court in the same village had blasted out a swimming bath in the rocks at [[Dancing Ledge]], a mile and a half away on the coast and the pupils of both schools used this daily in the [[summer term]]. Durnford's most famous former pupil is [[Ian Fleming]], author of the [[James Bond]] novels and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (novel)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''.

In 1939, the [[school]] was sold by Corbett to Victor Haggard (H) and Evan Hope-Gill (Hopper) who inherited 37 boys. Durnford was requisitioned by the army later that year and the Durnford boys transferred to the Old Malthouse. Durnford was acquired by the owners of the Old Malthouse when the army gave it up in 1948. The main buildings were variously pulled down or sold, leaving the OMH with the grounds, which were levelled for playing fields. A third joint headmaster Peter Mattinson (Mr Matt) joined after [[World War II]] and the [[triumvirate]] ruled until 1974 when the school, then with about 80 boys, was sold to a Trust under the headmastership of Quintin Ambler. Ill-health led to Mr Ambler's early departure to be replaced as headmaster by Patrick Jordan in 1975 who expanded the school by adding a pre-prep department in the early 1980s. In 1988, Jon Phillips took over as [[Headmaster]], remaining for 15 years. During this time the school  became fully [[co-educational]]. Richard Keeble became [[Headmaster]] in January 2004 and left the school in July 2006 handing over the reins to longtime deputy Dr Moira Laffey. Through the 1970s and early 80s the school expanded to about 100 pupils but declining enrollment and increasing losses led to the decision to close the school in 2007. 

In April 2007, the local press reported that the school would close at the end of the 2007 summer term

[[File:Zenodo logo.jpg|thumb|]]
'''Siddham''' or the '''Asia Inscriptions Database''' is an open-access resource for the study of inscriptions from South, Central and South East Asia. Siddham was established by the [[European Research Council]] with start-up funding from the project [[Beyond Boundaries: Religion, Region, Language and the State]].  The first focus of Siddham is [[Sanskrit]] [[epigraphy]], mainly of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries CE, but the platform is designed to accommodate inscriptions from all periods. In South Asia alone, the estimated number of historic inscriptions is 90,000.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, Richard. ''Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In its next phases, Siddham will expand to include inscriptions in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]], [[Prakrit]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]] and [[Mon language|Mon]]. 

==Etymology==
In [[Sanskrit]] ''siddhaṃ'' means "success, accomplished, perfected." It was also symbolism and substitution for an "auspicious sign" found in the oldest inscriptions of the South Asia. In some cases, siddham is not spelled out, but indicated with a sign such as ''[[Om]]'' or a ''srivasta'', and various scholars consider ''siddham'' in inscriptions to be equivalent to these signs.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lore Sander (1986), ''Om or Siddham–Remarks on Openings of Buddhist Manuscripts and Inscriptions from Gilgit and Central Asia'', in Deyadharma: Studies in Memory of Dr. DC Sircar, pages 251-261&lt;/ref&gt;

This word, written out in characters (such as those shown in the Siddham logo) or represented by a symbol, often stands at the beginning of inscriptions in Indic languages.&lt;ref name="Salomon1998p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Salomon|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA67 |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Siddham'' is also used as a short name for the Indian script known as [[Siddhaṃ_script|siddhamātṛkā]].

==Technical background==
The records in Siddham have been prepared in [[EpiDoc]], a tool for structured [[markup language|markup]] of [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] documents in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] [[XML]]. 

==Numbering system==
Within Siddham, each item is listed firstly as an object -- such as a pillar, sculpture, copper-plate, stone slab and so forth. Each object may carry one or more inscriptions, thus each inscription has been assigned a separate Siddham number. A good example is the [[Allahabad pillar]] -- a single object -- which carries many inscriptions, among them those of Aśoka, [[Samudragupta]] and Jahāngīr.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Harry. ''Aśokan Sites and Artefacts: A Source-Book with Bibliography''. Mainz am Rhein: Ph. von Zabern, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription of Samdragupta appears in Siddham as IN00001.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://siddham.uk/object/ob00001&lt;/ref&gt; All material generated for SIDDHAṂ is archived in [[Zenodo]].

The further example illustrated here is from [[Salihundam]], Gara Mandal, Srikakulam district, [[Andhra Pradesh]], India, a Buddhist place located approximately at 18°20'7"N 84°2'28"E. At this site, a series of five votive inscriptions are engraved on the semi-circular threshold of a ruined shrine. In Siddham, the semi-circular stone will carry an object number and each votive record an independent inscription number. The photograph of the inscriptions is archived as Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.557032.
[[File:Salihundam votive inscriptions.jpg|thumb|Salihundam, Andhra Pradesh. Votive inscriptions. In SIDDHAṂ the semi-circular threshold will have an object number, and each votive record an inscription number.]]

[[File:Erc-logo.jpg|thumb|]]
==Translations==
Translations of inscription texts into western languages appear separately in the community called '''SIDDHAṂ traductions''' in [[Zenodo]]. Each translation is numbered according to the inscription number assigned in Siddham.

==Mapping==
Epigraphic documentation involves mapping sites of key dynasties and their inscriptions, especially land-charters recording gifts of land. The mapping undertaken to date can be explored through these links:

The '''theory of mediation''', which is the principal referent of the research group of the [http://www.sites.univ-rennes2.fr/las/lirl/pages/niveau1/lirlenglish.html Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Language Research] (L.I.R.L.), is a theoretic model developed at [[Rennes]] (France) since the 1960' by Professor [[Gagnepain Jean|Jean Gagnepain]], linguist and [[Epistemology|epistemologist]]. This model, whose principles Jean Gagnepain has methodically set forth in his three volume study ''On Meaning'' (''Du Vouloir Dire''),&lt;ref&gt;Jean Gagnepain Jean, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eidcPOFI8uwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Du Vouloir Dire I], Bruxelles, De Boeck, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Gagnepain Jean, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_1xqJSorZXAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Du Vouloir Dire II], Bruxelles, De Boeck, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; covers the whole field of the [[human science]]s. One essential feature of the theory is that it seeks to find a kind of experimental verification of its theorems in the clinic of [[psychopathology]]. For this reason, the theory presents itself as a "clinical anthropology".

The theoretic model developed by Gagnepain and his research group at Rennes has inspired the work of professors and researchers in a number of [[European countries]] and in the [[United States]] in a wide variety of disciplinary fields, among them [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[psychology]], [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[theology]]. Its aim is deliberately trans-disciplinary - or, as Gagnepain humorously puts it, the theory of mediation cultivates "in-discipline".

== A theory of culture ==

This model, originally developed with respect to language, today takes for its object the entirety of what is called "the cultural", that is, the dimension that specifies human beings and distinguishes them from other living species. In other words, "the cultural" constitutes the specific order of reality in which only human beings participate. It is the cultural order that permits human beings, while remaining natural beings, to constantly transcend their natural being in abstracting themselves from it.

The theory of mediation understands the cultural order - more simply, culture - not as the totality of the essential works of a society, nor as the general state of a given civilization, but as the ensemble of properly human capacities which, absent pathological conditions, all human beings share regardless of their historical epoch or geographical setting. For the theory of mediation, culture and reason - the "rationality" which philosophers have discussed for centuries - are identical. The human sciences, understood as the theory of mediation understands them, take up in their own distinctive fashion the questions which philosophy has treated only speculatively.

== A clinical anthropology ==

Gagnepain's work shows, on the basis of what the clinic forces us to recognize, that human reason is diffracted. In other words, rationality in human beings has several different forms which the clinic requires us to dissociate. Reason is logical, to be sure, but it is equally and just as fundamentally technical, ethnical, and ethical. There is no hierarchy among these different "planes" or "levels" of rationality that constitute psychic life.

On each of these planes or levels, human being mediate their relations to the world and others (thus the term "mediation"). Unlike the other animals, human beings are not limited to what their immediate physiological capacities allow them to grasp. They can stand back from, or take a distance from, their natural insertion in the world and can elaborate those cultural mediations that are constitutive of a properly human reality.

In Kantian terms, it is a question of passing from a description of an already constituted reason to an explanation of a constituting reason. It is a question, therefore, of accounting for that in human beings which, without their knowing it, makes them capable of posing the world - and of posing it not only in one way, by knowing it, as the traditional analysis holds, but in four different ways on the basis of four different capacities.

To be sure, human beings manifest the world in and across the words they speak : with them, they designate the world and explain it to themselves. In so doing, they realize their logical capacity. Human beings also manifest the world in and across their tools : with them, they fabricate the world and, in doing so, they realize their technical capacity. Human beings likewise manifest the world in originating their histories and societies, realizations not of their logical or their technical capacities but of their ethnic capacity. Finally, human beings manifest the world in the norms and regulations to which they submit their desires. Here is it question of their ethical capacity.

The possible autonomisation of the four planes (or levels or modes) of our rationality is revealed by the clinic. Although "normally" the four modes of our rationality function together in such a way that it is hardly possible to distinguish them, pathologically it does become possible to distinguish them, as, for example, when one mode of rationality ceases to function in an afflicted person whereas the others continue to do so. Each plane of rationality has its specific pathology. The pathology specific to the logical plane is [[aphasia]]; the pathology specific to the technical plane is atechnia ; the pathology specific to the ethnical plane is [[psychosis]] (and [[Paraphilia|perversion]]) ; the pathology specific to the ethical plane is [[neurosis]] (and psychopathic conditions).

In other words, pathology dissociates what normally cannot be distinguished and puts into evidence processes otherwise unseen. In this way, as [[Freud]] recognized, pathology provides a veritable analysis, that is, a breakdown, of the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;"On the other hand, we are familiar with the notion that pathology, by making things larger and coarser, can draw our attention to normal conditions which would otherwise have escaped us. Where it points to a breach or a rent, there may normally be an articulation present. If we throw a crystal to the floor, it breaks; but not into haphazard pieces. It comes apart along its lines of cleavage into fragments whose boundaries, though they were invisible, were predetermined by the crystal’s structure. Mental patients are split and broken structures of this same kind. [...] They have turned away from external reality, but for that very reason they know more about internal, psychical reality and can reveal a number of things to us that would otherwise be inaccessible to us." (S. Freund, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'', lecture XXXI, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Gagnepain therefore makes it a methodological rule "to admit or to impute to a system only those dissociations that are pathologically verifiable."

==Location==

On a site that touches the lower slopes of the lush [[Hanthana mountain range]], University of Peradeniya is known for its natural environment.{{fact|date=July 2018}} It has inspired intellectuals like [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Ediriweera Sarachchandra]], Sri Lanka's premium playwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1604/16040710.htm |title=Symposium: Sri Lanka's Culture Experience – Between Home and the World |publisher=Frontline |year=1999 |accessdate=2011-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092341/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1604/16040710.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is in the [[Central Province of Sri Lanka|Central Province]], 8&amp;nbsp;km from the sacred city of [[Kandy]] (the historic capital of the last kingdom of Sri Lanka) and about 110&amp;nbsp;km from [[Colombo]]. A tourist attraction, [[Botanical Garden of Peradeniya]] is close by.

The university spans nearly 700 hectares in the Mahaweli flood plain. Most of the area remains afforested. Climate around the university is mild, and the temperature fluctuates between 18 and 30 degrees Celsius.

The main entrance to the university is through [[Galaha]] road. The [[Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya|Faculty of Engineering]] is on one side of the [[Mahaweli River]] and all other faculties are on the other side. The Akbar bridge links the two banks of the river. Considered as a marvel of civil engineering, it was designed by late [[Professor|Prof.]] A. Thurairajah (Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, 1975–77 and 1982–85) and built by the first batch of the faculty, in the year of its inception.

The Sarasavi Uyana railway station is on campus. Another bridge known as Yaka Paalama links the railway to the other bank. Daily shuttle bus services operate from Kandy to Galaha junction and Kandy to the university.

A separate subcampus was established in 1968 at Mahailuppallama, [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North Central province]] for the Faculty of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pdn.ac.lk/agri/history/ | title=Faculty of Agriculture sub campus | publisher=Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya | year=2008 | accessdate=2010-05-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127165951/http://www.pdn.ac.lk/agri/history/ | archivedate=27 November 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate residential facilities are provided to this subcampus.

==History==

===Beginnings===

The proposal for the establishment of [[University of Ceylon]], the first university of Sri Lanka (the predecessor of University of Peradeniya) goes back to 1899.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; But no progress was seen until the formation of Ceylon University Association in 1906 under the guidance of Sir [[Ponnambalam Arunachalam]], [[Sir]] [[James Peiris]] and Sir [[Marcus Fernando]]. Its request for a European-style university in Sri Lanka was partially granted by the [[British Ceylon|British rulers]] with the formation of Ceylon University College on 1 January 1921.

The [[University Council]], through which the administration of the Ceylon University College was done, appointed committees to plan the academic activities of a future university.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; It made suggestions to build the university in Bullers Road (now Bauddhaloka Mawatha) in Colombo, but it was disputed by politicians. To resolve the conflict, the then [[Governor]] [[Hugh Clifford]] appointed a committee headed by Justice M.T. Akbar on 20 December 1926. It suggested that the proposed university should be unitary, residential and outside Colombo. Another committee was appointed in 1928 with Sir Walter Buchanan-Riddel as chairman. It proposed a site at [[Aruppola]], in the Dumbara Valley close to [[Kandy]]. [[Dr.]] S.C. Paul and Andreas Nell pointed out disadvantages in the site and proposed a larger one at Peradeniya.

In 1938 the government acquired the plot and developed an area about 150 hectares (out of 700 hectares) to create the University Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.island.lk/2009/04/29/midweek3.html | title=Cambridge by the Mahaweli: Peradeniya University | publisher=The Island | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the site was acquired, no plans were made to establish the university until 1941. With the arrival of Sir [[Ivor Jennings]], as the second principal of the Ceylon University College, establishment plans were put into effect. He stressed the urgent need to move the university to Peradeniya to the Minister of Education [[C. W. W. Kannangara]] and took the initiative in the process. Thus he is considered the forefather of the University of Peradeniya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/ivorj.html | title=First Vice Chancellor of University of Ceylon | publisher=Rootsweb | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1942 to 1952===

In 1942, the [[University of Ceylon]] was created as the first unitary, residential and autonomous university in Sri Lanka with its seat in Peradeniya, amalgamating Ceylon University College and the Medical College into a single unit with 55 academic staff members, 904 students in four faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://acu.studylink.com/display/provider/provider-info.html?pid=pid-mm-01-sri014 | title=University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka: The Association of Commonwealth Universities | publisher=[[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-05-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160317/http://acu.studylink.com/display/provider/provider-info.html?pid=pid-mm-01-sri014 | archive-date=16 July 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.pdn.ac.lk/history.htm | title=Historical Roots | publisher=[[University of Peradeniya library]] | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-05-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818010829/http://www.lib.pdn.ac.lk/history.htm | archivedate=18 August 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But due to [[World War II]], the construction of buildings started in 1946. Until then, the lectures and laboratory classes were conducted in the buildings obtained from the [[Ceylon University College]] and the [[Ceylon Medical College]] in Colombo.

Consultants Sir [[Patrick Abercrombie]] and Clifford Holliday did the planning and layout of the university complex. The first phase of work constituted only the development of the left bank. The building of a bridge across the [[Mahaweli River]], later known as the 'Akbar bridge', was planned by [[Professor|Prof.]] A Thurairajah. Transfer of the first batch of students, students from the Departments of Law and Agriculture and the third and fourth year students of the Department of Veterinary Science, from Colombo to Peradeniya took place in 1949. Another major move took place in 1952, with the transfer of staff and students of the [[Faculty of Arts, University of Peradeniya|Faculties of Arts and Oriental Studies]], together with the [[University of Peradeniya library|Main Library]] and the University Administration. This movement on 6 October 1952 marks the official establishment of University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. At the initial stages, vice chancellor Jennings wanted to model British universities, but met with the resistance of students who opposed the changes.&lt;ref name="kandy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/03/31/fea05.asp | title=Kandy in 1940s and 50s... | publisher=Daily News | year=2009 | accessdate=2011-01-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117130651/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/03/31/fea05.asp | archivedate=17 January 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1952 to 1972===
[[File:A Bridge Inside UoP.JPG|thumb|right|A bridge inside the university.]]
Although the buildings at Peradeniya were established in 1952, the official ceremony for its inception was held on 20 April 1954, with the participation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The Sri Lankan government was keen to postpone the ceremony until Queen Elizabeth II could participate. Her visit was delayed by the death of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]. [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] also participated in the event. He declared the university opened:
{{cquote|You have remarked Mr. Chancellor, that it is not easy to open a university, because once established it is always open. However, like the shopkeepers of London during the bombing, I can declare this place to be "more open than usual..."}}
Sections of the University of Ceylon, functioned in Colombo and Peradeniya acted as campuses of the same university until 1967. In 1967, these campuses were split into two. The section in Peradeniya was known as the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, while the section in Colombo was known as University of Ceylon, Colombo.

===1972 to 1978===
[[File:UoP in May.jpg|thumb|left|The university in spring, the Senate building.]]
By the University Act No. 1 of 1972, four{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} universities functioned a —  Peradeniya, [[University of Colombo|Colombo]], [[Vidyodaya University|Vidyodaya]] and [[University of Kelaniya|Vidyalankara]] and the [[University of Moratuwa|Ceylon College of Technology, Katubedda, Moratuwa]] became five constituent campuses of a single structure — the University of Sri Lanka. It had one vice chancellor and five presidents for five campuses. Under this designation, University of Ceylon - Peradeniya became the University of Sri Lanka - Peradeniya Campus. This designation prevailed until 1978.

=== 1978 to the present ===
Under the Universities Act No. 16, 1978, the University of Sri Lanka was split into six independent, autonomous institutions as University of Peradeniya, [[University of Colombo]], [[University of Sri Jayewardenepura]], [[University of Kelaniya]], [[University of Moratuwa]] and [[University of Jaffna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Universities Act - Part XX |url=http://www.ugc.ac.lk/si/policy/universities-act/46.html |publisher=[[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act brought back some of the central features of the Ceylon University Ordinance of 1942 such as the senates, the councils and courts.

==Governance and administration==
The University of Peradeniya operates under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985. It is a [[Public university|state university]] and the undergraduate study is 100% [[Free education|free]]. Therefore, it depends on the government for much of its annual grant, which is provided by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission (UGC)]]. Due to this, its administration is heavily influenced by the UGC. The administration is based upon that of the former [[University of Ceylon]] consisting of a dual structure of bodies: the Council (formally known as the [[University Court]] which is the governing body) and the [[Academic Senate]] (academic affairs).

The university has eight academic [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] of study. These faculties contain 72 departments. In addition, the university has two postgraduate institutions and six affiliated centres.

[[File:1116 Muscle of the Female Perineum.png |thumb|]]
The '''vaginal support structures''' are those [[muscle]]s, [[bone]]s, [[ligament]]s, [[tendon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, membranes and fascia, of the [[pelvic floor]] that maintain the position of the [[vagina]] within the pelvic cavity and allow the normal functioning of the vagina and other reproductive structures in the female. Defects or injuries to these support structures in the pelvic floor leads to [[pelvic organ prolapse]]. Anatomical and congenital variations of vaginal support structures can predispose a woman to further dysfunction and prolapse later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KuCMWWG8BcC&amp;pg=PA1028&amp;dq=vaginal+rugae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDwJjtiKnZAhVEcq0KHbZxDPQQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=vaginal%20rugae&amp;f=false|title=Key Topics in Critical Care, Second Edition|last=Craft|first=T.

==Pelvic bones==
The support for the vagina is provided by muscles, membranes, tendons and ligaments. These structures are attached to the [[hip bone]]s. These bones are the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] and [[ischium]].The interior surface of these pelvic bones and their [[Epicondyle|projections]] and contours are used as attachment sites for the fascia, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support the vagina. These bones are then fuse and attach to the [[sacrum]] behind the vagina and anteriorly at the [[pubic symphysis]].&lt;ref name = herschorn&gt;{{cite journal  |last = Herschorn | first = Sender  | date = 2004 | title = Female Pelvic Floor Anatomy: The Pelvic Floor, Supporting Structures, and Pelvic Organs | journal = Reviews in Urology | volume = 6 | issue = Suppl 5| pages = S2–S10 | issn = 1523-6161 | pmc = 1472875 | pmid = 16985905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting ligaments include the [[Sacrospinous ligament|sacrospinous]] and [[sacrotuberous ligament]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. The sacrospinous ligament is unusual in that it is thin and triangular.&lt;ref name="herschorn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ect.downstate.edu/courseware/haonline/figs/l13/130304.htm|title=Human Anatomy|last=|first=|date=|website=ect.downstate.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pelvic diaphragm==
The muscular pelvic diaphragm is composed of the bilateral [[levator ani]] and coccygeus muscles and these attach to the inner pelvic surface. The iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus make up the levator ani muscle. The muscles pass behind the rectum. The levator ani surrounds the opening which the urethra, rectum and vagina pass. The pubococcygeus muscle is subdivided inot the pubourethralis, [[pubovaginal muscle]] and the puborectalis muscle. The names describe the attachments of the muscles to the urethra, vagina, anus, and rectum. The names are also called the pubourethralis, pubovaginalis, puboanalis, and puborectalis muscles and sometimes the pubovisceralis since it attaches to  the viscera.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt; &lt;!--The urethral portion forms part of the periurethral musculature, and the vaginal and anorectal portions insert into the vaginal walls, perineal body, and external anal sphincter muscle.4 The puborectalis portion passes behind the rectum and fuses with its counterpart from the opposite side to form a sling behind the anorectum. Other more posterior parts of the pubococcygeus attach to the coccyx."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;
"The thin lateral part of the levator ani is the iliococcygeus muscle, which arises from the arcus tendineus of the levator ani to the ischial spine. Posteriorly it attaches to the last 2 segments of the coccyx. The fibers from both sides also fuse to form a raphe and contribute to the anococcygeal ligament. This median raphe between the anus and the coccyx is called the levator plate and is the shelf on which the pelvic organs rest. It is formed by the fusion of the iliococcygeus and the posterior fibers of the pubococcygeus muscles. When the body is in a standing position, the levator plate is horizontal and supports the rectum and upper two thirds of vagina above it. Weakness of the levator ani may loosen the sling behind the anorectum and cause the levator plate to sag.5 This opens the urogenital hiatus and predisposes to pelvic organ prolapse. Women with prolapse have been shown to have an enlarged urogenital hiatus on clinical examination."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;

"The majority of the strirated muscle fibers in the levator ani are slow-twitch fibers that maintain constant tone with an increased density of fast-twitch (type II) fibers distributed in the periurethral and perianal areas. The levator ani maintains tone in the upright position to support the pelvic viscera and counteracts increased intra-abdominal pressures."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;--&gt;

==Urogenital diaphragm (perineal membrane)==

The urogenital diaphragm, or [[perineal membrane]], is present over the anterior pelvic outlet below the pelvic diaphragm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unifr.ch/ifaa/Public/EntryPage/TA98%20Tree/Entity%20TA98%20EN/09.5.03.002%20Entity%20TA98%20EN.htm|title=membrana perinei|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unifr.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact structure description is controversial. Despite the controversy, MRI imaging studies support the existence of the structure.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;&lt;ref name = snell/&gt;

Superficial and inferior muscles of the perineum (urogenital diaphragm):
* ischiocavernosus 
* bulbocavernosus 
* superficial transverse perinei 
The perineum attaches across the gap between the inferior pubic rami bilaterally and the perineal body. This grouping of muscles constricts to close the urogenital openings. The perineum supports and functions as a sphincter at the opening of the vagina. Other structures exist below the perineum that support the anus.&lt;ref name="herschorn" /&gt;&lt;ref name = snell/&gt;

==Perineal body==
[[File:Bulbospongiosus-Female.png|thumb|The bulbospongiosus muscle is highlighted in red.]]

The perineal body is a pyramidal structure of muscle and connective tissue and part of it is located between the anus and vagina. It is a tendon that is formed at the point where the [[bulbospongiosus muscle]], [[Transverse perineal muscles|superficial transverse perineal muscle]],&lt;ref&gt;Also known as transversus perinaei superficialis.&lt;/ref&gt; and external anal sphincter muscle converge to form this major supportive structure of the pelvis and vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarton|first=Julie|title=Assessment of the Pelvic Floor Muscles in Women with Sexual Pain|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1743609515327594|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=7|issue=11|pages=3526–3529|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02059.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imaios.com/en/e-Anatomy/Anatomical-Parts/Superficial-transverse-perineal-muscle|title=Superficial transverse perineal muscle|website=IMAIOS|language=en|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = suny1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://act.downstate.edu/courseware/haonline/labs/l41/110101.htm|title=Human Anatomy, The Female Perineum, Muscles of the Superficial Perineal Pouch|last=|first=|date=|website=act.downstate.edu|publisher=SUNY Downstate Medical Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Below this, muscles and their fascia converge and become part of the perineal body. The lower vagina is attached to the perineal body by attachments from the pubococcygeus, perineal muscles, and the [[Internal anal sphincter muscles|anal sphincter]]. The perineal body is made up of [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], elastic [[connective tissue]] fibers, and nerve endings. Above the perineal body are the vagina and the uterus. Damage and resulting weakness of the perineal body changes the length of the vagina and predisposes it to rectocele and enterocele.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;&lt;ref name = snell&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5s7jDVQkCfoC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Clinical Anatomy: An Illustrated Review with Questions and Explanations|last=Snell|first=Richard S.|date=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=|isbn=9780781743167|location=|pages=99|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endopelvic fascia and connective tissue==
[[File:Gray236.png|thumb|250px|The internal surface of the ilium showing where the muscles supporting the vagina insert and terminate]]
The vagina is attached to the pelvic walls by endopelvic fascia. The peritoneum is the external layer of skin that covers the fascia. This tissue provides additional support to the pelvic floor. The endopelvic fascia is one continuous sheet of tissue and varies in thickness. It permits some shifting of the pelvic structures. The fascia contains elastic collagen fibers in a 'mesh-like' structure. The fascia also contains fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and vascular vessels. The cardinal ligament supports the apex of the vagina and derives some of its strength from vascular tissue. The endopelvic fascia attaches to the lateral pelvic wall via the arcus tendineus.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;

==Anterior vaginal support==
Not all agree to the amount of supportive tissue or fascia exists in the anterior vaginal wall. The major point of contention is whether the vaginal fascial layer exists. Some texts do not describe a fascial layer. Other sources state that the fascia is present under the urethra which is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt; Despite disagreement, the urethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;

==Lateral and mid support structures==
The midsection of the vagina is supported by its lateral attachments to the [[Tendinous arch of pelvic fascia|arcus tendineus]]. Some describe the pubocervical fascia as extending from the pubic symphysis to  the anterior vaginal wall and cervix. Anatomists do not agree on its existence.&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/arcus+tendineus+fasciae+pelvis|title=Arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis|last=|first=|date=|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--"The paracolpium and parametrium are the connective tissues surrounding the vagina and the uterus, respectively. In the midvagina, the paracolpium fuses with the pelvic wall and fascia laterally.28 The cardinal ligaments (also called the transverse cervical ligaments of Mackenrodt) extend from the lateral margins of the cervix and upper vagina to the lateral pelvic walls. They originate over a large area from the region of the greater sciatic foramen over the piriformis muscles, from the pelvic bones in the region of the sacroiliac joint, and from the lateral sacrum. They are condensations of the lowermost parts of the broad ligaments. Laterally, the cardinal ligaments are continuous with the connective tissue surrounding the hypogastric vessels. Medially, they are continuous with the paracolpium and parametrium as well as the connective tissue in the anterior vaginal wall, the so-called pubocervical fascia.
The uterosacral ligaments are attached to the upper vaginal fornices posterolaterally. They extend to attach to the pre-sacral fascia in front of the sacroiliac joint. The cardinal and uterosacral ligaments hold the upper vagina in place over the levator ani muscles."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;--&gt;

&lt;!--==Posterior support==

"The posterior vaginal wall is supported laterally by the paracolpium, which is attached to the endopelvic fascia and pelvic diaphragm. The anterior and posterior fascial layers attach or come together on the sides of the vagina. The rectovaginal fascia is thin where it attaches to the vaginal wall. Some anatomists have described attachments to the posterior vaginal by a septum, consisting of fibromuscular elastic tissue, extending from the peritoneal reflection to the perineal body. Others dispute the existence of a septum. In either case the mobility of the rectum and vagina are independent."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;--&gt;

== Complications ==
Vaginal support structures can be damaged or weakened during childbirth or pelvic surgery. Other conditions that repeatedly strain or increase pressure in the pelvic area can also compromise support. Examples are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/vaginal-and-cervical-trauma-5045|title=Vaginal and cervical trauma|website=stratog.rcog.org.uk|language=en-uk|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[constipation|chronic constipation]]
* chronic or violent coughing
* heavy lifting
* being overweight or [[Obesity|obese]]&lt;ref name="niddk"/&gt;&lt;!--"The levator plate, the shelf on which the pelvic organs rest, is horizontal when the body is in a standing position and supports the rectum and upper two thirds of the vagina above it. Weakness of the levator ani may loosen the sling behind the anorectum and cause the levator plate to sag, opening the urogenital hiatus and allowing pelvic organ prolapse.
The urogenital diaphragm closes the levator hiatus, supports and has a sphincter-like effect at the distal vagina, provides structural support for the distal urethra, and contributes to continence in that it is attached to the periurethral striated muscles.
There is controversy regarding whether the anterior vaginal wall includes a suburethral fascial layer; regardless, the anterior vaginal wall provides support to the urethra by its lateral attachment to the levators and to the endopelvic fascia from the arcus tendineus of the pelvic fascia.
A combination of smooth and striated muscle, connective tissue, mucosa, and submucosa are necessary for a functional urethral sphincter, which provides watertight apposition of the urethral lumen, compression of the wall around the lumen, and a means of compensating for abdominal pressure changes.
The “hammock hypothesis” describes support of the urethra by a coordinated action of fascia and muscles, which provides a hammock onto which the urethra is compressed during increases in intra-abdominal pressure."&lt;ref name = herschorn/&gt;--&gt;

The '''Ventura County Air Pollution Control District''' ('''VCAPCD'''), formed in 1968, is the [[Air pollution#Air quality agencies|air pollution agency]] responsible mainly for regulating [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary sources]] of [[air pollution]] for [[Ventura County]]. The District was formed  by the [[Board of Supervisors]] in response to the county's first air pollution study which identified Ventura County as having a severe air quality problem.  

Currently, Ventura County does not meet the federal air quality standard for [[ozone]] and exceeds the state standard for ozone and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
