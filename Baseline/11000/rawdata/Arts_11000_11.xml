'''''Abraham's Sacrifice of Isaac''''' is a 1715 painting by the Baroque artist [[Federico Bencovich]] in the [[Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://dizbi.hazu.hr/object/view/3226 collection record] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting shows [[Abraham]] with a knife in his hand raised to kill his son [[Isaac]] at the moment that the angel intervenes. Bencovich became court painter of the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz [[Lothar Franz von Schönborn]] in 1715 and completed four large canvas masterpieces for his gallery in [[Schloss Weißenstein]]. These were ''Apollo and Marcia'', ''Hagar and Ishmael in the desert'', ''Iphigenia’s sacrifice'' and ''Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac''. The canvas of Abraham was taken in the beginning of the 19th-century, but it was attributed to [[Piazzetta]] at the time. The Strossmayer gallery in Croatia purchased the painting at a London auction in 1936 and research on the painting has determined this to be the same one.

{{nihongo|'''Akabeko'''|赤べこ|Akabeko|''red cow''}} is a legendary [[cattle|cow]] from the [[Aizu]] region of [[Japan]], who inspired a traditional [[toy]]. Aizu legend claims that the toys are based on a real cow used to build the Enzō-ji temple of [[Yanaizu, Fukushima|Yanaizu]] in the ninth century.

The toy is made from two pieces of [[papier-mâché]]-covered wood, shaped and painted to look like a red cow or ox. One piece represents the cow's head and neck and the other its body. The head and neck hangs from a string and fits into the hollow body. When the toy is moved, the head thus bobs up and down and side to side. The earliest akabeko toys were created in the late 16th or early 17th century.

Over time, people came to believe that the toys could ward off [[smallpox]] and other illnesses. Akabeko has become one of [[Fukushima Prefecture]]'s most famous crafts and a symbol of the Aizu region. It has also been recognized as a symbol of the larger [[Tōhoku region]], of which Fukushima Prefecture is a part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-282521648.html TV commercials transmitting the attractions of Japan and Tohoku to the world], States News Service, 8 March 2012 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the legend==
[[File:Akabeko1.png|thumb|Artist rendition of the legendary Akabeko cow]]
According to an Aizu-area legend recorded by Thomas Madden, akabeko toys are based upon a real cow that lived in CE 807. At that time, a monk named Tokuichi was supervising the construction of Enzō-ji&lt;!-- 圓蔵寺 --&gt;, a temple in [[Yanaizu, Fukushima]]. Upon the temple's completion, the akabeko gave its spirit to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and its flesh immediately turned to stone.

Another version of the tale claims that the cow instead refused to leave the temple grounds after construction had been completed and became a permanent fixture there. The red cow was called {{nihongo|akabeko|赤べこ|akabeko|''beko'' is [[Tōhoku dialect|Aizu dialect]] for ''cow''}} and became a symbol of zealous devotion to the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

After [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] had solidified his power over Japan, his representative, [[Gamō Ujisato]], was sent to be the lord of the Aizu region in 1590. At his new post, Ujisato heard the story of akabeko and ordered his court artisans, who had accompanied him from [[Kyoto]], to create a toy based on the red cow. These early [[papier-mâché]] akabeko introduced most of the basic elements for which the toy is known.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

In the same period, Japan suffered a smallpox outbreak. People in Aizu noticed that children who owned akabeko toys did not seem to catch the illness.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt; The akabeko's red colour may have enhanced this association, since red amulets are thought to protect against that illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/anthropology/japanese/ |title=Mingei: Japanese Folk Toys |accessdate=2007-01-18 |last=Schwartz |first=Nicole |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628204307/http://www.calacademy.org/RESEARCH/anthropology/japanese/ |archivedate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Dorothy (1991). ''Encyclopedia of Japan: Japanese History and Culture, from Abacus to Zori''. Facts on File. {{ISBN|0-8160-1934-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Akabeko toys became very popular as charms to ward off sickness, a Superstition that persists in modern times. The toy has since become one of the few crafts from [[Fukushima Prefecture]] to be known all over Japan&lt;ref name="Madden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.plala.or.jp/awia/AizuGlossary.html |title=Aizu Wakamatsu International Association |accessdate=2007-01-18 |last=Madden |first=Thomas |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221103824/http://www6.plala.or.jp/awia/AizuGlossary.html |archivedate=21 February 2007 |deadurl=yes }} (published May 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and a symbol of the Aizu area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-quart/14/jsps14.pdf|title=Introducing Japan: Aizu-Wakamatsu|journal=Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Quarterly|pages=15|issue=14|date=Winter 2005|last=Marasinghe|first=Chandrajith Ashuboda|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

Akabeko are made from [[papier-mâché]] that is painted and [[lacquer]]ed. The toy consists of two main pieces: the body, and the head and neck. The body is hollow and open on one end. The neck and head fit into this opening, suspended from a piece of string. Whenever the akabeko is moved or jostled, its head bobs up and down and side to side.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

Akabeko are made by fewer than a dozen family-run workshops, whose members have passed down the technique for generations. The process takes about 10 days to complete. The artisan begins by wrapping wetted ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper) around two blocks of wood, one shaped like the cow's body, and the other shaped like the head and neck. These blocks have often been used for several generations. Once the paper dries, the artisan splits it in two lengthwise and removes the wooden blocks. The craftsperson then rejoins the pieces of molded paper by wrapping more layers of ''washi'' around them.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

The artisan paints the toy, beginning with black, then adding the characteristic red, and finally the white eyes and other details. The akabeko's markings vary from workshop to workshop. For example, the Igarashi family paints the [[kanji|Chinese character]] ''kotobuki'' (寿 ''longevity'' and ''luck'') on the cow's back and a sun and moon on its side; other workshops add gold markings. The artisan finishes the toy with a thin coat of lacquer.&lt;ref name="Madden"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6555">"'''As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly'''" is an [[aphorism]] which appears in the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the [[Bible]] — [[s:Bible (King James)/Proverbs#26:11|Proverbs 26:11]] ({{Lang-he|כְּ֭כֶלֶב שָׁ֣ב עַל־קֵאֹ֑ו כְּ֝סִ֗יל שֹׁונֶ֥ה בְאִוַּלְתֹּֽו}} ''Kəḵeleḇ šāḇ ‘al-qê’ōw; kəsîl, 	šōwneh ḇə’iwwaltōw.''), also partially quoted in the [[New Testament]], [[2 Peter]] 2:22.  It means that fools are stubbornly [[Rigidity (psychology)|inflexible]] and this is illustrated with the repulsive [[simile]] of the [[dog]] that eats its [[vomiting|vomit]] again, even though this may be poisonous.  Dogs were considered [[unclean animals|unclean]] in Biblical times as they were commonly [[scavenger]]s of the dead and they appear in the Bible as repugnant creatures, symbolising evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Lj8IXYthLgC|page=354|title=The Book of Proverbs: Chapters 15–31|author=Bruce K. Waltke|isbn=978-0-8028-2776-0|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyUEAAAAMAAJ|title=Writing with a purpose|author=James McNab McCrimmon|page=144|isbn=978-0-395-17740-2|year=1973|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/saa/1997/00000005/00000001/art00003|title=Dogs: God's Worst Enemies?|author=Sophia Menache|volume=5|issue=1|year=1997|pages=23–44|doi=10.1163/156853097X00204|journal=Society and Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reference to vomit indicates excessive indulgence and so also symbolises revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yz04U3SlSMC&amp;pg=PA92 |year=2008 |title=Animal imagery in the book of Proverbs |isbn=978-90-04-16287-7 |author=Tova Forti |chapter=Dog and Fool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incorrigible nature of fools is further emphasised in [[s:Bible (King James)/Proverbs#27:22|Proverbs 27:22]], "Though you grind a fool in a [[mortar and pestle|mortar]], grinding them like grain with a pestle, you will not remove their folly from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjEYEjVVEosC|title=Dictionary of biblical imagery|author1=Leland Ryken |author2=Jim Wilhoit |author3=James C. Wilhoit |author4=Tremper Longman |author5=Colin Duriez |author6=Douglas Penney |author7=Daniel G. Reid |page=296|isbn=978-0-8308-1451-0|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Proverbs, the "fool" represents a person lacking moral behavior or discipline, and the "wise" represents someone who behaves carefully and righteously. The modern association of these words with intellectual capacity is not in the original context.

==Development==
The Greek translation in the [[Septuagint]] developed the idea, imbuing it with a sense of [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], "As when a dog goes to his own vomit and becomes abominable, so is a fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin."

The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] refers to the proverb ([[s:Bible (King James)/2 Peter#2:22|2 Peter 2:22]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJcsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA285 |page=285 |title=Notes, explanatory and practical, on the general epistles of James, Peter, John and Jude |author=Albert Barnes |year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; "But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."  [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] cites this in his poem ''[[The Gods of the Copybook Headings]]'' as one of several classic examples of repeated folly:{{cquote|As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man&lt;br&gt;There are only four things certain since Social Progress began.&lt;br&gt;That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,&lt;br&gt;And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;}}

The proverb is a favourite of the British politician [[Ken Livingstone]] who used it on the occasion of his failure to rejoin the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/livingstone-vents-his-fury-as-his-bid-to-rejoin-labour-fails-649295.html|title=Livingstone vents his fury as his bid to rejoin Labour fails|author=Paul Waugh|date=24 July 2002|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used on occasion in the [[Parliament of Australia]] by [[Paul Keating]], in reference to his political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The half wit, wisdom of a failed intellect | journal=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=Sep 26, 2006 |author=Piers Akerman |quote=In 1990, Paul Keating famously accused Wilson Tuckey of being "a dog returning to its own vomit" ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the TV programme ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'' (the prequel to ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]''), in the episode titled "Home," Endeavour returns to his family home to visit his sick father. He goes with his sister Joyce to a pub for a drink and the following is part of their conversation:

&lt;poem&gt;
Joyce: "Why did you go back to Oxford?" 
Endeavour: "Oh! A policeman goes where he's sent."
Joyce: "When I told Pop, he just said, ''''Proverbs 26:11'''.'"
Endeavour: [Recognizing the verse] "Well I've many faults, God knows, but I try to draw the line at masochism. Besides, traditionally it's the killer that returns to the scene of the crime, not the... whatever I was."&lt;ref&gt;''Endeavour'', Season 1, Episode, 4 May 5th 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2013}}
'''Basement 5''' were a [[reggae]] [[punk rock|punk]] fusion band from [[London]] founded in 1978. Their first vocalist was Winston Fergus, then [[Don Letts]]. One of their early performances was a support for [[Public Image Ltd.]]'s London debut at the [[Rainbow Theatre (Finsbury Park)|Rainbow]] on Christmas Day 1978. Finally in 1979 [[Dennis Morris (photographer)|Dennis Morris]] - photographer of Bob Marley and the Sex Pistols, took over as creative force, lead vocalist and lyricist. He also designed the Basement 5 logo and created their image. The drums were played by [[Richard Dudanski]], who had played in the bands [[101ers]], [[The Raincoats]] and [[Public Image Ltd.]] Their songs reflected the political situation of the time in Great Britain in the era of [[Margaret Thatcher]]: youth unemployment, strikes, racism and the poverty of the working class.

In 1980 they got signed to [[Island Records]] with vocalist [[Dennis Morris (photographer)|Dennis Morris]]. The new line up played its debut gig at Clarendon Hotel in London (19 March 1980),&lt;ref&gt;''Look Hear''. In: [[Melody Maker]] 22 March 1980, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moving Finger: ''After Midnight''. In: Melody Maker 29 March 1980, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a set at Camden's Music Machine (now called [[KOKO (music venue)|KOKO]]) at an all night gig hosted by [[ZigZag (magazine)|ZigZag]] magazines editor [[Kris Needs]] on 31 March 1980 along with numerous other artists such as [[John Cooper Clarke]],  [[Killing Joke]] and [[The Only Ones]] also recording a [[Peel Session]] on 21 April 1980, aired on 28 April and their debut, self-produced [[single (music)|single]], "Silicon Chip," on 26 May.  Following this, they recorded their début [[album]], ''[[1965-1980]]'', with [[record producer]] [[Martin Hannett]], releasing it on 11 August.  On the first day of recording the album, the existing drummer known as Anthony "Bigga" Thompson walked out of the session. The band was in shock. Having just finished touring with [[Ian Dury]] and [[The Blockheads]] who they became very friendly with, they then used their drummer "Gentleman" Charles Charles of the Blockheads for the album.

Hannett, in an interview with Dutch music magazine ''[[Oor]]'' in 1981, said, "You have to play it very loud to enjoy it fully. It was the most difficult production, I must say, the heaviest. It was eighteen degrees in the shade, the end of August. As I recall it has been the most physical album that I've ever done. Made me feel like I'd been carrying bricks around. Heavy work. Putting the bass lines in the right place. But it was good."

The sessions also yielded [[Dub music|dub]] versions of several of the main tracks, released on 31 October as ''In Dub''.  "Last White Christmas" was released in time for Christmas (1 December), as a 12" and 7" (the latter in Christmas wrapping paper with a silver sticker of the band logo).  The band broke up shortly thereafter, with several members forming Urban Shakedown.

In October 2017, the label Play It Again Sam (PIAS) re released the two Basement 5 albums: "1965- 1980" and "In Dub" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/music/1965-1980-in-dub&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/music/in-dub-4a73eba4-e159-4ef5-b790-1e3f2c2e8374&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Both Members of This Club George Bellows.jpeg|thumb|300px|''Both Members of This Club]]

'''''Both Members of This Club''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[George Bellows]]. It hangs in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]]. It dates to 1909 and measures {{cvt|115|x|160.5|cm|in|frac=16}}.

The Gallery writes, "''Both Members of This Club'' was inspired by the fights Bellows attended at [[Tom Sharkey|Tom Sharkey's]] Athletic Club in New York. At the time, public boxing matches were illegal in the city. Private organizations like Sharkey's made prospective fighters temporary members of the "club" on the night of the event to circumvent the law."&lt;ref name="nga"&gt;{{cite web|title=Both Members of This Club|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.30667.html|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The seal of the University of Bivona===
Until 1785, a seal engraved with the municipal arms of the lord of that time was used on the official acts of the University of Bivona. On 5 March 1785, with the publication of the royal circular letters, it was willing ''that the barons of the kingdom do not interfere in the election of judges, and mayors of their respective lands'':&lt;ref name=quattroquattrootto&gt;Marrone 2001 p.448.&lt;/ref&gt; thus, there was no longer baronial issuing power, the city administration bivonese was endowed with a new seal. The latter bore the emblem of the House of Bourbon-Sicily at the top, and a few naturalistic elements (such as some plants) around a tower at the bottom.

Below are the descriptions of three municipal seals of Bivona of 1593,&lt;ref name=centosettantaquattro&gt;Marrone 1987 p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1638 and 1801.&lt;ref name=trecentoquarantadue&gt;Marrone 1987 p.342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seicento&gt;Marrone 1987 p.600.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seal of 1593====
A seal of the University of Bivona in a document of 1593 (currently available at the State Archives of Palermo)&lt;ref&gt;State Archives of Palermo Court of the Royal Patrimony, Reveal, vol. 60, revealed to Peter Vincent, p.. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; probably depicts the arms of families [[Corona d'Aragona|D'Aragona]], [[De Luna d'Aragona]] and [[Peralta (family)|Peralta]], although there are doubts about the exact identification of the latter.&lt;ref name=centosettantaquattro/&gt;

In 1593 a woman was the head of the duchy of Bivona, [[Aloisia de Luna]],&lt;ref name=centocinquantatre-quattro&gt;Marrone 1987 p.153-154.&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Peter de Luna]] (first Duke of Bivona) and Isabella de Vega, also the daughter of [[Juan de Vega]], [[Viceroy of Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Marrone 1987 p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; Aloysia became the investiture of the duchy in September 1592, after the death of brother [[Giovanni de Luna|Giovanni]],&lt;ref name=centocinquantatre&gt;Marrone 1987 p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1567 she married [[Cesare Moncada]], died in 1571;&lt;ref name=centocinquantatre/&gt; in 1577 she became the wife of [[Antonio Aragon]], duke of Montalto.&lt;ref name=centocinquantatre-quattro/&gt;

====Seal of 1638====
A seal of the University of Bivona present in a document dated May 17, 1638 (also available at the State Archives of Palermo)&lt;ref&gt;State Archives of Palermo Court of the Royal Patrimony, Memor., Vol. 851, p.. 231, doc. of 17/05/1638.&lt;/ref&gt; depicts the arms of the families of Luna, [[de La Cerda]] and [[Aragona-Sicilia]]; missing are the arms of the [[Moncada family]].&lt;ref name=trecentoquarantadue/&gt;

In 1638, [[Luigi Guglielmo Moncada]] was the Duke of Bivona, great-grandson of Aloysia de Luna and descendant of the Aragon family.&lt;ref&gt;Marrone 1987 p.285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Codex Regius of Eddaic Poems and Flateyjarbok.jpg|thumb|Codex Regius and Flateyjarbók (open).]]

'''Codex Regius''' ({{lang-la|[[wikt:en:codex#Latin|Cōdex]] [[wikt:en:regius#Latin|Rēgius]]}}, "(The) Royal Book"; {{lang-is|Konungsbók}}) or '''GKS 2365 4º''' is an [[Iceland]]ic [[codex]] in which many [[Old Norse]] poems are preserved. It is made up of 45 [[vellum]] leaves, thought to have been written in the [[1270s in poetry|1270s]]. It originally contained a further 8 leaves, which are now [[Great Lacuna|missing]]. It is the sole source for most of the poems it contains. In scholarly texts, this manuscript is commonly abbreviated as [R] for Codex Regius, or as [K] for Konungsbók.

Nothing was known of its whereabouts until 1643 when it came into the possession of [[Brynjólfur Sveinsson]], then Bishop of [[Skálholt]], who sent it as a present to King [[Frederick III of Denmark]] in 1662, hence the name. It was then kept in the Royal Library in [[Copenhagen]] until April 21, 1971, when it was brought back to [[Reykjavík]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=sFaC8FmqzxcC&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=6USCQ420C0&amp;dq=codex%20regius%201971&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=codex%20regius%201971&amp;f=false | title=The Return of Cultural Treasures | author=Greenfield, Jeanette | pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now kept in the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]]. Since air travel was not to be entirely trusted at the time with such precious cargo, it was transported by ship, accompanied by a military escort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIUvBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=codex+regius+1971+%22ship%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FaqvzXI9C-&amp;sig=U0FWL2DLs5aFAnbn8cN3RJNm5iI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwittP6wlPneAhVoyoMKHcKIA6MQ6AEwCnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=codex%20regius%201971%20%22ship%22&amp;f=false | title=The Poetic Edda | author=Dodds, Jeramy | pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of the principal manuscripts of [[Prose Edda|Snorri's Edda]] (GKS 2367 4to) also goes by the name of the Codex Regius. It is made up of 55 vellum pages dating from the early 14th century. It was part of the same gift from Bishop Brynjólfur to Frederick III. It was returned to Iceland in 1985, where it is now also in the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]].

The '''art collections of the [[Palace Museum]]''' ({{zh|c=故宫博物院|p=Gùgōng Bówùyùan}}), a national [[museum]] housed in the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], are built upon the imperial collection of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. This collection was expanded in the 20th century with new acquisitions, transfers from other museums, and new archaeological discoveries.

{{main|Forbidden City}}
The Palace Museum is housed in the Forbidden City, the [[China|Chinese]] imperial palace from the [[Ming Dynasty]] to the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. It is located in the middle of [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]. For almost five centuries, it served as the home of the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] and his household, and the ceremonial and political centre of Chinese government.

Built from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8,707 bays of rooms&lt;ref name="Rooms"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=故宫到底有多少间房 (How many rooms in the Forbidden City) |url=http://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html |work= |publisher=Singtao Net |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2007-07-05 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718140600/http://www.singtaonet.com/arts/t20060927_343639.html |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covers 720,000&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;metres. The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/439|title=UNESCO World Heritage List: Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in [[East Asia]] and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; and is listed by [[UNESCO]] as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.

[[File:Album of the Yongzheng Emperor in Costumes 9.jpg|thumb|From ''Album of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] in Costumes'', by anonymous court artists, Yongzheng period (1723—35).]]
Built from 1406 to 1420, the [[Forbidden City]] was the Chinese imperial palace from the early [[Ming Dynasty]] to the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In 1912, [[Puyi]], the last Emperor of China, [[abdication|abdicated]]. Under an agreement with the new [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government, Puyi remained in the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was given over to public use,&lt;ref&gt;p 137, Yang (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; where a small museum was set up to display artifacts housed in the Outer Court. In 1924, Puyi was evicted from the Inner Court after a [[Coup d'etat|coup]].&lt;ref name="Yan4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yan|first=Chongnian|authorlink=Yan Chongnian|title= 正说清朝十二帝 (True Stories of the Twelve Qing Emperors)|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/40472/55544/55547/55560/3875789.html|year=2004|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|location=Beijing|isbn=710104445X|language=Chinese|chapter=国民—战犯—公民 (National - War criminal - Citizen)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Palace Museum was then established in the Forbidden City on [[Double Ten Day]] (October 10), 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Cao Kun |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= 故宫X档案: 开院门票 掏五毛钱可劲逛 (Forbidden City X-Files: Opening admission 50 cents)|url= http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/22226/53974/53977/3750782.html|work= Beijing Legal Evening|publisher= People Net|date=2005-10-06|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17&amp;nbsp;million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City.&lt;ref name=Wen&gt;
{{cite book|last=Wen|first=Lianxi (ed.)|title=故宫物品点查报告 [Palace items auditing report]|year=1925|publisher=Caretaker Committee of the Qing Dynasty Imperial Family. Reprint (2004): Xianzhuang Book Company|location=Beijing|isbn=7-80106-238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the imperial libraries housed countless rare books and historical documents, including government documents of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The forbidden city: the biography of a palace|author=Dorn, Frank|place=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|year=1970|OCLC=101030|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933, the threat of [[Japan]]ese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;See map of the evacuation routes at: {{cite web |url= http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/administration/about/tradition.htm|title= National Palace Museum - Tradition &amp; Continuity|accessdate=2007-05-01 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= National Palace Museum |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the end of [[World War II]], this collection was returned to Nanjing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/administration/about/tradition.htm|title= National Palace Museum - Tradition &amp; Continuity|accessdate=2007-05-01 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= National Palace Museum |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]]' victory imminent in the [[Chinese Civil War]], the Nationalist government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ordered the evacuation of the pick of this collection to [[Taiwan]]. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artifacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei. This relatively small but high quality collection today form the core of that museum.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite news|author=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=三大院长南京说文物 (Three museum directors talk artifacts in Nanjing)|url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/10416/949293.html|work=Jiangnan Times|publisher=People Net|date=2003-10-19|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201133727/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/10416/949293.html|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the [[Nanjing Museum]].&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt;

Under the government of the [[People's Republic of China]], the Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public.&lt;ref name="Guangming"&gt;{{cite news|author=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=北京故宫与台北故宫 谁的文物藏品多？ (Beijing Palace Museum and Taipei Palace Museum: which collection is bigger?)|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2005-01/16/content_2467212.htm|work=Guangming Daily|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110202014/http://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2005-01/16/content_2467212.htm|archivedate=2009-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the presence of commercial enterprises in the Forbidden City has become controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= 闾丘露薇：星巴克怎么进的故宫？Luqiu Luwei: How did Starbucks get into the Forbidden City|url= http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/5290184.html|work= |publisher= People Net|date=2007-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-25|language=Chinese}}; see also the original [[blog]] post [http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/46e9d5da01000694 here] (in Chinese).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Starbucks]] store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.starbucks.com/retail/locator/MapResults.aspx?storeKey=33319|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070612055602/http://www.starbucks.com/retail/locator/MapResults.aspx?storeKey=33319|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2007-06-12|title= Starbucks Store Locator -- Store detail|accessdate=2007-05-01 |author= Starbucks Corporation|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mellissa Allison| title=Starbucks closes Forbidden City store| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003788095_webstarbucks13.html| work=| publisher=The Seattle Times| date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparked objections &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Reuters |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Starbucks brews storm in China's Forbidden City |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/FOOD/news/12/11/china.starbucks.reut/ |work= |publisher=CNN |date=2000-12-11 |accessdate=2007-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502100933/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/FOOD/news/12/11/china.starbucks.reut/ |archivedate=2007-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually closed on July 13, 2007.

==Collections==
[[File:北京故宫3.JPG|thumb|Interior of one of the many palace halls in the Palace Museum]]
Today, there are over a million rare and valuable works of art in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.about.com/od/asiasouthasia/ig/Ancient-Beijing/Forbidden-City.htm|title=Forbidden City in Beijing, China|publisher=[[About.com]]: Architecture|author=[[Jackie Craven]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares, enamel objects, etc. According to an inventory of the Museum's collection conducted between 2004 and 2010, the Palace Museum holds a total of 1,807,558 artifacts and includes 1,684,490 items designated as nationally protected "valuable cultural relics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-01/27/c_13709525.htm|title=Palace Museum puts its house in order|work=China Daily|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=2011-01-27|accessdate=2011-01-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131083859/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-01/27/c_13709525.htm|archivedate=2011-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceramics===
The Palace Museum holds 340,000 pieces of [[ceramic]]s and [[porcelain]]. As well as other pieces, these include imperial collections from the [[Tang Dynasty]] and the [[Song Dynasty]], as well as pieces commissioned by the Palace, and, sometimes, by the Emperor personally. This collection is notable because it derives from the imperial collection, and thus represents the best of porcelain production in China; other large collections are in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]] and the [[Nanjing Museum]].

The ceramic collection of the Palace Museum represents a comprehensive record of Chinese ceramic production over the past 8,000 years, as well as one of the largest such collections in the world.&lt;ref name="Guangming"/&gt;

===Painting===

[[File:Lotus Flower Breaking the Surface by Yun Shouping.jpg|thumb|right|''Lotus Flower Breaking the Surface'' by [[Yun Shouping]], 17th century]]
The Palace Museum holds close to 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date from before the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368). This is the largest such collection in China and includes some of the rarest and most valuable paintings in [[Chinese history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Paintings |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection is based on the palace collection in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong]] meant that one of the most important collections of paintings in Chinese history was held at the palace.  However, a significant portion of this collection was lost. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, some of the best parts of the collection were moved to [[Taiwan]]. The collection has since been gradually replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.

===Bronzeware===
[[Bronze]] holds an important place in [[Chinese culture]], and was always an important part of state ceremony. The Palace Museum's bronze collection dates from the early [[Shang Dynasty]]. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1600 are inscribed items from the pre-[[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] period (to 221 BC). A significant part of the collection is ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court, including complete sets of musical instruments used by the imperial orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Bronzeware |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timepieces===
The Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. The collection contains both Chinese- and foreign-made pieces. Chinese pieces came from the palace's own workships, [[Guangzhou]] (Canton) and [[Suzhou]] (Suchow). Foreign pieces came from countries including [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. Of these, the largest portion come from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Timepieces |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable pieces in the collection include a clock with an attached [[automaton]] which is able to write, with a miniature [[writing brush]] on inserted paper, an auspicious couplet in perfect [[Chinese calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dpm.org.cn/English/c/c3/C3e/default.asp?artid=23|title= Gilded copper clock with the decoration of writing person|accessdate=2007-07-05 |author= The Palace Museum|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= Chinese|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jade===
[[Jade]] has a unique place in [[Chinese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laufer |first= Berthold|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jade: A Study in Chinese Archeology &amp; Religion|year=1912 |publisher=Reprint (1989): Peter Smith Pub Inc|location=Gloucestor MA |isbn=978-0-8446-5214-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum's collection, mostly derived from the imperial collection, includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan Dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history, as well as artifacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest pieces date from the [[Neolithic]] period.  Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty pieces, on the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Jade |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palace artifacts===
In addition to works of art, a large proportion of the Museum's collection consists of the artifacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |title=Collection highlights - Palace artifacts |accessdate=2007-07-05 |author=The Palace Museum |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language=Chinese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701213540/http://www.dpm.org.cn/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6170">In [[mathematical physics]], the '''conformal symmetry''' of [[spacetime]] is expressed by an extension of the [[Poincaré group]]. The extension includes [[special conformal transformation]]s and [[dilation (affine geometry)|dilation]]s. In three spatial plus one time dimensions, conformal symmetry has 15 [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]: ten for the Poincaré group, four for special conformal transformations, and one for a dilation.

[[Harry Bateman]] and [[Ebenezer Cunningham]] were the first to study the conformal symmetry of [[Maxwell's equations]]. They called a generic expression of conformal symmetry a [[spherical wave transformation]].
 
==Generators==

The [[conformal group]] has the following [[group representation|representation]]:&lt;ref name="difrancesco"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Di Francesco |author2=Mathieu, Sénéchal |title= Conformal field theory |series= Graduate texts in contemporary physics |year= 1997 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-0-387-94785-3 |page= 98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two dimensional [[spacetime]], the transformations of the conformal group are the [[conformal geometry|conformal transformations]]. There are [[Conformal_field_theory#Two_dimensions|infinitely many]] of them.

In more than two dimensions, [[Euclidean conformal transformations]] map circles to circles, and hyperspheres to hyperspheres with a straight line considered a degenerate circle and a hyperplane a degenerate hypercircle.

In more than two [[Lorentzian dimension]]s, conformal transformations map null rays to null rays and light cones to light cones with a null hyperplane being a [[degenerate light cone]].

==Applications==

===Conformal field theory===

The largest possible{{why|date=March 2017}} global [[symmetry group]] of a non-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[interaction|interacting]] [[quantum field theory|field theory]] is a [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of the conformal group with an [[internal group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Second-order phase transitions===
{{main|phase transitions}}

One particular application is to [[critical phenomena]] in systems with local [[interaction]]s. Fluctuations{{clarify|of what?|date=March 2017}} in such systems are conformally invariant at the critical point. That allows for classification of universality classes of phase transitions in terms of [[Conformal field theory|conformal field theories]]

{{expand section|date=March 2017}}

Conformal invariance is also present in two-dimensional turbulence at high [[Reynolds number]].

===High-energy physics===

Many theories studied in [[high-energy physics]] admit the conformal symmetry{{why|date=March 2017}}. A famous{{why|date=March 2017}} example is the [[N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory]]. Also, the [[worldsheet]] in [[string theory]] is described by a [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] coupled to the two-dimensional gravity.

'''Donald Pass''' (9 September 1930 – 3 December 2010) is a British painter whose art has been compared to that of [[William Blake]] by a reviewer in an Oxford newspaper, among others. He is known for work based on a vision he experienced, which has been interpreted as the Resurrection of the Dead. His work is found in museums and private collections in Europe, the United States, and Australia.

== Education ==
 
Donald Pass was educated on Stoke-on-Trent Regional College of Art (1947–1950) and the Royal Academy Schools in London (1951–1954).

== Early Visions ==
 
At a young age, Donald Pass saw an angel with a lion's head at a roadside hedge. Later, while working in London as a painter, he saw through the window "a beautiful face which appeared to be all gold. It seemed to expand through the window and embrace the whole room." &lt;ref&gt;Thorne, Dr. Tony. "Flights of Angels". Raw Vision Magazine, number 38&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Vision of the Resurrection ==

Prior to 1969, Donald Pass worked as a landscape artist. In a churchyard in Cuckfield, Sussex in August of that year, he experienced a vision which has been described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
" It was eleven in the morning on a bright day but suddenly everything darkened, and a strange light appeared with a sound like the rushing of wind. Vast fields stretched before him in which he could see miles into the distance as if it were close by, and the sky was an infinite black space with great lights moving in it. He was standing with a host of figures and gradually, he became aware of angels standing with them and coming towards them the sky. The angels were descending and ascending, coming from all directions and in all sizes. Some had their faces obscured, some had very compassionate and beautiful faces, others had faces of lions like the angel he saw in the hedge when he was a child.

In the middle, an enormous angel descended with outstretched arms and a face which Donald Pass says he can not describe. His descent was accompanied by a tremendous chorus of sound. Higher and at a distance was a beautiful and strange face in profile that had long hair yet was neither male nor female. It seemed unaware of the figures below. All the light stemmed from that extraordinary head and from the angels. It was a strange light and unlike sunlight, it spread in such a way that all the figures were illuminated.

On the ground, figures lay still with forms rising out of them as if something was emerging from a chrysalis. Donald Pass remembers that it looked "almost like a transfiguration, a rebirth" of the soul from the body. There were figures standing, and others going in three directions: one towards very dark angels who stood near the horizon and others upward in great columns into the sky where angels gathered them in. The dark angels stood very still a long way away, but those closer seemed to gather figures towards them. There were gangs of angels standing together, figures grouping together, and figures which Donald Pass say he can't describe standing together. There seemed at one point to be hands rising from the ground."  &lt;ref&gt;McCloud, Iliana. July–August 2009. "The Vision of the Resurrection". New York Arts Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His subsequent work has been based on the vision.

[[File:Mowgli-1895-illustration.png|thumb|[[Mowgli]] was a fictional feral child in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.]]
A '''feral child''' (also called '''wild child''') is a [[human]] child who has lived isolated from human contact from a very young age, where they have little or no experience of human care, behavior or human [[language]]. There are several confirmed cases and other speculative ones. Feral children may have experienced severe [[Child abuse|abuse]] or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] before being abandoned or running away. They are sometimes the subjects of [[folklore]] and [[legend]]s, typically portrayed as having been raised by animals.

==Description==
Feral children lack the basic [[social skills]] that are normally learned in the process of [[enculturation]]. For example, they may be unable to learn to use a [[toilet]], have trouble learning to walk upright after walking on fours all their lives, or display a complete lack of interest in the human activity around them. They often seem mentally impaired and have almost insurmountable trouble [[language acquisition|learning a human language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/other/feature-post/feral-children/|title = Mind Blowing Cases of Children Raised by Animals|date = December 1, 2014|accessdate = February 20, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impaired ability to learn a [[natural language]] after having been isolated for so many years is often attributed to the existence of a [[critical period]] for language learning, and taken as evidence in favor of the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Birdsong1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Birdsong|title=Second Language Acquisition and the Critical Period Hypothesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7OPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;focus=viewport&amp;q=curtiss%201977|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-67489-2|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.475.3365&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf This is an illegal scan, not sure whether the link should be included here--&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtiss2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Curtiss|title=Genie: A Psycholinguistic Study of a Modern-Day Wild Child|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSy0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;focus=viewport&amp;q=%22critical%20period%22|date=10 May 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-4832-1761-1|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little scientific knowledge about feral children. One of the best-documented cases has supposedly been that of sisters [[Amala and Kamala]], described by Reverend J. A. L. Singh in 1926 as having been "raised by wolves" in a forest in India. French surgeon [[Serge Aroles]], however, has persuasively argued that the case was a fraud, perpetrated by Singh in order to raise money for his orphanage. Child psychologist [[Bruno Bettelheim]] states that Amala and Kamala were born mentally and physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bettelheim|first1=Bruno|title=Feral Children and Autistic Children|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=March 1959|volume=64|issue=5|pages=455–467|doi=10.1086/222541|url=https://autisticacademic.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bettelheim-feral-children-and-autistic-children.pdf|jstor=2773433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other scientific studies of feral children exist, such as the case of [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]].&lt;ref name="Curtiss2014"/&gt;

== History ==

Around the 20th century, psychologists were attempting to differentiate between behavior and biological culture. Feral children who lived in isolation or with animals provided examples of this dilemma.

Prior to the 1600s, feral and wild children stories were usually limited to myths and legends. In those tales, the depiction of feral children included hunting for food, running on all fours, and not knowing language. Philosophers and scientists were infatuated with such children, and began to question if these children were part of a different species from the human family.

The question was taken seriously as science tried to name and categorize the development of humans, and the understanding of the natural world in the 18th and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/feral-children|title=Feral children|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documented cases of feral children==
===Raised by primates===
[[Marina Chapman]] lived with [[weeper capuchin]] monkeys in the [[Colombia]]n jungle from the age of four to about nine, following a botched kidnapping in about 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hattenstone|first1=Simon|title=Was Marina Chapman really brought up by monkeys?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/13/marina-chapman-monkeys|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual for feral children, she went on to marry, have children and live a largely normal life with no persisting problems.

Robert (1982) lost his parents in the [[Ugandan Bush War|Ugandan Civil War]] at the age of three, when [[Milton Obote]]'s looting and murdering soldiers raided their village, around {{convert|50|mi|km|-1}} from [[Kampala]]. Robert then survived in the wild, presumably with [[vervet monkey]]s, for three years until he was found by soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raised by monkeys, strugging to be human|url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1314386/raised-monkeys-strugging-human|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=New Vision|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saturday Mthiyane (or Mifune) (1987), a boy of around five, was found after spending about a year in the company of monkeys in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], South Africa. He was given the name Saturday after the day he was found, and Mthiyane was the name of the headmistress of the Special School which took him in. In 2005, at the age of around 17, he could still not talk, and still walked and jumped like a monkey. He never ate cooked food and refused to share or play with other children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/1997-11-21-child-of-the-wild-still-spurns-life-as-a-human|title=Child of the wild still spurns life as a human|date=21 November 1997|work=Mail and Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ssebunya, from [[Uganda]], was a toddler when his mother died. Instead of going into a care facility, he went to live with vervet monkeys. For two years he learned how to forage and travel. The monkeys protected him in the wild. When he was around seven years old, he was brought back to civilization. The only form of communication he could do was cry, and he was described as always  wanting food. Some considered him “wild” and “scary.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/raised-in-the-wild-tales-of-survival-8165967.html|title=Raised in the wild: tales of survival|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raised by wolves===

''Language Acquisition of a Bilingual Child: A Sociolinguistic Perspective (To Age Ten)''. United Kingdom: Multilingual Matters, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; (1304, 1341 and 1344).

[[Marcos Rodríguez Pantoja]] (ca. 1946, [[Sierra Morena]], Spain) lived for 12 years with wolves in the mountains of Southern Spain. He was discovered at age 19.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veterinari.vda.it/index.php?option=com_attachments&amp;task=download&amp;id=128 Lupine Lore by Walter Tarello]&lt;/ref&gt; Rodríguez's story was depicted in the 2010 Spanish-German film ''Entrelobos''. For his portrayal of Rodríguez, young actor Manuel Camacho received a ''Best New Actor'' nomination at the ''[[25th Goya Awards|2011 Goya Awards]]''.

===Raised by dogs===
[[Oxana Malaya]] was an eight-year-old girl who lived with dogs for six years. She was found in a kennel with dogs in 1991. She was neglected by her parents who were alcoholics.

Traian Căldărar, Romania (found in 2002) also known as "the Romanian Dog Boy" or "Mowgli". From the ages of four to seven, Trajan lived without his family. The boy was found at the age of seven and was described as a three-year-old due to undernutrition. His mother had left her home because of domestic violence, and Traian ran from home sometime after his mother left. He lived in the wild and took shelter in a cardboard box. He suffered from infected wounds, having poor circulation, and a children's disease caused by vitamin D deficiency. Traian was found by Manolescu Ioan, who had been walking across the country after his car broke down. In the surrounding area, a dog that had been eaten was also found. Many assume that the boy was eating the dog to stay alive. When Traian was being cared for, he would usually sleep under the bed and wanted to eat all the time. In 2007, Traian was being taken care of by his grandfather and was doing well in 3rd grade at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sociologychis.wordpress.com/2016/05/12/modern-day-feral-children/|title=Modern day Feral children|date=2016-05-12|work=Sociologychis|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, he is a normal child who likes football and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/romania/1390871/Wolf-boy-is-welcomed-home-by-mother-after-years-in-the-wild.html |title=Wolf boy is welcomed home by mother after years in the wild |accessdate=2014-07-02 |date=2002-04-14 |journal=Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrei Tolstyk (2004) was raised by dogs in a remote part of Siberia from the age of three months to 7 years. He was neglected by his parents because he had speaking and hearing problems. Social workers who found the boy were curious about why the boy was not admitted to his local school.

Hany Istók (a.k.a. Steve of the Marsh) of Kapuvár, Hungary (1749). According to documents stored at the Catholic parish of Kapuvár, an abandoned child was once found in a marshy lakeside forest by two fishermen. He was brought to the town of Kapuvár, where he was christened and received the name Steven. The local governor took him to his castle and tried to raised him up, but the boy eventually escaped and ran back to the forest. Later, numerous folk tales developed around his character, depicting him as a "half fish, half human creature" who lived in a nearby lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapuvar.hu/varos/hanyistok/], "Hany Istók legendája" (Legend of Hany Istók)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandra (1970s and 1980s) – First reported in 1973 in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], at roughly 12 years old, and as living an [[amphibian]] lifestyle in the Kuano river. He was rescued in 1979 and taken to a nearby village. He only partly adapted to a conventional lifestyle, still preferring raw food, walking with an awkward gait, and spending most of his time alone in nearby rivers and streams. He died in 1982 after approaching a woman who was frightened by him, and who badly scalded Ramachandra with boiling water. Historian [[Mike Dash]]&lt;ref&gt;Dash, Mike Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown; Overlook Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87951-724-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; speculates that Ramachandra's uncharacteristically bold approach to the woman was sparked by a burgeoning sexual attraction coupled with his ignorance of cultural mores and taboos.

===Raised with sheep===
The historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Psammetichus I]] (Psamtik) sought to discover the [[origin of language]] by conducting an experiment with two children. Allegedly, he gave two newborn babies to a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. The hypothesis was that the first word would be uttered in the root language of all people. When one of the children cried “''bekos''” (a sound quite similar to the bleating of sheep) with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for bread. Thus, they concluded that the Phrygians were an older people than the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Herodotus| first=| authorlink=| others=George Rawlinson (translator)| title=The History of Herodotus| work=| publisher=| url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html| doi=| accessdate=November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was her mother's second illegitimate child. Her mother had tried to give Anna up for several months but no agency was willing to take the financial burden, as this was during the [[Great Depression]]. Anna was kept in a store room at least until she was five and half, out of the way of her disapproving grandfather, who was infuriated by her presence. Her mother also resented her, considering her troublesome. She was tied to a broken chair which was too small for her, and is believed to have also been tied to a cot for long periods of time. She was mostly fed milk and was never bathed, trained, or caressed by anyone. When she was found, she was suffering from [[malnutrition]] as well as [[muscle atrophy]]. She was immobile, expressionless, and indifferent to everything. She was believed to be deaf as she did not respond to others (later it was found that her deafness was functional rather than physical). She could not talk, walk, feed herself, or do anything that showed signs of cognition. Once she was taken away and placed in a foster home, she showed signs of improvement. At the age of nine she began to develop speech. She had started to conform to social norms and was able to feed herself, though only using a spoon. Her teachers described her as having a pleasant disposition. Anna passed away in August 1942 of hemorrhagic [[jaundice]].

Sujit Kumar (1979), named the “Chicken Boy of Fiji” by the media, was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Sujit's mother committed suicide when he was a toddler and his father left him confined under the house to live with the chickens. Sujit was rescued while still a boy and committed to the Samabula Old People's Home where he was confined to his room and tied to his bed. He could not speak and his only verbalisation was clucking; his only interaction with people consisted of outbursts. Sujit remained at the old people's home for 20 years until he was found by Elizabeth Clayton, a wealthy businesswoman who founded the Happy Home Trust to care for Sujit and other at risk Fijian children. Sujit's behaviour has improved, but he will never learn to speak and he remains profoundly disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4567|number=567|title=Feral Children|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2008 disclosure by Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lesoir.be/?action=nav&amp;gps=580849 |title=Les aveux de Misha Defonseca}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the bestselling book ''[[Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years]]'' and movie ''Survivre avec les loups'' (“''Surviving with Wolves”'') was a media [[hoax]], the French media debated the credulity with which numerous cases of feral children have been unquestioningly accepted. Although there are numerous books on these children, almost none of them have been based on archives; the authors instead have used dubious second- or third-hand printed information. According to the French surgeon [[Serge Aroles]], who wrote a general study of feral children based on archives (''L'Enigme des Enfants-loups'' or ''The Enigma of Wolf-children'', 2007), many alleged cases are totally fictitious stories:
* The teenager of [[Braşov|Kronstadt]] (1781)&lt;ref name="Rauber" /&gt;{{rp|49–55}}&lt;ref name="Rauber_in_Chamber" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04112005-153758/unrestricted/11_Chapter2_deal.pdf |title=Chapter 2: Feral Children and Wranitzky’s Pantomime-Ballet Das Waldmädchen (1796) |accessdate=2007-06-18 |last=Deal |first=Bama Lutes |date=2005-04-01 |format=PDF |work=The Origin and Performance History of Carl Maria von Weber's Das Waldmädchen (1800) |publisher=[[Florida State University]] |page=16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701003432/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04112005-153758/unrestricted/11_Chapter2_deal.pdf |archive-date=2007-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – According to the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] document published by [[Serge Aroles]], this case is a hoax: the boy, mentally handicapped, had a [[goitre]] and was exhibited for money.
* Syrian Gazelle Boy (1946) – A boy aged around 10 was reported to have been found in the midst of a herd of [[gazelle]]s in the [[Syria]]n desert in the 1950s, and was only rescued with the help of an [[Iraqi army]] jeep, because he could run at speeds of up to 50&amp;nbsp;km/h. However, it was a hoax, as are the other gazelle-boy cases.
* [[Amala and Kamala]] – Claimed to have been found in 1920 by missionaries near [[Midnapore]], [[Calcutta]] region, [[India]], later proved to be a hoax to gain charity for Rev. Singh's orphanage.&lt;ref name="Aroles2007"/&gt;{{rp|104–113}} Scholars from Japan and France launched a new inquiry about Amala and Kamala, and validated the discoveries and conclusions done by Serge Aroles 20 years before: the story was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suzuki|first1=Kotaro|last2=Vauclair|first2=Jacques|title=De quelques mythes en psychologie : Enfants-loups, singes parlants et jumeaux fantômes|date=2016|publisher=Le Seuil|isbn=9782021103663|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The bear-girl of [[Krupina]], [[Slovakia]] (1767)&lt;ref name="Rauber" /&gt;{{rp|48–9}}&lt;ref name="Rauber_in_Chamber" /&gt; – Serge Aroles found no traces of her in the Krupina archives.

== Legend, fiction, and popular culture ==
{{Main|List of fictional feral children}}
Myths, legends, and fiction have depicted feral children reared by wild animals such as [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[ape]]s, [[monkey]]s, and [[bear]]s. Famous examples include [[Romulus and Remus]], [[Ibn Tufail]]’s [[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Hayy]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]]’ [[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Kamil]], [[Rudyard Kipling]]’s [[Mowgli]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]’s [[Tarzan]], [[George of the Jungle]] and the legends of [[Atalanta]] and [[Enkidu]].

[[File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg|thumb|The [[Capitoline Wolf]] suckling [[Romulus and Remus]].]]
Roman legend has it that [[Romulus and Remus]], twin sons of [[Rhea Silvia]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], were suckled by a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]]. Rhea Silvia was a priestess, and when it was found that she had been pregnant and had children, King [[Amulius]], who had usurped his brother's throne, ordered her to be buried alive and for the children to be killed. The servant who was given the order set them in a basket on the [[Tiber river]] instead, and the children were taken by [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]], the river god, to the shore where a she-wolf found them and raised them until they were discovered as toddlers by a shepherd named [[Faustulus]]. He and his wife [[Acca Larentia]], who had always wanted a child but never had one, raised the twins, who would later feature prominently in the events leading up to the founding of Rome (named after Romulus, who eventually killed Remus in a fight over whether the city should be founded on the [[Palatine Hill]] or the [[Aventine Hill]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Plutarch  | authorlink =  | others = John Dryden (translator) | title = Romulus | url = http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/romulus.html | doi =  | accessdate = November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legendary and fictional children are often depicted as growing up with relatively normal [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] and skills and an innate sense of culture or civilization, coupled with a healthy dose of [[Self preservation|survival instincts]]. Their integration into human society is made to seem relatively easy. One notable exception is Mowgli, for whom living with humans proved to be extremely difficult.

The subject is treated with a certain amount of realism in [[François Truffaut]]’s 1970 film ''[[L'Enfant Sauvage|L’Enfant Sauvage]]'' (UK: ''The Wild Boy'', US: ''[[The Wild Child]]''), where a scientist's efforts in trying to rehabilitate a feral boy meet with great difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897470428|title=François Truffaut : The Lost Secret|last=Gillain|first=Anne|publisher=Indiana University Press (Ind.)|year=2013|isbn=9780253008459|location=|page=215|translator-last=Fox|translator-first=Alistair,|oclc=897470428|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French Colonial''' is a style of architecture used by the [[French colonial empire|French during colonization]]. Many former French colonies, especially those in Southeast Asia, have previously been reluctant to promote their colonial architecture as an asset for tourism; however, in recent times, the new generation of local authorities has somewhat "embraced" the architecture and advertise it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/abouthcmcity/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?CategoryId=10&amp;ItemID=5440&amp;PublishedDate=2005-03-13T11:19:09Z/&lt;/ref&gt; French Colonial architecture has a long history, beginning in North America in 1604 and being most active in the Western Hemisphere (Caribbean, Guiana, Canada, Louisiana) until the 19th century, when the French turned their attention more to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mqup.ca/architecture-and-urbanism-in-the-french-atlantic-empire-products-9780773553149.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==
[[French colonization of the Americas|French settlements in Canada]] date back to the mid-16th century and until the annexion of Quebec by the British Crown after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], [[New France|French Canada]] alongside with Louisiana, was immensely prosperous. Hence the abundant architectural legacy from that period particularly in [[Quebec City]] but also in [[Montreal]]. Most buildings constructed during the French colonial period utilized a heavy timber frame of logs installed vertically on a sill, ''[[poteaux-sur-sol]]'', or into the earth, ''[[Post in ground|poteaux-en-terre]]''.  An infill of lime mortar or clay mixed with small stones ([[pierrotage]]) or a mixture of mud, moss, and animal hair ([[bousillage]]) was used to pack between the logs.  Many times the infill would later be replaced with [[brick]].  This method of construction was used in the [[Illinois Country]] as well as Louisiana. General characteristics of a French Colonial dwelling included a raised [[basement]] which would support the floor of the home's primary living quarters.  Exterior stairs were another common element; the stairs would often climb up to a distinctive, full-length [[veranda]] or "gallery," on a home's [[façade]]. The roof over the veranda was normally part of the overall roof. French Colonial roofs were either a steep [[Hip roof|hipped roof]], with a [[dormer]] or dormers, or a side-gabled roof.  The veranda or gallery was often accessed via [[French doors]].  French Colonial homes in the [[Southern United States|American South]] commonly had [[stucco]]ed exterior walls.&lt;ref name=bigolin&gt;Bigolin, Steve.

==In the United States==
French Colonial was one of four domestic architectural styles that developed during the colonial period in what would become the [[United States]]. The other styles were [[Colonial Georgian]], [[Dutch Colonial]], and [[Spanish Colonial]].  French Colonial developed in the settlements of the [[Illinois Country]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]].  It is believed to have been primarily influenced by the building styles of [[French Canada]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Robert ''Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930'', page 180. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8173-1134-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It had its beginnings in 1699 with the establishment of French Louisiana but continued to be built after [[Spain]] assumed control of the colonial territory in 1763. Styles of building that evolved during the French colonial period include the [[Creole cottage]], [[Buildings and architecture of New Orleans#Creole townhouse|Creole townhouse]], and [[Louisiana Creole people|French Creole]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/louisiana/architecture.htm |title=French Creole Architecture |accessdate=2008-08-02 |work=Louisiana Division of Historic Preservation |publisher=National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Southeast Asia==
There are some colonial buildings as France's legacy in the area, dating back to the 19th and 20th [[French Indochina]] colony. Most of them are located in [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and [[Phnom Penh]]. Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi, as the capitals of Indochina, respectively, in 1887–1902 and 1902-1945, present the most exceptional and among the best-preserved French Colonial buildings in the region, including:

'''''Glory''''' is a 1989 American [[war film]] directed by [[Edward Zwick]], starring [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Denzel Washington]], [[Cary Elwes]] and [[Morgan Freeman]]. The screenplay by [[Kevin Jarre]] was based on the books ''Lay This Laurel'' by Lincoln Kirstein and ''[[One Gallant Rush]]'' by [[Peter Burchard]], and the personal letters of Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]].  The end credits are superimposed on photos of the monument to the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] on [[Boston Common]].

The film is about one of the first military units of the [[Union Army]], during the [[American Civil War]], to consist entirely of African-American men (except for its officers), as told from the point of view of Colonel Shaw, its white commanding officer. The regiment is known especially for its heroic actions at [[Fort Wagner]].

''Glory'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]] and won three, including one for Denzel Washington for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Private Silas Tripp. It won many other awards from, among others, the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Golden Globe Award]]s, the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, the [[Political Film Society]], and the [[NAACP Image Awards]].

The film was co-produced by [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[Freddie Fields|Freddie Fields Productions]], and distributed by Tri-Star Pictures in the United States. It premiered in limited release in the United States on December 14, 1989, and in wide release on February 16, 1990, making $26.8 million on an $18 million budget. The soundtrack, composed by [[James Horner]] and performed in part by [[Boys Choir of Harlem]], was released on January 23, 1990. The home video was distributed by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]. On June 2, 2009, a widescreen [[Blu-ray]] version, featuring the director's commentary and deleted scenes, was released.

==Plot==
During the American Civil War, [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] [[Robert Gould Shaw|Robert Shaw]], injured at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], is sent home to Boston on [[medical leave]]. Shaw accepts a promotion to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] commanding the [[54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]], one of the first all-black regiments in the Union Army. He asks his friend, Cabot Forbes, to serve as his second in command, with the rank of major. Their first volunteer is another friend, Thomas Searles, a bookish, free [[African American|African-American]]. Other recruits include John Rawlins, Jupiter Sharts, Silas Tripp, and a [[muteness|mute]] teenage drummer boy.

The men learn that, in response to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] has issued an order that all black soldiers will be returned to slavery. Black soldiers found in a Union uniform will be [[summarily executed|executed]] as well as their white officers. They are offered, but turn down, a chance to take an honorable discharge. They undergo rigorous training with Sergeant-Major Mulcahy, which Shaw realizes is to prepare them for the challenges they will face.

Tripp goes [[AWOL]] and is caught; Shaw orders him flogged in front of the troops. He then learns that Tripp left to find shoes to replace his worn ones because his men are being denied supplies. He confronts the base's racist [[quartermaster]] on their behalf. Shaw also supports them in a pay dispute, as the [[U.S. Government|Federal government]] pays black soldiers $10, not the $13 per month white soldiers earn. When the men begin tearing up their pay stubs in protest of the unequal treatment, Shaw tears up his own pay stub in support of their actions. In recognition of his leadership, Shaw promotes Rawlins to the rank of Sergeant-Major.

Once the 54th completes its training, they are transferred under the command of General [[Charles Garrison Harker|Charles Harker]]. On the way to South Carolina they are ordered by Colonel [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]] to sack and burn [[Darien, Georgia]]. Shaw initially refuses to [[Superior orders|obey an unlawful order]], but agrees under threat of having his troops taken away. He continues to lobby his superiors to allow his men to join the fight, as their duties to date have involved mostly manual labor, for which they are mocked. Shaw finally gets the 54th into combat after he confronts Harker and threatens to report the illegal activities he has discovered. In their first battle at [[Battle of Grimball's Landing|James Island, South Carolina]], the 54th successfully defeats a Confederate attack that had routed other units. During the battle, Searles is wounded but saves Tripp. Shaw offers Tripp the honor of bearing the regimental flag in battle. He declines, not believing the war will result in a better life for slaves.

General George Strong informs Shaw of [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|a major campaign]] to secure a foothold at [[Charleston Harbor]]. This involves assaulting [[Morris Island]] and capturing [[Fort Wagner]], whose only landward approach is a strip of open beach; a charge is certain to result in heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers the 54th to lead the attack. The night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service. Several make emotional speeches to inspire others. On their way to the battlefield, the 54th is cheered by the same Union troops who had scorned them earlier.

The 54th leads the charge on the fort, suffering serious losses. As night falls, the regiment is pinned down against the walls of the fort. Attempting to encourage his men, Shaw is killed. Tripp lifts the flag, rallying the soldiers to continue, but he too is soon shot dead. Forbes takes charge, and the soldiers break through the fort's defenses. On the brink of victory, Forbes, Rawlins, Searles, Sharts, and the two Color Sergeants are fired upon by Confederate artillery. The morning after the battle, the beach is littered with bodies of Union soldiers; the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. The dead Union soldiers are buried in a mass grave, with Shaw and Tripp's bodies next to each other.

Closing text reveals Fort Wagner never fell to the Union Army. However, the courage demonstrated by the 54th resulted in the Union accepting thousands of black men for combat, and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] credited them with helping to turn the tide of the war.

==Production==
[[File:St_GaudensShaw_Mem.jpg|thumb|Memorial at Boston Common by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]]]
Kevin Jarre's inspiration for writing the film came from viewing [[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial|the monument to Colonel Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] in [[Boston Common]].&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;  The [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th]] was the first formal unit of the [[U.S. Army]] to be made up entirely of African-American enlisted men; all of the officers were white men.  His screenplay was based on two books, Lincoln Kirstein's ''Lay This Laurel'' (1973) and [[Peter Burchard]]'s ''[[One Gallant Rush]]'' (1965), and the personal letters of [[Robert Gould Shaw]].&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;Canby, Vincent (December 14, 1989). [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE4D8113FF937A25751C1A96F948260 Glory (1989)]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exterior filming took place primarily in Massachusetts and Georgia. Opening passages, meant to portray the Battle of Antietam, show volunteer military [[Historical reenactment|reenactors]] filmed at a major engagement at the [[Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District|Gettysburg]] battlefield. Zwick did not want to turn ''Glory'' "into a black story with a more commercially convenient white hero".&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194041&amp;rss=mrqe |title=Glory (1989) |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Morgan Freeman noted: "We didn't want this film to fall under that shadow. This is a picture about the 54th Regiment, not Colonel Shaw, but at the same time the two are inseparable."&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt; Zwick hired the writer [[Shelby Foote]] as a technical adviser; he later became widely known for his contributions to [[Ken Burns]]' PBS nine-episode documentary, ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt;

The film contains numerous inaccuracies. The movie implies that most of the soldiers in the regiment were former slaves, when in fact a majority had been born free in the North. The regiment was not formed until early 1863, so they were not in camp for Christmas of 1862, and on the day the recruits arrived at Readville, they were given uniforms and new boots so soldiers were not reduced to marching barefoot in cold mud, as the film depicts. While the film shows Shaw volunteering his unit immediately after hearing General Strong describe Fort Wagner's defenses, the regimental commanders had conferred among themselves before going back to Strong and telling him that the 54th was to make the charge. Another inaccuracy is in showing the 54th attacking the fort from north to south with the ocean on their left.  The actual attack occurred from the opposite direction, with the ocean on the right parallel to the regiment. Despite the film's closing statement that Wagner was never taken by U.S. forces, it fell to Union hands in September 1863 after further shelling from the U.S. Navy.

''Glory'' was the first major motion picture to tell the story of black U.S. soldiers fighting for their freedom from slavery during the Civil War.  The 1965 [[James Stewart]] film ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' also depicted black soldiers fighting for the Union, but the script suggested the Union army at that time was integrated.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic [[Vincent Canby]]'s review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, "[Broderick] gives his most mature and controlled performance to date....[Washington is] an actor clearly on his way to a major screen career...The movie unfolds in a succession of often brilliantly realized vignettes tracing the 54th's organization, training and first experiences below the [[Mason-Dixon line]]. The characters' idiosyncrasies emerge."&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "a strong and valuable film no matter whose eyes it is seen through".&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt; He believed the production design credited to Norman Garwood and the cinematography of Freddie Francis paid "enormous attention to period detail".&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" |Watching ''"Glory,"'' I had one reccuring [''sic''] problem. I didn't understand why it had to be told so often from the point of view of the 54th's white commanding officer. Why did we see the black troops through his eyes — instead of seeing him through theirs? To put it another way, why does the top billing in this movie go to a white actor?

The film was not without its detractors. [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was not impressed at all with the overall acting, calling Broderick "catastrophically miscast as Shaw".&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Peter (December 1989). Glory (1989). ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the picture by saying, "the movie's often awesome imagery and a bravely soaring choral score by James Horner that transfigure the reality, granting it the status of necessary myth".&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, Richard (December 5, 1989).

Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Desson Howe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', pointed out some flaws that included mentioning Broderick as "an amiable non-presence, creating unintentionally the notion that the 54th earned their stripes despite wimpy leadership".&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;Desson, Howe (January 12, 1990).

[[James Berardinelli]] writing for ''[[ReelViews]]'', called the film "without question, one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War," and noted that it "has important things to say, yet it does so without becoming pedantic".&lt;ref name="reelview"&gt;Berardinelli, James (December 1989). [http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/glory.html Glory]. ''[[ReelViews]]''. Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rating the film with four stars, critic [[Leonard Maltin]] wrote that it was "grand, moving, breathtakingly filmed (by veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis) and faultlessly performed" and called it "one of the finest historical dramas ever made".&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Leonard (August 5, 2008).

[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film a ''thumbs up'' review, saying, "like ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'', this is another admirable film that turns out to be surprisingly entertaining". He thought the film took on "some true social significance" and felt the actors portrayed the characters as "more than simply black men". He explained: "They're so different, that they become not merely standard Hollywood blacks, but true individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Siskel, Gene (December 1989).

'''Guy Le Borgne''' (6 January 1920 – 12 December 2007) was a French Army general that fought in [[World War II]], [[First Indochina War]] and [[Algerian War]].  He commanded several paratroop units during his career and was military governor of [[Lyon]].

== Biography ==
He graduated from [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr Military Academy]] as part of the 1939-1940 "Franco-British Friendship" promotion.  After the Allied defeat in the [[Battle of France]], he escaped to [[North Africa]] and made his way to [[Great Britain]] to join [[Charles de Gaulle|General de Gaulle]]'s [[Free French Forces]].

Became part of a [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh team]], a three men team consisting of an American, British and a Frenchman. Le Borgne's team no. 45, code named FRANCIS, was dropped over [[Finistère]], [[Brittany]] in July 1944, to assist the [[French Resistance]].  His British teammate, Major Colin Ogden Smith, was killed in a firefight with German troops on 29 July 1944.  After the Jedburgh mission he joined one of two French [[Special Air Service]] units with which he took part in two operations behind German lines in the [[Ardennes]] and the [[Netherlands]].

After the war, he joined a parachute regiment and served in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] where he commanded the [[8th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment|8th Parachute Commando Group]] between 1952 and 1953. During the [[Algerian War]] he commanded the [[3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment]] from 1961 to 1962, leading it during the [[Bizerte]] crisis and keeping it loyal to de Gaulle during the [[Algiers putsch of 1961|1961 Algiers Putsch]]. After the war Guy Le Borgne commanded the 11th Parachute Division from 1973 to 1975 and finished his career as military governor of [[Lyon]] from 1976 to 1980 with the grade of général de corps d'armée.

After he retired he was elected president of the Confédération nationale des associations parachutistes in 1980 and becoming member of the honorary committee of the Union Nationale des Parachutistes in 1988. Guy Le Borgne also [[Painting|painted]] under the pseudonyme of Guy Le Zachmeur, his resistance alias from World War II. He died on 12 December 2007.

{{Wiktionarypar|holograph}}
A '''holograph''' is a document written entirely in the handwriting of the person whose [[signature]] it bears. Some countries (e.g., France) or local jurisdictions within certain countries (e.g., some U.S. states) give legal standing to specific types of holographic documents, generally waiving requirements that they be witnessed. One of the most important types of such documents are holographic [[Will (law)|last wills]].

== Holographic instrument ==
The expansion of the concept of ''holographic'' or [[Handwriting|handwritten]] documents must include a discussion of the effectiveness of a document in accomplishing its intended purpose. Print media came into being as a solution to the problem of the sluggish and ponderous task of [[transcribing]] written materials by hand. Printing enabled rapid construction, compilation and production of written material and provided a means for the revolutionary concept of dissemination of copies of written material.

The intrinsic value of employing the handwritten word in creating a document is that the authorship of handwritten documents is able to be authenticated by handwriting comparison with samples of the author's other writings or by recognition by [[witnesses]] familiar with the handwriting style and characteristics of the author. This valuable quality of proof of [[authorship]] maintains to this day the primacy of the hand-written document where it was required, by law or by necessity, to have authenticity and verifiable provenance or origin of the document.

=== The last will ===
{{main|Holographic will}}
Of particular importance to [[law]] and [[society]] was to have the ultimate document requiring authenticity—a last will and [[will (law)|testament]]—retain its authenticity, thereby accomplishing its author's intended purpose: that of making a valid, indisputable disposition of the author's [[real property]], personal assets and wishes or declarations, at the time of his or her death.

The rule for creating a minimally acceptable "holographic" will has been agreed upon:  to be indisputably without edit or revision by an outsider (other than the author), absolutely no mechanically printed material must be contained in the document.  It must not be typeset, typewritten, mechanically printed or scribed by any means other than by the hand of the original author.  This rule does not, however, apply to non-material terms of the will.  As a result, so-called "form wills" purchased at stationery stores can constitute legally valid holographic wills provided that their material terms are completed solely in the testator's handwriting.

The will must be dated at the time of its writing, so that it can be compared (visually, [[Forensics|forensically]]) with documents originating from the same author at other times, such as an earlier will (which might be intended by its author to be withdrawn or revoked by a later written will).

To be effective as a testamentary document, a "holographic" will must be signed by its author. Unlike a typewritten or word-processed "formal" will, where usually two disinterested witnesses are required to attest to the author's signing or "execution" of the document, a holographic will does not require any witnessing or [[Notary public|notarization]] (an accepted form of witnessed certification of authenticity) in order to be a proper and valid testamentary [[Legal instrument|instrument]] (document) having full legal force and effect.

==Music==
In music, a holograph is a manuscript entirely in the composer's hand, while an [[autograph]] is merely in a known hand, not necessarily the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Holograph|author=Stanley Boorman|access-date=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such autographs by non-composers are common, as not only was copying music by hand a common way to study it, but the children or students of major composers were also usually [[copyist]]s for instrumental parts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11559">[[Image:Hugh-wontner.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sir Hugh Wontner in 1975]]
'''Sir Hugh Walter Kingwell Wontner''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GBE|CVO}} (22 October 1908 – 25 November 1992) was an English hotelier and politician.  He was managing director of the [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]] hotel group from 1941 to 1979 and its chairman from 1948 to 1984, continuing as president until his death.  He was also chairman of the [[Savoy Theatre]] from 1948 until his death.  In 1973–74, he was [[Lord Mayor of London]].

Wontner was appointed general secretary of the Hotels and Restaurants Association of Great Britain in 1933 at the age of 25.  He shepherded the Savoy hotel group properties through the difficult World War II years, restoring their lustre after the war, and successfully preserved the group's independence against take-over bids in the 1950s, 1970s and 1980s.  As chairman of the [[Savoy Theatre]], he personally supervised its rebuilding after it was destroyed by fire in 1990.

Wontner was closely involved in the [[City of London]] as a leading member of two of its ancient [[Livery Company|guilds]] and as [[alderman]], chief magistrate and Lord Mayor.  He was knighted in 1972.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Wontner was the elder son of the actor-manager [[Arthur Wontner]] and his first wife, the actress Rose Pendennis, whose real name was Rosecleer Alice Amelia Blanche, ''née'' Kingwell.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Baker, Anne Pimlott. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51374, "Wontner, Sir Hugh Walter Kingwell (1908–1992)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 16 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  He was born '''Hugh Walter Kingwell Wontner Smith''', but his father changed the family name in 1909, dropping the "Smith". Wontner was educated at [[Oundle School]] and in France, but was not, he said later, an academic pupil.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'', obituary, 27 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

After working in the [[Hôtel Meurice]] in Paris, Wontner joined the secretariat of the [[London Chamber of Commerce]] from 1927 to 1933. In 1933, at the age of 25, he was appointed general secretary of the Hotels and Restaurants Association of Great Britain. In 1936 Wontner married Catherine Irvin. They had two sons and one daughter.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Savoy Group===
Wontner's work with the Hotels and Restaurants Association brought him into close contact with [[George Reeves-Smith|Sir George Reeves-Smith]], managing director of the Savoy hotel group, who was the association's founder chairman.  Reeves-Smith was impressed by Wontner's administrative abilities, and, as ''[[The Times]]'' noted, "the young man had other qualities also which appealed to the veteran managing director: a discerning palate for wines, a taste for travel, and a consuming passion for the theatre....  Wontner must have seemed ideal Savoy material."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;  In 1938 he invited Wontner to join the group as his assistant.  When Reeves-Smith died at the age of 77 in May 1941, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], the Savoy chairman, had no doubts about the succession and appointed the 32-year-old Wontner as managing director of the Savoy group, which included the [[The Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[Claridges]] hotels as well as the Savoy.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

[[Image:Savoy Hotel, London.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Savoy Hotel]]
Carte died in 1948, and as his heir, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]], did not wish to become chairman,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' obituary notice for Bridget D'Oyly Carte, 3 May 1985, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the Savoy board elected Wontner, the first person to combine the roles of chairman and managing director since the Savoy's founder, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt;  Wontner remained managing director until 1979 and chairman until 1984. He was elected life president of the group in 1990.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

When Wontner took over, World War II was at its height, and he and his staff had to cope with bomb damage, food rationing, manpower shortage, and, at first, a serious decline in the number of foreign visitors. After the U.S. entered the war, business picked up as the Savoy Hotel became a favourite of American officers, diplomats, journalists and others.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  The hotel became a meeting place for war leaders: [[Lord Mountbatten]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Jan Masaryk]] and [[Archibald Wavell|General Wavell]] were among the regular Grill Room diners, and the hotel's air-raid shelters were "the smartest in London".&lt;ref name=times/&gt;  Wontner co-operated fully with the government's wartime restrictions, helping to draw up an order imposing a five shilling limit on the price of a restaurant meal&lt;ref&gt;About £10 in 2009 terms: see [http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/ "Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present"]&lt;/ref&gt; and advising the government on managing the change from wartime rationing to peacetime conditions.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;
  
After the war, Wontner set about restoring the standards of the Savoy group to their pre-war glory, investing a great deal of capital in repairing war damage, upgrading facilities and enhancing the prestige of the hotels in the group.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Under his control Claridges became a home in London for numerous statesmen, from [[Josip Broz Tito|President Tito]] and [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] to [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhi]], while the Savoy attracted such show business stars as [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Sophia Loren]] and was visited by British royalty including [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]].  Under Wontner's leadership, the group bought the [[Connaught Hotel]] in 1956, and in the early 1960s decided to relocate the Berkeley from [[Piccadilly]] to new premises in [[Knightsbridge]] for an opening in 1972. Wontner was cautious about expanding the Savoy group internationally, concerned that over-expansion might prejudice standards, but in 1970 he added the Lancaster Hotel in Paris to the group.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

===Business methods===
[[Image:DOCplanter.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Planter in the embankment gardens between the hotel and the river, commemorating Wontner's tenure]]
Throughout his career, according to ''The Times'', "Wontner was admired by business associates for his acumen, integrity and loyalty while being accused by his critics of aloofness and arrogance. Beneath a genial manner there certainly lay steely determination and a fair degree of ruthlessness."&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Under his leadership, the Savoy group successfully fought off several hostile takeover bids using, on occasion, controversial stratagems to defeat the bidder.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;''The Economist'', 12 December 1953, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 the entrepreneur [[Charles Clore]] attempted to buy the Savoy group, and when his bid was rejected he sold his shares to the property developer [[Harold Samuel, Baron Samuel of Wych Cross|Harold Samuel]], who planned to redevelop the Piccadilly site of the Berkeley Hotel. Wontner temporarily transferred possession of the freehold of the Berkeley from the Savoy group to its staff pension fund until the bid was withdrawn.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

After this first attempted takeover, Wontner insured against future bids by issuing new shares in the group which carried 40 times as many votes each as the normal shares. These special shares were held by Bridget D'Oyly Carte, Wontner and their allies. The financial magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' found this ploy outrageous: "On grounds of principle, it is difficult to find condemnation too severe for what the Savoy Hotel board have done. They have taken, without the consent of their shareholders, a valuable property in which the shareholders have an equity and of which the best use is open to dispute. They have made it impossible for the shareholders ... to exert any control in future over the disposition of that property."&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; Nevertheless, Wontner's share structure enabled the board to defeat later takeover bids by [[Trafalgar House (company)|Trafalgar House]] and [[Trusthouse Forte]].  During the latter, [[Charles Forte, Baron Forte|Charles Forte]] managed to acquire 69 per cent of the group's shares, but only 42 per cent of the voting rights,&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and was furious at being outwitted by Wontner, whom he accused of having "a great gift for supercilious indifference".&lt;ref&gt;''quoted'' in DNB&lt;/ref&gt; Having thwarted this final takeover bid, Wontner retired from his executive roles and accepted the position of president of the Savoy group.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

===Other interests and honours===
Wontner had many other interests, prominent among which was the City of London, where he was at various times the Master of two [[Livery Companies]], an [[alderman]] of the [[Corporation of the City of London|City Corporation]], chief magistrate and, in 1973–74, [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He advised the royal household on its catering at [[Buckingham Palace]] and elsewhere, and in 1953 was appointed Clerk of the Royal Kitchens – the first holder of the post since the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  He also inherited his father's love of the theatre and served as a member of the board of trustees of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and of the committee of the [[Barbican Centre]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U176351 "Wontner, Sir Hugh (Walter Kingwell)",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 16 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  He was proud of being a member of the [[Old Stagers]], England's oldest amateur dramatic society, and of his association with the [[Savoy Theatre]], of which he was chairman and managing director from 1948 until his death.  When the theatre was destroyed by fire in 1990 Wontner personally supervised the reconstruction. The topping-out ceremony gave him great pleasure, and only a few days before his death he was looking forward to presiding over the re-opening in 1993.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

He was the recipient of many international honours, including Honorary Citizen of [[St Emilion]], 1974; Freeman of the Seychelles, 1974; Order of Cisneros (Spain), 1964; Officer, L'Étoile Equatoriale (Gabon), 1970; Médaille de Vermeil, City of Paris, 1972; Ordre de l'Étoile Civique (France), 1972; Officier du Mérite Agricole (France), 1973; Commander, [[National Order of the Leopard]] (Zaire), 1974; Knight Commander, [[Order of the Dannebrog]] (Denmark), 1974; [[Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia]], 1974; Knight Commander, Royal Swedish Order of the Polar Star, 1980; and a Knight of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]], 1973. His British honours were [[Royal Victorian Order|MVO]] 1950, [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] 1969, [[Knight bachelor]] 1972, and [[GBE]] 1974.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Wontner died of a heart attack in London, aged 84.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Huichol art''' broadly groups the most traditional and most recent innovations in the [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|folk art and handcrafts]] produced by the [[Huichol people]], who live in the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]] and [[Nayarit]] in Mexico.  The unifying factor of the work is the colorful decoration using symbols and designs which date back centuries. The most common and commercially successful products are "yarn paintings" and objects decorated with small commercially produced beads. Yarn paintings consist of commercial yarn pressed into boards coated with wax and resin and are derived from a ceremonial tablet called a neirika. The Huichol have a long history of beading, making the beads from clay, shells, corals, seeds and more and using them to make jewelry and to decorate bowls and other items. The "modern" beadwork usually consists of masks and wood sculptures covered in small, brightly colored commercial beads fastened with wax and resin.

While the materials have changed and the purpose of many of the items have changed from religious to commercial purposes, the designs have changed little, and many retain their religious and symbolic significance. Most outsiders experience Huichol art as tourists in areas such as [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]], without knowing anything about the people who make the items, and the meanings of the designs. There are some notable Huichol artists in the yarn painting and beadwork fields, and both types of work have been commissioned for public display.

==The Huichol People==
[[File:Huichol indian.jpg|thumb|175px|Huichol woman and child]]
The [[Huichol people|Huichols]] are an indigenous people who mostly live in the mountainous areas of northern Jalisco and parts of Nayarit in north central Mexico, with the towns of San Andrés, Santa Catarina and San Sebastián as major cultural centers. Their numbers are estimated at 50,000 and the name Huichol is derived from the word Wirriarika, which means soothsayer or medicine man in the [[Huichol language]].&lt;ref name="survival2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3165-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-two.html |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival II: authenticity and commercialization |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uribe |first=Carlos Rios  |date=September–October 1996 |title= In the track of the deer |journal=Art Education |volume=48 |issue=5 |page=6  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish]] arrived in the 16th century, the Huichols retreated into the rugged mountains of northern Jalisco and Nayarit. While nominally converted to Christianity in the colonial period by Franciscan missionaries, most of the native Huichol culture managed to survive intact due to the isolation, and because the area lacked mineral or other resources of interest to the Spanish.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dkarla"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Primosch |first=karla  |author2=Kathy David |date=November 2001 |title= Art of the Huichol people: A symbolic link to an ancient culture |journal=Art Education |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=25–32  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican historian and anthropologist [[Fernando Benítez]] states that the Huichols have probably maintained their ancient belief systems better than any other indigenous group in Mexico.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  Much of this isolationist tendency remains intact although economic circumstances have forced a number of Huichols to migrate to areas such as Guadalajara, and coastal areas to work or sell their wares.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;

The religious faith of the Huichols is still based on a "trinity" of veneration of the deer, corn and [[peyote]]. The last is ritually gathered each year on a long pilgrimage to the desert area of [[San Luis Potosí]], where the people are said to have originated and used by [[shaman]]s.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  The importance of this and the pantheon of gods is seen in their stylistic representations on just about everything that the Huichol decorate. They did not have a written language until recently, so these symbols were and are the primary form of preserving the ceremonies, myths and beliefs of ancient Huichol religion.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

==Yarn painting and beadwork==
[[File:StringArt1MAPDF.JPG|thumb|Yarn painting at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City]]
[[File:MaskWomanTep.JPG|thumb|Beaded mask on sale in Tepotzotlán, State of Mexico]]
The best known Huichol art is made with modern, commercially produced items such as yarn and small beads. The [[Tepehuán]]es of [[Durango]] adapted the yarn paintings. These have replaced many of the traditional materials such as clay, stone and vegetable dyes.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  Making and decorating items with beads did not begin with importation of European glass beads, as it did with a number of indigenous cultures to the far north.  Techniques for making and using beads have been in place long before that with beads made from bone, clay, stone, coral, [[turquoise]], [[pyrite]], [[jade]] and seeds.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  Huichol art was first documented in the very late 19th century by [[Carl Lumholtz]]. This includes the making of beaded earrings, necklaces, anklets and more.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;

What mostly links the yarn paintings and beaded objects made today is the continuance of the traditional patterns used for centuries to represent and communicate with the gods.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  The use of commercial materials has allowed for the production of more elaborate designs and brighter colors, as well as more flexibility in how traditional concepts are rendered.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;  It has also allowed that the production of commercialized folk art along with the production of strictly religious items.&lt;ref name="4survival"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3441-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-four |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival IV: an art in evolution |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date= May 18, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The commercialization of Huichol art began when a [[Franciscan order|Franciscan]] priest by the name of Ernesto Loera Ochoa began a Huichol museum at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]] just north of Guadalajara. One of the artists exhibited here was Ramón Medina Silver, whose work was exhibited and sold at the museum. Medina’s work came to the attention of American [[Peter Furst]], who suggested that Ramón represent the traditions and beliefs of his people by pressing colored yarn into a wax and resin-covered baseboard.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3262.html |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival I: Origins |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These yarn paintings first appeared in 1962 in Guadalajara and were derived from "nierikas" a small board or disc with a hole or mirror in the center. Nierikas were initially produced by shamans to represent visions they experienced while consuming peyote, then left as offerings to the gods in places such as caves, temples and streams.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

These modern yarn paintings quickly proved popular and were imitated. They have also developed into complex designs which can take weeks to complete.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; The yarn paintings led to experimentation with other commercially produced materials such as beads, which have taken the place of yarn for many Huichol artisans. This beading has been expanded to include the decoration of jaguar heads, masks of the sun and moon and various animal forms.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt;

This art produced for commercial purposes has provided an important, sustainable source of income for the Huichols. Even though new materials are being used, traditional symbols are maintained and transmitted to younger generations.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  However, the production of goods for commercial markets has caused a certain amount of controversy. One question concerns the "authenticity" of the yarn and bead art given the current forms’ modern origins. One person to do this was Fernando Benítez, who was particularly disturbed by the depiction of the dead as floating heads in yarn paintings; something he said was not traditionally Huichol. (origensbarnett) Much of the "authenticity" of the modern works has to do with the continued use of traditional symbols and designs. However, some items of Huichol items can be deemed non-traditional or borderline traditional, such as the production of Christmas tree decorations, masks of the sun and moon, the use of the [[jaguar]] (a [[Mesoamerica]]n symbol) and the incorporation of modern images such as airplanes and modern buildings into designs.&lt;ref name="4survival"/&gt; Selling of the items has not been easy for the Huichol either, with limited outlets such as tourist venues, especially Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara and [[San Miguel de Allende]] as well as sales to middlemen who can earn much more from the works than they can.(CRUruibe)

==Noted Huichol artists==
[[File:InsideMuseoHuicholZapopan.JPG|thumb|Inside the Huichol museum in the Basilica of Zapopan, Jalisco]]
Notable Huichol artists include Emeteria Ríos Martínez, who has done a number of yarn painting murals.&lt;ref name="banderas"&gt;{{cite news |title= Institute of the Americas Hosts Huichol Art Exhibit |url= http://www.banderasnews.com/1002/art-ioahuicholexhibit.htm |newspaper=Banderas News |location=Puerta Vallarta |date=February 21, 2010 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; José Benítez Sánchez is a shaman-artist, who helped to expand yarn painting from its early decorative function to larger more vision like pieces.&lt;ref name="dmarsden"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marsden |first=Dawn |date=Winter 2005 |title=Visions of a Huichol Shaman |journal=American Indian Quarterly |volume=29 |issue=1/2 |pages=302–304 |doi=10.1353/aiq.2005.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pablo Taizan is also a shaman in the village of Mesa de Tirador. He principally does beadwork featuring animal figures used in healing.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt; [[Santos de la Torre]] made a great mural for the metro station Palais Royal at the Louvre, Paris.&lt;ref name="palais-royal"&gt;{{cite web|title=palais-royal
|url=http://metro-paris.fr/en/#/place/palais-royal-musee-du-louvre-station}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Mexican portrait documentary '[[Echo of the Mountain]]', originally known in Spanish as Eco de la montaña&lt;ref name="echoofthemountain"&gt;{{cite web|title=echoofthemountain|url=http://echoofthemountain.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Nicolás Echevarría]] released based on his experiences during the mural creation.

==More traditional items==
Although the yarn paintings and items decorated with beads are the best known and most widely sold pieces, the Huichols continue to make a number of other types of folk art and handcrafts. Urus, or prayer arrows, are ceremonial arrows created to be shot into the air and petition the gods for special blessings. They are also sometimes left at certain places or sent down rivers. These arrows are decorated with symbols and designs related to the petition.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

From the far past to the present, men, women and children all wear woven bags around their waist to carry personal objects. These bags are colored and otherwise decorated for aesthetic and to magically protect the wearer.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

A "kuka" is a three dimensional ceremonial mask which is decorated by beading. These masks evolved from small gourd bowls originally covered in seeds, bone, clay, coral and shell, but these have been replaced by commercially produced beads. It is from these masks that the modern practice of covering wooden sculptures of snakes, dolls, small animals, jaguar heads and other forms is derived.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

Nearika are highly decorated ceremonial objects that can be circular or diamond-shaped. When [[Carl Lumholtz]] did his writing on the Huichol, he named the circular ones "frontal shields" and the diamond-shaped ones as "eyes" and giving rise to the concept of the "[[God's eye]]s," applied to a Huichol cross. Nearika are tablets of wood or [[bamboo]] which are heavily decorated placed into certain sacred areas. Often they focus on a face of a sun, moon or person. From these the new tradition of yarn paintings developed, and the most traditional of these still show the round face of Tau, the Sun, in the middle.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;

==Huichol decorative designs==
[[File:Huichol1FONART.JPG|thumb|Huichol beadwork for sale at the annual [[FONART]] exposition in Mexico City]]
Most outsiders are not aware that most Huichol patterns and designs have religious and cultural significance.&lt;ref name="haviland"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William A. |last2=Prins |first2=Harald E.L. |author3=Dana Walrath |title= Cultural anthropology: the human challenge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxzZl460258C&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=huichol+beadwork&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sVrbjLdThf&amp;sig=HhyOSsckK4_cv-qTBz9dh5wtacA&amp;hl=es-419&amp;ei=nZ37TYKLNouftwePydi6Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTiYAg#v=onepage&amp;q=huichol%20beadwork&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 21, 2011 |year=2005 |publisher= Cengage Learning |page=331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns can be found on a wide variety of objects including carved and beaded on masks, gourds, musical instruments and embroidered on clothing objects such as belts, sashes, side bags, and  more.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;  Most have religious significance and many are influenced by visions which occur during peyote rituals.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haviland"/&gt;  Much of what is known about Huichol designs and symbols was put together by Norwegian explorer and ethnographer Carl Lumholtz in the late 19th century, but Huichol art and decoration has since become more varied.&lt;ref name="survival2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; However, plant and animal motifs remain the most common and most retain their original meaning.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt;

When ceremonial or religious items are made, all aspects of the making from materials to colors to designs are important as they are identified with particular gods and meanings. [[Mesquite]] and the color reddish brown belong to Tatewari, who is of the earth and the wood of the Brazil tree is related to Tayuapa or "Father Sun." Symbols such as the [[golden eagle]] and [[macaw]]s are related to Tatewari. Shapes such as the deer, [[coyote]], pine tree or whirlwind can be associated with Tamat’s Kauyumari, who shaped the world. The salate tree, the [[armadillo]] and the bear are associated with Takutzi Nakahue, the mother of all gods and of corn.&lt;ref name="CRUribe"/&gt; The toto is a small white flower with five petals associated with the rainy season. Sashes and belts often have designs that mimic the markings on the backs of snakes, which are also associated with rain, along with good crops, health and long life.&lt;ref name="originsbarnett"/&gt; The zigzag lines that emanate from all living things represent communication with the deities.&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt; The butterfly motif is reminiscent of the Itzpapolotl or Obsidian Butterfly, a principal deity of the classical [[Aztec]]s.

The most common motifs are related to the three most important elements in Huichol religion, the deer, corn and [[peyote]]. The first two are important as primary sources of food, and the last is valued for its hallucinogenic properties which give shamans visions.&lt;ref name="3survival"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3280-huichol-art-a-matter-of-survival-part-three |title= Huichol art, a matter of survival III: motifs and symbolism |author=Ronald A. Barnett |date= April 1, 2009 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions of Huichol art==
Most outsiders’ experience with Huichol artwork comes from visiting areas such as [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]] and seeing the work being sold. However, most do not know what it is. These vendors are mostly Huichol women who come into these cities from rural villages.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt;

The artwork varies greatly in size, with some as large as murals. In 2010, the Institute of the Americas at the [[University of California, San Diego]], held an exhibit of Huichol art targeting tourists who visit the west coast of Mexico, especially those who travel by boat.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt;

The [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular]] in [[Mexico City]] held a temporary exhibit in 2009 comparing the art of the Huichol people with that of the aborigines of northern Australia entitled "Magica huichol: rito aborigen" ("Huichol Magic: Aborigine Ritual").  The aim was not to show any historical connection but rather to show the similarity of style between two disparate cultures.&lt;ref name="tmargolis"&gt;{{cite news |title= Huichol and aboriginal art: Two indigenous visions |first=Therese |last=Margolis |newspaper=McClatchy - Tribune Business News |location=Washington, DC |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Bead Museum]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]], held an exhibit called "The HuicholWeb of Life: Creation and Prayer".&lt;ref name="dkarla"/&gt;

Huichol work has been commissioned for public display.  There is a permanent display of twelve Huichol murals at the [[San Diego International Airport|Lindbergh International Airport]] at Terminal 3.&lt;ref name="banderas"/&gt; A Huichol bead mural was commissioned for the [[Paris Métro]] at the [[Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre (Paris Métro)|Palais Royal-Musee de Louvre station]]. It was donated by the [[Mexico City Metro]] to France, as a returned favor for the [[Art Nouveau]] [[Metro Bellas Artes|Bellas Artes station]] entrance which was donated by France to Mexico. The work is called "Huichol Thought and Soul" and measures 2.4 by 3 meters in total divided into 80 panels of 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm, created by artist [[Santos de la Torre]].&lt;ref name="donaran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Donaran a Paris un mural huichol |author=Dora Luz Haw |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=September 19, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Donating to Paris a Huichol mural }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recent commissioned works is the "[[Vochol]]," a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] which was covered in Huichol designs using 2,277,000 beads fastened to the body of the car using a special heat-resistant resin. The car was commissioned by the Association of Friends of the Museo de Arte Popular and other public and private enterprises to be auctioned off to benefit Mexican artisans.&lt;ref name="mensaje"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/sala_prensa_detalle.php?id=10228  |title= El Vochol, un vehículo para llevar el mensaje del pensamiento y la filosofía del pueblo huichol |publisher=[[CONACULTA]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Vochol, a vehicle to carry the message of the thought and philosophy of the Huichol people |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inauguran"&gt;{{cite news |title=Inauguran el Vochol, auto intervenido por huicholes a base de chaquira |author= |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/75b72844da8089d57a31be8af1cb2327 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906002448/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/75b72844da8089d57a31be8af1cb2327 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |agency=Notimex |newspaper=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=December 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Inaugurate the Vochol, auto modified by Huichols with beads }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">'''Hymnology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὕμνος ''hymnos'', "song of praise" and -λογία ''-logia'', "study of") is the [[scholar]]ly study of [[religious]] [[song]], or the [[hymn]], in its many aspects, with particular focus on [[choir|choral]] and [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregational]] song. It may be more or less clearly distinguished from ''[[Hymn|hymnody]]'', the creation and practice of such song. Hymnologists, such as [[Erik Routley]], may study the history and origins of hymns and of traditions of sung worship, the biographies of the women and men who have written hymns that have passed into choral or congregational use, the interrelationships between text and tune, the historical processes, both folk and redactional, that have changed hymn texts and [[hymn tune]]s over time, and the sociopolitical, theological and aesthetic arguments concerning various styles of sung worship.

Hymnology is sometimes more strictly construed, as in ''[[A Dictionary of Hymnology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Julian, ed., (1902/1985), ''A Dictionary of Hymnology'', Grand Rapids, MI:  Kregel.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[John D. Julian]], which concerns itself very largely with the history, textual changes, and translations of hymns, and with the biographies of [[hymnographer]]s, and very little with the [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] of these hymns, or with the [[hymn tune]]s to which these are sung.

{{nihongo|'''I-Novel'''|私小説|Shishōsetsu, Watakushi shōsetsu}} is a [[literary genre]] in [[Japanese literature]] used to describe a type of [[Confessional writing|confessional literature]] where the events in the story correspond to events in the author's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Edward|title=The rhetoric of confession: shishōsetsu in early twentieth-century japanese fiction|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-07883-7|edition=1. paperback printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This genre was founded based on the Japanese reception of [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] during the [[Meiji period]]. Many authors believed the form reflected greater individuality and a less constrained method of writing. From its beginnings, the "I-Novel" was a genre that also was meant to expose the dark side of society or the dark side of the author's life.

There are several general rules for the creation of an I-Novel: The first and most important was that it was often written from the first person perspective (which is where the "I" of I-Novel comes from).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karatani|first=Kōjin|title=Origins of modern Japanese literature|year=1998|publisher=Duke Univ. Press|location=Durham [u.a.]|isbn=0-8223-1323-5|edition=3. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese language contains a number of different words for "I"; generally, the formal ''watashi'' ([[wikt:私#Japanese|私]]) was used in the I-Novel. 

I-novels attempt to portray a realistic view of the world (thus the genre's ties to Naturalism). As autobiographical works, they involve real experiences to be completely portrayed with language. Because these two concepts were so important to the authors they used the events of their own lives for their subject matter. Many of them were also trained in literary studies, so their works expressed a great knowledge of literature. Compared to formal writing styles influenced by Chinese literature, I-Novels used more casual language.

The first "I-Novels" are believed to be ''Hakai'' (''Broken Commandment''), written in 1906 by [[Shimazaki Tōson]], and ''[[Futon]]'' (''Quilt'') written by [[Tayama Katai]] in 1907. In ''Hakai'', Toson described a male who was born a member of a discriminated segment of the population ([[burakumin]]), and how he decided to violate his father's commandment not to reveal his community of birth.  In ''Futon'', the protagonist confesses his affection for a female pupil.

Major writers include [[Naoya Shiga]], [[Osamu Dazai]] and others. ''[[Scandal (Shūsaku Endō novel)|Scandal]]'' by [[Shūsaku Endō]] is a recent example of an "I-Novel".

An '''ideogram''' or '''ideograph''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἰδέα}} ''idéa'' "idea" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''gráphō'' "to write") is a [[graphic]] [[symbol]] that represents an [[idea]] or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases.  Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as [[pictogram]]s.

==Terminology==
{{further|Character (symbol)|Logogram}}
[[Image:Perros No.svg|thumb|"No dogs allowed" sign in Spain. The dog illustration is a [[pictogram]]. The red circle and bar is an ideogram representing the idea of "no" or "not allowed".]]
[[Image:EinKaremVisitationIdeogram.jpg|thumb|Ideograms in the [[Church of the Visitation]], Jerusalem]]
In [[proto-writing]], used for inventories and the like, physical objects are represented by stylized or conventionalized pictures, or [[pictogram]]s. For example, the pictorial [[Dongba symbols]] without [[Geba syllabary|Geba]] annotation cannot represent the [[Naxi language]], but are used as a mnemonic for reciting oral literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramsey | first = S. Robert | title = The Languages of China
|publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-691-01468-5| page = 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some systems also use ideograms, symbols denoting abstract concepts.

The term "ideogram" is often used to describe symbols of [[writing system]]s such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Sumerian cuneiform]] and [[Chinese character]]s.  However, these symbols are [[logogram]]s, representing words or morphemes of a particular language rather than objects or concepts. In these writing systems, a variety of strategies were employed in the design of logographic symbols.
Pictographic symbols depict the object referred to by the word, such as an icon of a bull denoting the Semitic word ''ʾālep'' "ox".
Some words denoting abstract concepts may be represented iconically, but most other words are represented using the [[rebus]] principle, borrowing a symbol for a similarly-sounding word. Later systems used selected symbols to represent the sounds of the language, for example the adaptation of the logogram for ''ʾālep'' "ox" as the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] [[aleph]] representing the initial sound of the word, a [[glottal stop]].

Many signs in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] as well as in [[cuneiform writing]] could be used either logographically or phonetically. For example, the Akkadian sign [[dingir|AN]] ({{script|Xsux|[[Dingir|&amp;#x1202D;]]}}) could be an ideograph for "[[deity]]", an ideogram for the god [[An (mythology)|Anum]] in particular, a logograph for the  Akkadian stem ''[[ilah|il-]]'' "deity", a logograph for the Akkadian word  ''šamu'' "sky", or a [[syllabogram]] for either the syllable ''an'' or ''il''.

Although Chinese characters are logograms, two of the smaller classes in the [[Chinese character classification|traditional classification]] are ideographic in origin:
* Simple ideographs (指事字 ''zhǐshìzì'') are abstract symbols such as 上 ''shàng'' "up" and 下 ''xià'' "down" or numerals such as 三 ''sān'' "three".
* Semantic compounds (会意字 ''huìyìzì'') are semantic combinations of characters, such as 明 ''míng'' "bright", composed of 日 ''rì'' "sun" and 月 ''yuè'' "moon", or 休 ''xiū'' "rest", composed of 人 ''rén'' "person" and 木 ''mù'' "tree".  In the light of the modern understanding of [[Old Chinese phonology]], researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds have an at least partially phonetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Boltz | title = The origin and early development of the Chinese writing system | publisher = American Oriental Society | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-940490-78-9 | pp = 67–72, 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ideograms is the [[DOT pictograms|collection of 50 signs]] developed in the 1970s by the  [[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] at the request of the [[US Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/symbol-signs Symbols and signs], AIGA.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was initially used to mark airports and gradually became more widespread.

==Mathematics==

Mathematical symbols are a type of ideogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics as Sign: Writing, Imagining, Counting |first=Brian |last=Rotman |year=2000 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-3684-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed universal languages==
{{See also|Pasigraphy}}

Inspired by inaccurate early descriptions of Chinese and Japanese characters as ideograms, many Western thinkers have sought to design universal written languages, in which symbols denote concepts rather than words. An early proposal was ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668) by [[John Wilkins]]. A recent example is the system of [[Blissymbols]], which was proposed by [[Charles K. Bliss]] in 1949 and currently includes over 2,000 symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (2003), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In the Realms of the Unreal''''' is a 2004 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Jessica Yu]] about American [[outsider art]]ist [[Henry Darger]] (1892–1973). 

An obscure janitor during his life, Darger is known for the posthumous discovery of his elaborate 15,145-page fantasy manuscript entitled ''The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion'', along with several hundred [[watercolor paintings]] and other drawings illustrating the story.

The film won the [[National Film Board of Canada|National Film Board]] Award for Best Documentary at the 2004 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]].

==Content==
The film's style is atypical of a documentary. Because there are only three known photographs of Darger, and because of his reclusive lifestyle, the film is mostly a narrated biographical account, accompanied by animated versions of events from his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', which is also surveyed in detail. Interviews with his few neighbors and other acquaintances are included.

'''Lev Feliksovich Lagorio''' (Russian: Лев Феликсович Лагорио; 9 December 1826, [[Feodosia]] - 17 November 1905, [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a Russian painter and [[watercolorist]], known primarily for his [[seascapes]] and maritime scenes. He was associated with the "[[Kerch Strait|Cimmerian]]" school of painting, composed of artists who worked in Southern [[Crimea]].

==Biography==
His father, Felice Lagorio (1781-1857) was a [[Genoa|Genoese]] merchant serving as [[Vice-Consul]] for the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/national-romantic/leo-lagorio Brief biography] @ RusArtNet.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1839 to 1840, he received his first artistic training in the studios of [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]. In 1842, with the support of {{ill|Alexander Kaznacheyev|ru|Казначеев, Александр Иванович}}, the Governor of [[Taurida Governorate|Taurida]], he was able to enroll at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{ВТ-ЭСБЕ|Лагорио, Лев Феликсович}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he was able to obtain financial assistance from the [[Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg|Duke of Leuchtenberg]], the Academy's new President.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; Among his teachers there were [[Alexander Sauerweid]], [[Maxim Vorobiev]] and [[Bogdan Willewalde]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/l/lagorio/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Paintings.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, he received the title of "Artist" for his painting "View of [[Lahti]]" and, two years later, became a Russian citizen.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; He was also awarded a pension to study abroad, visiting Paris first (1853), then Rome, where he stayed until 1859, the last two years at his own expense.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt;

After his return, in 1860, he was named a Professor and exhibited the works he had created in Italy.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He travelled to the [[Caucasus]] in 1861 and presented a series of landscapes from there to Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who presented him with the [[Order of Saint Anna]].

He returned to the Caucasus in 1863 and 1864, with the entourage of Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Mikhail Nikolayevich]], where he participated in the [[Caucasian War]].&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; Afterward he settled in Saint Petersburg, spent the summers in [[Sudak]] and often travelled abroad..

In 1885, he was commissioned to paint a series of works on the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 and visited battlefields throughout the European and Asian theaters.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; In 1900, he was named an honorary member of the Academy.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He is buried at [[Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|Novodevichy Cemetery]].

The '''Logan Medal of the Arts''' was an arts prize initiated in 1907 and associated with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the Frank G Logan family and the [[Society for Sanity in Art]].  From 1917 through 1940, 270 awards were given for contributions to American art.

The Medal was named for arts patron Frank Granger Logan, founder of the brokerage house of Logan &amp; Bryan, who served over 50 years on the board of the Chicago Art Institute.  He and his wife, Josephine Hancock Logan, administered the award consistent with their patronage of the [[Society for Sanity in Art]], which they founded in 1936, and the theme of her 1937 book ''Sanity in Art''.  The Logans strongly opposed all forms of modern art, including [[cubism]], [[surrealism]], and [[abstract expressionism]]. It was not unknown for the Society of Sanity in Art to award a prize (e.g. in 1938 to [[Rudolph F. Ingerle]]) in competition with the official award by the exhibition prize committee of a prize the Logans had already sponsored.

The Logans sponsored several prizes in their name. The Mr and Mrs Frank G Logan prize was awarded to a jury-selected exhibit at the American Paintings and Sculpture Exhibitions held in Chicago, and a similarly named prize was awarded to a local artist at the annual Chicago and Vicinity Exhibition for a selected exhibit. Frank G Logan prizes were also awarded at exhibitions of prints by the [[Chicago Society of Etchers]], the annual International Watercolor Exhibition and the annual International Lithography and Wood Engraving Exhibition, all held at the Chicago Art Institute. Logan prizes were also awarded by the Society for Sanity in Art at exhibitions in California. Recipients of these prizes are listed below.

The '''Merdeka Palace''' ({{Lang-id|'''Istana Merdeka'''}}; also known in Indonesian as '''Istana Gambir''' and during the Dutch colonial times as '''Paleis te Koningsplein'''), is one of six presidential palaces in Indonesia. It is located on the north side of the [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]] in [[Central Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] and is used as the [[official residence]] of the [[President of the Republic of Indonesia]].

The palace was a residence for the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] during the colonial era. In 1949, the palace was renamed Merdeka Palace, "(ke)[[merdeka]](an)" meaning "freedom" or "independence".

The Merdeka Palace is part of the {{convert|6.8|ha|acre}} Jakarta Presidential Palace Complex, which also includes the [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|Negara Palace]], Wisma Negara (State Guesthouse), Sekretariat Negara (State Secretariat), and the Bina Graha building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/in/istana/istana-jakarta|title=Istana Jakarta|trans-title=Jakarta Palace|language=id|website=National website|access-date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the center of the Indonesian [[Executive (government)|executive]] authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://djamandoeloe.com/read/15/gedung/mengenal-kecantikan-dua-istana-kepresidenan Mengenal Kecantikan Dua Istana Kepresidenan], djamandoeloe.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The beginning===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het paleis van de gouverneur- generaal op het Koningsplein in Batavia TMnr 3728-795.jpg|thumb|left|Lithograph of the ''Paleis te Koningsplein'' in the 1880s (now Merdeka Palace)]]

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zaal in paleis van de Gouverneur-Generaal Batavia TMnr 10013665.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the Palace in 1936]]
The building that is now the Merdeka Palace was built in the premise of the Rijswijk Palace (present [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|Istana Negara]]) when it was considered no longer sufficed for administrative purposes e.g. big receptions and conferences during the mid-19th-century. In 1869, the instruction to construct a new palace was given by Governor-General [[Pieter Mijer]]. Construction took place on the south lawn of the Rijswijk Palace on March 23, 1873 during the tenure of Governor-General [[James Loudon (politician)|James Loudon]].

The Neo-Palladian palace was designed by Jacobus Bartholomeus Drossaers and was built by the Department of Public Works and the contracting firm Drossaers &amp; Company at a cost of [[Netherlands Indies gulden|ƒ]] 360,000. The new building was built in southern part of the Rijswijk Palace grounds, directly facing Koningsplein (now [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]]).

Construction of the palace was finished in 1879 during the tenure of Governor-General [[Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge]]. The new palace was given the official name ''Paleis van de Gouverneur Generaal'' ("Palace of the Governor-General"), the official residence of the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] and his family.&lt;ref name=setneg&gt;[http://www.setneg.go.id/images/stories/kepmen/ppid/istana_istana_kepresidenan_republik_indonesia.pdf ISTANA-ISTANA KEPRESIDENAN REPUBLIK INDONESIA], setneg.go.id&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merdeka&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |archive-url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/1933/Merdeka-lstana |title=Merdeka, Istana |encyclopedia=Jakarta |url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/1933/Merdeka-Astana |archive-date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor-General [[Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge]] (1875-1881) was the first to reside in the building.{{sfn|Djawatan Penerangan Kotapradja Djakarta Raya|1957|p=152}} Governor-General [[Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer]] (1936-1942) was the last Dutch governor-general to reside in the Palace.

===Japanese occupation===
During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]] (1942-1945), the ''Saiko Shikikan'' (army commander) of the Japanese garrison resided in the Rijswijk Palace compound. Three Japanese commanders have taken residence in the Merdeka Palace.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;&lt;ref name=merdeka /&gt;

===Post-independence===
The [[Indonesian national revolution]] (1945–1949) ended with the Netherlands' recognition of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian declaration of independence from the Dutch in 1949 was announced in Gambir Palace. During the ceremony, the Dutch flag was substituted with the [[Flag of Indonesia]]. Many spectators were rejoicing when the flag was hoisted, and yelled "[[Merdeka]]! (Freedom!)". From that moment, Gambir Palace became known as Merdeka Palace.&lt;ref name=merdeka /&gt; [[Tony Lovink]], the High Commissioner of the Dutch Crown was the last man representing the Dutch power to leave the Palace.{{sfn|Djawatan Penerangan Kotapradja Djakarta Raya|1957|p=152}} The name of the palace officially changed to Istana Merdeka ("Indendepence Place") on 28 December 1949 at 17.55 hours.{{sfn|Djawatan Penerangan Kotapradja Djakarta Raya|1957|p=152}}

On 27 December 1949, a day after the ceremony, President [[Sukarno]] and his family arrived from [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. For the first time, the President of the Republic of Indonesia settled in Merdeka Palace.

The first annual Independence Day ceremony was held at the Merdeka Palace in 1950.

==Evolution of the Merdeka Palace==
The building has remain unchanged since the building was finished in 1879.&lt;ref name=merdeka /&gt; After the Indonesian independence, the Merdeka Palace compound was expanded to include not only [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|Istana Negara]] (State Palace), but also to construct Wisma Negara, Sekretariat Negara (State Sectreatiat) and Bina Graha. Several colonial buildings and residences were demolished in the Weltevreden area to make way for today's State Palace compound.

A small octagonal [[gazebo]] located in the courtyard of the palace was used as private school for [[Sukarno]]'s and the palace staff's children. This gazebo was previously used by Dutch colonial officials as ''muziekkoepel'' (music gazebo), where music performances were played during formal [[Ball (dance party)|balls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.detik.com/read/2012/08/30/100042/2002862/1383/4/yuk-main-ke-istana-presiden Yuk, Main ke Istana Presiden!], 30 August 2012, detik.com&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Suharto]] became president of Indonesia, he made changes to the previously residential function of the Palace. Sukarno's bedroom was converted into Ruang Bendera Pustaka (Regalia Room) and the room of Sukarno's wife Fatmawati became the President's bedroom.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt; An old wooden building in the palace complex known as "Sanggar" was demolished to make way for the Puri Bhakti Renatama building, and was used as a museum to store valuable artifacts, artwork and gifts from foreign emissaries. Later{{when|date=August 2015}} he also built the Bina Graha building on the palace grounds, which he used as his office.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;

When [[Megawati]] took office, she had the Puri Bhakti Renatama building converted into the President's office, while its contents moved to Bina Graha building. She also restored the furniture and decorations of the palace back to the way it was under Sukarno. Suharto's Jepara [[wood carving]] furniture was removed, with the exception of the Ruang Jepara (Jepara Room, as a reminder of Suharto's regime), and replaced with the old colonial refurbishment.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;

==The Merdeka Palace now==

[[File:Vladimir Putin with Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono-5.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vladimir Putin meets Yudhoyono at the Merdeka Palace during the Russian state visit of 2007]]

The Merdeka Palace serves as an official venue for state events such as the Independence Day ceremony, welcoming (foreign) dignitaries, cabinet meetings, state banquets and reception of letters of credence from foreign ambassadors. Additionally, it still contains the president's private quarters and offices.

The administrative role that the palace once had, has been shifted to the State Palace and State Secretariat, while the Merdeka Palace remains a symbol of authority.

===Layout of the Palace===
A 17&amp;nbsp;m tall flagpole and a fountain are located on the front lawn of the Merdeka Palace. The annual flag raising ceremony takes place during the Indonesian Independence day on 17 August. During the Independence ceremony, the [[veranda]] is often used as a ceremonial stage for the President and dignitaries.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;

Notable rooms in the Palace include:

* '''Ruang Kredensial''' ([[Letter of credence|credential]] hall) provides entrance to the palace and is the place where most diplomatic activities are conducted, such as receiving state guests and ambassadors. The credential hall is decorated with furniture that dates back to the colonial days, as well as paintings and ceramic works.&lt;ref name=merdeka /&gt;
* '''Ruang Jepara''' (Jepara room) was a former study room of [[Sukarno]], and named after the [[Central Java]]nese town of [[Jepara]], source of the room's [[wood carving|carved wooden]] furniture and ornaments.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;
* '''Ruang Raden Saleh''' (Raden Saleh room) is located in front{{where|date=August 2015}} of Ruang Jepara. The room was previously used as the First Lady's office and living room. Megawati used the room to store 5 paintings by Indonesian painter [[Raden Saleh]].&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;
* '''Ruang Resepsi''' ([[Party|reception]] room) is the largest room of the palace. It is usually used for state banquets, state gala dinners, national meetings, and cultural performances. There are two paintings of [[Basuki Abdullah]]. On the eastern wall hangs "Pergiwa Pergiwati", a painting theme from [[Mahabharata]], and on the west wall hangs the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] "[[Jaka Tarub]]" painting.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;
* '''Ruang Bendera Pusaka''' (the heirloom flag room), or Regalia room. The room is used to store "[[Bendera Pusaka]]", the first [[Indonesian flag]] that was raised during [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence]] on 17 August 1945.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;

The presidents after Sukarno no longer use the palace as a residence, although it is still the official presidential residence. The palace's offices are still in use by the current Indonesian president. During the [[Suharto]] administration, Suharto preferred to reside in his own house at Jalan Cendana, [[Menteng]], while the palace and Bina Graha only served as his office. The palace once again became the official presidential residence during the [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] and [[Megawati]] administrations. [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] sometimes resides in Merdeka Palace, however just like Suharto, he often prefers to reside in his own house, at Puri Cikeas, Cibubur, south of Jakarta.&lt;ref name=Suharto&gt;{{cite news |title=Zaman Soeharto, Istana Negara Jarang Digunakan |first=Meutia Febrina |last=Anugrah |url=http://economy.okezone.com/read/2014/04/18/471/972345/zaman-soeharto-istana-negara-jarang-digunakan |newspaper=okezone.com |date=April 19, 2014 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European [[heraldry]], the '''musimon''' (also known as the '''tityrus''' or '''tytron''') is used to symbolize one in authority who leads with strength.  Used in this sense, the musimon is a cross between a goat and a sheep; it has the feet and body of a goat, the head and beard of a ram, and two horns from each for a total of four—two curved and two straight.

Musimon can also refer to the real animal known as the [[European mouflon]] (''Ovis aries musimon''), a wild short-fleeced mountain sheep found on the islands of [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] and parts of mainland [[Europe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">A '''not-for-profit arts organization''' usually takes the form of a [[not-for-profit corporation]], [[Voluntary association|association]], or [[foundation (charity)|foundation]]. Such organizations are formed for the purpose of developing and promoting the work of [[artist]]s in various [[visual art|visual]] and [[performing arts|performing art]] forms such as [[film]], [[sculpture]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[multimedia]], [[poetry]], and [[performance art]].

==History==
Although [[museum]]s and performing arts societies have existed for centuries, they have proliferated since the end of World War II. In particular, government sponsored organisations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], the [[Canada Council]], the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], have been created to fund award grants to help promote the development of art and culture.

There are also not-for-profit legal service organizations providing services to artists and arts and cultural organizations. [[Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts|Philadelphia Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts]] (PVLA) is one such organization. Through its volunteer attorneys PVLA provides non-criminal legal assistance to artists and arts and cultural organizations on arts related issues.

==Canadian artist-run centres==
In [[Canada]], a series of artist-run organizations often known as "parallel galleries" or artist-run centres (ARCs) have developed in cities across the country since the 1960s to encourage the exhibition of contemporary works by Canadian and international artists. The purpose is often to provide alternative spaces for exhibition for emerging artists and contemporary artists outside the commercial gallery system. Canadian ARCs usually pay a fee and de-emphasize the selling of work, although this will vary from gallery to gallery. A recommended schedule of payment is provided by the [[Canadian Artists' Representation]] (CARFAC), an artists' advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carfac.ca/membership/fees/ CAFRAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[National Gallery, London]] 1434.  Among other changes, his face was higher by about the height of his eye, hers was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.  Each of his feet was underdrawn in one position, painted in another, and then overpainted in a third.  These alterations are seen in infra-red reflectograms.]]
A '''pentimento''' (plural '''pentimenti''') is an alteration in a painting, evidenced by traces of previous work, showing that the artist has changed their mind as to the composition during the process of painting. The word is [[Italian language|Italian]] for ''repentance,'' from the verb ''[[wikt:pentirsi|pentirsi]]'', meaning to repent.

==Significance==
Pentimenti may show that a composition originally had an element, for example a head or a hand, in a slightly different place, or that an element no longer in the final painting was originally planned.  The changes may have been done in the [[underdrawing]] of the painting, or by the visible layers of paint differing from the underdrawing, or by the first painted treatment of the element having been over-painted.

Some pentimenti have always been visible on the final painting with careful inspection; others are revealed by the increasing transparency that some paint acquires after several centuries. Others, especially in the underdrawing, can only be seen with modern methods such as [[X-ray]]s and [[Infrared reflectography#Art history|infrared reflectography]] and photographs.  These are able to record photographically some [[pigment]]s, depending on their chemical composition, which remain covered by later paint layers. For example, [[white lead]], a common pigment, will be detected by X-ray, and [[carbon black]] underdrawings can often be seen with great clarity in infra-red reflectograms.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221432/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/72881.html] These methods have greatly expanded the number of pentimenti art historians are aware of, and confirmed that they are very common in the works of many [[old master]]s, from [[Jan van Eyck]] onwards.
[[File:OldGuitaristLady.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The face of the woman in the image that ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''is painted over. These marks would not usually be described as ''pentimenti'' as the subjects are totally different]]

Pentimenti are considered especially important when considering whether a particular painting is the first version by the original artist, or a second version by the artist himself, or his workshop, or a later copyist. Normally secondary versions or copies will have few if any pentimenti, although this will not always be the case, as in ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'' by [[Caravaggio]].  Like [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and many other masters, Caravaggio seems rarely to have made preliminary drawings, but to have composed straight onto the canvas.  The number of pentimenti found in the work of such masters naturally tends to be higher.

Marks revealing a totally different subject, for example in ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''by [[Picasso]], are not usually described as pentimenti - the artist has abandoned his ''earlier composition'' to begin a new one. In cases where a composition has been changed by a later painter or restorer, marks showing the original composition would not be described as pentimenti either—it must be the original painter who has changed his mind.

==Usage in English==
The term is usually treated as an Italian word and therefore written in italics, depending on the style used in the individual context.  The fully anglicised word ''pentiment'' (plural ''pentiments'') is much rarer, though included in the [[Grove Dictionary of Art]].  The distinction between singular and plural is also rather flexible; some writers refer to a change of just one outline as ''pentimenti'', whilst others treat each area that has been changed as a single ''pentimento''. The word "pentimento" is occasionally used synonymously with "palimpsest", but strictly the latter is used for documents and parchments which, due to fading, have been reused.

==Examples==
[[File:Cardsharps.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' in the [[Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth]].]]
[[File:La casa de Nazaret, por Zurbarán.jpg|thumb|right|''Christ and the Virgin in the House at Nazareth'' by [[Zurbarán]], Cleveland.]]
A portrait in the [[National Gallery, London]] of Jacques de Norvins by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] was painted in 1811–12 when the sitter was [[Napoleon]]'s Chief of Police in Rome. Originally, instead of the curtain at the left, there was a fully painted bust of a boy's head on top of a small column.  Probably this was a bust of Napoleon's son, who was known as the King of Rome. The presumption is that this was overpainted with the curtain after the fall of Napoleon, either by Ingres himself, or another artist.&lt;ref&gt;The National Gallery, Complete Illustrated Catalogue, National Gallery Publications, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85709-050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bust can just be made out in the enlarged online photo, with its chin level with the sitter's hair-line; the top of the column was level with the middle of the sitter's ear.  These may always have been (just) visible, or have become so by the paint becoming transparent with age.  Few viewers of the painting would notice the bust without it being pointed out.  Strictly speaking, these alterations might not be described as pentimenti, because of the presumed lapse of time, and because another artist may have made the change.[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3291]

An example by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] can be found in his work ''[[Leonardo Da Vinci|Salvator Mundi]]'', which was sold to a private collector for more than $450 million after being restored by Christie's auction house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/leonardo-da-vinci-painting-salvator-mundi-sells-for-450-3-million-1510794281|title=Leonardo da Vinci Painting ‘Salvator Mundi’ Smashes Records With $450.3 Million Sale|first=Kelly|last=Crow|date=16 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work  by [[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' in the [[Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth]], has a number of typical minor pentimenti, altering the position of the figure on the right, which are revealed by infra-red reflectograms.  These are used in discussing the painting and comparing it to another version of the subject in [[Bari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kimbellart.org/database/conservation.cfm?acquisition_id=AP%201987.06 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001114100/http://www.kimbellart.org/database/conservation.cfm?acquisition_id=AP%201987.06 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Zurbarán]] in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] shows that the size of a white cloth was expanded after the dark background under-paint had been applied; the expanded area is a darker white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/zurPent.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221750/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/zurPent.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, as a result of the discovery of pentimenti after conservation and cleaning, the [[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld Institute]] changed its opinion on its version of Manet’s ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' from that of it being a copy to  it being a preparatory painting that predates the version in the Louvre. Pentimenti were visible once the old varnish was removed, including alterations to the curve of the back of the female nude and one of the male figure's cap, suggesting that the Courtauld picture is a preparatory work.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Baily, "London version of Manet’s Le déjeuner sur l’herbe predates the bigger picture in Paris", The Art Newspaper, 26 Nov 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term has sometimes been used in a modern sense to describe the appearance of the sides of buildings with painted advertising.  Often old ads are painted over with newer ads and the paint wears away to reveal the older layers. Examples in [[Amsterdam]], [[New York City]] and elsewhere have been photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fadingad.com/009.html|title=Amsterdam Ediglyph|last=Jump|first=Frank H.|date=2008-02-28|website=www.fadingad.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankjump.com|title=Fading Ad Campaign|website=www.frankjump.com|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2306">The '''perfume organ''', also called an '''octophone''' (unrelated to the mandola-related [[octophone]]), was an instrument invented by the French chemist Septimus Piesse, in which the keys of a piano activated one of 46 different odors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=Sadakichi|date=1913|title=In Perfume Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bW4oZmW3mBQC&amp;pg=PA217|journal=The Forum|volume=L (50), July 1913 - December 1913|pages=271|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, in his book ''The Art of Perfumery'', Piesse used music to describe how notes and smells can work together: "There is, as it were, an octave of odors like an octave in music; certain odors coincide, like the keys of an instrument."&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Septimus Piesse, ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16378/16378-h/16378-h.htm The Art of Perfumery And Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants]''  Philadelphia: Lindsay and Blakiston, 1857; Ebook: Project Gutenberg, July 28, 2005, [EBook #16378].&lt;/ref&gt;

As Sadakichi Hartmann noted in 1913, the keys of the octophone "are complementary and can be combined to harmonies as sounds to a musical chord. It is a valuable guide on a quasi scientific basis for the manufacturers of perfumery, for it is only necessary to strike a chord on the piano, and to know what odors the respective notes of the chord represent, to arrive at the suggestion for some new bouquet."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hartmann was skeptical of the value of the perfume organ for "asthetical" experiments, as "the affinity between sounds and odors is purely speculative".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1922, the magazine ''Science and Invention'' had an article on a new, silent take on the perfume organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/6/069.html|title=The Dead media Project:Working Notes:06.9|website=Dead Media|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of attempting harmony of music and scent, the keys on the keyboard of the ''Science and Invention'' version played only notes of perfume. There does not appear to be any evidence that this particular smell organ was ever constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/environment/smell-organ-50062|title=The Olfactory Organ|work=Pacific Standard|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randy Souders''' is an American [[artist]] and a [[disability rights]] advocate.

==Early life and influences==
Souders was born in [[Chickasha, Oklahoma]]. Hoping to become an illustrator he attended [[Trimble Technical High School]] in [[Fort Worth]] where he received daily instruction in [[commercial art]]. At age 14, his parents also enrolled him in a home study correspondence course offered by [[Art Instruction Schools]] which was founded in 1914 and well known for its "Draw Me" art introductory tests. He attended the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in [[graphic design]].&lt;ref name=Enabled&gt;{{cite book|last=Landry|first=Keith|title=Enabled in Words: The Real Lives, Real Victories of People with Disabilities|year=2005|publisher=Enabled Media Group, Inc|location=U.S.A.|isbn= 0976656019|pages=211–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 1972, three months before his 18th birthday, Souders dove into a local lake and hit a submerged object. He broke his neck and sustained a paralyzing [[spinal cord injury]] resulting in incomplete [[tetraplegia]]. He adapted and gradually regained enough function to write, paint and live independently. His drawing hand is paralyzed so his artworks are created entirely with wrist and arm movement.&lt;ref name=Chronicles&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy-Smith|first=Jean|title=Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists |year=1993|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|isbn=0394570030|pages=147–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Beginning===

Upon graduating college in May 1978, Souders was employed for a short time at a local advertising agency. He had his first one-man show of paintings on November 8, 1978. Based on the success of this first show, he left advertising to concentrate on painting full-time.&lt;ref name=Chronicles/&gt;

Many millions of Texans had a piece of Souders art in their home and or office when Southwestern Bell selected a painting called “County Seat” for the cover of the 1984-1985 phone book in Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hancock |first1=Orville |title=Bell rings success for Tarrent artist | accessdate=September 3, 2018 | url = http://www.newpapers.com |work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |issue=June 19, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Loydean |first1=Thomas |title=Handicap doesn't slow 'telephone book artist' | accessdate=September 3, 2018 | url = http://www.newpapers.com |work=San Antonio Express-News |date=August 2, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting featured a red stone courthouse typical of many historic Texas courthouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fredrick |first1=Linda |url=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc983089/m1/?q=randy%20souders#track/1 |website=University of North Texas Libraries Special Collection |publisher=KXAS-TV |title=Phonebook | accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
Since 1990 Souders has created artworks for the [[Walt Disney Company]]. Souders' involvement with Disney originally began through his exhibits at the former "Old World Antiques" shop in Liberty Square at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disabled Artist Will Pay A Visit To Disney World|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-15/entertainment/9203130085_1_museum-of-art-souders-world-antiques|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=15 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ten years he was a featured artist at Disney's "Official [[Disneyana]] Conventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disneyana Convention 2001 -Mouseplanet.com|url=http://www.mouseplanet.com/merchandise/mer010912a.htm|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable affiliations and advocacy==
In 1988, [[Jean Kennedy Smith]] asked Souders to serve on the board of directors of [[VSA Arts]], --the international organization on arts and disability of the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]].&lt;ref name="VSA-About"&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/ About VSA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VSA BOD"&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/resources/introcontents.pdf VSA Board Member |page XV].&lt;/ref&gt; Smith dedicated a chapter to Souders in her book ''[[Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists]]'' co-authored by [[George Plimpton]].&lt;ref name="JKS book"&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family/Jean-Kennedy-Smith.aspx Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parade&gt;[http://www.randysouders.com/Parade.jpg PARADE Magazine article]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also profiled in VSA's 25th anniversary book "Journey To Here"&lt;ref name="VSA Journey"&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/resources/artists.cfm?artbook=randy_souders Journey To Here]&lt;/ref&gt; and penned the introduction to the book "Putting Creativity to Work-- Careers in the Arts for People With Disabilities".&lt;ref name="Creativity"&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/resources/introcontents.pdf Putting Creativity to Work].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repurposing''' is the process by which an object with one [[use value]] is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.

==Description==
Repurposing is as old as [[human civilization]], with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/04/medieval-recycling/ | title=Medieval Recycling | publisher=Harvard Gazette | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as [[Instructables]] and other [[Maker culture]] communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-[[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Malewitz, R. (2014) {{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=22814 | title=The Practice of Misuse | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=3195 | title=Throwaways: Work Culture and Consumer Education | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins. [[Incinerator]] and power plant exhaust stack [[fly-ash]] is used extensively as an [[concrete additive|additive to concrete]], providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as [[Textile|rags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for [[Electric vehicle conversion|electric car conversion]] can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62×51mm).]]

===Automobiles===
*[[Full-size van]]s from the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some [[depreciation]] to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200401/200401_54_sb6_vans.cfm | title=What Church Leaders Should Know About Church Vans | publisher=Enrichment Journal | accessdate=3 August 2014 | author=Hammar, Richard R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics===
*A [[USB dead drop]] can be mounted on a [[brick wall]] since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everdrive]] and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download [[ROM image]]s of video game cartridges onto [[SD card]]s while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014653/http://www.stoneagegamer.com/mega-everdrive-deluxe.html Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial [[accelerometer]] of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., [[Quake-Catcher Network]].
*Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly [[Project Argus]]), Wi-Fi links, and microwave [[amateur radio]] [[radio beacons]].

===As a tactic for manufacturing goods===
* [[Right-hand-drive]] [[Jeep]] brand vehicles, such as the [[Jeep Wrangler]], which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada [[postal service]] mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ US Drive Right: The Nation's Largest Seller Of Used Factory

===Manufacturing of recycled goods===
*[[Reusable packaging]] can be reused for a wide variety of other purposes.
* [[Recycling]] can also involve repurposing of materials, such as products using [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref name="debunking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Recycled Paper|url=http://recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm|publisher=Recycling Point Dot Com|accessdate=4 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006094659/http://www.recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm |archivedate = 6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Technological advances gave rise to residual payments, and their evolution can be traced in terms of those technologies.

===Radio===
Residuals were established in [[Radio in the United States|U.S. network radio]]. [[Live radio]] programs with nationwide audiences were generally performed either two or three times to account for different [[time zone]]s between the east and west coasts of the United States. The performers were paid for each performance. After audio "[[transcription disc]]" technology became widely available in the late 1930s, it was initially used to make recordings to send to radio stations that were not connected to the live network. As sound quality improved, radio networks began using them for time-delaying west coast broadcasts, eventually eliminating the need for multiple performances. The performers were kept on standby and paid for a second performance in case there were technical problems. This established the precedent for residual payments from recorded performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=5 August 2007
|accessdate=13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In the early 1950s, a similar transition occurred in television. Initially, most television broadcasts were either live performances or broadcasts of older films originally produced for theaters. [[Kinescope]] recordings were made of live east coast performances so they could be broadcast several hours later on the west coast, which also made it possible to broadcast these shows later as many times as they wanted. In 1952, residual payments were extended to these television [[rerun]]s, thanks in large part to [[Ronald Reagan]], whose first term as president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) ran from 1947 to 1952.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verrier|first1=Richard|title=Residual resentment slows Hollywood talks|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-residuals16oct16-story.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]] negotiated residuals for up to five reruns for made-for-TV shows.&lt;ref name = "survival"/&gt;

That said, film actors were still not paid residuals for reruns. As Americans increasingly watched TV at home instead of going out to the movies, movie attendance plummeted by over 65% between 1948 and 1959, [[film studio|studios]] were grappling with decreased revenues, and actors felt like they were being deprived of significant income that was owed to them. The studios, however, took a hardline stance on residuals for movie actors due to their shrinking revenue as well as the fact that if they paid residuals to actors, they would also have to pay directors and [[screenwriter]]s as well.&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Federman|first1=Wayne|title=What Reagan Did for Hollywood|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/what-reagan-did-for-hollywood/248391/|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Atlantic|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This stalemate led SAG actors to re-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] as SAG President in fall of 1959. Reagan asked SAG for a [[Strike action|strike]] authorization in February and the actors agreed on a work-stop date for March 7, 1960, Hollywood's first-ever industry-wide strike. Starting with [[Universal Pictures]], studios ended up agreeing to film residuals, but only for movies made after 1960s. They would issue a one-time payout of $2.25 million for movies made between 1948 and 1960, and movies made before 1948 would not be eligible for any residuals. (Unrelated to residuals, Reagan also secured [[health insurance]] and [[pension]]s for SAG actors.) This upset older actors like [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Bob Hope]], who blamed Reagan and the SAG board for weak negotiating, but in April 1960 SAG voted to accept the offer and returned to work.&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

In 1988, WGA launched [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|its longest strike]], lasting 22 weeks, over a disagreement over residuals for TV shows broadcast in foreign countries. The new contract allowed writers two formulas for calculating foreign residuals: the existing formula ($4,400 maximum for a one-hour show) or the new formula (1.2% of the producer's foreign sales). On the other hand, domestic residuals were adjusted to take a sliding scale, which would incentivize producers to [[Broadcast syndication|syndicate]] one-hour shows, whose revenue performance was poor, to independent TV stations.&lt;ref name="nyt1988"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmetz|first1=Aljean|title=Writers Ratify Contract, Ending Longest Strike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/movies/writers-ratify-contract-ending-longest-strike.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=8 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers]] (AMPTP), the industry bargaining group that deals with the trade unions, called for an end to the current residual payment system in response to the rise of online media. Instead, it proposed that residuals be pooled so the studios would recoup their costs paying the actors, directors, and writers based on a profit-based formula,&lt;ref name="ciep"&gt;{{cite news| last1 = Cieply | first1 =Michael | title =Hollywood Officials Seek End to System Of Paying Residuals| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/business/media/12hollywood-web.html |accessdate=3 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would solve the problem that residuals remain the same despite decreases in TV profits.&lt;ref name="handel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Handel|first1=Jonathan|title=Residuals Revelation: Network Primetime Residuals as Chilly for SAG/AFTRA and DGA as WGA|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/residuals-revelation-network-primetime-residuals-214646|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers in the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) decided to negotiate for higher residual payments. The AMPTP adamantly opposed extending residuals to online movie and TV show sales for at least three years, citing the need to "adapt to the realities of the marketplace, the new demands from our audiences and new technologies",&lt;ref name = "latimes"/&gt; while a WGA representative countered that they "already had effective business models".&lt;ref name = "ciep"/&gt;

In 2011, SAG-AFTRA, WGA, and DGA negotiations kept residuals for network primetime TV (considered "among the most lucrative" residuals) frozen at previous levels.&lt;ref name = "handel"/&gt;

== Process ==

Residuals are administered by the [[labor union|unions]]—[[SAG-AFTRA]], the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA), and the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA)—for their members, who are paid between one and four months after the air date. According to [[SAG-AFTRA]], it processes around 1.5 million residual checks a year.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; WGA receives between 100 and 5,000 residual checks a day.&lt;ref name = "survival"/&gt; The DGA processes "hundreds of thousands of checks" a year, and in 2016 it processed $300 million in residuals for its members.&lt;ref name="dga"&gt;{{cite web|title= Residuals |url=https://www.dga.org/The-Guild/Departments/Residuals.aspx|website=Directors Guild of America |accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual calculation is complex and depends on several variables, including guild membership, initial payment, time spent, type of production (e.g., network TV, DVD, ad-supported streaming, online purchases), and whether it involves a domestic or foreign market. Additionally, residuals change a lot: guilds negotiate new contracts with the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|AMPTP]] every three years, and residuals for primetime TV tend to increase every year because they are "directly or indirectly keyed to salary minimums, which increase several percent per year".&lt;ref name = "handel"/&gt;

In acting, [[Extra (acting)|extras]] are generally not eligible, but [[stunt performer]]s, [[puppeteer]]s, singers, and actors with lines or scripted physical interactions with characters ("supporting actors" or "day players") are eligible.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Residuals FAQ|url=https://www.sagaftra.org/content/residuals-faq|website=SAG-AFTRA|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal performers generally get larger residuals.&lt;ref name="market"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Andres |first1= Tommy| title=How do actors make money off residuals?|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2014/10/24/business/ive-always-wondered/how-do-actors-make-money-residuals|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Marketplace|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the more prominent the actor, the more generous the residual. Big stars like [[Tom Cruise]], for example, would get a portion of DVD sales in addition to his "regular" residuals.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handel|first1=Jonathan|title=Hollywood on Strike!: An Industry at War in the Internet Age|date=2011|publisher=Hollywood Analytics|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781438233857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZvLwaBN1uAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All "credited" writers are eligible for residuals, and the specific credit determines the amount of amount. For example, the "written by" credit yields a 100% residual allocation, "screenplay/teleplay by" yields a 75%, and "adaptation by" yields 10%.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;{{cite book|title=Residual Survivals Guide|date=October 2016|publisher=Writers Guild of America|url=http://www.wga.org/uploadedfiles/members/finances/residualssurvival2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Not super relevant?
Disabled members are not supposed to have [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]] ([[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]) removed from their residuals. Some studios do comply if the disabled member contacts the movie studio, but there are other studios that choose to violate the IRS rule.
--&gt;
=== Examples ===
Residual payments can sometimes be very small if the role was small or the movie or show was not successful. For example, actor [[Jeff Cohen (actor)|Jeff Cohen]] received a residual check for $0.67 after appearing in one episode of ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''; he took it to a former bar in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] called "Maeve's Re$iduals", which used to trade free drinks for any [[SAG-AFTRA]] residual checks for less than $1.&lt;ref name="bkstg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Jeff|title=Calculating SAG Residuals| url= https://www.backstage.com/news/calculating-sag-residuals/|accessdate=3 February 2018 |work=Backstage|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Bob Gunton]], who played Warden Norton in ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', noted that the movie, one of the most-rerun films, generated "close to six figures" in residuals for him in 2004, ten years after the movie was released, and even as of 2014, that he continued to receive "a very substantial income".&lt;ref name="bi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|title=The Actors From 'Shawshank Redemption' Still Make A 'Steady' Income Off TV Residual Checks|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/actors-from-shawshank-redemption-residual-pay-2014-6|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=Business Insider|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, actor [[Lisa Kudrow]] of ''[[Friends]]'' was ordered to pay $1.6 million to her former manager, who argued that he was owed 5% of Kudrow's residuals earnings from work that he negotiated.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothman|first1=Michael|title='Friends' Star Lisa Kudrow Loses $1.6 Million Lawsuit|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/friends-star-lisa-kudrow-loses-16-million-lawsuit/story?id=22681593|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=ABC News|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends star Lisa Kudrow must pay ex-manager $1.6m|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26381575|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=BBC|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using figures that were publicly disclosed, one analyst estimated Kudrow's residuals to be at least $2.3 million, and likely much higher.&lt;ref name="market"/&gt;

'''Simon de Vlieger''' (c. 1601, [[Rotterdam]] &amp;ndash; buried 13 March 1653, [[Weesp]]) was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] designer, [[drawing|draughtsman]], and [[Painting|painter]], most famous for his marine paintings.

==Life==
Born in Rotterdam, de Vlieger moved in 1634 to [[Delft]], where he joined the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], and then to [[Amsterdam]] in 1638, though he maintained a house in Rotterdam until 1650 when he moved to Weesp, a small town on the outskirts of Amsterdam. In the 1630s and 1640s he was one of the best-known Dutch maritime painters. He moved away from the [[monochrome]] style of [[Jan Porcellis]] and [[Willem van de Velde, the elder]] towards a more realistic use of colour, with highly detailed and accurate representations of rigging and ship construction. He painted ships in harbour and at sea as well as storms and shipwrecks.

In addition to painting, he designed [[tapestry|tapestries]], [[etching]]s, [[stained glass]] windows for the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in Amsterdam, and the [[organ screen]] for the St. Laurenskerk in [[Rotterdam]].

[[File:De_Vlieger_The_Fisherman_Onvolledige_(_unfinished).jpg|200px|thumb|The_Fisherman]]
His pupils included [[Willem van de Velde, the younger]], [[Adriaen van de Velde]], and [[Jan van de Cappelle]]. Jan van der Cappelle in fact owned 9 original De Vlieger paintings, and more than 1300 prints. When de Vleiger died in 1653, there were a number of unfinished, but still beautiful works. One of these, of a fisherman dragging nets to shore was sold by Jan van der Capelle to Joanna Six, wife of Simon van der Stel, and later shipped to the Cape of Good Hope where it was displayed at Groot Constantia, the home of van der Stel. His work was highly influential on the younger generation of maritime painters.

The '''Southland Art Foundation''', established in 1995, is a [[Southland, New Zealand]] art foundation that provides funding for a variety of art programs and scholarships for New Zealand artists. It was the successor to the Trustbank Southland Art Foundation, created by former [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]] Chairman, Dr Alf Poole CBE and former Southland Museum and Art Gallery Director, Russell Beck.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/118-1222/1665/,   Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association, 16-September-2005, Vol 118 No 1222, Alfred Philip Poole, Retrieved March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Hodges Fellowship==

The Southland Art Foundation 'Artist in Residence' programme began in 1996,&lt;ref name=beehive&gt;http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/opening-burwell-house-artist039s-residence-invercargill, Opening of Burwell House, Artist's Residence, Invercargill , Judith Tizard, Retrieved March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; having been proposed and developed by Michael A R Anderson, Head of Art Faculty, Southern Institute of Technology and by Wayne P Marriott, Art Gallery Manager, Southland Museum &amp; Art Gallery, .

Southland had previously hosted a number of one off opportunities for New Zealand artists to work in the region, during the 1980s. These had been the work of Russell Beck and Dr Alf Poole, former Director and former Chair, Southland Museum and Art Gallery. This culminated in 1990 with the Art in the Sub-Antarctic programme, which provided an opportunity for Bill Hammond, Geerda Leenards, Shaun Burdon, Chester Nealie, Helen Mitchell, Lloyd Godman and Laurence Aberhardt, amongst others to participate in the joint Museum and DOC residency on the Sub-Antarctic Islands. Godman proposed the concept of the project as far back as 1984 and was instrumental in the organization as was Lou Sanson, Conservator for the Southland Conservancy in charge of Fiordland National Park, Stewart Island and the Subantarctic World Heritage Area.

Anderson saw the residency as an opportunity to expose the Southland community, and the students of the Southern Institute of Technology, to the creative genius of some of New Zealand's greatest living artists.

Artists are required to spend time at the Southern Institute of Technology and also to work in and around Southland.

In 1999 the Trustees–Shirley Palmer, Gwen Neave, Russell Beck and Wayne P Marriott resolved to rename the Artist in Residence programme the [[William Hodges Fellowship]]. This was in recognition of the acquisition of [[William Hodges]] "Maori before a Waterfall", 1773 by the Southland Museum and Art Gallery in 1998. Hodges was regarded as the first artist in residence in Southland, having depicted the flora, fauna and people of the region during [[Captain Cook]]'s second voyage to New Zealand.

==Burwell House==

In 2000, Burwell House, a former 1878 Doctors residence of Invercargill Public Hospital was converted into a residence and studio for artists, and officially opened by Hon. [[Judith Tizard]], Associate Minister, Arts, Culture and Heritage that year.&lt;ref name=beehive/&gt;

The original architect was F W Burwell; Burwell House was constructed in 1879.&lt;ref name=historic&gt;http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=7777&amp;m=advanced, Dee Street Hospital (Former), Retrieved March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southland Museum and Art Gallery leased the property in 1988 and undertook some external restoration on the buildings. It used the Central Block for storage and in 2000 refurbished the South Wing for use as the accommodation for the artist-in-residence program.&lt;ref name=historic/&gt;

Athletics were an important part of the cultural life of Ancient Greeks. Depictions of boxing and [[bull-leaping]] can be found back to the [[Bronze Age Greece|Bronze Age]].  Buildings were created for the sole use of athletics including [[Stadion (running race)|stadions]], [[palaestra]], and [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]]. Starting in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]], [[Panhellenic Games]], including the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], begin taking place each year. These games gave people from all over Greece the chance to gain fame for their athletic prowess. Athletics in Greece became one of the most commonly depicted scenes of everyday life in their art.

== Architecture relating to athletics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

As the site of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], the architecture of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] is heavily influenced by the theme of athletics. The temple of Zeus, for example, is decorated with a frieze containing the 12 labors of [[Heracles]], who is believed to be the founder of the Olympic Games, and a [[Eastern Pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia|pediment]] depicting the myth of [[Pelops]], another origin tale of the Olympics. 
[[File:Stadium at Olympia 2013.JPG|thumb|Birth of the Olympic Games in the Stadium at Olympia]]
The main site of where the Olympic Games took place was the [[Stadium at Olympia]] which is located to the east of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|sanctuary of Zeus]]. The physical landmarks of the Stadium are 212.54 meters long and 30–34 meters wide, and it served mainly for running races that determined the fastest person in the world. The track was made of hard-packed clay to serve as traction for the people competing in the running events.

The site of Nemea showcase both the practical and ceremonial use of athletic architecture in the early Hellenistic monumentalization of Panhellenic sanctuaries. The bath house [[Nemean Baths]] contains a western room with basin baths and an eastern plunge bath. The western basin room is common of 4th century baths throughout Greece and was likely place where visiting athletes could wash themselves during their stay. The eastern plunge bath however, is one of only 4 others in Greece, all of which have been found at Panhellenic ritual sites. Though its exact function is unknown, its public nature suggests that it may have had a ritual component in the athletic games or ceremonies. Nemea also housed a stadium, where athletes would participate in games, specifically the stadion (running event).

== Depictions of Games ==

During the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] practiced several sports, including wrestling, bull jumping, acrobatics, and boxing. This is apparent in multiple pieces of art, ranging from frescoes to pottery. The youth of the boys in the [[Akrotiri Boxer Fresco]] hints that athletes began training very early on in life, suggesting that sports were extremely important to Minoan society. It has even been suggested that athletics played a religious role in society due to their widespread practice. Finally, the youth of athletes in many pieces of artwork indicates that athletic competition may have been a rite if passage into adulthood for the Minoans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhw.gr/olympics/ancient/en/102.html|title=OLYMPIC GAMES|website=www.fhw.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular and famous combat sports in Ancient Greece was [[boxing]]. Boxing in Ancient Greece was far less regulated than modern boxing, with opponents chosen at random, regardless of weight or age, and matches lasting until one of the competitors admitted defeat or was left unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/boxing.html|title=Ancient Sports: Boxing|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighters were often left disfigured; for example, one boxing injury commonly depicted was the [[cauliflower ear]], which was depicted notably in the [[Boxer Stele Fragment from Kerameikos|Boxer Stele from Kerameikos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many who participated in these ancient boxing matches were gravely injured or even killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-bloody-deadly-heavy-fights-of-ancient-greece|title=The Bloody, Deadly, Heavy Fights of Ancient Greece {{!}} FIGHTLAND|work=Fightland|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, boxing was highly popular among the Ancient Grecian population and therefore was frequently featured on works of art. Another notable depiction of an ancient boxer is [[Boxer at Rest]], also known as Terme Boxer, who has just finished a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2013/the-boxer|title=The Boxer: An Ancient Masterpiece Comes to the Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Boeotian Dancer's Group Kothon, Black Figure Tripod, 6th Century B.C.|kothon, black-figure tripod by the Boeotian Dancer's Group]] features two men engaged in a boxing match on one of its legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.artstor.org/#/asset/AMICO_DALLAS_103842516|title=Artstor|last=Artstor|website=library.artstor.org|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic events, particularly [[Panhellenic festivals]], brought drew both athletes and spectators. Occurrences of athletic competitions were first recorded by [[Homer]] in the [[Iliad]]. As a result, competitions had ties with war and military training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/abccliow/development_of_the_concept_of_sport_in_the_greek_world/0|title=Development of the Concept of Sport in the Greek World - World History Encyclopedia - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of athletic events in ancient art sometimes show the athletes wearing armor in order to illustrate the connection between athletes and warriors.

Depictions of athletic events were also portrayed on pieces of pottery used in everyday life. Artists like [[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]] and the [[Foundry Painter]] depicted events such as [[Pankration|pancration]] scenes and wrestling matches on kylixes which were then used at [[symposium]]s or male drinking parties. Both of these painters used the red-figure technique, developed in Athens in 530 B.C., in their work and this technique allowed them to have greater freedom to express movement, emotion, and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vase/hd_vase.htm|title=Athenian Vase Painting: Black- and Red-Figure Techniques {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Greek and Roman|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depictions of Athletic events in Art expanded as major athletic events also expanded. In 708 BCE, the [[pentathlon]] was added to the Olympic games. Since this event required the skills for five different events ([[Discus throw|discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], [[long jump]], [[running]], and [[wrestling]]) these athletes were held in high regard among society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TC006EN.html|title=Ancient Olympics|website=ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became common to have a [[Kylix depicting Pentathletes|kylix]] or an amphora depict these events, and in turn, it praised the athletes by leaving their legacy in the art.

The [[Kleophrades Terracotta Panathenaic Prize Amphora|Kleophrades terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora]] (ca. 500 BCE) provides an example of recognition for success in athletic endeavors. At the [[Panathenaic Games]], victors would be awarded a prize amphora filled with a luxury good like olive oil. The amphora itself would depict [[Athena Promachos]], or Athena as a military leader directing troops into battle, and the athletic event in which the victor competed. Recognition for athletic endeavors and success by depicting the event itself as this Panathenaic prize amphora does highlights just how important athleticism was to the Ancient Greeks. Another example of the many Panathenaic Prize Amphoras is the [[Euphiletos Painter Panathenaic Amphora]] (530 BC). Painted in black figure, this Panathenaic amphora depicts a [[Stadion (running race)|stadion]] from Panathenaic games. Like other prize amphora, this amphora serves to emphasize athleticism and the victors of these events.
[[File:Terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora MET DT5498.jpg|thumb|207x207px|[[Kleophrades terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora|Panthenaic Amphora By Kleophrades Painter]]]]
Descriptions of women’s sport during Archaic Period mainly come from literary sources, and there are a few examples of female sporting events. One of the most popular forms of physical activity for ancient Greek women is running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.|first=Mills, Brett|date=|title=Women of Ancient Greece: Participating in Sport?.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED370951|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bronze Statuette of Athletic Spartan Girl|bronze statuettes of athletic Spartan girl]], which depicts Spartan young women involving in racing games, provide material evidence to the accounts of different women’s races in ancient Greece.

== Athletic Dedications ==

The prominence of athletic subject material in Greek art is no coincidence. Even statuary, called Athletic Dedications, arose as a way to immortalize Greek athletes and athletic games. Athletic events and art were so closely related that a common practice of athletes was to commemorate their victories with artistic dedications. One example of this would be the marble [[Apobates Base]] which commemorates victory in a chariot race at the [[Panathenaic Games]]. A competitor would erect a dedication to celebrate an athletic victory and place it in a sanctuary or Panhellenic site.  These dedications were an artistic celebration of athletic prowess which every Greek could observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/greek-art/beginners-guide-greece/a/olympic-games|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AGMA Victorious Apobates 7305.jpg|thumb|[[Apobates Base]]]]
As part of the games taking place at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], many individuals competed in the pentathlon, a competition consisting of five events. The [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon|Ancient Olympic Pentathlon]] consisted of the [[discus throw]], [[long jump]]s with weights attached to their feet, [[javelin throw]], [[running]], and [[wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/pentathlon.html|title=Ancient Olympic Events|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many victors of the pentathlon would go on to receive prizes such as exclusive items that were made specifically for the victor. For example, the amphorae of the [[Panathenaic Games]], often filled with expensive olive oil, featured [[Athena]] standing with a sword and shield to represent their victory in the games.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Bothmer|first=Dietrich|date=|title=A Panathenaic Amphora|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257530.pdf.bannered.pdf|journal=Metropolitan Museum of Art|volume=|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Olympics were dedicated to [[Zeus]], often these prizes would become votive dedications to him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Bronze Diskos Thrower Statue|Bronze Diskos Thrower]] (''Discobolus'') was a rare commodity that came from a time in which not many pieces survived: the end of the Persian Wars. The piece itself still exhibits many traits of archaic art, despite coming from the early Classical period (480 - 460 BCE). The athlete in the statue was a participant of diskos throwing, a very popular event in Ancient Greece and even modern day Olympics.

'''''The Kid Stays in the Picture''''' is a 1994 autobiography by film producer [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]].  A [[film adaptation]] of the book was released in 2002.

The title comes from a line attributed to studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who was defending Evans after some of the actors involved in the film ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957) had recommended he be removed from the cast.

The film adaptation was directed by [[Nanette Burstein]] and [[Brett Morgen]] and released by [[USA Films]]. It was screened out of competition at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3110701/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Kid Stays in the Picture |accessdate=2009-11-04 |work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Book===
The book chronicles Evans' rise from childhood to radio star to film star to production chief of [[Paramount Pictures]] to independent producer, his marriage to [[Ali MacGraw]], his downfall including his 1980 cocaine bust and implication in the murder of [[Roy Radin]], aka "The Cotton Club Murder", his banishment from Paramount Pictures, and his return to the studio in the early 1990s.

A revised edition of the book, published in 1995, adds several chapters of new material, including material on his projects after his return to Paramount Pictures.

===Film===
The film version, released in 2002, utilizes Evans' narration interspersed mostly with photographs from Evans' life as well as brief film footage from films such as ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'', ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and ''[[The Godfather]]'', along with interviews to tell the story from his discovery by [[Norma Shearer]] for ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957) to his return to Paramount Pictures.

According to the commentary by directors Burstein and Morgen on the DVD, many elements from the book, such as Evans' childhood and his other marriages (the film focuses only on his marriage to Ali MacGraw), were dropped because they felt it did not move the story along.

==Critical response==
The film received mostly positive reviews. As of April 8, 2012, it had a 92% "Certified Fresh" rating on the movie review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a score of 7.4 out of 10 on [[IMDb]], based on 4,077 reviews.

==Stage production==
An adaptation of the book—along with material from a further, unpublished volume of Evans' memoirs—for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage was announced in 2010, to be written by [[Jon Robin Baitz]] and directed by [[Richard Eyre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Hollywood Player Inspires a Broadway Play |author=Michael Cieply |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/theater/11evans.html?_r=1&amp;hpw |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=February 10, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the production was canceled in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/156769-PLAYBILL-ON-OPENING-NIGHT-Private-Lives-Keeping-Up-with-the-Chases |title=Playbill on Opening Night: ''Private Lives'' – Keeping Up with the Chases |author=Harry Haun |date=November 18, 2011 |work=Playbill.com |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419165412/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/156769-PLAYBILL-ON-OPENING-NIGHT-Private-Lives-Keeping-Up-with-the-Chases |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another stage adaptation of the book was first performed at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]] in 2017. It was adapted by the [[Complicite]] theatre company and directed by [[Simon McBurney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/kid-stays-picture |title=the kid stays in the picture - Royal Court |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included [[Danny Huston]], son of [[John Huston]], who worked with Evans on ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.

[[File:Studiolo_di_belfiore,_thalia_di_michele_pannonio,_budapest_2.jpg|thumb|350px]]
'''''Thalia''''' is a c.1546 painting by [[Michele Pannonio]], signed by the artist and produced for the 'studiolo' in Belfiore, begun by [[Lionello d'Este]] in 1447 and completed by his brother Borso in 1463. After the palace's destruction by fire in 1632 its paintings were dispersed - ''Thalia'' is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Budapest. 

Long misidentified as [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], the work is one of the few known works by the artist, active in [[Ferrara]] but of Hungarian origins.

Monteleone argues that the [[War on Drugs]] cannot be won, that criminalization creates a "phantom economy" dominated by violent criminals, and that drug prohibition is a violation of [[individual liberty]].&lt;ref name="afsg" /&gt; Monteleone is an admirer of [[Ayn Rand]], and has described her book ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' as a "person barometer".&lt;ref name="sm" /&gt; Monteleone has also criticized the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] for bringing an [[antitrust]] [[United States v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1731">There are numerous active artist-run initiatives (ARIs) in the [[United Kingdom]], often working around and critiquing the functioning of larger art institutions and organisations. An ARI is a project independently run by visual artists which generally showcases the work of local and emerging artists; many exist on low budgets and are managed by artist collectives. In the UK, ARIs tend to be smaller and less permanent than public and municipal organisations and can, for example, become established for the duration of an event or for the period of a lease on a property. 

Most ARIs in the UK are funded by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]], the national development agency for the arts in the UK, distributing public money from Government and the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]].

City Racing: The Life and Times of an Artist-Run Gallery, published in 2002 is a revealing account by the artists, of a ten-year-long ARI based in London from 1988-1998

'''Willem van de Velde the Younger''' (bapt. 18 December 1633; died 6 April 1707) was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[marine painter]].

==Biography==
Willem van de Velde was baptised on 18 December 1633 in [[Leiden]], [[Holland]], [[Dutch Republic]].

A son of [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]], also a painter of sea-pieces, Willem van de Velde, the younger, was instructed by his father, and afterwards by [[Simon de Vlieger]], a marine painter of repute at the time, and had achieved great celebrity by his art before he came to [[London]]. By 1673 he had moved to England, where he was engaged by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], at a salary of £100, to aid his father in "taking and making draughts of sea-fights", his part of the work being to reproduce in color the drawings of the elder Van de Velde. He was also patronized by the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] and by various members of the nobility.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He died on 6 April 1707 in [[London]], [[England]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and was buried at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St. James's Church]].

His brother [[Adriaen van de Velde]] was also an artist.

==Works==
[[File:Willem_van_de_Velde_II_-_Dutch_men-o'-war_and_other_shipping_in_a_calm.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dutch men-o'-war and other shipping in a calm''. c. 1665]]
{{double image|right|Het Kanonschot - Canon fired (Willem van de Velde II, 1707).jpg|151|De Windstoot - A ship in need in a raging storm (Willem van de Velde II, 1707).jpg|148|The pendants ''The cannon shot'' and ''The gust'' (c. 1680), in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]}}

Most of Van de Velde's finest works represent views off the coast of Holland, with Dutch shipping. His best productions are delicate, spirited and finished in handling, and correct in the drawing of the vessels and their rigging. The numerous figures are tellingly introduced, and the artist is successful in his renderings of sea, whether in calm or storm.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The ships are portrayed with almost photographic accuracy, and are the most precise guides available to the appearance of 17th-century ships.

There are a number of van de Velde's marine paintings in the [[Wallace Collection]], London, including "The Embarkation of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] at [[Scheveningen]], 1660".
