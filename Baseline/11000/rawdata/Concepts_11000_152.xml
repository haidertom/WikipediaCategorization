The '''2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl''', nicknamed '''The Crosstown Punch-Out''', was a [[bench-clearing brawl]] that took place at the end of the 2011 edition of the [[Crosstown Shootout]] [[college basketball]] game between the [[University of Cincinnati]] [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats]] and the [[Xavier University]] [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Musketeers]].  The game took place on December 10, 2011 at Xavier's home arena, the [[Cintas Center]] in [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]].

==Background==
The Crosstown Shootout has always been one of the more intense rivalries in college basketball, all the more so because Xavier and UC are only two miles ({{convert|2|mi|disp=output only}}) apart. There has always been a fair amount of [[trash talk]] between the two schools, and the 2011 game was no different. On December 8, UC guard [[Sean Kilpatrick]] told Andy Furman of [[WCVX|WQRT]] that Xavier's All-American guard [[Tu Holloway]] probably wouldn't start for the Bearcats "with the players that we have now."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Shannon. [http://cincinnati.com/blogs/xavier/2011/12/08/kilpatrick-holloway-wouldnt-start-at-uc Kilpatrick: Holloway wouldn't start at UC]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series had developed a history of bad blood in the years leading up to the 2011 Crosstown Shootout.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2008''', a total of ''six'' technicals were called in a 76-66 XU win.  XU's Derrick Brown was ejected, and two freshman post players were involved in an altercation that included a heavy dose of foreshadowing: XU's [[Kenny Frease]] head-butted UC's [[Yancy Gates]] (both players received technicals).  The altercation between Frease and Gates in 2008 set the tone for bad blood between the two, and may have motivated Gates to seek revenge in 2011.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2009''', multiple verbal exchanges resulting in UC clearing their bench as well as technicals called on XU's [[Jordan Crawford]] and UC's Rashad Bishop in XU's double overtime win.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2010''', Xavier's Tu Holloway received a technical foul for throwing an elbow late in UC's 66-46 win.&lt;br&gt;

==The brawl==
The game was close at first, with eight ties and six lead changes in the first half. Xavier led 34-25 at halftime.&lt;ref name=Enquirergamestory&gt;Russell, Shannon. [http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20111210/SPT0102/312100035 Brouhaha mars Xavier's 76-53 win against UC at Cintas Center]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first sign of trouble occurred in the closing seconds of the first half, when Bearcat backup [[Octavius Ellis]] began exchanging some words with Xavier player [[Mark Lyons]] from the bench. Ellis jumped up from the bench to confront Lyons, and the two players had to be separated. Before the start of the second half, according to Xavier coach [[Chris Mack (basketball)|Chris Mack]], both teams were warned that any further incident would result in [[technical foul]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Zac. [http://www.foxsportsohio.com/12/10/11/Xavier-UC-rivalry-hits-rock-bottom/landing.html?blockID=623940&amp;feedID=3725 Xavier-UC rivalry hits rock bottom]. [[Fox Sports Ohio]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Musketeers started the second half on a 9-2 run and were never seriously threatened afterward.&lt;ref name=APESPN&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=313442752 Bench-clearing melee halts end of Xavier's rout of Cincinnati]. [[Associated Press]] via [[ESPN]], 2011-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the Musketeers outscored the Bearcats 42-28 in the second half.&lt;ref name=Enquirergamestory/&gt;

With 18.6 seconds remaining, [[Tu Holloway]] scored a layup to give the Musketeers the 76-53 lead. As Holloway walked to the other end of the court, he began shouting at the Bearcat bench, bringing UC's Ge'Lawn Guyn over to confront him, leading to an argument between both men. As Guyn reached for Holloway's throat, Xavier's [[Dezmine Wells]] intervened by pushing Guyn to the ground,&lt;ref name=APESPN/&gt; causing UC's [[Yancy Gates]] to throw the ball at Holloway's head, and both benches to empty. In the ensuing fight, Gates punched Xavier's Kenny Frease in the face, opening up a large cut under Frease's left eye and knocking him to the ground. As Frease tried to crawl away from the crowd, UC's Cheikh Mbodj stomped on the back of his head. Ellis threw a punch at Lyons, causing him and Wells to throw several back, before coaches got in between them. This brought Gates over, who began shouting and throwing more punches at a Xavier backup, until Xavier assistant [[Aaron Williams (basketball)|Aaron Williams]] and Lyons calmed him down.&lt;ref name=Highlights&gt;[http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=7339298 ESPN highlights of game]&lt;/ref&gt; Referees Michael Roberts, Jeff Anderson, and Tony Crisp ended the game with 9.4 seconds remaining, giving Xavier the 76-53 win. UC's Gates and Mbodj, and Xavier's Wells were retroactively ejected from the game for fighting. Under NCAA rules, they were suspended for their next game, a sanction that cannot be appealed.

Immediately following the incident, both sides were escorted to the tunnels at either end of the court so that they would enter their respective locker rooms. However, due to the chaos of the brawl, both teams entered through the tunnels opposite from where they were supposed to go. This would have resulted in another confrontation in the hallways beneath the Cintas Center stands as both teams would have had to cross each other in the narrow hallway leading to their locker rooms. To avoid this, the Xavier team was corralled into the south tunnel leading out of the main arena. Once the UC players were off the court and had filed through the north tunnel to their locker room, the Xavier players were brought back out and began celebrating with the remaining fans and students still in the stands. This however resulted in an incident between the Xavier players and the Cincinnati fans who began yelling obscenities at one another. Security again had to get involved to keep the two groups away from each other.

==Aftermath==
UC coach [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]], angry at how his players behaved, ordered them to take off their jerseys in the locker room, and in some cases physically took them off. In his postgame comments, a visibly angry Cronin said that he told his players not to put them on again "until they have a full understanding of where they go to school and what the university stands for and how lucky they are to even be there, let alone have a scholarship." He also hinted that several players could face suspensions, and possibly dismissal from the team, saying that he was going to review the tape with school president [[Gregory H. Williams]] and athletic director Whit Babcock "and decide who's going to be on my team going forward." He also appeared to blame the referees for not taking control of the situation sooner (threats of technicals after the first-half incident notwithstanding), saying that Musketeer players were yelling at his bench for the whole game and even cursing at his coaches. Cronin said he tried to call a time out before the brawl broke out so the players could go to their respective benches, but couldn't get the officials' attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobearcats.com/allaccess/?media=273285 Mick Cronin postgame comments]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the postgame interview, Holloway claimed the Bearcats had "disrespected" his teammates in the run-up to the game. He also said, "We went out there and zipped them up at the end of the game." He also added that he and his teammates considered themselves "gangsters, not thugs, but tough guys on the court." Lyons added, "If somebody puts their hand in your face or tries to do something to you, where we're from you're gonna do something back."&lt;ref name=Highlights/&gt;

Later that night, Cronin spoke with [[ESPN]]'s [[Andy Katz]] and reiterated that there would be additional suspensions coming. "Nobody is going to walk on our side," he said. He also said this was the most embarrassing moment of his coaching career. Mack was somewhat more restrained in his remarks, saying he wasn't "in a position to be a decision maker," but that his players needed to learn "how to handle themselves and not let that happen again." 
Earlier, Mack had tweeted, "If my players say they've been taught to be tough their whole life, they mean ON THE FLOOR. Nothing else is condoned."&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;[[Andy Katz|Katz, Andy]]. [http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7339184/cincinnati-bearcats-coach-embarrassed-brawl-xavier-musketeers Penalties pending after Cincinnati brawl]. [[ESPN]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both schools' presidents issued statements condemning the brawl. UC's Williams strongly supported Cronin's postgame remarks, saying that the brawl was "not what we expect of representatives of the University of Cincinnati" and that school officials would "act swiftly and firmly" to ensure it never happened again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121011aaa.html Statement on brawl from UC president Gregory Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier's [[Michael J. Graham]] called the brawl "unsportsmanlike" and apologized to Xavier's fans and "the entire Cincinnati community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goxavier.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121011aaa.html Statement from Xavier president Michael J. Graham]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] and [[Atlantic 10 Conference]], the home conferences for UC and Xavier respectively at the time, also condemned the brawl and promised to hand down additional suspensions if they felt the schools haven't acted harshly enough.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

On December 11, both schools announced suspensions for the players involved. UC suspended Gates, Mbodj and Ellis for six games each, and Guyn for one game. Cronin said that the four players would still have to earn their way back onto the team even after they serve out their suspensions.  At the very least, Cronin said, they would have to sincerely apologize on camera and complete several other unspecified tasks. Xavier suspended Wells and Landen Amos for four games, Lyons for two and Holloway for one.  Xavier athletic director Mike Bobinski also apologized for Holloway and Lyons' postgame remarks. Mack said that Holloway was suspended specifically for his postgame comments, and admitted that neither he nor Lyons should have been before the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7341744/cincinnati-bearcats-suspend-four-players-brawl-xavier-musketeers Cincinnati, Xavier reveal suspensions]. [[ESPN]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, Mack, Holloway, Lyons and Xavier Athletic Director Mike Bobinski all apologized for what occurred.  Mike Bobinski said, "It was an embarrassment. It was a disappointment at every level. We take full responsibility for the role that we played in those events and are resolved to whatever is necessary to see to it that it never happens again."&lt;ref name="cincinnati.com"&gt;[http://cincinnati.com/blogs/xavier/2011/12/11/bobinski-mack-holloway-apologize/]&lt;/ref&gt; Tu Holloway also apologized for post game comments saying, "Myself, I used the wrong choice of words. I represent Xavier University, my family and myself and I really apologize for what took place."&lt;ref name="cincinnati.com"/&gt;

On December 12, an emotional Gates apologized for his actions, saying they were "not what my family is about."  Guyn, Ellis and Mbodj also apologized.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Bill. [http://cincinnati.com/blogs/uc/2011/12/12/tearful-yancy-gates-uc-apologize-for-role-in-xaiver-game Tearful Yancy Gates, UC apologize for role in Xavier game]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[Hamilton County, Ohio]] prosecutor [[Joe Deters]] said he was considering filing criminal charges related to the brawl.  Under Ohio law, Deters' office would handle the case if the charges rose to the level of felonies; Cincinnati city solicitor John Curp would prosecute if they are only misdemeanors. There is no known instance of criminal charges being filed as a result of a brawl at an NCAA game.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Kimball.[http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20111212/SPT0101/312120055 Prosecutors explore possible criminal charges for UC, Xavier]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Deters announced he would not file charges. He also indicated that Gates and Frease had "reached out to each other privately", and that Frease was satisfied with a personal apology from Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7352151/no-charges-cincinnati-bearcats-xavier-musketeers-brawl-prosecutor-says |title=Prosecutor: No charges in brawl |author=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that same day XU athletic Director Mike Bobinski used head coach Chris Mack's radio show to again apologize and take questions from fans concerning the incident.

On December 18, prior to Xavier's game against Oral Roberts, Mack took the floor again to apologize for the incident that had occurred in the previous game. Mack said, "We were all embarrassed by our behavior last weekend," and added, "It's extremely disappointing and in no way was a representation of what our university and our basketball program is all about."&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/story/2011-12-18/xavier-oral-roberts-holloway-lyons/52049068/1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to the incident, Xavier and UC officials decided to move the game to [[U.S. Bank Arena]] for at least the next two seasons and rename it the Crosstown Classic. Player and fan behavior was extensively reevaluated after the 2013 game, and was said to be a major factor in the decision to continue the series beyond the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20120521/SPT01/305210101/Exclusive-Crosstown-Shootout-set-U-S-Bank-Arena  |title=Exclusive: Crosstown Shootout set for U.S. Bank Arena |first=Bill |last=Koch |newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crosstown Shootout Gets New Name, Venue|url=http://www.wlwt.com/news/sports/Crosstown-Shootout-to-get-new-name-venue/-/9837968/14860932/-/oofsoq/-/index.html|publisher=[[WLWT]]|date=14 June 2012|access-date=2012-12-14|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209090751/http://www.wlwt.com/news/sports/Crosstown-Shootout-to-get-new-name-venue/-/9837968/14860932/-/oofsoq/-/index.html|archive-date=2013-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, 2014, the two schools announced a 10-year agreement to continue the series, alternating between campuses, and to revert the name of the series back to the Crosstown Shootout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xavier, UC reach 10-year agreement to continue Crosstown Shootout, with rivalry returning to campuses |url=http://www.xavier.edu/news/Xavier-UC-reach-10-year-agreement-to-continue-Crosstown-Shootout-with-rivalry-returning-to-campuses.cfm#.VNmKWJ_X-_Q |website=xu.edu|publisher=Xavier University|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adaptive bias''' is the idea that the [[human brain]] has [[evolution|evolved]] to [[reason]] adaptively, rather than truthfully or even rationally, and that [[cognitive bias]] may have evolved as a mechanism to reduce the overall '''cost''' of cognitive errors as opposed to merely reducing the '''number''' of cognitive errors, when faced with [[decision-making|making a decision]] under conditions of [[uncertainty]].

==Error Management Theory==
According to [[Error Management Theory]], when making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, two kinds of errors need to be taken into account—"[[false positive]]s", i.e. deciding that a risk or benefit exists when it does not, and "[[false negative]]s", i.e. failing to notice a risk or benefit that exists. False positives are also commonly called "Type I errors", and false negatives are called "Type II errors".

Where the cost or impact of a Type I error is much greater than the cost of a Type II error (e.g. the water is safe to drink), it can be worthwhile to bias the decision-making system towards making fewer Type I errors, i.e. making it less likely to conclude that a particular situation exists. This by definition would also increase the number of Type II errors. Conversely, where a false positive is much less costly than a false negative (blood tests, smoke detectors), it makes sense to bias the system towards maximising the probability that a particular (very costly) situation will be recognised, even if this often leads to the (relatively un-costly) event of noticing something that is not actually there. This situation is exhibited in modern airport screening—maximising the probability of preventing a high-cost terrorist event results in frequent, low-cost screening hassles for harmless travelers who represent a minimal threat.

{{harvtxt|Haselton|Buss|2003}} state that cognitive bias can be expected to have developed in humans for cognitive tasks where:
* decision-making is complicated by a significant signal-detection problem (i.e. when there is uncertainty)
* the solution to the particular kind of decision-making problem has had a recurrent effect on survival and [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] throughout evolutionary history
* the costs of a "false positive" or "false negative" error dramatically outweighs the cost of the alternative type of error

==The costly information hypothesis==
The costly information hypothesis is used to explore how adaptive biases relate to cultural evolution within the field of [[dual inheritance theory]]. The focus is on the evolutionary trade-offs in cost between individual learning, (e.g., [[operant conditioning]]) and [[Social learning theory|social learning]]. If more accurate information that could be acquired through individual learning is too costly, evolution may favor learning mechanisms that, in turn, are biased towards less costly, (though potentially less accurate), information via social learning.

'''Ahmet Güneştekin''' (born December 22, 1966) is a [[Kurds|Kurdish]] visual artist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/world/middleeast/sifting-through-anatolias-dark-sins-and-bright-cultures.html&lt;/ref&gt; whose works span [[painting]], [[conceptual art]] and constructions [[sculpture]]. For Ahmet Güneştekin, a self-taught artist, art is a passion which has driven him since his childhood. He left the town of Batman for Istanbul in 1991, but had to wait several years before he found his own style at the beginning of the 2000s. He then abandoned the figurative to launch himself into a “narrative abstraction”. This kind of production is loaded with the recollection of a vernacular art, the memory of motifs such as carpets, lamps, Ottoman copperware in which geometry is the leading force.

Güneştekin uses a unique technique with an individual method and precision. After establishing a complex web of black [[acrylic paint]], he fills each of the small spaces with a layer of oil paint, ranging from the light to the dark. Then, using a sort of pen with a rubber tip, he engraves into the paint, and writes as a [[calligrapher]] would on a book. He writes on his paintings by removing material, a principle which has more in common with [[sculpture]] than [[painting]].

After the agreement he signed with the London-based [[Marlborough Gallery]] – one of the world’s top five reputable galleries – in 2013, Ahmet Güneştekin made room for himself in the international art market.  Marlborough’s first move was to open an exhibition in the same timeframe as the 55th [[Venice Biennial]]. When Massimiliano Gioni, listed Güneştekin’s ‟Momentum of Memory” exhibition among the ‟Top 10 exhibitions to see,” the media couldn’t remain indifferent. Güneştekin’s works appeared in high circulation Italian dailies such as [[Il Manifesto]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ilmanifesto.info/il-passato-oscuro/&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Repubblica]], [[La Stampa]]. Naturally, his works drew the attention of the art circle.  
         
In November 2013, [[Marlborough Gallery]] opened its doors in New York to Güneştekin. After making a flamboyant introduction for Güneştekin with a solo exhibition, “Ahmet Güneştekin: Recent Paintings” between 26 November and 4 January 2014, Marlborough Gallery prepared an intensive program for 2014. The exhibitions that began in January with Arco Madrid was followed by the New York [[Armory Show]], Art Breda, and [[Art Basel]] Hong Kong. Afterward Marlborough Monaco Gallery opened a solo exhibition by Ahmet Güneştekin from 18 September to 14 November. His works are on display at the Marlborough Galleries in Barcelona, Madrid, Monaco and New York at their permanent exhibition halls all the year round.

Güneştekin’s works can be briefly described as the interpretation of the oral narratives, [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] from [[Ancient Anatolians|Anatolian]], [[Mesopotamian]] and Greek civilizations using free technique. He creates [[optical]] and vibrant works, with the solar disc as one of his occurring motifs. The figurative way of expression is present in all his oeuvres, even though in an abstract stylized way. In all his contemporaneous works, the characters, symbols and scenes are taken out of ancient times, and these characters are symbolic, woven in symbolic tales about the essential questions of mankind.

== Style and Technique ==

Ahmet Güneştekin realizes his works by adopting diverse methods. Gradient optics, dimensional canvases, flat canvases, sun explosions and installations expose his main approach that is to stay out of conventional practices applied on canvas. His art works are composed of charming colours, intricately combined layers, and the tales of the [[ancient times]]. The Kurdish artist thinks that [[mythology]] is the source of all beginnings. Yedizim, as of a dualist religion, has first emerged in the ancient [[Mesopotamia]], rests on the belief that people make distinctions between the good and the evil. The narratives of the culture and its peculiar imitations spontaneously offer precise choices.

However, Güneştekin aims not only to convey messages, also he tries to reveal his own mythology and truths, by expressing himself painting and narrating the diversity of the culture. The characters of the myths he draw are also the ancient characters of the [[Greek mythology]]. For Güneştekin, there actually appears no difference between Shahmeran, one of the ancient mythological creatures of Mesopotamia and [[Medusa]] in Greek mythology. The effect of embroidery can be best observed in artist’s recent paintings. The drawings and the circles are combined in one geometric structure, and the uses of the colours radically effect the eye. They also provide a narrative, for the symbols and emotions put forward all these elements in the paintings. The refined and meticulously cultivated colour palettes and drawings which they have comprised in harmony are the base of Güneştekin’s works.

[[Mesopotamia]], where the artist was born, and [[Anatolia]], the [[mythological creatures]] such as Phoenix or the [[Peacock Angel]], form Güneştekin’s most important source of inspiration. The glowing sun marks his peculiar signature. His method of oil painting is a model that reveals itself in adopting embroiderer’s patient work that is to knit and adorn, and to make a drawing model out of it. The diverse uses of the light, the thickness of the lines and the colours, and their density pave the way to gross geometric forms. His oil paintings are the outcome of a hard and dense work process, and give the impression that they are magnified by sculpturing. His colossal works and his paintings resemble the historical art works that are consist of archaeological fragments and figures. However, the most enchanting form he adopts is the glitter of his genuine light globes.

== Following the Traces of the Sun with the Masters ==

Ahmet Güneştekin traced and compiled ancient [[myths]], oral narratives and [[legend]]s of [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as of 1997. He took excursions to the villages and towns of Anatolia and Mesopotamia and conducted in-depth researches since 2003. He set up art exhibitions in the historical sights and public spaces together with many artists from contemporary art, sculpture and photography. The series of the exhibition titled ''Following the Traces of the Sun with the Masters'' brought about his first major exhibition, ''The Colors after Darkness''.

== Documentary Films ==

Güneştekin became the art director of the news show Haberci, produced and directed by [[Coşkun Aral]] in 2005.

== Children's Art Classes ==

In his excursions to Anatolia and Mesopotamia, Ahmet Güneştekin provided painting classes to the children so that they can learn how to express themselves in [[visual arts]]. In classes, Güneştekin taught children about art concepts and techniques by exposing them to many different kinds of [[art materials]]. Güneştekin met over 5,000 children and introduced them the world of painting.

'''Ālambana''' ([[Sanskrit]]:आलम्बन), is a Sanskrit noun which variously means – support, foundation, supporting, base, sustaining, cause, reason, basis, or the five attributes of things, or the silent repetition of a prayer, or the natural and necessary connection of a sensation with the cause which excites it, or the mental exercise practiced by the yogis in endeavouring to realize the gross form of the Eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit. de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=alambana&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic implication==

In [[Indian philosophy]] the word, ''ālambana'', refers to the objective basis of a perception or sensation; according to which philosophy ''Kārana'' (cause) and all attendant emotional conditions are known as ''Vibhavas'' which are of two kinds – a) ''Ālambana'', the personal and human object and substratum, and b) ''Uddipana'', the excitant. ''Ālambana'' may further be divided into ''asraya'' and ''visaya'', [[Radha]] is ''asraya'' and [[Krishna]] is ''visaya''; Radha, as the devotee, experienced greater pleasure than Krishna who remained the object of her veneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaniquotes|url= http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Vibhava_is_divided_into_the_two_categories_alambana_and_uddipana._Alambana_may_be_further_divided_into_asraya_and_visaya }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Visaya'' is the potential object of a perceptual consciousness, ''ālambana'' is the objective basis which can even be the cause of perceptual or cognition support for a perceptual error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Logic, Language and Reality:Indian Philosophy and Contemporary Issues|author=Bimal Kroshna Matilal|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8SLH7ogB9oC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItvAU9PuDdeQuASzuIHYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyaya]] school does not consider the object in front to be the ''ālambana'' of the illusory cognition but rather the interfering external element with its own characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhamati and Vivarna Schools of Advaita: A Critical Approach|author=Poolasth Soobah Roodurmum|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=54|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2pU2ZQB2wUYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItvAU9PuDdeQuASzuIHYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best ''ālambana'' for the ''[[upasana]]'' of [[Brahman]] is [[Om]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gaudapadakarika|author=Gaudapada|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lz08gSuuLQkC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8-HAU8fNNs-l8AWL6IK4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vedic]] parlance, ''ālambana'' is also known as ''skambha'' i.e. the pillar of strength; God is the pillar of strength;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Philosophy for Himalayan Eco-System Development|author=M.L.Dewan|publisher=Concept Publishing Co.|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hebaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=alambana+vedic&amp;dq=alambana+vedic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zOvBU8nQEI63uAS5p4HABg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the objective contemplation which lends support to the mind in its travel Godwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wisdom of the Hindus|author=Brian Brown|publisher=Brentanos|page=278|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLwlAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=alambana+upanishads&amp;dq=alambana+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_fjBU7GrJM28uASmtIHAAg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rasa implication==

In the Indian theory of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]], ''Uddipana'' is the excitant or determinant which inflames sentiments or emotions, and ''ālambana'' is that on which the sentiment hangs i.e. ''ālambana'' is with reference to the sentiment which arises as the link between a sentiment and the cause which excites it. In ''Rasa'' process, the nature or object is said to be visibly present before the ''asraya'' as an excitant but the object that arouses emotions is usually imagined by the poet or dramatist; the mere presence of ''vibhava'' impels the configuration of ''Pratibha'' (the intuitive outcome of wisdom or knowledge) to change it in no time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I.A.Richards and Indian Theory of Rasa|author=Gupteshwar Prasad|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |pages=92,230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmy5cnSbsWYC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uODAU_2XH8Xs8AWJiIGwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the Rasa of Heroic devotion in compassion the enhancing excitants include transitory emotions such as impatience, understanding and happiness, and Krishna in some disguised form is offered by the hero, motivated by kindness, his own body. [[Yuddhisthira]] had made sacrificial offerings to Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhaktirasamrtasindhu of Rupa Gosvamin|author=Rupa Gosvami|publisher=Motolal Banarsidass|pages=579–581|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DsRb6gjUa1oC&amp;pg=PA581&amp;dq=alambana+vedic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ru3BU63-K82XuATh84GoBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana%20vedic&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogic implication==

With the aid of self-supported yoga or ātmālmbana yoga, [[Ishvara]] can be seen in two ways i.e. dual and non-dual, or can be seen as fourfolded. ''Ālambana'' refers to inner support and [[yoga]] refers to self-discipline; ''ātmālambana yoga'' is the discipline of objectifying the non-self with the aid of the self when the negated-self becomes the object of the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paratattvagaonitadarsanam|author=G.S.Murty|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |pages=174,175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ig1-enQgyE8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uODAU_2XH8Xs8AWJiIGwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]] while defining Sleep which is a [[vritti]] of [[Buddhi]], just as the waking state and the dream states are, tells us:

:अभावप्रत्ययालम्बना तमोवर्त्तिर्निद्रा (Yoga Sutra Samādhipada 10)

:"Deep sleep is the absence of all impressions resulting from opacity in that which is mutable in human-beings (citta)."

Here, he has used the word, ''ālambana'', to mean support or based on i.e. absence of impressions is supported / based on inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samadhi pada 10 |publisher=Ashtangayoga.info |url=http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/abhava-pratyaya-alambana-tamo-vrittir-nidra/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827022537/http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-1/item/abhava-pratyaya-alambana-tamo-vrittir-nidra/ |archivedate=2014-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist implication==

According to the [[Yogacara]] phenomenology the ''ālambana'' condition, whether immediate direct or remote, means if there exists a dharma it will have a distinct appearance, the mind will sometimes correspond with it (''[[lakshana]]'') for that ''[[dharma]]'' to be cognized and perceptually grasped. This condition leads to the awakening which results in the ending of the eight consciousnesses and replacing them with four enlightened cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Phenomenology|author=Dan Lusthaus|publisher=Routledge|pages=500–503|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA500&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=alambana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KV4dFfAzsT&amp;sig=GRwQCtuiXAQdCTfXc6lYHCm5164&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4NbAU9rpA4b88QWZsIKgCg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist consider ''ālambana'' as a cause same as ''hetu'', ''samanantara'' and ''adhipati'', they consider it to be the object-condition which is taken as the cause in the production of knowledge and mentals, such as ''citta'' and ''caitta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Central Philosophy of Buddhism|author=T.R.V.Murti|publisher=Routledge|page=170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmvzSw2igPUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItvAU9PuDdeQuASzuIHYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Nagarjuna]] there are three motivational contexts of love and compassion viz, ''sattva-ālambana'', motivated by the similarity of one’s self with other selves, ''dharma-ālambana'', motivated by the sameness of psycho-physical elements, and ''ānalambana'' which is not motivated by these two i.e. which is independent of motivational context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Critical Superiority|author=Shohei Ichimura|page=81|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xTW6XNxOxbkC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItvAU9PuDdeQuASzuIHYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xuanzang]] in the context of [[Dignāga]]’s statement with reference to the eighth consciousness explains that the seeds or virtualities of the eighth consciousness produce the actual consciousness and also the objective base (ālambana) of actual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Phenomenology and Indian Philosophy|publisher=SUNY PRESS|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfipfaNM44C&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=alambana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8-HAU8fNNs-l8AWL6IK4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alambana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
'''Ananyatā''' ([[Sanskrit]]:अनन्यता) means – 'having no equal', 'matchless', 'peerless', 'identity', 'sameness' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=75|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of devotion in which the devotee is solely dependent on God. ''Ananyata'' is the doctrine that makes no distinction between God and the Atman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Hindu World part 2|publisher=Concept Publishing|pages=434–435|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=ananyata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ma-0VPrPOMyWuATny4DQDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ananyata&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Narada Bhakti Sutra]]s No. IX and X read as follows :- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga of Spiritual Devotion|author=Prem Prakash|publisher=Inner Traditions|pages=23–25|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=LrlzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=ananyata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fa60VK2BMImgugTe54HgBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ananyata&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:तस्मिन्ननन्यता तद्विरोधिशूदासीनता च |

: " Inner stillness, furthermore, requires a single-hearted intention, and disinterest in what is antagonistic to spiritual devotion. "

:अन्याश्रयाणां त्यागोऽनन्यता |

: " When one is single-hearted, one relinquishes seeking security in anything other than God. "

With these words [[Narada|Nārada]] explains ''ananyatā'' as the state in which the mind of the devotee does not waver or goes astray, remains one-pointed ever steady in the contemplation of God to the exclusion of everything else, in that state everything is envisioned in God as His cosmic play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of Bhakti|author=Taoshobuddha|publisher=Brij Saksena|page=24|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=eyvkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ananyata+vedanta&amp;dq=ananyata+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NLC0VLTYDoyJuASlv4GABQ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantists]], ''ananyatā'' means absolute oneness or non-otherness of the individual self (''[[Jiva]]'') and the Universal Self (''[[Brahman]]''), the absolute height of enlightenment, ''atmaikatya'' which is the absolute identity of the phenomenal selves with the Supreme Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=6|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=ananyata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fa60VK2BMImgugTe54HgBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ananyata&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eduard Kurzbauer - The Dispute - Walters 37102.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Dispute'' by [[Eduard Kurzbauer]]]]

'''Annoyance''' is an unpleasant [[Mood (psychology)|mental state]] that is characterized by such effects as [[Irritability|irritation]] and [[distraction]] from one's [[thought|conscious thinking]]. It can lead to [[emotion]]s such as [[frustration]] and [[anger]]. The property of being easily annoyed is called [[irritability]].

==Psychology==
Various reasons exist for why one finds particular stimuli annoying. Measurement of annoyance is highly subjective. As an attempt at measurement, psychological studies on annoyance often rely on their subjects' own ratings of levels of annoyance on a scale. Any kind of stimuli can cause annoyance, such as getting poked in the side or listening to a song repeatedly.  Many stimuli that one is at first neutral to, or even finds pleasant, can turn into annoyances from repeated continued exposure.  One can often encounter this phenomenon with such media as [[popular music]], [[meme]]s, [[commercials]], and [[jingle|advertising jingles]], which by their very nature are continually repeated over a period of weeks or months.

A study published in the ''International Journal of Conflict Management'' found that one's response to an annoyance, at least when the perceived cause is another person, escalate to more extreme levels as they go unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;Dean G Pruitt, John C Parker, Joseph M Mikolic. "Escalation as a reaction to persistent annoyance.", ''International Journalists of Conflict Management.'' Bowling Green: July 1997, Vol 8, Issue 3; pg. 252&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that one was more likely to blame the party who was causing the annoyance in the study, rather than one's self, for the annoyance as it escalated.

[[Psychological warfare]] can involve creating annoyances to distract and wear down the resistance of the target. For example, in 1993, the United States' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) played music "specifically selected for its irritation ability" on loudspeakers outside the [[Branch Davidian]] church in [[Waco, Texas]] in an attempt to bring about the surrender of [[David Koresh]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Potok. "FBI grinds away at cult", ''USA Today'', April 14, 1993, pg. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English law==
In the sense of "nuisance", the noun "annoyance" is found in the English "Jury of Annoyance" appointed by an act of 1754 to report upon obstructions in the [[highway]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Annoy|volume=2|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11297">The '''assessment of basic language and learning skills''' (ABLLS, often pronounced "ables") is an educational tool used frequently with [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) to measure the basic linguistic and functional skills of an individual with developmental delays or disabilities.

==Development==
The revised assessment of basic language and learning skills (ABLLS-R) is an assessment tool, curriculum guide, and skills-tracking system used to help guide the instruction of language and critical learner skills for children with autism or other developmental disabilities.  It provides a comprehensive review of 544 skills from 25 skill areas including language, social interaction, self-help, academic and motor skills that most typically developing children acquire prior to entering kindergarten.  Expressive language skills are assessed based upon the behavioral analysis of language as presented by Dr. B.F. Skinner in his book, Verbal Behavior (1957).  The task items within each skill area are arranged from simpler to more complex tasks.  This practical tool facilitates the identification of skills needed by the child to effectively communicate and learn from everyday experiences.  The information obtained from this assessment allows parents and professionals to pinpoint obstacles that have been preventing a child from acquiring new skills and to develop a comprehensive language-based curriculum.
  
The ABLLS-R comprises two documents.  The ABLLS-R Protocol is used to score the child’s performance on the task items and provides 15 appendices that allow for the tracking of a variety of specific skills that are included in the assessment.  The ABLLS-R Guide provides information about the features of the ABLLS-R, how to correctly score items, and how to develop Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives that clearly define and target the learning needs of a student.  

The original version was first released in 1998 by [http://www.behavioranalysts.com Behavior Analysts, Inc.] and was developed by James W. Partington, Ph.D., BCBA-D and Mark L. Sundberg, Ph.D, BCBA-D.  It was revised in 2006 by  Partington.  The revised version incorporates many new task items and provides a more specific sequence in the developmental order of items within the various skill areas.  Significant changes were made in the revised version of the vocal imitation section with input from Denise Senick-Pirri, SLP-CCC.  Additional improvements were made to incorporate items associated with social interaction skills, motor imitation and other joint attention skills, and to ensure the fluent use of established skills.

==WebABLLS and normative data==

The [http://www.webablls.com WebABLLS] is an electronic version of the assessment.  It allows parents, teachers, speech pathologists, behavior analysts, and others who design, coordinate, or supervise language or skill-acquisition programs to expedite the development of IEPs, progress reports, and to easily share information about a child.  The WebABLLS provides videos of many skills that are measured by the ABLLS-R and can be used to demonstrate those specific skills.

Over the past four years, parents, relatives and friends of typically developing children have been participating in an ongoing research project by entering data into the WebABLLS.  The data are collected by parents or professionals who both know the children and have received training in the administration of the ABLLS-R.  The data are updated at three-month intervals (i.e., 6 months, 9 months, 12 months) in order to track the specific changes in skills over the course of the children’s development.  These preliminary data have been collected in a systematic manner to provide information about when each skill measured by the ABLLS-R is usually acquired by typically developing children.  

The preliminary data from this research project are from 81 children (42 females &amp; 39 males) ranging in age from 6 months to 60 months.  Children are from a variety of geographical locations (both nationally and internationally) and of differing ethnic, socio-economic and educational backgrounds.  The average percent of the total possible scores along with the range from the highest to the lowest scores for the sample at each 3-month age intervals are presented.  The data clearly indicate that typically developing children demonstrate most of the basic language and learning skills measured by the ABLLS-R by the time they are 4 to 5 years of age.

==Usage==
While the ABLLS-R is most commonly used on children with developmental disabilities and delays (including [[autism]]), it can be used for anyone who may be lacking in basic communication or life skills.

It assesses the strengths and weaknesses of an individual in each of the 25 skill sets. Each skill set is broken down into multiple skills, ordered by typical development or complexity. So, a skill of F1 (Requests by indicating) is a simpler skill than F12 (Requesting Help). ''Usually'', lower level skills are needed before proceeding to teach higher skills. However, many individuals display [[splinter skill]]s that are above their practical level.

The ABLLS-R is conducted via observation of the child's behavior in each skill area. The instructor will provide a stimulus to the child (verbal, hand-over-hand, non-verbal, etc.), and, depending on what the child does (the behavior), determines their skill-level. Some skills are difficult or time-consuming to test; instructors frequently accept anecdotal evidence from parents and other instructors as to a child's ability at a given skill-level.

==Sections==
The ABLLS-R is split into 25 functional areas, each corresponding to a letter in the alphabet. The sections between the ABLLS and ABLLS-R are similar; it is mostly the skills that vary in number and scope.

The '''Basque Declaration''' (2016) is a formal document outlining 15 pathways for the development of more sustainable cities in Europe. The Declaration was acclaimed at the 8th European Conference on Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns from 27-29 April 2016 in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. The document can be seen as a continuation of the [[Aalborg Charter|Aalborg Charter (1994)]] and the Aalborg Commitments (2004) echoing sustainability vision from Local [[Agenda 21|Agenda 21]], and is itself a call for active engagement from civil society..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/about-the-basque-declaration/|title=About the Basque Declaration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of the Declaration is 'to create productive, sustainable and resilient cities for a liveable and inclusive Europe'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/fileadmin/repository/Basque_Declaration/BD_May_Update/Basque-Declaration-ENGLISH-www.pdf|title=The Basque Declaration (English)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basque Declaration is targeted at city leaders in Europe, including mayors and city governments, and can also be signed by individuals. It outlines pathways to help city leaders shape the development of their own municipalities, and ultimately aims to accelerate socio-cultural, socio-economic and technological transformation. The Declaration is based on the understanding that a diversity of local initiatives are required to address social, environmental and economic challenges. It recognises the importance of things such as protecting biodiversity, decarbonising energy systems, creating more sustainable mobility systems, protecting water systems, adapting to climate change, promoting social inclusion and strengthening local economies, among other things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although focusing on action at the local scale, the Declaration is underpinned by the idea of cooperation, sharing and replication of solutions adapted to the local context. A strong theme of the Declaration is to have a highly engaged civil society, where participation is a key ingredient in both developing and ''implementing'' local transformative actions.

The 15 pathways listed in the Basque Declaration are summarised under three headings:

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Cultural Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To develop a 'culture of sustainability'
* To actively involve citizens, going beyond just participatory planning to co-creative approaches
* To re-think boundaries between public and private activities
* To promote social innovation, enterprises and civic engagement, focusing especially on marginalised groups and immigrants
* To nurture the [[sharing economy|sharing economy]] and ideas that combine entrepreneurship, civic engagement and societal transformation

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Economic Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To turn challenges into opportunities for local economies in key areas such as energy and food production
* To create and close local value chains, increasing public income and local investment
* To apply innovative financing, including crowd-funding and blends of public funding or complementary currencies
* To purchase products and services conscientiously, taking into account the environmental, social and economic impacts of purchasing decisions
* To pursue development towards a circular economy, reducing the demand of natural resources and waste output

&lt;u&gt;The Technological Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To wisely take advantage of smart technologies
* To use public procurement as a way to accelerate innovation in the market
* To address the [[Digital divide|digital divide]] within local societies, focusing on equal access
* To support open data standards, keeping data available to the public
* The prepare political and governance structures to deal with these changes

==Transformative actions==

The Declaration supports local 'transformative actions' and encourages cities to develop and share their sustainability solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transformative Action Award|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/transformative-action-award/|website=Sustainable Cities EU|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.sustainablecities.eu/| Sustainable Cities EU] website has a central database where cities can submit their own 'transformative actions'. The idea is that local innovations can inspire other city leaders and where it is possible, help to facilitate replication of successful strategies. To encourage cities to report on their activities a 'Transformative Action Award' was created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4746">{{other uses|Bite the bullet (disambiguation)}}

To "'''bite the bullet'''" is to endure a painful or otherwise unpleasant situation that is seen as unavoidable.&lt;ref name="phrasefinder"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/65400.html Bite the bullet]. Phrases.org.uk. Retrieved on 2011-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was first recorded by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his 1891 novel ''[[The Light that Failed]]''.&lt;ref name="phrasefinder"/&gt;

It was suggested by the movie [[Bite the Bullet (film)|''Bite the Bullet'']] that biting the bullet meant using a shell casing to cover an aching tooth, especially one that had been broken, and where a nerve is exposed. In the film, the slug was removed from the bullet, the cap was hit to expend that charge, and the casing was cut down to allow it to sit level with the other teeth.

It is often stated that it is derived historically from the practice of having a patient clench a [[bullet]] in his or her teeth as a way to cope with the extreme pain of a [[surgical procedure]] without anesthetic, though evidence for biting a bullet rather than a leather strap during surgery is sparse.&lt;ref name="phrasefinder"/&gt; It has been speculated to have evolved from the British empire expression "to [[bite the cartridge]]", which dates to the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], but the phrase "chew a bullet", with a similar meaning, dates to at least 1796.&lt;ref name="phrasefinder"/&gt;

==In philosophy==

A more specific meaning of the phrase is to accept unpleasant consequences of one's assumed beliefs.&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite book |first=Nigel |last=Warburton |title=Thinking from A to Z |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-22281-8 |pages=28–29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNjM75ItNKAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=bite+the+bullet+philosopher&amp;sig=zxV-AuvTVtdhoqLrS-iiCY07o2I#PPA28,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound [[reasoning]] requires its practitioner to always sustain a [[consistent]] set of beliefs. This may involve accepting a disturbing belief that is a consequence of one's currently held beliefs. It may be disturbing because it is counterintuitive or has other disturbing consequences. Given a [[philosophy|philosopher]]'s currently held beliefs that he or she is not prepared to give up, he or she may have to ''bite the bullet'' by accepting a particular claim offered as an extreme case or putative [[counterexample]].

===Examples===
* A strict [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] will be forced to admit that, if it can be shown that punishing an innocent person would increase the total happiness of the whole society, then there are times when it is morally right to punish an innocent person.&lt;ref name=Warburton/&gt; (''See [[telishment]]'') An ethically "easy" example would be when an informed person—such as an army cadet—voluntarily accepts the "punishment" or risk of "harm" for the greater good.
* The [[Euthyphro dilemma]] can be resolved in the mind of a [[Divine command theory|divine command theorist]] by simply accepting that if [[God]] tells us to do something which appears to be immoral, then we are to accept that it really is moral in the bigger picture, and that it only appears to be immoral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/divine-c.htm#SH4a Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. Iep.utm.edu (2006-08-21). Retrieved on 2011-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[consequentialist]] believes that what is called ''right'' or ''wrong'' depends on what consequences come about as a result of a proposed action. As a way to test this view, some counterexamples may be considered which are intended to find out if this view holds up in extreme cases. For example, one may object that some actions appear to be ''right in principle'' even when terrible consequences have resulted from them. Also, there may be times when an action appears to be wrong in principle, but has wonderful consequences. A person wanting to stay faithful to the consequentialist view in the face of an extreme case may have to ''bite the bullet'' by taking the position that, even though these counterexamples do exist, the original view still holds up: 
::''Even though both drivers were driving recklessly, only the one who gets in an accident gets a severe penalty. It's okay that some people are treated differently based solely on their luck.''
:Accepting the existence of [[moral luck]] may seem counterintuitive or even unreasonable to some, so this statement of acceptance can be seen as ''biting the bullet''.

A  '''chaordic organization''' refers to a [[system]] of organization that blends characteristics of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[:wikt:order|order]]. The term was coined by [[Dee Hock]], the founder and former CEO of the [[VISA]] credit card association.

The mix of chaos and order is often described as a harmonious coexistence displaying characteristics of both, with neither chaotic nor ordered behavior dominating. The chaordic principles have also been used as guidelines for creating human organizations -- [[business]], [[nonprofit]], [[government]] and hybrids—that would be neither centralized nor anarchical networks.

== Land use and greenhouse gases ==

Most of the excess [[greenhouse gas]]es causing [[climate change]] have come from burning [[fossil fuel]]. But a special report from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) estimated that in the last 150 years fossil fuels and [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement production]] were responsible for only about two-thirds of climate change: the other third has been caused by human [[land use]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report) |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521800839 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0 |first1=Robert T. |last1=Watson |first2=Ian R. |last2=Noble |first3=Bert |last3=Bolin |first4=N. H. |last4=Ravindranath |first5=David J. |last5=Verardo |first6=David J. |last6=Dokken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main greenhouse gases produced by [[unsustainable]] land use are [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitrous oxide]].&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitigating Climate Change through Food and Land Use"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mitigating Climate Change through Food and Land Use |date=2009 |publisher=Worldwatch Institute |location=Washington, United States of America |isbn=9781878071910 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/179%20Land%20Use.pdf |first1=Sara J. |last1=Scherr |first2=Sajal |last2=Sthapit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Black carbon]] or [[soot]] can also be caused by unsustainable land use, and, although not a gas, can behave like greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.&lt;ref name="Ullstein editor 2011"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ullstein  |editor-first=Bart |title=Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone:  Summary for Decision-Makers |date=2011 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organisation |isbn=978-92-807-3142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=T.

=== Carbon dioxide ===

[[Carbon dioxide]], {{CO2}}, is a natural part of the [[carbon cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more, especially from [[habitat destruction]] and the [[Tillage|cultivation]] of [[soil]]. When [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, and other natural [[habitat]]s are turned into [[pasture]], [[Arable land|arable fields]], buildings and roads, the [[Soil carbon|carbon held in the soil]] and vegetation becomes extra carbon dioxide and [[methane]] to trap more heat in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report) |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521800839 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0 |first1=Robert T. |last1=Watson |first2=Ian R. |last2=Noble |first3=Bert |last3=Bolin |first4=N. H. |last4=Ravindranath |first5=David J. |last5=Verardo |first6=David J. |last6=Dokken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gardener]]s may cause extra carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:

* Using [[peat]] or [[potting compost]] containing peat;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Royal Horticultural Society |title=Peat and the Gardener: Conservation and Environment Guidelines |date=2009 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society, Wisley, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |title=Towards Sustainable Growing Media: Chairman's Report and Roadmap |date=2013 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), London |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221019/pb13867-towards-sustainable-growing-media.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=John |title=How to Create an Eco Garden: The Practical Guide to Greener, Planet-Friendly Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=Aquamarine |location=Wigston, Leicester |isbn=978-1903141892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Buying [[garden furniture]] or other [[wood]]en products made from woodland which has been destroyed rather than taken as a [[Renewable resource|renewable crop]] from [[Sustainable land management|sustainably managed]] woodland;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;
* Digging soil and leaving it bare so that the carbon in soil organic matter is [[Oxidation|oxidised]];&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
* Using [[power tool]]s which burn [[fossil fuel]] or [[electricity]] generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Sally |title=Ecological Gardening |date=2009 |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Marlborough |isbn=978 1 84797 125 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[patio heater]]s;
* Heating [[greenhouse]]s by burning fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
* Burning [[Pruning|garden pruning]]s and [[weed]]s on a [[bonfire]];
* Buying [[tools]], [[pesticide]]s, [[Fertilizer|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]] (over 2 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent is produced in the manufacture of each kilogram of ammonium nitrate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sam |last1=Wood |first2=Annette  |last2=Cowie |title=A Review of Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors for Fertiliser Production |date=2004 |publisher=IEA Bioenergy}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and other materials which have been manufactured using fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Julian Allwood and Jonathan Cullen 'Sustainable Materials - with both eyes open'"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sustainable Materials - with both eyes open |date=2011 |publisher=UIT |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781906860059 |url=http://www.withbotheyesopen.com/ |first1=Julian |last1=Allwood |first2=Jonathan |last2=Cullen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammond |first=G.

Gardeners will also be responsible for extra carbon dioxide when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;

=== Methane ===
[[Methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is a natural part of the [[carbon cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more, especially from [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] [[soil]], artificial [[wetland]]s such as [[Rice#Environmental impacts|rice fields]], and from the [[Digestion|guts]] of [[livestock|farm animals]], especially [[ruminant]]s such as [[cattle]] and [[sheep]].&lt;ref name="Dave Reay 2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Methane and Climate Change |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=978-1844078233 |first1=Dave |last1=Reay |first2=Pete |last2=Smith |first3=Andre |last3=van Amstel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gardener]]s may cause extra methane to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:

* [[Soil compaction|Compacting]] soil so that it becomes anaerobic, for example by treading on soil when it is wet;
* Allowing [[compost]] heaps to become compacted and anaerobic;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Kopinska |author2=Jane Griffiths |author3=Heather Jackson |author4=Pauline Pears |title=The Garden Organic Book of Compost|date=2011|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=9781847734372}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creating homemade liquid feed by putting the leaves of plants such as [[Comfrey#Fertilizer uses|comfrey under water]], with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they [[Decomposition|decay]];
* Killing pernicious [[weed]]s by covering them with water, with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they decay;
* Allowing [[pond]]s to become anaerobic, for example by adding unsuitable [[fish]] species which stir up sediment that then blocks light from and kills [[Water aeration#Natural aeration|submerged oxygenating plants]].&lt;ref name="Creating a Garden Pond for Wildlife"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating a Garden Pond for Wildlife |date=2011 |publisher=Freshwater Habitats Trust |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-9537971-2-7 |author=Pond Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrous oxide ===

[[Nitrous oxide]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is a natural part of the [[nitrogen cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith (editor) |first=Keith |title=Nitrous Oxide and Climate Change |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=978-1844077571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The nitrogen cycle and its influence on the European greenhouse gas balance |date=2011 |publisher=Centre for Ecology and Hydrology |isbn=978-1-906698-21-8 |first1=Mark |last1=Sutton |first2=Stefan |last2=Reis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardeners may cause extra nitrous oxide to be added to the atmosphere by:

* Using synthetic nitrogen [[fertilizer]], for example "weed and feed" on [[lawn]]s, especially if it is applied when plants are not actively growing, the soil is compacted, or when other factors are limiting so that the plants cannot make use of the nitrogen;&lt;ref name="Livesley 2010 273–293"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on: soil management (Fact Sheet 20) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS20_REV_Nov09%20%28final%29.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 21"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on: nutrient management (Fact Sheet 21) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS21_REVOCT09WEB.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compacting the soil (for example by working in the garden when the soil is wet) which will increase the conversion of [[Nitrate#Uses|nitrates]] to nitrous oxide by soil bacteria;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"/&gt;
* Burning garden waste on [[bonfire]]s.

=== Black carbon ===

Black carbon is not a gas, but it acts like a greenhouse gas because it can be [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in the atmosphere and absorb [[Thermal energy|heat]].&lt;ref name="Ullstein editor 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond 2013"/&gt;

Gardeners may cause extra black carbon to be added to the atmosphere by burning garden [[pruning]]s and [[weed]]s on bonfires, especially if the waste is wet and becomes black carbon in the form of soot.&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt; Gardeners will also be responsible for extra black carbon produced when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by [[fossil fuel]] especially the [[Diesel exhaust|diesel]] used in most lorries.

== Gardening to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and absorb carbon dioxide ==

There are many ways in which climate-friendly gardeners may reduce their contribution to climate change and help their gardens absorb [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardening in the Global Greenhouse: The impacts of climate change on gardens in the UK |date=2002 |publisher=UK Climate Impacts Programme |location=Oxford |citeseerx = 10.1.1.131.6205 |first1=Richard |last1=Bisgrove |first2=Paul |last2=Hadley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners can find good ideas in many other [[Sustainability|sustainable]] approaches:
* [[Agroforestry]];
* [[Forest gardening]];
* [[Orchard]]s;
* [[Organic gardening]];
* [[Permaculture]];
* [[Rain garden]];
* [[Vegan organic gardening]];
* [[Water-wise gardening]];
* [[Wildlife garden]].

== Protecting and enhancing carbon stores ==

=== Protecting carbon stores in land beyond gardens ===
[[File:Woodland and wetland in the New Forest.JPG|thumb|Woodland and wetland in the New Forest, Hampshire]]
[[File:Woodland and trees in Herefordshire landscape.JPG|thumb|Woodland and trees in Herefordshire]]
[[File:Waterbutt in kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent.JPG|thumb|Kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent, showing greenhouse, waterbutt, box hedging and vegetable beds.]]
[[File:Alliums in dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden.JPG|thumb|Alliums, lavender, box and other water-thrifty plants in the dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden]]

Climate-friendly gardening includes actions which protect [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] beyond gardens. The biggest carbon stores in land are in soil; the two habitat types with the biggest carbon stores per hectare are [[Woodland|woods]] and [[wetland]]s; and woods absorb more carbon dioxide per hectare per year than most other habitats. Climate-friendly gardeners therefore aim to ensure that nothing they do will harm these habitats.

According to Morison and Morecroft&amp;nbsp;(eds.)'s ''Plant Growth and Climate Change'',&lt;ref name="Plant Growth and Climate Change"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plant Growth and Climate Change |date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=978-14051-3192-6 |first1=James I. L. |last1=Morison |first2=Michael D. |last2=Morecroft}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[net primary productivity]] (the net amount of carbon absorbed each year) of various habitats &lt;!--not encyclopedic: (they don't give a figure for wetlands)--&gt; is:

* [[Tropical forest]]s: 12.5 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Temperate forest]]s: 7.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Grassland|Temperate grassland]]s: 3.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Cropland]]s: 3.1 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s Special Report ''[[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]]''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt; lists the carbon contained in different global habitats as:

* Wetlands: 643 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 43 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 686 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Tropical forests: 123 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 120 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 243 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Temperate forests: 96 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 57 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 153 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Temperate grasslands: 164 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 7 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 171 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Croplands: 80 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 2 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 82 tonnes carbon per hectare.

The figures quoted above are global averages. More recent research in 2009 has found that the habitat with the world's highest known total carbon density&amp;nbsp;- 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare&amp;nbsp;- is temperate moist forest of [[Eucalyptus regnans]] in the Central Highlands of south-east [[Australia]]; and, in general, that temperate forests contain more carbon than either [[boreal forest]]s or tropical forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keith |first1=Heather |first2=Brendan G. |last2=Mackey |first3=David B. |last3=Lindenmaye |title=Re-evaluation of forest biomass carbon stocks and lessons from the world's most carbon-dense forests |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=2009 |volume=106 |issue=28|doi=
10.1073/pnas.0901970106 |pages=11635–11640 |pmid=19553199 |pmc=2701447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon stores in Britain===
According to Milne and Brown's 1997 paper "Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain",&lt;ref name="Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milne |first1=R. |first2=T. A. |last2=Brown |title=Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |date=1997 |volume=49 |pages=413–433 |doi=10.1006/jema.1995.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s [[vegetation]] and soil are estimated to contain 9952 million tonnes of carbon, of which almost all is in the soil, and most in [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[bog|peatland]] soil:

* Soils in Scotland: 6948 million tonnes carbon;
* Soils in [[England]] and [[Wales]]: 2890 million tonnes carbon;
* Vegetation in British [[woodland|woods]] and [[plantation]]s (which cover only 11% of Britain's land area): 91 million tonnes carbon;
* Other vegetation: 23 million tonnes carbon.

A 2005 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change and British Woodland |date=2005 |publisher=Forestry Commission |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-85538-658-4 |first1=Mark |last1=Broadmeadow |first2=Duncan |last2=Ray |url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcin069.pdf/$FILE/fcin069.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that British woodland soil may contain as much as 250 tonnes of carbon per hectare.

Many studies of [[soil carbon]] only study the carbon in the top 30 centimetres, but soil is often much deeper than that, especially below woodland. One 2009 study of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] by Keith Dyson and others gives figures for soil carbon down to 100&amp;nbsp;cm below the [[habitat]]s, including "Forestland", "Cropland" and "Grassland", covered by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dyson |first1=Keith |first2=A.

===Protecting carbon stores in wetland===
[[File:Paving - wood chip with birch logs as edging at Wisley.JPG|thumb|Permeable paving of wood chip with birch-log edging at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley]]
[[File:Symphytum grandiflorum, creeping comfrey, with Cotinus coggygria.JPG|thumb|A ground-cover and rain-garden plant - Symphytum grandiflorum, creeping comfrey (with Cotinus coggygria)]]
Climate-friendly gardeners choose [[peat]]-free [[Potting compost|compost]]s&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; because some of the planet's biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] are in [[soil]], and especially in the [[Bog|peatland]] soil of [[wetland]]s.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s Special Report ''Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry'' gives a figure of 2011 gigatonnes of carbon for global carbon stocks in the top 1 metre of soils, much more than the carbon stores in the vegetation or the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners also avoid using [[tapwater]] not only because of the [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to treat and pump water,&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt; but because if water is taken from wetlands then carbon stores are more likely to be oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;

A climate-friendly garden therefore does not contain large [[Irrigation|irrigated]] [[lawn]]s, but instead includes [[water-butt]]s to collect [[rain]]water; water-thrifty plants which survive on rainwater and do not need watering after they are established; [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[hedge]]s to [[Windbreak|shelter]] gardens from the drying effects of [[Sunlight|sun]] and [[wind]]; and [[groundcover]] plants and [[Mulch#Organic mulches|organic mulch]] to protect the soil and keep it moist.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;242&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;80–82&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardening Without Water"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardening Without Water: Creating beautiful gardens using only rainwater |date=1999 |publisher=Search Press |location=Tunbridge Wells |isbn=0855328851 |first=Charlotte |last=Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners will ensure that any paved surfaces in their gardens (which are kept to a minimum to increase carbon stores) are [[Permeable paving|permeable]],&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and may also make [[rain garden]]s, sunken areas into which rainwater from buildings and paving is directed, so that the rain can then be fed back into [[groundwater]] rather than going into [[storm drain]]s. The plants in rain gardens must be able to grow in both dry and wet soils.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rain Gardens: Managing Water Sustainably in the Garden and Designed Landscape |date=2007 |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon, USA |isbn=978-0881928266 |first1=Nigel |last1=Dunnett |first2=Andy |last2=Clayden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protecting carbon stores in woodland===
Wetlands may store the most carbon in their soils, but woods store more carbon in their living [[biomass]] than any other type of vegetation, and their soils store the most carbon after wetlands.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt; Climate-friendly gardeners therefore ensure that any wooden products they buy, such as [[garden furniture]], have been made of wood from [[Sustainable forest management|sustainably managed]] woodland.

=== Protecting and increasing carbon stores in gardens ===
[[File:Juglans major at Cambridge Botanic Garden.jpg|thumb|Juglans elaeopyren, an American walnut, at Cambridge Botanic Garden]]

After [[Carbonate rocks|rocks containing carbonate compounds]], soil is the biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|store of carbon]] on land.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;
Carbon is found in [[soil organic matter]], including living organisms ([[Root|plant roots]], [[fungi]], [[animal]]s, [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]]), dead organisms, and [[humus]].&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
One study of the environmental benefits of gardens estimates that 86% of carbon stores in gardens is in the soil.&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Ross W. F. |first2=Tijana |last2=Blanuša |first3=Jane E. |last3=Taylor |first4=Andrew |last4=Salisbury |first5=Andrew J. |last5=Halstead |first6=Béatrice |last6=Henricot |first7=Ken |last7=Thompson |title=The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure |journal=Urban Forestry &amp; Urban Greening |date=2012 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=129–137 |doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2012.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fragaria vesca, wild strawberry.JPG|thumb|Wild strawberries in flower below a British hedge.]]

The first priorities for climate-friendly gardeners are, therefore, to:
* Protect the soil's existing carbon stores;
* Increase the soil's carbon stores.

To protect the soil, climate-friendly gardens:
* Are based on [[plant]]s rather than buildings and paving;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;
* Have soil that is kept at a relatively stable temperature by [[Windbreak|shelter]] from trees, shrubs and/or hedges;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Matthew |title=New Gardening: How to garden in a changing climate |date=2007 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley and the Royal Horticultural Society |location=London |isbn=9781845333058}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Have soil that is always kept covered and therefore moist and at a relatively stable temperature by [[groundcover]] plants, fast-growing [[green manure]]s (which can be used as an [[Intercropping|intercrop]] in [[kitchen garden]]s of [[Annual plant|annual]] vegetables) and/or [[Mulch#Organic mulches|organic mulches]].&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crawford |first=Martin |title=Creating a Forest Garden: Working with nature to grow edible crops |date=2010 |publisher=Green Books |location=Hartland, Devon |isbn=9781900322621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil improvement and protection - wood chip mulch at Wisley.JPG|thumb|Mulch of woodchips protecting soil at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley in Surrey.]]

Climate-friendly gardeners avoid things which may harm soil. They do not tread on the soil when it is wet, because it is then most vulnerable to compaction. They [[Tillage|dig]] as little is possible, and only when the soil is moist rather than wet, because cultivation increases the [[oxidation]] of soil organic matter and produces [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013 12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Protecting our Water, Soil and Air: A Code of Good Agricultural Practice for farmers, growers and land managers |date=2013 |publisher=The Stationery Office |location=London |isbn=978 0 11 243284 5 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase soil carbon stores, climate-friendly gardeners ensure that their gardens create optimal conditions for vigorous healthy growth of plants, and other garden organisms above and below ground, and reduce the impact of any [[limiting factor]]s.

In general, the more [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that the plants can create each year, the more carbon will be added to the soil.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
However, only some biomass each year becomes long-term [[soil carbon]] or humus. In ''Soil Carbon and Organic Farming'', a 2009 report for the [[Soil Association]], Gundula Azeez discusses several [[Environmental factor|factor]]s which increase how much biomass is turned into humus. These include good [[soil structure]], [[Soil biology|soil organisms]] such as fine [[root hair]]s, [[microorganism]]s, [[mycorrhiza]]s and [[earthworm]]s which increase [[Soil#Structure|soil aggregation]], residues from plants (such as trees and shrubs) which have a high content of resistant chemicals such as [[lignin]], and plant residues with a [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] lower than about 32:1.&lt;ref name="Soil Carbon and Organic Farming"&gt;{{cite book |last=Azeez |first=Gundula |title=Soil Carbon and Organic Farming: A review of the evidence on the relationship between agriculture and soil carbon sequestration, and how organic farming can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation |date=2009 |publisher=The Soil Association |location=Bristol |url=http://www.soilassociation.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=SSnOCMoqrXs%3D&amp;tabid=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil fertility - nitrogen fixation by root nodules on Wistaria roots, with hazelnut to show size.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing nodules on Wisteria roots (hazelnut for scale)]]

Climate-friendly gardens therefore include:

* Hedges for shelter from wind;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* A light canopy of late-leafing [[deciduous]] trees to let in enough [[sunlight]] for growth but not so much that the garden becomes too hot and dry&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt; (this is one of the principles behind many [[agroforestry]] systems, such as [[Paulownia]]'s use in China partly because it is late-leafing and its [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] is sparse so that [[crop]]s below it get shelter but also enough light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Temperate Agroforestry Systems |date=1997 |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire |isbn=9780851991474 |author=Yungying Wu |author2=Zhaohua Zhu |pages=170–172 |editor1-first=Andrew M. |editor1-last=Gordon |editor2-first=Steven M. |editor2-last=Newman |chapter=Temperate Agroforestry in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
* Groundcover plants and organic mulches (such as [[woodchips]] over [[compost]] made from kitchen and garden "waste") to keep soil moist and at relatively stable temperatures;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|Nitrogen-fixing plants]], because soil nitrogen may be a limiting factor (but climate-friendly gardeners avoid [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]], because these may cause mycorrhizal associations to break down);&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* Many layers&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt; of plants, including [[Lignin|woody]] plants such as trees&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and shrubs, other [[Perennial plant|perennials]], groundcover plants, deep-rooted plants, all chosen according to 'right plant, right place',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Nicola |title=Right Plant, Right Place |date=1986 |publisher=Pan |location=London |isbn=0 330 29656 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lancaster |first=Roy |title=Perfect Plant, Perfect Place |date=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |isbn=978-1405348133}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they are suited to their growing conditions and will grow well;
* A wide [[biodiversity|diversity]] of [[Plant disease resistance|disease-resistant]], vigorous plants for [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and to make the most of all available [[ecological niche]]s;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;

* Compost made from garden and kitchen "waste".&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;

Lawns, like other grasslands, can build up good levels of [[soil carbon]],&lt;ref name="Soil Carbon and Organic Farming"/&gt; but they will grow more vigorously and store more carbon if besides [[Lawn#Grasses|grasses]] they also contain nitrogen-fixing plants such as [[clover]],&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt; and if they are cut using a [[Lawn mower#Other notable types|mulching mower]] which returns finely-chopped mowings to the lawn. More carbon, however, may be stored by other perennial plants such as trees&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and shrubs. They also do not need to be maintained using [[power tool]]s.

Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to increase biodiversity not only for the sake of the wildlife itself, but so that the garden ecosystem is resilient and more likely to store as much carbon as possible as long as possible. They will therefore avoid pesticides,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and increase the diversity of the habitats within their gardens.

== Reducing greenhouse gas emissions ==
Climate-friendly gardeners can directly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from their own gardens, but can also use their gardens to indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere.

=== Using gardens to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ===

Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es elsewhere, for example by using the [[sunlight|sun]] and [[wind]] to dry [[Laundry|washing]] on [[Clothes line|washing lines]] in the garden instead of using [[electricity]] [[Electricity generation|generated]] by [[fossil fuel]] to dry washing in [[Clothes dryer|tumble dryers]].

====From farmland====
[[File:Juglans regia, walnut, with ripening nuts.JPG|thumb|Walnut, Juglans regia, with ripening walnuts]]
Food is a major contributor to climate change. In the United Kingdom, according to Tara Garnett of the [http://www.fcrn.org.uk/ Food Food Climate Research Network], food contributes 19% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Cooking up a Storm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garnett |first=Tara |title=Cooking up a Storm: Food, greenhouse gas emissions and our changing climate |date=September 2008 |publisher=Food Climate Research Network, Centre for Environmental Strategy, University of Surrey |location=Guildford, Surrey |url=http://www.fcrn.org.uk/sites/default/files/CuaS_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil is the biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|store of carbon]] on [[land]]. It is therefore important to protect the [[soil organic matter]] in [[Agricultural land|farmland]]. Farm animals, however, especially free-range pigs, may cause erosion, and cultivation of the soil increases the [[oxidation]] of soil organic matter into [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013 12"/&gt; Other sources of greenhouse gases from farmland include: compaction caused by farm machinery or overgrazing by [[Livestock|farm animals]] can make soil [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] and produce [[methane]]; farm animals produce methane; and [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|nitrogen fertilizer]]s can be converted to [[nitrous oxide]].

Most farmland consists of [[Arable land|fields growing annual arable crops]] which are eaten directly by people or fed to farm animals, and [[grassland]] used as [[pasture]], [[hay]] or [[silage]] to feed farm animals. Some [[Perennial crop|perennial food plants]] are also grown, such as [[fruit]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s in [[orchard]]s, and [[watercress]] grown in water.

Although all cultivation of the soil in arable fields produces carbon dioxide, some arable crops cause more damage to soil than others. [[List of root vegetables|Root crops]] such as [[potato]]es and [[sugar-beet]], and crops which are harvested not just once a year but over a long period such as [[Leaf vegetable|green vegetables and salads]], are considered "high risk" in [[catchment-sensitive farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Soil Protection Review 2010 |date=2009 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |location=London |pages=21–22 |url=http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/resources/000/145/513/PB13311.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 10"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Focus on arable crops (Fact Sheet 10) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS_REV_FS10_Arable%20crops.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners therefore grow at least some of their food,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and may choose [[Agriculture|food crops]] which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland [[soil]]s if they grow such high-risk crops in small [[Kitchen garden|vegetable plots]] in their gardens, where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under [[Commercial agriculture|commercial]] pressures. Climate-friendly gardeners may grow and eat plants such as sweet [[cicely]] which sweeten food, and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet.&lt;ref name="Plants for a Future"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fern |first=Ken |title=Plants for a Future: Edible and useful plants for a healthier world |date=1997 |publisher=Permanent Publications |location=Clanfield, Hampshire |isbn=9781856230117}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They may also choose to grow [[Perennial plant|perennial]] food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland, but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens.&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plants for a Future"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=Robert |title=Forest Gardening |date=1991 |publisher=Green Books |location=Hartland, Devon |isbn=1870098447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toensmeier |first=E. |title=Perennial Vegetables |date=2007 |publisher=Chelsea Green |location=Vermont, United States of America |isbn=9781931498401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassland contains more carbon per hectare than arable fields, but farm animals, especially [[ruminant]]s such as [[cattle]] or [[sheep]], produce large amounts of [[methane]], directly and from manure heaps and slurry.&lt;ref name="Dave Reay 2010"/&gt; Slurry and manure may also produce nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change series: General ways to mitigate climate change (Fact Sheet 4) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS4_Mitigation_WEB_Oct%202008.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gardeners who want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions can help themselves to eat less [[meat]] and [[dairy produce]] by growing [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] trees which are a good source of [[Umami|tasty]], [[protein]]-rich [[food]], including [[walnut]]s which are an excellent source of the [[Omega-3|omega-3 fatty acid]] [[alpha-linolenic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyle |first=Susanna |title=Ultimate Fruit &amp; Nuts: A comprehensive guide to the cultivation, uses and health benefits of over 300 food-producing plants |date=2006 |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |isbn=978-0-7112-2593-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and farmers are investigating and improving ways of farming which are more sustainable, such as [[agroforestry]], [[forest farming]], [[Conservation agriculture|wildlife-friendly farming]], [[soil management]], [[catchment-sensitive farming]] (or water-friendly farming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freshwater Habitats Trust |title=Water-Friendly Farming |url=http://www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Water-Friendly-Farming-Introduction.pdf |website=Freshwater Habitats Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, the organisation [http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk Farming Futures] assists farmers in the United Kingdom to reduce their farms' greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 23"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on energy efficiency (Fact Sheet 23) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS23_Energy%20efficiency.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers are aware that consumers are increasingly asking for "green credentials". Gardeners who understand climate-friendly practices can advocate their use by farmers.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;

====From industry====
[[File:Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing and edible - Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden in Devon]]
Climate-friendly gardeners aim to reduce their consumption in general.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; In particular, they try to avoid or reduce their consumption of tapwater because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to supply the energy needed to treat and pump it to them.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt; Instead, gardeners can garden using only rainwater.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardening Without Water"/&gt;

Greenhouse gases are produced in the [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] of many materials and products used by [[gardener]]s. For example, it takes a lot of [[Energy industry|energy]] to produce [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|synthetic fertilizer]]s, especially nitrogen fertilizers. [[Ammonium nitrate]], for example, has an [[embodied energy]] of 67000 kilojoules/kilogramme,&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt; so [[Sustainable living|climate-friendly]] gardeners will choose alternative ways of ensuring the soil in their gardens has optimal levels of nitrogen by alternative means such as [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing plants]].

Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to follow "[[cradle-to-cradle design]]" and "[[circular economy]]" principles: when they choose to buy or make something, it should be possible to take it apart again and [[Recycling|recycle]] or [[compost]] every part, so that there is no waste, only [[Natural resource|raw materials]] to be made into something else.&lt;ref name="Cradle to Cradle: Re-making the Way We Make Things"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braungart and McDonough |first=Michael and William |title=Cradle to Cradle: Re-making the Way We Make Things |date=2009 |publisher=Vintage, Random House |location=London |isbn=9780099535478}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This will reduce the greenhouse gases otherwise produced when [[Natural resource#Extraction|extracting]] raw materials.

====From transport====
Gardeners can reduce not only their [[food miles]] by growing some of their own food, but also their "gardening miles" by reducing the amount of plants and other materials they import, obtaining them as locally as possible and with as little packaging as possible. This might include ordering plants by [[mail order]] from a specialist nursery if the plants are sent out [[Bare root|bare-root]], reducing transport demand and the use of [[peat]]-based composts; or growing plants from [[seed]], which will also increase [[genetic diversity]] and therefore [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]]; or growing plants [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] from [[Cutting (plant)|cutting]]s or [[Offset (botany)|offset]]s from other local gardeners; or buying reclaimed materials from salvage firms.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;

====From houses====
[[File:Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn colours.JPG|thumb|Climbers as insulation - Boston ivy, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn]]
Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes by:

* Using sunlight and wind to dry washing on washing lines instead of fossil fuel-generated electricity to run [[Clothes dryer|tumble dryer]]s;
* Planting [[deciduous]] [[Vine|climber]]s on houses and planting deciduous trees at suitable distances from the house to provide shade during the summer, reducing the consumption of electricity for [[HVAC#Air conditioning|air conditioning]], but also such that at cooler times of year, sunlight can reach and warm a house, reducing [[HVAC#Heating|heating]] costs and consumption;&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;
* Planting hedges, trees, shrubs and climbers to shelter houses from wind, reducing heating costs and consumption during the winter (as long as any planting does not create a [[Wind tunnel|wind-tunnel]] effect).&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;243&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners may also choose to reduce their own personal greenhouse gas emissions by growing and eating [[carminative]] plants such as [[fennel]] and [[garlic]] which reduce intestinal gases such as methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Gut |date=2008 |publisher=Nottingham University Press |isbn=9781904761570 |first1=W. N. |last1=Ewing |first2=Lucy |last2=Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from gardens ===
[[File:Taxus baccata, yew, as internal hedge at Down House.JPG|thumb|Slow-growing yew, Taxus baccata, as hedge at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent]]
[[File:Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens, red and white clover within meadow.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing red and white clover (Trifolium) as lawn plants]]
[[File:Soil improvement - leaf cage, compost heap and wormery at Wisley.JPG|thumb|Leaf cage, compost heap and wormery at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley]]

There are some patent sources of greenhouse gas emissions in gardens and some more latent.

[[Power tool]]s which are powered by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[petrol]], or [[electricity]] [[Electricity generation|generated]] by burning other [[fossil fuel]]s, emit [[carbon dioxide]]. Climate-friendly gardeners may therefore choose to use [[Garden tool|hand tool]]s rather than power tools, or power tools powered by renewable electricity,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; or [[Garden design|design their gardens]] to reduce or remove a need to use power tools. For example, they may choose dense, slow-growing species for [[hedge]]s so that the hedges only need to be cut once a year.&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"/&gt;

Lawns need[?] to be cut by lawn mowers and, in drier parts of the world, are often irrigated by tapwater. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore do what they can to reduce this consumption by:

* Replacing part of or all lawns with other perennial planting such as trees and shrubs with less ecologically demanding maintenance requirements;
* Cut some or all lawns only once or twice a year, i.e. convert them into [[meadow]]s;
* Make lawn shapes simple so that they may be cut quickly;
* Increase the cutting height of mower blades;
* Use a mulching mower to return organic matter to the soil;
* Sow [[clover]] to increase vigour (without the need for synthetic fertilisers) and resilience in dry periods;

Greenhouses can be used to grow crops which might otherwise be imported from warmer climates, but if they are heated by fossil fuel then they may cause more greenhouse gas emissions than they save. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore use their greenhouses carefully by:

* Choosing only annual plants which will only be in the greenhouse during warmer months, or perennial plants which do not need any extra heat during winter;
* Using water tanks as heat stores and compost heaps as heat sources inside greenhouses so that they stay frost-free in winter.

Climate-friendly gardeners will not put woody prunings on bonfires, which will emit carbon dioxide and black carbon,&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt; but instead burn them indoors in a [[wood-burning stove]] and therefore cut emissions from fossil fuel, or cut them up to use as [[mulch]] and increase soil carbon stores,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; or add the smaller prunings to compost heaps to keep them [[Aeration|aerated]], reducing [[methane emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Kopinska |author2=Jane Griffiths |author3=Heather Jackson |author4=Pauline Pears |title=The Garden Organic Book of Compost|date=2011|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=9781847734372}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of fire, they will also choose fire-resistant plants from habitats which are not prone to [[wildfire]]s and which do not catch fire easily, rather than fire-adapted [[Wildfire#Plant adaptation|plants from fire-prone habitats]] which are flammable and adapted to encourage fires and then gain a competitive advantage over less resistant species.

Climate-friendly gardeners may use deep-rooted plants such as [[comfrey]] to bring nutrients closer to the surface topsoil, but will do so without making the leaves into a liquid feed, because the rotting leaves in the [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] conditions under water may emit methane.

[[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|Nitrogen fertilizer]]s may be [[Nitrous oxide#Soil|oxidised]] to [[nitrous oxide]],&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; especially if fertilizer is applied in excess, or when plants are not actively growing. Climate-friendly gardeners may choose instead to use [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing]] plants which will add nitrogen to the soil without increasing nitrous oxide emissions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3644">'''Co-benefits of climate change mitigation''' as defined in the 4th Assessment Report of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] are the positive benefits related to the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web|last1=IPCC|title=Co-benefits of climate change mitigation|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch4s4-5-3.html|website=Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such climate mitigation policies include improved energy efficiency of plants, renewable energy uptake and fuel switching which might enable a range of co-benefits such as air-pollution impacts, technological innovation, energy-supply security through increased energy diversity, reduced fuel cost and employment possibilities.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; 

==Co-benefits in policy-making==
Co-benefits of GHG mitigation can be an important decision criteria in analyses carried out by policy-makers, but they are often neglected, and often the co-benefits are not quantified, monetised or even identified by businesses and decision-makers. Appropriate consideration of co-benefits can greatly influence policy decisions concerning the timing and level of mitigation action, and there can be significant advantages to the national economy and technical innovation.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;

==Co-benefits in research ==
Different research groups currently examine the impacts of co-benefits of climate change mitigation. One of these projects is the COBENEFITS project of the [[Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. The COBENEFITS project is part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The [[Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German [[Bundestag]]. The project is conducted in close collaboration with government ministries, agencies, research institutions, and think tanks as political partners and knowledge partners in the target countries. These four target countries are [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], and [[Vietnam]]. The project team, thereby, cooperates with national authorities and knowledge partners to develop key insights that enable them to mobilise these co-benefits in their countries and accelerate domestic processes aimed at achieving their international climate protection commitments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cobenefits.info/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4629">In proving results in [[combinatorics]] several useful '''combinatorial rules''' or '''combinatorial principles''' are commonly recognized and used.

The [[rule of sum]], [[rule of product]], and [[inclusion–exclusion principle]] are often used for [[Enumerative combinatorics|enumerative]] purposes. [[Bijective proof]]s are utilized to demonstrate that two sets have the same [[cardinality|number of elements]]. The [[pigeonhole principle]] often ascertains the existence of something or is used to determine the minimum or maximum number of something in a [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] context. Many [[combinatorial identities]] arise from [[Double counting (proof technique)|double counting]] methods or the [[method of distinguished element]]. [[Generating function]]s and [[recurrence relation]]s are powerful tools that can be used to manipulate sequences, and can describe if not resolve many combinatorial situations.

== Rule of sum ==

{{main|Rule of sum}}

The rule of sum is an intuitive principle stating that if there are ''a'' possible outcomes for an event (or ways to do something) and ''b'' possible outcomes for another event (or ways to do another thing), and the two events cannot both occur (or the two things can't both be done), then there are ''a + b'' total possible outcomes for the events (or total possible ways to do one of the things). More formally, the sum of the sizes of two [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] sets is equal to the size of their union.

== Rule of product ==

{{main|Rule of product}}

The rule of product is another intuitive principle stating that if there are ''a'' ways to do something and ''b'' ways to do another thing, then there are ''a''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''b'' ways to do both things.

== Inclusion–exclusion principle ==

[[File:Inclusion-exclusion.svg|thumb|Inclusion–exclusion illustrated for three sets]]

{{main|Inclusion–exclusion principle}}

The inclusion–exclusion principle relates the size of the union of multiple sets, the size of each set, and the size of each possible intersection of the sets. The smallest example is when there are two sets: the number of elements in the union of ''A'' and ''B'' is equal to the sum of the number of elements in ''A'' and ''B'', minus the number of elements in their intersection.

Generally, according to this principle, if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are finite sets, then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\biggl|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr| &amp; {} =\sum_{i=1}^n\left|A_i\right|
-\sum_{i,j\,:\,1 \le i &lt; j \le n}\left|A_i\cap A_j\right| \\
&amp; {}\qquad +\sum_{i,j,k\,:\,1 \le i &lt; j &lt; k \le n}\left|A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k\right|-\ \cdots\ + \left(-1\right)^{n-1} \left|A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n\right|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Bijective proof ==

{{main|Bijective proof}}

Bijective proofs prove that two sets have the same number of elements by finding a [[bijective function]] (one-to-one correspondence) from one set to the other.

== Double counting ==

{{main|Double counting (proof technique)}}

Double counting is a technique that equates two expressions that count the size of a set in two ways.

== Pigeonhole principle ==

{{main|Pigeonhole principle}}

The pigeonhole principle states that if ''a'' items are each put into one of ''b'' boxes, where ''a'' &gt; ''b'', then one of the boxes contains more than one item. Using this one can, for example, demonstrate the existence of some element in a set with some specific properties.

== Method of distinguished element ==

{{main|Method of distinguished element}}

The method of distinguished element singles out a "distinguished element" of a set to prove some result.

== Generating function ==

{{main|Generating function}}

Generating functions can be thought of as polynomials with infinitely many terms whose coefficients correspond to terms of a sequence. This new representation of the sequence opens up new methods for finding identities and closed forms pertaining to certain sequences. The (ordinary) generating function of a sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;G(a_n;x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n.&lt;/math&gt;

== Recurrence relation ==

{{main|Recurrence relation}}

A recurrence relation defines each term of a sequence in terms of the preceding terms. Recurrence relations may lead to previously unknown properties of a sequence, but generally [[closed-form expression]]s for the terms of a sequence are more desired.

The '''Coorgi–Cox alphabet''' is an [[alphabet]] developed by the [[linguist]] Gregg M. Cox and is used by a number of individuals within [[Kodagu]] district of India. It is the independent dialect of [[Tulu language|Tulu]]. It is used for the endangered [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language of [[Kodava language|Kodava]], also known sometimes as ''Coorgi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/12/stories/2006031206840300.htm|title=Debate on Kodava script continues|date=March 12, 2006|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coorgi–Cox alphabet uses a combination of 26 [[consonant]]s, five [[vowel]] markings and a [[diphthong]] marker. Each letter represents a single sound and there are no [[capital letter]]s. A computer based font has been created for use with the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;The Coorgi-Cox handbook, Feb. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabet was developed out of the request by a group of native individuals to have their own unique script for Kodava Takk, and to distinguish the language on its own merits. Kodava Takk is generally written in the [[Kannada script]], but can also be found written in the [[Malayalam script]] especially along the borders with [[Kerala]]. The new alphabet is intended to unify, and to provide a single alphabet to be used for all Kodava Takk speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Cox, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to introduce the alphabet, 10,000 CD booklets and 25,000 post cards with various scenes from the region were produced and distributed throughout the Coorg area in March and April 2005. Several books are being planned including a [[phrase book]] and [[dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Sujet publishers, Sep. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12015">A '''crime against peace''', in [[international law]], is "planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of [[War of aggression|wars of aggression]], or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing".&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of crimes against peace was first incorporated into the [[Nuremberg Principles]] and later included in the [[United Nations Charter]]. This definition would play a part in defining [[Aggression (war crime)|aggression as a crime against peace]]. It can also refer to the core international crimes set out in [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], ([[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]]) which adopted crimes negotiated previously in the Draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind.

An important exception to the foregoing are defensive military actions taken under [[Article 51]] of the UN Charter. Such defensive actions are subject to immediate [[Security Council]] review, but do not require UN permission to be legal within international law. "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations." (UN Charter, Article 51) The Security Council will determine if the action is legally the "right of individual or collective self-defence", or it may appoint another UN organ to do this.

==Definition==

{{Original research section|date=June 2008}}
No legal authority exists for the definition of the terms ''"[[territorial integrity]]"'', ''"[[independence|political independence]]"'' and ''"[[sovereignty]]"''. However, their [[face value]] would seem to disclose the following:

* The ''"territorial integrity"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent permanently to deprive a state of any part or parts of its territory, not excluding territories for the foreign affairs of which it is responsible;
* The ''"political independence"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent to deprive a state of the entirety of one or more of the prerequisites of statehood, namely: defined territory, permanent population, constitutionally independent government and the means of conducting relations with other States;
* The ''"sovereignty"'' rule means that it is a crime of aggression to use armed force with intent to overthrow the government of a state or to impede its freedom to act unhindered, as it sees fit, throughout its jurisdiction.

This definition of the crime of aggression belongs to ''[[jus cogens]]'', which is supreme in the hierarchy of [[international law]] and, therefore, it cannot be modified by, or give way to, any rule of international law but one of the same rank. An arguable example is any rule imposing a conflicting obligation to prevent, interdict or vindicate crimes which also belong to ''jus cogens'', namely [[aggression]] itself, [[crimes against humanity]], [[genocide]], [[war crimes]], [[slavery]], [[torture]] and [[piracy]], so that a war waged consistent with the aim of repressing any of these crimes might not be illegal where the crime comes within the limit of [[Proportionality (political maxim)|proportionality]] relative to [[war]] and its characteristic effects.

==Kellogg-Briand Pact==
In 1928, the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], known as the ''General Treaty for the Renunciation of War'', said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a nation does not register with the UN as recognizing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, even if the nation had signed it, the UN cannot hold a claimed violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to be a violation of international law (according to its own Charter, Article 102). The interpretation of Article 102 is reserved to the Security Council, so it is possible that a "crime against peace" might be found by the Security Council, regardless.

==Nuremberg Principles==

In 1945, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] defined three categories of crimes, including ''crimes against peace''. This definition was first used in [[Finland]] to prosecute the political leadership in the [[War-responsibility trials in Finland]]. The principles were later known as the [[Nuremberg Principles]].

In 1950, the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Tribunal]] defined Crimes against Peace (in Principle VI.a, submitted to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]) as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances; 
(ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council, which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939"

For committing this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced a number of persons responsible for starting [[World War II]].  One consequence of this is that nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or - it seems - the enforcement of the [[criminal law]] of ''[[jus cogens]]''. It has made formal [[declaration of war]] uncommon after 1945.

During the trial, the chief American prosecutor, [[Robert H. Jackson]], stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Associate Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]] charged that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were guilty of "substituting power for principle" at Nuremberg. "I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled.", he wrote. "Law was created [[ex post facto]] to suit the passion and clamor of the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson, Jr |first1=H. K.|last2=Strutz |first2=Henry|date= |title=Dönitz at Nuremberg: A Reappraisal |url= |location= |publisher=Torrance|page= |isbn=978-0939484058  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations Charter==
The first article of the [[United Nations Charter]] says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Purposes of the [[United Nations]] are:

#To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the [[peace]], and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of [[justice]] and [[international law]], adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a [[breach of the peace]];
#To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of [[Civil rights|equal rights]] and [[self-determination]] of [[peoples]], and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The interdiction of [[War of Aggression|aggressive war]] was confirmed and broadened by the United Nations' Charter, which states in article 2, paragraph 4 that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 33===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.

The [[Security Council]] shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to settle their dispute by such means. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 39===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Security Council]] shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Article 51===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the [[United Nations]], until the [[Security Council]] has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==U.S. laws of war==

The [[U.S. Army]]'s ''Law of Land Warfare'' (Field Manual 27-10) states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
498. [[Crimes Under International Law]]

Any person, whether a member of the armed forces or a civilian, who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment. Such offenses in connection with war comprise:

:a. '''Crimes against peace.'''
:b. Crimes against humanity.
:c. War crimes.

Although this manual recognizes the criminal responsibility of individuals for those offenses which may comprise any of the foregoing types of crimes, members of the armed forces will normally be concerned, only with those offenses constituting "war crimes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/27-10/Ch8.htm#s2 FM 27-10 Chptr 8 Remedies for Violation of International Law; War Crimes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (emphasis added)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vietnam's Criminal Code==

[[Vietnam]]'s Criminal Code calls this crime as the crime of "Undermining peace, provoking aggressive wars".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chapter XXIV: CRIMES OF UNDERMINING PEACE, AGAINST HUMANITY AND WAR CRIMES

:Article 341. Undermining peace, provoking aggressive wars

::Those who propagate and/or incite wars of aggression, or prepare, carry out or participate in wars of aggression against the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country, shall be sentenced to between twelve years and twenty years of imprisonment, life imprisonment or capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/en/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=610 Vietnam's PENAL CODE]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|directly landing on the Moon or other body|direct injection|Parking orbit}}
'''Direct ascent''' is a method of landing a spacecraft on the Moon or another planet directly, without first assembling the vehicle in Earth orbit, or carrying a separate landing vehicle into orbit around the target body. It was proposed as the first method to achieve a manned lunar landing in the United States [[Apollo program]], but was rejected because it would have required developing a prohibitively large [[launch vehicle]]. It was used to launch uncrewed lunar landers in the United States [[Surveyor program]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna program]].

==Apollo program==
[[Image:Apollo Direct Ascent.png|thumb|right|190px|Artist's conception of an early Apollo spacecraft that would have used direct ascent]]
The [[Apollo program]] was initially planned based on the assumption that direct ascent would be used.&lt;ref name=apollo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html|title=NASA - Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program|publisher=NASA|date=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have required developing an enormous [[launch vehicle]], either the [[Saturn C-8]] or [[Nova rocket]], to launch the three-man [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo spacecraft]], with an attached landing module, directly to the Moon, where it would land tail-first and then launch off the Moon for the return to Earth.  The other two options that [[NASA]] considered required a somewhat smaller launch vehicle, either the [[Saturn C-4]] or [[Saturn V|C-5]]. These were [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous#Apollo|Earth Orbit Rendezvous]], which would have involved at least two launches to assemble the direct-landing and return vehicle in orbit; and [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR), which carried a smaller two-man [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar lander]] spacecraft for flight between lunar orbit and the surface. LOR was the strategy used successfully in Apollo.&lt;ref name=apollo/&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] also considered several direct ascent strategies, though in the end they settled on an approach similar to NASA's: two men in a [[Soyuz spacecraft]] with a one-man [[LK (spacecraft)|LK]] lander.  The failure of the Soviets' [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] delayed their lunar program substantially, however, and they were nowhere close to a successful N1 launch when [[Apollo 11]] lifted off and made the first manned [[lunar landing]]. The Soviets had planned to use an [[LK (spacecraft)|LK]], which looked much like a smaller version of the spider-like [[Lunar Module]], although [[OKB-52]] continued to develop the [[UR-700]] modular booster for the direct ascent [[LK-700]] ship.

[[Science fiction]] movies such as ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'' had frequently depicted direct ascent missions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2257">In [[mathematics]], a '''double vector bundle''' is the combination of two compatible [[vector bundle]] structures, which contains in particular the double tangent &lt;math&gt;TE&lt;/math&gt; of a vector bundle &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and the [[double tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;T^2M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition and first consequences==
A '''double vector bundle''' consists of &lt;math&gt;(E, E^H, E^V, B)&lt;/math&gt;, where 
# the ''side bundles'' &lt;math&gt;E^H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^V&lt;/math&gt; are vector bundles over the base &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a vector bundle on both side bundles &lt;math&gt;E^H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^V&lt;/math&gt;,
# the projection, the addition, the scalar multiplication and the zero map on ''E'' for both vector bundle structures are morphisms.

==Double vector bundle morphism==

A '''double vector bundle morphism''' &lt;math&gt;(f_E, f_H, f_V, f_B)&lt;/math&gt; consists of maps &lt;math&gt;f_E : E \mapsto E'&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;f_H : E^H \mapsto E^H{}'&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;f_V : E^V \mapsto E^V{}'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;f_B : B \mapsto B'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(f_E, f_V)&lt;/math&gt; is a bundle morphism from &lt;math&gt;(E, E^V)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(E', E^V{}')&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(f_E, f_H)&lt;/math&gt; is a bundle morphism from &lt;math&gt;(E, E^H)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(E', E^H{}')&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(f_V, f_B)&lt;/math&gt; is a bundle morphism from &lt;math&gt;(E^V, B)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(E^V{}', B')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(f_H, f_B)&lt;/math&gt; is a bundle morphism from &lt;math&gt;(E^H, B)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(E^H{}', B')&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''flip'' of the double vector bundle &lt;math&gt;(E, E^H, E^V, B)&lt;/math&gt; is the double vector bundle &lt;math&gt;(E, E^V, E^H, B)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

If &lt;math&gt;(E, M)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector bundle over a differentiable manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(TE, E, TM, M)&lt;/math&gt; is a double vector bundle when considering its [[secondary vector bundle structure]].

If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a differentiable manifold, then its [[double tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;(TTM, TM, TM , M)&lt;/math&gt; is a double vector bundle.

Some fallacies are committed intentionally to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] or [[Persuasion|persuade]] by [[deception]], while others are committed unintentionally due to carelessness or ignorance. The [[soundness]] of [[legal argument]]s depends on the context in which the arguments are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Bustamente |editor1-first = Thomas |editor2-last = Dahlman |editor2-first = Christian |title = Argument types and fallacies in legal argumentation |date = 2015 |publisher = Springer International Publishing |location = Heidelberg |isbn = 978-3-319-16147-1 |page = x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallacies are commonly divided into "formal" and "informal". A [[formal fallacy]] can be expressed neatly in a standard system of logic, such as [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]],&lt;ref name="GenslerAZ"/&gt; while an [[informal fallacy]] originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper logical form.&lt;ref name=garns&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nku.edu/~garns/165/ppt3_2.html |title = Informal Fallacies, Northern Kentucky University |date =  |accessdate = 2013-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally [[Validity (logic)|valid]], but still fallacious.&lt;ref name=Downden&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Dowden |first1 = Bradley |title = Fallacy |url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/ |website = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate = 17 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special case is a [[mathematical fallacy]], an intentionally invalid [[mathematical]] [[mathematical proof|proof]], often with the error subtle and somehow concealed. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of spurious proofs of obvious [[contradiction]]s.

==Overview==
Fallacies are defects that weaken arguments. Fallacious arguments are very common and can be persuasive in common use. They may be even "unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The new handbook of cognitive therapy techniques |last = McMullin |first = Rian E. |date = 2000 |publisher = W. W. Norton |isbn = 978-0393703139 |edition = [Rev. ed.] |location = New York |oclc = 41580357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal fallacies in particular are found frequently in mass media such as television and newspapers.&lt;ref name="McMurty1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = McMurtry |first1 = John |title = The mass media: An analysis of their system of fallacy |journal = Interchange |date = December 1990 |volume = 21 |issue = 4 |pages = 49–66 |doi = 10.1007/BF01810092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to understand what fallacies are so that one can recognize them in either one's own or others' writing. Avoiding fallacies will strengthen one's ability to produce strong arguments.

It can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious, as arguments exist along a continuum of [[soundness]] and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones.&lt;ref name="DeLancey_Handout"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = DeLancey |first1 = Craig, Ph.D. |title = Evaluating Arguments—Distinguishing between reasonable and fallacious tactics |url = https://writingcenter.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/evaluatingarguments.pdf |website = oswego.edu |publisher = self-published |accessdate = 7 March 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130903171329/http://writingcenter.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/evaluatingarguments.pdf |archive-date = 2013-09-03 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments."{{refn|1={{named ref|name=Damer 2009}} [https://books.google.cz/books?id=-qZabUx0FmkC&amp;pg=PA52 page&amp;nbsp;52].}} Recognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in [[rhetoric]]al patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements. Informal fallacies may also exploit the [[emotion]]al, intellectual, or [[psychology|psychological]] weaknesses of the audience. Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true.

[[Argumentation theory]] provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies. In this approach, an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals that attempts to resolve their disagreements. The protocol is regulated by certain rules of interaction, so violations of these rules are fallacies.

Fallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade. Examples in the [[mass media]] today include but are not limited to [[propaganda]], [[advertisement]]s, [[politics]], newspaper editorials and opinion-based “news” shows.

==&lt;span id="Material fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Systems of classification==
Because of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or their content, such as classifying them as [[Formal fallacy|formal fallacies]] or [[Informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006"&gt;{{cite book |last = Pirie |first = Madsen |authorlink = Madsen Pirie |title = How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;pg=PA46 |accessdate = 10 September 2015 |year = 2006 |publisher = A&amp;C Black |isbn = 978-0-8264-9006-3 |page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as [[Material fallacy|material fallacies]] (content), [[Verbal fallacy|verbal fallacies]] (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies. Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed in either formal or informal classifications; compare [[equivocation]] which is a word or phrase based [[ambiguity]], e. g. "he is mad", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the [[fallacy of composition]] which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. "this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = fallacy |url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/fallacy#toc280530 |website = Encyclopedia Brittanica |publisher = Encyclopedia Brittanica |accessdate = 13 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the definitions of the classes may not be unique. For example, [[#Whately's grouping|Whately]] treats material fallacies as a complement to logical fallacies, which makes them synonymous to informal fallacies, while others consider them to be a subclass of informal fallacies, like mentioned above.

===&lt;span id="Verbal fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] was the first to systematize logical errors into a list, as being able to refute an opponent's thesis is one way of winning an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 2 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's "[[Sophistical Refutations]]" (''De Sophisticis Elenchis'') identifies thirteen fallacies. He divided them up into two major types, linguistic fallacies and non-linguistic fallacies, some depending on language and others that do not depend on language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://thenonsequitur.com/?page_id=621 |title = Aristotle's original 13 fallacies |publisher = The Non Sequitur |accessdate = 2013-05-28 |date = 2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.logiclaw.co.uk/fallacies/Straker3.html |title = Aristotle's 13 fallacies |website = www.logiclaw.co.uk |access-date = 2017-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fallacies are called verbal fallacies and material fallacies, respectively. A [[material fallacy]] is an error in what the arguer is talking about, while a [[verbal fallacy]] is an error in how the arguer is talking. Verbal fallacies are those in which a conclusion is obtained by improper or ambiguous use of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://aristotle.tamu.edu/~rasmith/Courses/PhilosophicalWriting/08a/fallacies.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905215503/http://aristotle.tamu.edu/~rasmith/Courses/PhilosophicalWriting/08a/fallacies.html |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2008-09-05 |title = PHIL 495: Philosophical Writing (Spring 2008), Texas A&amp;M University |date =  |accessdate = 2013-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a language dependent fallacy is given as a debate as to who amongst humanity are learners: the wise or the ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 3 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A language-independent fallacy is for example:
# "[[Coriscus of Scepsis|Coriscus]] is different from Socrates."
# "Socrates is a man."
# "Therefore, Coriscus is different from a man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 4 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whately's grouping===

[[Richard Whately]] defines a fallacy broadly as, "any argument, or apparent argument, which professes to be decisive of the matter at hand, while in reality it is not".&lt;ref&gt;Frans H. van Eemeren, Bart Garssen, Bert Meuffels (2009). ''Fallacies and Judgments of Reasonableness: Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules'', p.8. {{ISBN|9789048126149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whately divided fallacies into two groups: ''logical'' and ''material''. According to Whately, logical fallacies are arguments where the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Material fallacies are not logical errors because the conclusion does follow from the premises. He then divided the logical group into two groups: purely logical and semi-logical. The semi-logical group included all of Aristotle's [[sophisms]] except:''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'', ''[[petitio principii]]'', and ''[[non causa pro causa]]'', which are in the material group.&lt;ref name="Coffey1912"&gt;{{cite book |first = P. |last = Coffey |year = 1912 |title = The Science of Logic |publisher = Longmans, Green, and Company |lccn = 12018756 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j8BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 |page = 302 |accessdate = 2016-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other systems of classification===
Of other classifications of fallacies in general the most famous are those of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] and [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]. Bacon (''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aph. 33, 38 sqq.) divided fallacies into four Idola (Idols, i.e. False Appearances), which summarize the various kinds of mistakes to which the human intellect is prone. With these should be compared the Offendicula of Roger Bacon, contained in the Opus maius, pt. i. J. S. Mill discussed the subject in book v. of his Logic, and [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s Book of Fallacies (1824) contains valuable remarks. See Rd. Whateley's Logic, bk. v.; A. de Morgan, Formal Logic (1847); A. Sidgwick, Fallacies (1883) and other textbooks.

==Formal fallacy==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}

A formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, logical fallacy or ''non sequitur'' ([[Latin]] for "it does not follow") is a flaw in the structure of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[logical argument|argument]] which renders the argument [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]. The flaw can neatly be expressed in standard system of logic.&lt;ref name="GenslerAZ"/&gt; Such an argument is always considered to be wrong.
The presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument's [[premise]]s or its conclusion. Both may actually be true, or may even be more probable as a result of the argument; but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described.

{{Dubious span|text=By extension, an argument can contain a formal fallacy even if the argument is not a deductive one: for instance, an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or [[causality]] can be said to commit a formal fallacy.|date=May 2018}} "Since deductive arguments depend on formal properties and inductive arguments don't, formal fallacies apply only to deductive arguments."&lt;ref name=garns /&gt;

A logical form such as "''A'' and ''B''" is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions. Logical form alone can guarantee that given true premises, a true conclusion must follow. However, formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false; the conclusion can be either true or false. Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee. Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a statement to be true.

The term ''logical fallacy'' is in a sense self-contradictory, because ''logic'' refers to valid reasoning, whereas a ''fallacy'' is the use of poor reasoning. Therefore, the term ''formal fallacy'' is preferred. In informal discourse however, ''logical fallacy'' is used to mean an argument which is problematic for any reason.

The term ''non sequitur'' denotes a general formal fallacy, often meaning one which does not belong to any named subclass of formal fallacies like [[affirming the consequent]].

===Common examples===
{{main|List of fallacies#Formal fallacies}}

==== Ecological fallacy ====
An [[ecological fallacy]] is committed when one draws an inference from data based on the premise that qualities observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals; for example, "if countries with more Protestants tend to have higher suicide rates, then Protestants must be more likely to commit suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Freedman |first = David A. |title = Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods |year = 2004 |publisher = Sage |location = Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn = 978-0761923633 |pages = 293–295 |authorlink = Ecological Fallacy |editor = Michael S. Lewis-Beck &amp; Alan Bryman &amp; Tim Futing Liao }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fallacy fork===
[[Maarten Boudry]] argues that formal, deductive fallacies rarely occur in real life and that arguments that would be fallacious in formally deductive terms are not necessarily so when context and prior probabilities are taken into account, thus making the argument defeasible and inductive. For a given fallacy, one must either characterize it by means of a deductive argumentation schema, which rarely applies (the first prong of the fork) or one must relax definitions and add nuance to take the actual intent and context of the argument into account (the other prong of the fork).  To argue, for example, that one became nauseous after eating a mushroom because the mushroom was poisonous could be an example of the ''post hoc ergo propter hoc'' fallacy unless one were actually arguing inductively and probabilistically that it is likely that the mushroom caused the illness since some mushrooms are poisonous, it is possible to misidentify a mushroom as edible, one doesn't usually feel nauseous, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boudry |first1=Maarten |authorlink1=Maarten Boudry |title=The Fallacy Fork: Why It's Time to Get Rid of Fallacy Theory |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal fallacy==
In contrast to a formal fallacy, an informal fallacy originates in a reasoning error other than a flaw in the logical form of the argument.&lt;ref name=garns /&gt; A [[deductive argument]] containing an informal fallacy may be formally [[Validity (logic)|valid]],&lt;ref name=Downden /&gt; but still remain rationally unpersuasive. Nevertheless, informal fallacies apply to both deductive and non-deductive arguments.

Though the form of the argument may be relevant, fallacies of this type are the "types of mistakes in reasoning that arise from the mishandling of the ''content'' of the propositions constituting the argument".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Copi |first1 = Irving M. |last2 = Cohen |first2 = Carl |year = 2005 |title = Introduction to Logic |edition = 12 |publisher = Pearson Education, Inc. |isbn = 978-0-13-189834-9 }} p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty generalization ===
A special subclass of the informal fallacies is the set of [[faulty generalization]]s, also known as inductive fallacies. Here the most important issue concerns inductive strength or methodology (for example, [[statistical inference]]). In the absence of sufficient evidence, drawing conclusions based on induction is unwarranted and fallacious. With the backing of [[empirical evidence]], however, the conclusions may become warranted and convincing (at which point the arguments are no longer considered fallacious).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==== Hasty generalization ====
For instance, [[hasty generalization]] is making assumptions about a whole group or range of cases based on a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] that is inadequate (usually because it is atypical or just too small).
Stereotypes about people ("frat boys are drunkards", "grad students are nerdy", "women don’t enjoy sports", etc.) are a common example of the principle.

Hasty generalisation often follows a pattern such as:

:X is true for A.
:X is true for B.
:Therefore, X is true for C, D, etc.

While never a valid logical deduction, if such an inference can be made on statistical grounds, it may nonetheless be convincing. This is because with enough empirical evidence, the generalization is no longer a hasty one.

=== Relevance fallacy ===
The [[fallacy of relevance|fallacies of relevance]] are a broad class of informal fallacies (see the [[#Fallacies of relevance|navbox below]]), generically represented by [[missing the point]]: Presenting an argument, which may be [[soundness|sound]], but fails to address the issue in question.

==== ''Argumentum ex silentio'' ====
An [[argument from silence]] features an unwarranted conclusion advanced based on the absence of data.

=== Examples of informal fallacies ===
{{Main|List of fallacies#Informal fallacies}}

==== ''Post hoc'' (false cause) ====
This fallacy gets its name from the Latin phrase "post hoc, ergo propter hoc," which translates as "after this, therefore because of this."
''Definition:'' Assuming that because B comes after A, A caused B.
Sometimes one event really does cause another one that comes later—for example, if I register for a class, and my name later appears on the roll, it's true that the first event caused the one that came later. But sometimes two events that seem related in time aren't really related as cause and event. That is, correlation isn't the same thing as causation.

==== Slippery slope ====
''Definition:'' The arguer claims that a sort of chain reaction, usually ending in some dire consequence, will take place, but in fact there is not enough evidence for that assumption.
The arguer asserts that if we take even one step onto the "[[slippery slope]]," we will end up sliding all the way to the bottom; he or she assumes we can't stop halfway down the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/eng207-td/Logic%20and%20Analysis/most_common_logical_fallacies.htm |title = The Most Common Logical Fallacies |website = www.webpages.uidaho.edu |access-date = 2017-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== False analogy ====
This error in reasoning occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons, hence the [[false analogy]]'s informal nickname of the "[[apples and oranges]]" fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kornprobst |first = Markus |title = Comparing Apples and Oranges? Leading and Misleading Uses of Historical Analogies |journal = Millennium&amp;nbsp;— Journal of International Studies |year = 2007 |volume = 36 |pages = 29–49 |doi = 10.1177/03058298070360010301 |url = http://mil.sagepub.com/content/36/1/29 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20131030094151/http://mil.sagepub.com/content/36/1/29 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 30 October 2013 |accessdate = 29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement fallacy==
Some of the fallacies described above may be committed in the context of measurement.
Where [[mathematical fallacies]] are subtle mistakes in reasoning leading to invalid mathematical proofs, measurement fallacies are unwarranted inferential leaps involved in the extrapolation of raw data to a measurement-based value claim. The ancient Greek Sophist [[Protagoras]] was one of the first thinkers to propose that humans can generate reliable measurements through his "human-measure" principle and the practice of ''dissoi logoi'' (arguing multiple sides of an issue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Schiappa |first = Edward |title = Protagoras and Logos: A Study in Greek Philosophy and Rhetoric |year = 1991 |publisher = University of South Carolina Press |location = Columbia, SC |isbn = 978-0872497580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Protagoras |title = The Older Sophists |year = 1972 |publisher = Hackett Publishing Co. |location = Indianapolis, IN |isbn = 978-0872205567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This history helps explain why measurement fallacies are informed by [[informal logic]] and [[argumentation theory]].

===Knowledge value measurement fallacy===
Increasing availability and circulation of [[big data]] are driving proliferation of new metrics for scholarly authority,&lt;ref name=Meho&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Meho |first = Lokman I. |year = 2007 |title = The Rise and Rise of Citation Analysis |journal = [[Physics World]] |volume = January |pages = 32–36 |arxiv = physics/0701012 |bibcode = 2007physics...1012M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Metrics-of-Scholarly/5449 |title = The New Metrics of Scholarly Authority |last = Jensen |first = Michael |date = June 15, 2007 |work = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |access-date = 28 October 2013 |publisher = The Chron |editor-last = Riley |editor-first = Michael G. |issn = 0009-5982 |oclc = 1554535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is lively discussion regarding the relative usefulness of such metrics for measuring the value of knowledge production in the context of an "information tsunami".&lt;ref name="Baveye 2010 191–215"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Baveye |first = Phillippe C. |year = 2010 |title = Sticker Shock and Looming Tsunami: The High Cost of Academic Serials in Perspective |url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/369309 |journal = [[Journal of Scholarly Publishing]] |volume = 41 |issue = 2 |pages = 191–215 |doi = 10.1353/scp.0.0074 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[anchoring]] fallacies can occur when unwarranted weight is given to data generated by metrics that the arguers themselves acknowledge is flawed. For example, limitations of the [[journal impact factor]] (JIF) are well documented,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/CCA%20Impact%20Factor%20Report%20Final.pdf |title = Impact Factors, Journal Quality, and Communication Journals: A Report for the Council of Communication Associations |last = National Communication Journal |publisher = National Communication Association |year = 2013 |location = Washington, D.C. |access-date = 2016-02-22 |archive-date = April 4, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160404212454/http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/CCA%20Impact%20Factor%20Report%20Final.pdf |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even JIF pioneer Eugene Garfield notes, "while citation data create new tools for analyses of research performance, it should be stressed that they supplement rather than replace other quantitative-and qualitative-indicators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Gafield |first = Eugene |title = What Citations Tell us About Canadian Research |journal = Canadian Journal of Library and Information Science |year = 1993 |volume = 18 |issue = 4 |page = 34 |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that arguers jettison acknowledged limitations of JIF-generated data in evaluative judgments, or leave behind Garfield's "supplement rather than replace" caveat, they court commission of anchoring fallacies.

A [[naturalistic fallacy]] can occur for example in the case of sheer quantity metrics based on the premise "more is better"&lt;ref name="Baveye 2010 191–215" /&gt; or, in the case of developmental assessment in the field of psychology, "higher is better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Stein |first = Zachary |title = Myth Busting and Metric Making: Refashioning the Discourse about Development |journal = Integral Leadership Review |date = October 2008 |volume = 8 |issue = 5 |url = http://www.archive-ilr.com/archives-2008/2008-10/2008-10-article-stein.php |archive-url = https://archive.is/20131030094158/http://www.archive-ilr.com/archives-2008/2008-10/2008-10-article-stein.php |archive-date = October 30, 2013 |access-date = October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[false analogy]] occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons between data points. For example, the [[Scopus]] and [[Web of Science]] bibliographic databases have difficulty distinguishing between citations of scholarly work that are arms-length endorsements, ceremonial citations, or negative citations (indicating the citing author withholds endorsement of the cited work).&lt;ref name=Meho/&gt; Hence, measurement-based value claims premised on the uniform quality of all citations may be questioned on false analogy grounds.

For the next example let us consider Academic Analytics' [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]], which purports to measure overall faculty productivity, yet the tool does not capture data based on citations in books. This creates a possibility that low productivity measurements using the tool may constitute [[argument from silence]] fallacies, to the extent that such measurements are supported by the absence of book citation data.

[[Ecological fallacy|Ecological fallacies]] can be committed when one measures scholarly productivity of a sub-group of individuals (e.g. "Puerto Rican" faculty) via reference to aggregate data about a larger and different group (e.g. "Hispanic" faculty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Allen |first = Henry L. |title = Faculty Workload and Productivity: Ethnic and Gender Disparities |journal = NEA 1997 Almanac of Higher Education |year = 1997 |page = 39 |url = http://www.nea.org/assets/img/PubAlmanac/ALM_97_04.pdf |format = PDF |access-date = October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional fallacy==

Sometimes a speaker or writer uses a fallacy intentionally. In any context, including academic debate, a conversation among friends, political discourse, advertising, or for comedic purposes, the arguer may use fallacious reasoning to try to persuade the listener or reader, by means other than offering relevant evidence, that the conclusion is true.

Examples of this include the speaker or writer:&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;
{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=22s9JWeHJbAC&amp;pg=PA92 |title = Applications of Grammar: Principles of Effective Communication |last = Shewan |first = Edward |publisher = Christian Liberty Press |year = 2003 |isbn = 978-1-930367-28-9 |edition = 2nd |access-date = February 22, 2016 |chapter-url = https://books.google.es/books?id=22s9JWeHJbAC&amp;pg=PA84 |chapter = Soundness of Argument }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

# Diverting the argument to unrelated issues with a [[Red herring#Logical fallacy|red herring]] ([[Ignoratio elenchi]])
# Insulting someone's character ([[Ad hominem|argumentum ad hominem]])
# Assume the conclusion of an argument, a kind of circular reasoning, also called "begging the question" ([[begging the question|petitio principi]])
# Making jumps in logic ([[Non sequitur (logic)|non-sequitur]])
# Identifying a false cause and effect ([[post hoc ergo propter hoc]])
# Asserting that everyone agrees ([[argumentum ad populum]], [[Bandwagon effect|bandwagoning]])
# Creating a "false dilemma" ([[False dilemma|"either-or fallacy"]]) in which the situation is oversimplified
# Selectively using facts ([[Card stacking|card-stacking]])
# Making false or misleading comparisons ([[false equivalence]] and [[false analogy]])
# Generalizing quickly and sloppily ([[hasty generalization]])

In humor, errors of reasoning are used for comical purposes. Groucho Marx used fallacies of [[amphiboly]], for instance, to make ironic statements; [[Gary Larson]] and [[Scott Adams]] employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons. Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive by means of a whole host of informal and formal fallacies.&lt;ref name="How to Be Persuasive"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.rinkworks.com/persuasive/ |title = How to Be Persuasive |last = Boyer |first = Web |last2 = Stoddard |first2 = Samuel |website = Rink Works |access-date = December 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment&amp;nbsp;— pragmatic theory==
According to the pragmatic theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Douglas N. |last1 = Walton |url = https://books.google.es/books?id=4uTWAAAAMAAJ |title = A Pragmatic Theory of Fallacy |publisher = [[University of Alabama Press]] |author-link = Douglas N. Walton |year = 1995 |location = Tuscaloosa |pages = 324 |isbn = 9780817307981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a fallacy can in some instances be an error a fallacy, use of a heuristic (short version of an argumentation scheme) to jump to a conclusion. However, even more worryingly, in other instances it is a tactic or ploy used inappropriately in argumentation to try to get the best of a speech part unfairly. There are always two parties to an argument containing a fallacy&amp;nbsp;— the perpetrator and the intended victim. The dialogue framework required to support the pragmatic theory of fallacy is built on the presumption that argumentative dialogue has both an adversarial component and a collaborative component. A dialogue has individual goals for each participant, but also collective (shared) goals that apply to all participants. A fallacy of the second kind is seen as more than simply violation of a rule of reasonable dialogue. It is also a deceptive tactic of argumentation, based on sleight-of-hand. Aristotle explicitly compared contentious reasoning to unfair fighting in athletic contest. But the roots of the pragmatic theory go back even further in history to the Sophists. The pragmatic theory finds its roots in the Aristotelian conception of a fallacy as a sophistical refutation, but also supports the view that many of the types of arguments traditionally labelled as fallacies are in fact reasonable techniques of argumentation that can be used, in many cases, to support legitimate goals of dialogue. Hence on the pragmatic approach, each case needs to analyzed individually, to determine by the textual evidence whether the argument is fallacious or reasonable.

'''Gutter oil''' ({{zh|c=地沟油|p=dìgōu yóu}}, or {{zh|c=餿水油|p=sōushuǐ yóu|labels=no}}) is a term used in [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]] to describe illicit [[cooking oil]] which has been recycled from [[waste oil]] collected from sources such as restaurant [[Deep fryer|fryer]]s, [[grease trap]]s, [[slaughterhouse waste]] and [[sewage]] from [[sewerage|sewer drains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://o.canada.com/health-2/gutter-oil-is-even-more-disgusting-than-it-sounds|title=Chinese ‘gutter oil’ is even more disgusting than it sounds|first=Ishmael N.|last=Daro|date=29 October 2013|website=canada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/10/28/you-may-never-eat-street-food-in-china-again-after-watching-this-video/|title=You may never eat street food in China again after watching this video|author=Max Fisher|date=28 October 2013|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Reprocessing of used cooking oil is often very rudimentary; techniques include [[filtration]], boiling, refining, and the removal of some adulterants.&lt;ref&gt;Qian Ye, Xiaofang Pei [http://www.aocs.org/Membership/FreeCover.cfm?itemnumber=18028 Methods for differentiating recycled cooking oil needed in China] AOCS&lt;/ref&gt; It is then packaged and resold as a cheaper alternative to normal cooking oil. Another version of gutter oil uses discarded animal parts, animal fat and skins, internal organs, and expired or otherwise low-quality meat, which is then cooked in large vats in order to extract the oil. Used kitchen oil can be purchased for between $859 and $937 per ton, while the cleaned and refined product can sell for $1,560 per tonne.&lt;ref name="In the Tank, Not on the Table"&gt;Li Li [http://www.bjreview.com.cn/nation/txt/2011-11/14/content_405509.htm In the Tank, Not on the Table] ''The Beijing Review'' 17 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is great economic incentive to produce and sell gutter oil. 

It is estimated that up to one in every ten lower-market restaurant meals consumed in China is prepared with gutter oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21534812|title=In the gutter|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high prevalence is due to what Feng Ping of the China Meat Research Center has made clear: "The illegal oil shows no difference in appearance and indicators after refining and purification because the law breakers are skillful at coping with the established standards."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Shen [http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-10-18/news/30292607_1_cooking-oil-waste-oil-yuan "China's Ministry of Health Just Inadvertently Green Lighted The Gutter Oil Industry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511043221/http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-10-18/news/30292607_1_cooking-oil-waste-oil-yuan |date=11 May 2013 }}. ''Business Insider'' 18 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first documented case of gutter oil in Taiwan was reported in 1985. In a subsequent investigation, 22 people were arrested for involvement in a recycling oil ring over 10 years based in Taipei. The worst offender was sentenced to 7 years in prison.&lt;ref name=UDN&gt;[http://udn.com/NEWS/BREAKINGNEWS/BREAKINGNEWS1/8915972.shtml], UDN, September 2014.{{dead link|date=June 2017|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a report of an earlier incident in Taiwan in the 1960s, where "trench oil" was imported from Japan to Taiwan and then used in food processing.&lt;ref name="Waste Management World"&gt;[http://www.wastemanagementworld.com/japanese-tactics-to-solve-the-trench-oil/ "Japanese Tactics To Solve The Trench Oil"], ''Waste Management World'', December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}

The first documented case of gutter oil in mainland China was reported in 2000, when a [[street vendor]] was found to be selling oil obtained from restaurant [[garbage disposals]].&lt;ref name=newschina&gt;He Jiangyong and Liu Ziqian, [http://www.newschinamag.com/magazine/sick-slick "Sick Slick"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908225412/http://www.newschinamag.com/magazine/sick-slick |date=8 September 2014 }}, ''NewsChina Magazine'', December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, an ongoing investigation into the suspected use of gutter oil as a raw material in the [[Chinese pharmaceutical industry]] was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19462349 |title=China probes 'gutter oil in medicine' claims |publisher=BBC News |date=3 September 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2014 Taiwan food scandal|A scandal]] involving 240 tons of gutter oil in Taiwan affecting hundreds of companies and thousands of eateries, some of which may have been exported overseas, broke in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1586065/taiwans-premier-bans-sale-235-food-companies-products-gutter-oil-scandal "Taiwan's Premier Bans Sale 235 Food Companies Products Gutter Oil Scandal"]. ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and distribution==
The collected [[waste oil]] is sold to local workshops or small factories for cleaning and packaging. When sold to workshops it is often transported on the back of bicycles by peddlers who are paid a monthly wage; afterwards, the oil is held in 200-liter barrels at the workshops until it is processed.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Alexa Olesen [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/20/gutter-oil-china-sounds-a_n_652398.html "Gutter Oil: China Sounds Alarm Over Filthy Cooking Oil"]. ''Huffington Post'', 20 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions the oil goes to industrial cooking oil refineries for further processing before it finally reaches its end purpose. The industrial oil refineries are usually legitimate producers that sell the processed oil for use in the chemical or energy industries. Gutter oil is perfectly suitable as a raw ingredient for producing soap, rubber, [[bio-fuel]], and cosmetics.&lt;ref name="In the Tank, Not on the Table"/&gt; However, the refiners can also have other intentions as the prices attained by selling it as cooking oil are much higher than if it is sold to the chemical or energy industries. 

There are few formal rules or protocols in place to prevent purchases from or sales to entities intending to use the oil for human consumption,{{cn|date=April 2017}} so it is very easy for individuals or wholesalers to purchase oil from these industrial refineries and then resell the oil to restaurants or to end consumers. There have been some cases where the industrial oil refiner packaged the oil under a unique brand name and sold it as legitimate oil in retail outlets as opposed to just selling directly to restaurants.{{cn|date=April 2017}} Some lower-market restaurants have long-term purchase agreements with oil recyclers for selling their used oil.&lt;ref&gt;David Barboza [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/world/asia/01shanghai.html?_r=1 Recycled Cooking Oil Found to Be Latest Hazard in China] ''The New York Times'', 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cao Yin and Luo Wangshu, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-04/04/content_14975475.htm "Rotting meat used to make illegal oil"], ''China Daily'', 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-end restaurants and street vendors are the biggest end users of gutter oil, as they operate with lower profit margins than bigger restaurants. Oil is one of the largest kitchen supply costs for restaurants,{{cn|date=April 2017}} so obtaining cheaper oil can allow a marginal restaurant to reduce its overall expenses. Chinese food is generally heavily dependent on oil due to most foods being fried, so cheaper meal prices for many price-sensitive consumers are possible if gutter oil is used instead of virgin oil.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;Xinhua News Agency, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2011-09/14/c_131138019.htm Our kitchens must be freed from gutter oil], 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation becomes more serious because it is hard to distinguish reprocessed gutter oil from legitimate oil. [[Bleach]] is used to transform gutter oil's dark color into a more natural-looking one, and [[alkali]] additives are used to neutralize the abnormal [[pH]] caused by high concentrations of [[animal fats]].&lt;ref name=newschina/&gt;

==Health effects==
Gutter oil has been shown to be quite toxic, and can cause [[diarrhea]] and abdominal pain. There are also reports that long-term consumption of the oil can lead to stomach and liver cancer as well as [[developmental disabilities]] in newborns and children.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;Austin Ramzy, [http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2011/09/13/china-cracks-down-on-gutter-oil-a-substance-even-worse-than-its-name/ China Cracks Down on "Gutter Oil," a Substance Even Worse Than its Name], ''Time'', 13 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Testing of some samples of gutter oil has revealed traces of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAH), dangerous organic pollutants capable of causing cancer with long-term consumption. There is also potential for gutter oil to contain [[aflatoxin]]s, highly carcinogenic compounds produced by certain molds.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt; Zeng Jing of the Guangdong Armed Police Hospital said of gutter oil: "Animal and vegetable fat in refined waste oil will undergo rancidity, oxidation and decomposition after contamination. It will cause indigestion, [[insomnia]], liver discomfort and other symptoms."&lt;ref name="In the Tank, Not on the Table"/&gt;

==Regulations and law enforcement==
Chinese law states that industrial animal fat is not allowed for use in food products because it does not meet basic hygiene standards and contains high levels of potentially toxic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Ankush Chibber [http://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Policy/Edible-oil-or-industrial-oil-in-China "Edible oil or industrial oil in China"]. ''Food Navigator Asia'', 25 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The national and local governments are researching ways to test and identify gutter oil but {{as of|2012|lc=y}} there were no nationwide standards in place to help with this process. The government is looking into methods that rely on technical equipment as well as on-site instant tests to screen suspect oil. There are five proposed tests for gutter oil but each has failed to accurately detect it.

In August and September 2011, the Beijing city government passed two new sets of regulations. The first was "On Accelerating the City's Food Waste and Waste Oil Recycling Program". Its goals are to increase daily food waste processing to 2,200 tons by 2012 and to 2,900 tons by 2015. Additionally, the intent of the regulations is to create a system that "should be a unified, standardized, and orderly processing of waste oil collection and improvement of the transportation system".&lt;ref&gt;Tian Peng, Sun Lichao [http://www.eeo.com.cn/ens/2011/1114/215679.shtml "Cooking Oil's Final Destination"]. ''The Economic Observer'' 14 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The second set of regulations by the city of Beijing, called the "Beijing Municipal Solid Waste Regulations", was passed in September 2011. The regulations specifically target the two sources of gutter oil: food waste and used oil. The central government intends for these two sets of regulations to serve as national examples, yet wants every municipality nationally to find their own solutions to the food waste and gutter oil problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/2012-05/24/content_25462528.htm 'Proposals pouring in for testing gutter oil'], ''China Daily'', 24 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A nationwide campaign was set in motion in August 2011 to crack down on the widespread production and selling of gutter oil.  The law enforcement campaign uncovered 100 gutter oil manufacturers and arrested more than 800 people allegedly involved in the production and sale of gutter oil. In April 2012 another crackdown occurred with an additional 100 arrests made and 13 illegal workshops closed down across four provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Astley [http://www.foodqualitynews.com/Public-Concerns/Chinese-officials-arrest-more-than-100-in-rotten-meat-based-gutter-oil-crackdown Chinese officials arrest more than 100 in rotten meat-based 'gutter oil' crackdown] ''Food Quality News'', 5 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to a notice released jointly by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security, the [[Capital punishment in China|death penalty]] will now be an option when prosecuting more serious cases of gutter oil manufacturing in the country. More severe punishments will also be given out to government and public officials who fail to properly address matters related to gutter oil. The State Council said inspectors would target edible oil trade fairs and wholesale markets and called for inspections of oil being used at restaurants, school cafeterias, work canteens and kitchens at construction sites. The State Council also stated that businesses that use recycled oil would be forced to close temporarily or lose their business license while peddlers who sell the oil could be criminally prosecuted.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua News Agency [http://www.china.org.cn/china/2012-02/24/content_24718208.htm Death penalties considered for 'gutter oil' crimes] 24 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Burkitt, [https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/04/03/chinese-gutter-oil-attains-new-level-of-gross/ Chinese Gutter Oil Attains New Level of Gross], ''The Wall Street Journal'', China Real Time Report, 3 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013,  a man from eastern China's Jiangsu Province was sentenced to life imprisonment for profiting heavily from making and selling gutter oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-10/09/c_132783008.htm|title=Chinese gutter oil producer jailed for life|date=9 October 2013|newspaper=Xinhau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22753">In [[mathematics]], the '''incompressibility method''' is a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] method like the [[probabilistic method]], the [[counting]] method or the [[pigeonhole principle]]. To prove that an object in a certain class (on average) satisfies a certain property, select an object of that class which is [[Incompressible string|incompressible]]. If it does not satisfy the property, it can be compressed by [[Computability theory|computable]] coding. Since it can be generally proven that almost all objects in a given class are incompressible, the argument demonstrates that almost all objects in the class have the property involved (not just the average). To select an incompressible object is ineffective, and cannot be done by a computer program. However, a simple counting argument usually shows that almost all objects of a given class can be compressed by only a few [[bit]]s (are incompressible).

==History==
The incompressibity method depends on an objective, fixed notion of incompressibility. Such a notion was provided by the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] theory, named for [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&amp;jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=68&amp;option_lang=eng  A. N. Kolmogorov, "Three approaches to the definition of the concept 'quantity of information', ''Probl. Peredachi Inf.'', 1:1 (1965), 3–11]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of the incompressibility method with Kolmogorov complexity its theory of computation was to&lt;ref name="Pa"&gt;[http://www-wjp.cs.uni-saarland.de/publikationen/Pa79.pdf W. J. Paul, "Kolmogorov's complexity and lower bounds", pp 325–333 in: L. Budach Ed., ''Proc. 2nd Int. Conf. Fund. Comput. Theory'', 1979.]&lt;/ref&gt; prove that the running time of a one-[[Punched tape|tape]] [[Turing machine]] is quadratic for accepting a palindromic language and [[sorting algorithm]]s require at least &lt;math&gt;n \log n&lt;/math&gt; time to sort &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items. The first influential paper using the incompressibility method was published in 1980.&lt;ref name="PSS"&gt;[http://dlacm.org/citation.cfm?id=804685 W. J. Paul, J. I. Seiferas, J. Simon, "An information-theoretic approach to time bounds for on-line computation" (preliminary version), ''Proc. 12th  ACM Symp. Theory Comput (STOC)'', 357–367, 1980.]&lt;/ref&gt; The method was applied to a number of fields, and its name was coined in a textbook.&lt;ref name="LV"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=JvXiBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=vitanyi+Introduction M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Ccomplexity and Its Applications'', Springer, 1993, 1997, 2008, Chapter 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Kolmogorov complexity of an object, represented by a finite, binary string, is the length of the shortest binary program on a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed]], [[Mathematical optimization|optimal]] [[universal Turing machine]]. Since the machine is fixed and the program concerned is the shortest, the Kolmogorov complexity is a definite positive [[Integer (computer science)|integer]]. The Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of the shortest binary program from which it can be computed. Therefore, it is a lower [[Upper and lower bounds|bound]] on the length of a computably-compressed version (in bits) of that object by any existing (or future) compression program.

==Applications==

===Number theory===
According to an [[Mathematical beauty|elegant]] [[Euclid]]ian proof, there is an infinite number of [[prime number]]s. [[Bernhard Riemann]] demonstrated that the number of primes less than a given number is connected with the 0s of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin]] proved in 1896 that this
number of primes is [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;n/\ln n&lt;/math&gt;; see [[Prime number theorem]] (use &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; for the natural logarithm an &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; for the binary logarithm). Using the incompressibility method, [[G. J. Chaitin]] argued as follows:  Each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be described by its [[Integer factorization|prime factorization]] &lt;math&gt;n= p_1^{n_1} \cdots p_k^{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; (which is unique), where &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots , p_k&lt;/math&gt; are the first &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; primes which are (at most) &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Exponentiation|exponents]] (possibly) 0. Each exponent is (at most) &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;, and can be described by &lt;math&gt; \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits. The description of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can be given in &lt;math&gt;k \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits, provided we know the value of &lt;math&gt;\log \log n&lt;/math&gt; (enabling one to [[Parsing|parse]] the consecutive blocks of exponents). To describe &lt;math&gt;\log \log n&lt;/math&gt; requires only &lt;math&gt;\log \log \log n&lt;/math&gt; bits. Using the incompressibility of most positive integers, for each &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there is a positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of binary length &lt;math&gt;l\approx \log n&lt;/math&gt; which cannot be described in fewer than &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; bits. This shows that the number of primes, &lt;math&gt;\pi(n)&lt;/math&gt;  less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi(n) \geq \frac{\log n}{\log \log n} -o(1).
&lt;/math&gt;

A more-sophisticated approach attributed to Piotr Berman (present proof partially by John Tromp) describes every incompressible &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n/p_k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is the largest prime number dividing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is incompressible, the length of this description must exceed &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;. To parse the first block of the description &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; must be given in prefix form &lt;math&gt;P(k)=\log k +\log \log k +\log \varepsilon(k)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(k)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary, small, positive function. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\log p_k \leq P(k)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;p_k \leq n_k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n_k=\varepsilon(k)k\log k&lt;/math&gt; for a special sequence of values &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2,  \ldots &lt;/math&gt;. This shows that the expression below holds for this special sequence, and a simple extension shows that it holds for every &lt;math&gt;n &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\pi(n) \geq \frac n {\varepsilon(n)\log n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Both proofs are presented in more detail.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;

===Graph theory===
A [[labeled graph]] &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes can be represented by a string &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; bits, where each bit indicates the presence (or absence) of an edge between the pair of nodes in that position. &lt;math&gt;K(G) \geq {n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of each vertex satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;
|d-n/2| = O\left(\sqrt{n \log n}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this by the incompressibity method, if the deviation is larger we can compress the description of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; below &lt;math&gt;K(G)&lt;/math&gt;; this provides the required contradiction. This theorem is required in a more complicated proof, where the incompressibility argument is used a number of times to show that the number of unlabeled graphs is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sim \frac{2^{n \choose 2}}{n!}.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539797327805  H. M. Buhrman, M. Li, J. T. Tromp, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "Kolmogorov random graphs and the incompressibility method", ''SIAM J. Comput.'', 29:2(1999), 590–599.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinatorics===
A transitive [[tournament]] is a complete [[directed graph]], &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;; if &lt;math&gt;(i,j),(j,k) \in E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(i,k) \in E&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the set of all transitive tournaments on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes. Since a tournament is a labeled, directed [[complete graph]], it can be encoded by a string &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{n \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; bits where each bit indicates the direction of the edge between the pair of nodes in that position. Using this encoding, every transitive tournament contains a transitive subtournament on (at least) &lt;math&gt;v(n)&lt;/math&gt; vertices with

:&lt;math&gt;
v(n) \leq 1+ \lfloor 2 \log n \rfloor.
&lt;/math&gt;

This was shown as the first problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/probabilistic-methods-in-combinatorics  P. Erdos, J.

===Topological combinatorics===

In the [[Heilbronn triangle problem]], throw &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points in the unit square and determine the maximum of the minimal area of a triangle formed by three of the points over all possible arrangements. This problem was solved for small arrangements, and much work was done on asymptotic expression as a function of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The original conjecture of [[Heilbronn]] was &lt;math&gt;O(1/n^2)&lt;/math&gt; during the early 1950s. [[Paul Erdős]] proved that this bound is correct for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, a prime number. The general problem remains unsolved, apart from the best-known lower bound &lt;math&gt;\Omega((\log n)/n^2)&lt;/math&gt; (achievable; hence, [[Heilbronn]]'s conjecture is not correct for general &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) and upper bound &lt;math&gt;\exp(c \sqrt{\log n})/n^{8/7}&lt;/math&gt; (proven by Komlos, Pintsz and Szemeredi in 1982 and 1981, respectively). Using the incompressibility method, the average case was studied. It was proven that if the area is too small (or large) it can be compressed below the Kolmogorov complexity of a uniformly-random arrangement (high Kolmogorov complexity). This proves that for the overwhelming majority of the arrangements (and the expectation), the area of the smallest triangle formed by three of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points thrown uniformly at random in the unit square is &lt;math&gt;\Theta(1/n^3)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the incompressibility method proves the lower and upper bounds of the property involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rsa.10024/abstract  T. Jiang, M. Li, P. M.

The [[law of the iterated logarithm]], the [[law of large numbers]] and the recurrence property were shown to hold using the incompressibility method&lt;ref&gt;[http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1132061 V. G. Vovk, "The law of the iterated logarithm for random Kolmogorov, or chaotic, sequences", ''Theory Probab.

Zimand, "A high-low Kolmogorov complexity law equivalent to the 0–1 law", ''Inform. Process.

Borel]]) and the distribution of 0s and 1s in binary strings of high Kolmogorov complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01192146#page-2 M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "Statistical properties of finite sequences with high Kolmogorov complexity",  ''Mathematical Systems Theory'', 27(1994), 365–376.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Turing machines time complexity}}Turing-machine time complexity===
The basic Turing machine, as conceived by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, consists of a memory: a tape of potentially-infinite cells on which a symbol can be written and a finite control, with a read-write head attached, which scans a cell on the tape. At each step, the read-write head can change the symbol in the cell being scanned and move one cell left, right, or not at all according to instruction from the finite control. Turing machines with two tape symbols may be considered for convenience, but this is not essential.

In 1968, F. C. Hennie showed that such a Turing machine requires order &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; to recognize the language of binary palindromes in the [[Best, worst and average case|worst case]]. In 1977, W. J. Paul&lt;ref name="Pa"/&gt; presented an incompressibility proof which showed that order &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; time is required in the average case. For every integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, consider all words of that length. For convenience, consider words with the middle third of the word consisting of 0s. The accepting Turing machine ends with an accept state on the left (the beginning of the tape). A Turing-machine computation of a given word gives for each location (the boundary between adjacent cells) a sequence of crossings from left to right and right to left, each crossing in a particular state of the finite control. Positions in the middle third of a candidate word all have a [[Crossing sequence (Turing machines)|crossing sequence]] of length &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; (with a total computation time of &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;), or some position has a crossing sequence of &lt;math&gt;o(n)&lt;/math&gt;. In the latter case, the word (if it is a [[palindrome]]) can be identified by that crossing sequence.

If other palindromes (ending in an accepting state on the left) have the same crossing sequence, the word (consisting of a prefix up to the position of the involved crossing sequence) of the original palindome [[Concatenation (mathematics)|concatenated]] with a suffix the remaining length of the other palindrome would be accepted as well. Taking the palindrome of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] described by &lt;math&gt;o(n)&lt;/math&gt; bits is a contradiction.

Since the overwhelming majority of binary palindromes have a high Kolmogorov complexity, this gives a lower bound on the average-case [[Time complexity|running time]]. The result is much more difficult, and shows that Turing machines with &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; work tapes are more powerful than those with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; work tapes in [[real-time computing|real time]] (here one symbol per step).&lt;ref name="PSS"/&gt;

In 1984, W. Maass&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;[http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1985-292-02/S0002-9947-1985-0808746-4/ W. Maass, "Combinatorial lower bound arguments for deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines", ''Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.'' 292 (1985), 675–693.]&lt;/ref&gt; and M. Li and  P. M. B. Vitanyi &lt;ref name="LVa"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089054018890003X M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "Tape versus queue and stacks: The lower bounds", ''Information and Computation'', 78:1(1988), 56–85.]&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the simulation of two work tapes by one work tape of a Turing machine takes &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministically]] (optimally, solving a 30-year [[open problem]]) and &lt;math&gt;\Omega (n^2/(\log n \log \log n))&lt;/math&gt; time nondeterministically &lt;ref name = "LVa"/&gt; (in,&lt;ref name="Ma" /&gt; this is &lt;math&gt;\Omega (n^2/(\log^2 n \log \log n))&lt;/math&gt;. More results concerning tapes, [[Stack (abstract data type)|stacks]] and [[Queue (abstract data type)|queues]], deterministically and nondeterministically,&lt;ref name="LVa"/&gt; were proven with the incompressibiity method.&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt;

===Theory of computation===
[[Heapsort]] is a sorting method, invented by J. W. J. Williams and refined by [[R. W. Floyd]], which always runs in &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; time. It is questionable whether Floyd's method is better than Williams' on average, although it is better in the worst case. Using the incompressibility method, it was shown&lt;ref name="LV"/&gt; that Williams' method runs on average in &lt;math&gt;2n \log n +O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time and Floyd's method runs on average in &lt;math&gt;n\log n+O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time. The proof was suggested by [[Ian Munro (computer scientist)|Ian Munro]].

[[Shellsort]], discovered by [[Donald Shell]] in 1959, is a [[comparison sort]] which divides a list to be sorted into sublists and sorts them separately. The sorted sublists are then merged, reconstituting a partially-sorted list. This process repeats a number of times (the number of passes). The difficulty of analyzing the complexity of the sorting process is that it depends on the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of keys to be sorted, on the number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of passes and the increments governing the scattering in each pass; the sublist is the list of keys which are the increment parameter apart. Although this sorting method inspired a large number of papers, only the worst case was established. For the average running time, only the best case for a two-pass Shellsort&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Computer-Programming-Searching/dp/0201896850 D. E. Knuth, ''Sorting and Searching'' (Vol. 3 ''The Art of Computer Programming''), 2nd Ed. Addison-Wesley, 1998, pp 83–95.]&lt;/ref&gt; and an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;O(n^{23/15})&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9608105 S. Janson, D. E. Knuth, "Shellsort with three increments", ''Random Structures Algorithms'' 10:1–2(1997), 125–142.]&lt;/ref&gt; for a particular increment sequence for three-pass Shellsort were established. A general lower bound on an average &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-pass Shellsort was given&lt;ref name="JLV"&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=355488  T. Jiang, M. Li, P. M. B. Vitanyi, "A lower bound on the average-case complexity of Shellsort", ''Journal of the ACM (JACM)'', 47:5(2000) 905–911.]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first advance in this problem in four decades. In every pass, the comparison sort moves a key to another place a certain distance (a path length). All these path lengths are [[Logarithmic number system|logarithmically coded]] for length in the correct order (of passes and keys). This allows the reconstruction of the unsorted list from the sorted list. If the unsorted list is incompressible (or nearly so), since the sorted list has near-zero Kolmogorov complexity (and the path lengths together give a certain code length) the sum must be at least as large as the Kolmogorov complexity of the original list. The sum of the path lengths corresponds to the running time, and the running time is lower-bounded in this argument by &lt;math&gt;\Omega (pn^{1+1/p})&lt;/math&gt;. This was improved in &lt;ref&gt;P.M.B. Vitanyi (2018), On the average-case complexity of Shellsort, Random Structures and Algorithms, 52:2, 354--363&lt;/ref&gt; to a lower bound of 
:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega \left( n\sum_{k=1}^p h_{k-1}/h_k \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h_0=n&lt;/math&gt;. This implies for example the Jiang-Li-Vitanyi lower bound for all &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-pass increment sequences and improves that lower bound for particular increment sequences;
the Janson-Knuth upper bound is matched by a lower bound for the used increment sequence, showing that three pass Shellsort for this increment sequence uses &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n^{23/15})&lt;/math&gt; inversions.

Another example is as follows. &lt;math&gt;n,r,s&lt;/math&gt; are natural numbers and &lt;math&gt;2 \log n \leq r,s \leq n/4&lt;/math&gt;, it was shown that for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; there is a [[Logical matrix|Boolean]] &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix; every &lt;math&gt;s \times (n-r)&lt;/math&gt; submatrix has a [[Matrix rank|rank]] at least &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; by the incompressibility method.

===Logic===
According to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], in every formal system with computably enumerable theorems (or proofs) strong enough to contain [[Peano arithmetic]], there are true (but unprovable) statements or theorems. This is proved by the incompressibility method; every formal system &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be described finitely (for example, in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; bits). In such a formal system, we can express &lt;math&gt;K(x) \geq |x|&lt;/math&gt; since it contains arithmetic. Given &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, we can search exhaustively for a proof that some string &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n\gg f&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;K(y) \geq n&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, we obtain the first such string; &lt;math&gt;K(y) \leq \log n+f&lt;/math&gt;: contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Information-Cambridge-Theoretical-Computer/dp/0521616042 G. J. Chaitin, ''Algorithmic Information Theory'', Cambridge University Press, 1977.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other methods==
Although the [[probabilistic method]] generally shows the existence of an object with a certain property in a class, the incompressibility method tends to show that the overwhelming majority of objects in the class (the average, or the expectation) have that property. It is sometimes easy to turn a probabilistic proof into an incompressibility proof or vice versa. In some cases, it is difficult or impossible to turn a proof by incompressibility into a probabilistic (or counting proof). In virtually all the cases of Turing-machine time complexity cited above, the incompressibility method solved problems which had been open for decades; no other proofs are known. Sometimes a proof by incompressibility can be turned into a proof by counting, as happened in the case of the general lower bound on the running time of [[Shellsort]].&lt;ref name="JLV"/&gt;

{{Psychology sidebar}}

'''Leadership''' is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or [[organization]] to "lead" or guide other individuals, [[team]]s, or entire [[organization]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Specialist literature debates various viewpoints, contrasting [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western world|Western]] approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) United States versus European approaches. U.S. academic environments define leadership as "a process of [[social influence]] in which a person can enlist the aid and [[Peer support|support]] of others in the accomplishment of a common [[task (project management)|task]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= An integrative theory of leadership|last= Chemers|first= M.|publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year= 1997|isbn= 978-0-8058-2679-1|location= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chin 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Chin|first= Roger|year= 2015|title= Examining teamwork and leadership in the fields of public administration, leadership, and management|journal= Team Performance Management|volume= 21|issue= 3/4|pages= 199–216|doi= 10.1108/TPM-07-2014-0037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leadership studies|Studies of leadership]] have produced theories involving [[Trait leadership|trait]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLocke1991|Locke et al. 1991]]&lt;/ref&gt; situational interaction, function, behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith Marshall, [http://www.designtoolbox.co.uk/strategies/leaders-make-values-visible/ "Leaders Make Values Visible"], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Power (social and political)|power]], [[goal|vision]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]],&lt;ref&gt;

==Historical views==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2009}}
[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb| [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' argues that it is better to be feared than loved.]]
[[Sanskrit]] literature identifies ten types of leaders. Defining characteristics of the ten types of leaders are explained with examples from history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit Text Book -9th Grade|publisher=Government of Karnataka, India|author=KSEEB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristocracy|Aristocratic]] thinkers have postulated that leadership depends on one's "blue blood" or [[gene]]s. [[Monarchy]] takes an extreme view of the same idea, and may prop up its assertions against the claims of mere aristocrats by invoking divine sanction (see the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right of kings]]). Contrariwise, more democratically inclined theorists have pointed to examples of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] leaders, such as the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic]] marshals profiting from [[career]]s open to [[skill|talent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transformation Of An Individual Family Community Nation And The World|last=Cano, PE|first=Librado F.|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8D8sanxRQR8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[autocracy|autocratic]]/[[paternalism|paternalistic]] strain of thought, traditionalists recall the role of leadership of the Roman ''[[pater familias]]''. [[Feminism|Feminist]] thinking, on the other hand, may object to such models as [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and posit against them emotionally attuned, responsive, and consensual [[empathy|empathetic]] guidance, which is sometimes associated with [[matriarchy|matriarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Behaviour|last1=Singh|first1=Ravinder|first2=Ajita|last2=Rani|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-946983-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparable to the Roman tradition, the views of [[Confucianism]] on "right living" relate very much to the ideal of the (male) scholar-leader and his benevolent rule, buttressed by a tradition of filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Management, A Modern Approach|last=Saxena Dr.|first=P.K.|publisher=Global India Publications PVT LTD|year=2009|isbn=978-81-907941-5-2|location=New Delhi|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and discipline ... Reliance on intelligence alone results in rebelliousness. Exercise of humaneness alone results in weakness. Fixation on trust results in folly. Dependence on the strength of courage results in violence. Excessive discipline and sternness in command result in cruelty. When one has all five virtues together, each appropriate to its function, then one can be a leader. — [[Sun Tzu]]&lt;ref&gt;''The 100 Greatest Leadership Principles of All Time'', edited by Leslie Pockell with Adrienne Avila, 2007, Warner Books&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Machiavelli's ''[[The Prince]]'', written in the early 16th century, provided a manual for [[Ruler (potentate)|rulers]] ("princes" or "tyrants" in Machiavelli's terminology) to gain and keep [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 19th century the elaboration of [[anarchism|anarchist]] thought called the whole concept of leadership into question. (Note that the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the word "leadership" in English only as far back as the 19th century.) One response to this denial of [[élitism]] came with [[Leninism]], which demanded an élite group of disciplined [[professional revolutionaries|cadres]] to act as the [[vanguard party|vanguard]] of a socialist revolution, bringing into existence the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Other historical views of leadership have addressed the seeming contrasts between secular and religious leadership. The doctrines of [[Caesaro-papism]] have recurred and had their detractors over several centuries. Christian thinking on leadership has often emphasized [[stewardship]] of divinely provided resources—human and material—and their deployment in accordance with a Divine plan. Compare [[servant leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfjUgMJlDK4C|title=Servant Leadership: A Journey Into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness|publisher=Paulist Press|year=1977|isbn=9780809105540|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|publication-date=2002|last1=Greenleaf|first1=Robert K.|author-link1=Robert K. Greenleaf|accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Early western history===

The search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has continued for centuries. Philosophical writings from [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''&lt;ref&gt;
Benjamin Jowett's translation of Plato's ''Republic'' does not use the word "leadership"; Plato discusses primarily a "[[Philosopher king|guardian]]" class. See {{cite book| author = Plato| author-link1 = Plato| title = The Dialogues of Plato translated into English with Analyses and Introductions by B. Jowett, M.A.| url                   = http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/767| volume = 3| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = 1892| accessdate = 2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Plutarch's]] ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' have explored the question "What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?" Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-learn-from-ancient-philosophers|title=What can business leaders learn from ancient philosophers?|last=Network|first=Jules Evans for the Guardian Professional|date=2012-05-04|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the "[[trait leadership|trait theory of leadership]]".

A number of works in the 19th century – when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords and bishops had begun to wane – explored the trait theory at length: note especially the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and of [[Francis Galton]], whose works have prompted decades of research. In ''Heroes and Hero Worship'' (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power. Galton's ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men. After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited. In other words, leaders were born, not developed. Both of these notable works lent great initial support for the notion that leadership is rooted in characteristics of a leader.

[[Cecil Rhodes]] (1853–1902) believed that public-spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with "moral force of character and instincts to lead", and educating them in contexts (such as the collegiate environment of the [[University of Oxford]]) which further developed such characteristics. International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help "render war impossible". This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Donald Markwell]], ''"Instincts to Lead": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'', Connor Court: Australia, 2013. {{ISBN|9781922168702}} {{cite web |url=http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=256 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222013842/http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=256 |archivedate=2017-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of alternative theories===

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of qualitative reviews of these studies (e.g., Bird, 1940;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, C. (1940). ''Social Psychology''. New York: Appleton-Century.&lt;/ref&gt; Stogdill, 1948;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stogdill | first1 = R. M. | year = 1948 | title = Personal factors associated with leadership: A survey of the literature | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 35–71 | doi=10.1080/00223980.1948.9917362| pmid = 18901913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann, 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mann | first1 = R. D. | year = 1959 | title = A review of the relationship between personality and performance in small groups | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 241–270 | doi=10.1037/h0044587}}&lt;/ref&gt;) prompted researchers to take a drastically different view of the driving forces behind leadership. In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that persons who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait, as situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others. The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective. This approach dominated much of the leadership theory and research for the next few decades.

===Reemergence of trait theory===

New methods and measurements were developed after these influential reviews that would ultimately reestablish [[trait theory]] as a viable approach to the study of leadership. For example, improvements in researchers' use of the round robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.&lt;ref name="Kenny, D.A. 1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenny | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Zaccaro | first2 = S. J. | year = 1983 | title = An estimate of variance due to traits in leadership | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 678–685 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.68.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, during the 1980s statistical advances allowed researchers to conduct [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], in which they could quantitatively analyze and summarize the findings from a wide array of studies. This advent allowed trait theorists to create a comprehensive picture of previous leadership research rather than rely on the qualitative reviews of the past. Equipped with new methods, leadership researchers revealed the following:
* Individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.&lt;ref name="Kenny, D.A. 1983"/&gt;
* Significant relationships exist between leadership emergence and such individual traits as:

While the trait theory of leadership has certainly regained popularity, its reemergence has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in sophisticated conceptual frameworks.&lt;ref name="Zaccaro, S. J. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zaccaro | first1 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Trait-based perspectives of leadership | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 6–16 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.62.1.6| pmid = 17209675 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.9808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Zaccaro (2007)&lt;ref name="Zaccaro, S. J. 2007"/&gt; noted that trait theories still:
* Focus on a small set of individual attributes such as "The Big Five" personality traits, to the neglect of cognitive abilities, motives, values, social skills, expertise, and problem-solving skills.
* Fail to consider patterns or integrations of multiple attributes.
* Do not distinguish between the leadership attributes that are generally not malleable over time and those that are shaped by, and bound to, situational influences.
* Do not consider how stable leader attributes account for the behavioral diversity necessary for effective leadership.

===Attribute pattern approach===

Considering the criticisms of the trait theory outlined above, several researchers have begun to adopt a different perspective of leader individual differences—the leader attribute pattern approach.&lt;ref name="Foti, R.J. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foti | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Hauenstein | first2 = N. M. A. | year = 2007 | title = Pattern and variable approaches in leadership emergence and effectiveness | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 2| pages = 347–355 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.2.347| pmid = 17371083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaccaro, S.

D. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, D. (1995). "Holistic interactionism: A perspective for research on personality development". In L. A. Pervin &amp; O. P. John (Eds.), ''Handbook of personality: Theory and research'' (pp. 219–247). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes..

===Behavioral and style theories===
{{Main article|Managerial grid model}}

In response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors, evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpillane2004|Spillane (2004)]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David McClelland]], for example, posited that leadership takes a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego. To lead, self-confidence and high self-esteem are useful, perhaps even essential.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Thomas. New York: ''The CEO Paradox'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Management Grid.PNG|right|thumb|200px|A graphical representation of the managerial grid model]]

[[Kurt Lewin]], Ronald Lipitt, and Ralph White developed in 1939 the seminal work on the influence of leadership styles and performance. The researchers evaluated the performance of groups of eleven-year-old boys under different types of work climate. In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of [[group decision making]], [[praise]] and [[criticism]] ([[feedback]]), and the management of the group tasks ([[project management]]) according to three styles: [[Leadership#Autocratic or authoritarian style|authoritarian]], [[Leadership#Participative or democratic|democratic]], and [[Leadership#Laissez-faire or free rein style|laissez-faire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLewin1939|Lewin et al. (1939)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Ohio State University conducted a study which investigated observable behaviors portrayed by effective leaders, They would then identify if these particular behaviors reflective in leadership effectiveness. They were able to narrow their findings to two identifiable distinctions &lt;ref&gt;"Ohio State Leadership Studies Explained with Examples"(2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The first dimension was identified as "Initiating Structure", which described how a leader clearly and accurately communicates with their followers, defines goals, and determine how tasks are performed. These are considered "task oriented" behaviors The second dimension is "Consideration", which indicates the leader's ability to build an interpersonal relationship with their followers, to establish a form of mutual trust. These are considered "social oriented" behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;AAmodt (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Michigan State Studies, which were conducted in the 1950s, made further investigations and findings that positively correlated behaviors and leadership effectiveness. Although they similar findings as the Ohio State studies, they did contribute an additional behavior identified in leaders. This was participative behavior; allowing the followers to participate in group decision making and encouraged subordinate input. Another term used to describe this is "Servant Leadership", which entails the leader to reject a more controlling type of leadership and allow more personal interaction between themselves and their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The managerial grid model is also based on a behavioral theory. The model was developed by [[Robert Blake (management)|Robert Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] in 1964 and suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders' concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlake1964|Blake et al. (1964)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positive reinforcement====
[[B. F. Skinner]] is the father of [[behavior modification]] and developed the concept of [[positive reinforcement]]. Positive reinforcement occurs when a positive stimulus is presented in response to a behavior, increasing the likelihood of that behavior in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G., (2004). ''Behavior Modification Principles and Procedures'' (3rd ed). Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting. Assume [[praise]] is a positive reinforcer for a particular employee. This employee does not show up to work on time every day. The manager of this employee decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time. As a result, the employee comes to work on time more often because the employee likes to be praised. In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.

The use of positive reinforcement is a successful and growing technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates. Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Lussier, R. N., &amp; Achua, C. F., (2010). ''Leadership, Theory, Application, &amp; Skill Development.''(4th ed). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research covering the last 20 years suggests that [[reinforcement theory]] has a 17 percent increase in performance. Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.

===Situational and contingency theories===
{{Main article|Fiedler contingency model|Vroom–Yetton decision model|path–goal theory|situational leadership theory}}

[[Situational leadership theory|Situational theory]] also appeared as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership. [[social science|Social scientists]] argued that history was more than the result of intervention of great men as [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] suggested. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1884) (and [[Karl Marx]]) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpencer1841|Spencer (1884)]], apud [[#refHeifetz1994|Heifetz (1994)]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics; according to this group of theories, no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists. According to the theory, "what an individual actually does when acting as a leader is in large part dependent upon characteristics of the situation in which he functions."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHemphill1949|Hemphill (1949)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists started to synthesize the trait and situational approaches. Building upon the research of Lewin et al., academics began to normalize the descriptive models of leadership climates, defining three leadership styles and identifying which situations each style works better in. The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the "hearts and minds" of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not "take charge", they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWormer2007|Wormer et al. (2007)]], p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, theorists defined the style of leadership as contingent to the situation, which is sometimes classified as contingency theory. Four contingency leadership theories appear more prominently in recent years: Fiedler contingency model, Vroom-Yetton decision model, the path-goal theory, and the Hersey-Blanchard situational theory.

The [[Fiedler contingency model]] bases the leader's effectiveness on what [[Fred Fiedler]] called ''situational contingency''. This results from the interaction of leadership style and situational favorability (later called ''situational control''). The theory defined two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFiedler1967|Fiedler (1967)]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader. Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a "favorable situation". Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.

[[Victor Vroom]], in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973)&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVroom1973|Vroom, Yetton (1973)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and later with Arthur Jago (1988),&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVroom1988|Vroom, Jago (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt; developed a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for describing leadership situations, which was used in a normative [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|decision model]] where leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSternberg2002|Sternberg, Vroom (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was novel because it supported the idea that the same manager could rely on different [[group decision making]] approaches depending on the attributes of each situation. This model was later referred to as situational contingency theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLorsch1974|Lorsch (1974)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[path-goal theory]] of leadership was developed by Robert House (1971) and was based on the [[expectancy theory]] of [[Victor Vroom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHouse1971|House (1971)]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to House, the essence of the theory is "the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHouse1996|House (1996)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory identifies four leader behaviors, ''achievement-oriented'', ''directive'', ''participative'', and ''supportive'', that are contingent to the environment factors and follower characteristics. In contrast to the [[Fiedler contingency model]], the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands. The path-goal model can be classified both as a [[Contingency leadership theory|contingency theory]], as it depends on the circumstances, and as a [[Transactional leadership|transactional leadership theory]], as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.

The [[Hersey-Blanchard situational theory|Situational Leadership® Model]] proposed by Hersey suggests four leadership-styles and four levels of follower-development. For effectiveness, the model posits that the leadership-style must match the appropriate level of follower-development. In this model, leadership behavior becomes a function not only of the characteristics of the leader, but of the characteristics of followers as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHersey2008|Hersey et al. (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional theory===
{{Main article|Functional leadership model}}
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 100805-F-7552L-211 - Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Gen. David H. Petraeus center U.S. Army talks with U.S. soldiers of the 2nd Battalion.jpg|thumb|250px|General Petraeus talks with U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan]]
Functional leadership theory (Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986; [[McGrath]], 1962; Adair, 1988; Kouzes &amp; Posner, 1995) is a particularly useful theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader's main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion (Fleishman et al., 1991; Hackman &amp; Wageman, 2005; Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986). While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership (Zaccaro, Rittman, &amp; Marks, 2001), it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well (Zaccaro, 2001). In summarizing literature on functional leadership (see Kozlowski et al. (1996), Zaccaro et al. (2001), Hackman and Walton (1986), Hackman &amp; Wageman (2005), Morgeson (2005)), Klein, Zeigert, Knight, and Xiao (2006) observed five broad functions a leader performs when promoting organization's effectiveness. These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group's work.

A variety of leadership behaviors are expected to facilitate these functions. In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman (1953) observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors' behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as [[consideration and initiating structure]]. Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships. Examples of such behavior would include showing concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others. Initiating structure involves the actions of the leader focused specifically on task accomplishment. This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.

===Integrated psychological theory===
{{Main article|Three Levels of Leadership model}}

The Integrated Psychological theory of leadership is an attempt to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e. traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, largely by introducing a new element – the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery. It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of [[servant leadership]] and [[authentic leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;Businessballs management information website – Leadership Theories page, "Integrated Psychological Approach" section: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Psychological theory began to attract attention after the publication of James Scouller's [[Three Levels of Leadership model]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011). ''The Three Levels of Leadership: How to Develop Your Leadership Presence, Knowhow and Skill''. Cirencester: Management Books 2000., {{ISBN|9781852526818}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scouller argued that the older theories offer only limited assistance in developing a person's ability to lead effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
He pointed out, for example, that:
* Traits theories, which tend to reinforce the idea that leaders are born not made, might help us select leaders, but they are less useful for developing leaders.
* An ideal style (e.g. Blake &amp; Mouton's team style) would not suit all circumstances.
* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears or ingrained habits. Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.
* None of the old theories successfully address the challenge of developing "[[Three Levels of Leadership model#Leadership presence|leadership presence]]"; that certain "something" in leaders that commands attention, inspires people, wins their trust and makes followers want to work with them.

Scouller proposed the Three Levels of Leadership model, which was later categorized as an "Integrated Psychological" theory on the Businessballs education website.&lt;ref&gt;Businessballs information website: Leadership Theories Page, Integrated Psychological Approach section. Businessballs.com.: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership 2012-02-24. Retrieved 2012-08-15&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, his model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders.

The three levels in his model are Public, Private and Personal leadership:
* The first two – public and private leadership – are "outer" or behavioral levels. These are the behaviors that address what Scouller called "the four dimensions of leadership". These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; (4) individual selection and motivation. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Public leadership|Public leadership]] focuses on the 34 behaviors involved in influencing two or more people simultaneously. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Private leadership|Private leadership]] covers the 14 behaviors needed to influence individuals one to one.
* The third – [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Personal leadership|personal leadership]] – is an "inner" level and concerns a person's growth toward greater leadership presence, knowhow and skill. Working on one's personal leadership has three aspects: (1) Technical knowhow and skill (2) Developing the right attitude toward other people – which is the basis of servant leadership (3) Psychological self-mastery – the foundation for authentic leadership.

Scouller argued that self-mastery is the key to growing one's leadership presence, building trusting relationships with followers and dissolving one's limiting beliefs and habits, thereby enabling behavioral flexibility as circumstances change, while staying connected to one's core values (that is, while remaining authentic). To support leaders' development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of [[Mindfulness#Mindfulness meditation in organizations|mindfulness meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 137–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transactional and transformational theories===
{{Main article|Transactional leadership|Transformational leadership}}

Bernard Bass and colleagues developed the idea of two different types of leadership, transactional that involves exchange of labor for rewards and transformational which is based on concern for employees, intellectual stimulation, and providing a group vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B. J. | last3 = Atwater | first3 = L. E. | year = 1996 | title = The transformational and transactional leadership of men and women | url = | journal = Applied Psychology: An International Review | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 5–34 | doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.1996.tb00847.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M., &amp; Riggio, R. E. (2006). ''Transformational leadership'' (2nd ed.). Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers; US.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transactional leader ([[James MacGregor Burns|Burns]], 1978)&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite book| last = Burns| first = J. M.| authorlink =James MacGregor Burns| title = Leadership| publisher = Harper and Row Publishers Inc.| year = 1978| location = New York| isbn = 978-0060105884}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given power to perform certain tasks and reward or punish for the team's performance. It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else. Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.

===Leader–member exchange theory===
{{Main article|Leader–member exchange theory}}
This LMX theory addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process is the leader–member exchange (LMX) theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graen | first1 = G. B. | last2 = Novak | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Sommerkamp | first3 = P. | year = 1982 | title = The effects of leader-member exchange and job design on productivity and satisfaction: Testing a dual attachment model | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Performance | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 109–131 | doi = 10.1016/0030-5073(82)90236-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved from an earlier theory called the vertical dyad linkage (VDL) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dansereau | first1 = F. | last2 = Graen | first2 = G. | last3 = Haga | first3 = W. J. | year = 1975 | title = A vertical dyad linkage approach to leadership within formal organizations: A longitudinal investigation of the role making process | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Performance | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 46–78 | doi=10.1016/0030-5073(75)90005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these models focus on the interaction between leaders and individual followers. Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance. However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of ''in-groups'' and ''out-groups''. In-group members are said to have ''high-quality exchanges'' with the leader, while out-group members have ''low-quality exchanges'' with the leader.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In-group members====

[[In-group]] members are perceived by the leader as being more experienced, competent, and willing to assume responsibility than other followers. The leader begins to rely on these individuals to help with especially challenging tasks. If the follower responds well, the leader rewards him/her with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences. If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another. Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."/&gt; In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.

====Out-group members====

[[Ingroups and outgroups|Out-group]] members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts. With out-group members, leaders expect no more than adequate [[job performance]], good attendance, reasonable respect, and adherence to the job description in exchange for a [[living wage|fair wage]] and standard benefits. The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests. Research shows that out-group members are less satisfied with their job and organization, receive lower performance evaluations from the leader, see their leader as less fair, and are more likely to file grievances or leave the organization.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."/&gt;

===Emotions===
{{see also|Emotional intelligence}}
Leadership can be perceived as a particularly emotion-laden process, with emotions entwined with the social influence process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J. M. | year = 2000 | title = Emotions and leadership: The role of emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 53 | issue = 8| pages = 1027–1055 | doi=10.1177/0018726700538001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an organization, the leader's mood has some effects on his/her group. These effects can be described in three levels:&lt;ref name=cote&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sy | first=T.| last2=Cote | first2=S.| last3=Saavedra | first3=R.| year=2005| title=The contagious leader: Impact of the leader's mood on the mood of group members, group affective tone, and group processes| journal=Journal of Applied Psychology| volume=90 | issue=2| pages=295–305| url=http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~scote/SyetalJAP.pdf| doi=10.1037/0021-9010.90.2.295| pmid=15769239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The mood of individual group members. Group members with leaders in a positive mood experience more positive mood than do group members with leaders in a negative mood. The leaders transmit their moods to other group members through the mechanism of [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name=cote/&gt; Mood contagion may be one of the psychological mechanisms by which [[charismatic]] leaders influence followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bono | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Ilies | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Charisma, positive emotions and mood contagion | url = | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 317–334 | doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2006.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The affective tone of the group. [[Group affective tone]] represents the consistent or homogeneous affective reactions within a group. Group affective tone is an aggregate of the moods of the individual members of the group and refers to mood at the group level of analysis. Groups with leaders in a positive mood have a more positive affective tone than do groups with leaders in a negative mood.&lt;ref name=cote/&gt;
# Group processes like coordination, effort expenditure, and [[Task (project management)|task]] [[strategy]]. Public expressions of mood impact how group members think and act. When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others. Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good. The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.&lt;ref name=cote/&gt;
In research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the [[leader]] improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.&lt;ref name=george&gt;George J. M. 2006. "Leader Positive Mood and Group Performance: The Case of Customer Service". ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'' 25(9): pp. 778–794&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the leader's mood, her/his behavior is a source for employee positive and negative [[emotions]] at work. The leader creates situations and events that lead to emotional response. Certain leader behaviors displayed during interactions with their employees are the sources of these affective events. Leaders shape workplace affective events. Examples – feedback giving, allocating tasks, resource distribution. Since employee behavior and productivity are directly affected by their emotional states, it is imperative to consider employee emotional responses to organizational leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dasborough | first1 = M. T. | year = 2006 | title = Cognitive asymmetry in employee emotional reactions to leadership behaviors | url = | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 163–178 | doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage moods and emotions in the self and others, contributes to effective leadership within organizations.&lt;ref name=george/&gt;

===Neo-emergent theory===
{{Main article|Functional leadership model}}

The neo-emergent leadership theory (from the Oxford Strategic Leadership Programme) sees leadership as created through the emergence of information by the leader or other stakeholders, not through the true actions of the leader himself.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In other words, the reproduction of information or [[narrative|stories]] form the basis of the perception of leadership by the majority. It is well known{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that the naval hero [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] often wrote his own versions of battles he was involved in, so that when he arrived home in England he would receive a true hero's welcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In modern society, the press, blogs and other sources report their own views of leaders, which may be based on reality, but may also be based on a political command, a payment, or an inherent interest of the author, media, or leader. Therefore, one can argue that the perception of all leaders is created and in fact does not reflect their true leadership qualities at all.

== Leadership emergence ==
Many personality characteristics were found to be reliably associated with leadership emergence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Group Dynamics|last=Forsyth|first=Donelson|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2010|isbn=|location=Belmont, California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list include, but is not limited to following (list organized in alphabetical order): assertiveness, authenticity, Big Five personality factors, birth order, character strengths, dominance, emotional intelligence, gender identity, intelligence, narcissism, self-efficacy for leadership, self-monitoring and social motivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Leadership emergence is the idea that people born with specific characteristics become leaders, and those without these characteristics do not become leaders.  People like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Nelson Mandela all share traits that an average person does not.  This includes people who choose to participate in leadership roles, as opposed to those who do not.  Research indicates that up to 30% of leader emergence has a genetic basis.&lt;ref&gt;Aamodt, M. G. (2010). I/O applications workbook: Industrial/organizational psychology an applied approach. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no current research indicating that there is a “leadership gene”, instead we inherit certain traits that might influence our decision to seek leadership.  Both anecdotal, and empirical evidence support a stable relationship between specific traits and leadership behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Law, J. R. (1996). Rising to the occasion: foundations, processes, and outcomes of emergent leadership.&lt;/ref&gt; Using a large international sample researchers found that there are three factors that motivate leaders; affective identity (enjoyment of leading), non-calculative (leading earns reinforcement), and social-normative (sense of obligation).&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K., &amp; Drasgow, F. (2001). Toward a theory of individual differences and leadership: Understanding the motivation to lead. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86(3), 481-498. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.481&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assertiveness ===

The relationship between assertiveness and leadership emergence is curvilinear; individuals who are either low in assertiveness or very high in assertiveness are less likely to be identified as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ames|first=Daniel R.|last2=Flynn|first2=Francis J.|title=What breaks a leader: The curvilinear relation between assertiveness and leadership.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=2|pages=307–324|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.2.307|pmid=17279851|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authenticity ===

Individuals who are more aware of their personality qualities, including their values and beliefs, and are less biased when processing self-relevant information, are more likely to be accepted as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ilies|first=Remus|last2=Morgeson|first2=Frederick P.|last3=Nahrgang|first3=Jennifer D.|date=2005-06-01|title=Authentic leadership and eudaemonic well-being: Understanding leader–follower outcomes|url=https://scholars.opb.msu.edu/en/publications/authentic-leadership-and-eudaemonic-well-being-understanding-lead-2|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=373–394|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.03.002|issn=1048-9843|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.5548}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Authentic leadership|Authentic Leadership]].

Those who emerge as leaders tend to be more (order in strength of relationship with leadership emergence): extroverted, conscientious, emotionally stable, and open to experience, although these tendencies are stronger in laboratory studies of leaderless groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judge|first=Timothy A.|last2=Bono|first2=Joyce E.|last3=Ilies|first3=Remus|last4=Gerhardt|first4=Megan W.|title=Personality and leadership: A qualitative and quantitative review.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.87.4.765|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=87|issue=4|pages=765–780|doi=10.1037//0021-9010.87.4.765|year=2002|citeseerx=10.1.1.301.9866}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreeableness, the last factor of the Big Five personality traits, does not seem to play any meaningful role in leadership emergence &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Birth order ===

Those born first in their families and only children are hypothesized to be more driven to seek leadership and control in social settings. Middle-born children tend to accept follower roles in groups, and later-borns are thought to be rebellious and creative &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Character strengths ===

Those seeking leadership positions in a military organization had elevated scores on a number of indicators of strength of character, including honesty, hope, bravery, industry, and teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Michael D.|last2=Eid|first2=Jarle|last3=Kelly|first3=Dennis|last4=Bailey|first4=Jennifer K.

=== Dominance ===

Individuals with dominant personalities – they describe themselves as high in the desire to control their environment and influence other people, and are likely to express their opinions in a forceful way – are more likely to act as leaders in small-group situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223344605|title=A pattern approach to leader emergence|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Emotional intelligence ===

Individuals with high emotional intelligence have increased ability to understand and relate to people. They have skills in communicating and decoding emotions and they deal with others wisely and effectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such people communicate their ideas in more robust ways, are better able to read the politics of a situation, are less likely to lose control of their emotions, are less likely to be inappropriately angry or critical, and in consequence are more likely to emerge as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New leaders |isbn=9780751533811|oclc=891670377|last1 = Goleman|first1 = Daniel|last2=Boyatzis|first2=Richard E.|last3=McKee|first3=Annie|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender identity ===

Masculine individuals are more likely to emerge as leaders than are feminine individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lord|first=Robert G.|last2=Vader|first2=Christy L. de|last3=Alliger|first3=George M.|title=A meta-analysis of the relation between personality traits and leadership perceptions: An application of validity generalization procedures.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=71|issue=3|pages=402–410|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.71.3.402|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligence ===

Individuals with higher intelligence exhibit superior judgement, higher verbal skills (both written and oral), quicker learning and acquisition of knowledge, and are more likely to emerge as leaders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Correlation between IQ and leadership emergence was found to be between .25 and .30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bass &amp; Stogdill's handbook of leadership : theory, research, and managerial applications Bass and Stogdill's handbook of leade.|last=Melvin.|first=Stogdill, Ralph|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Free Press|isbn=9780029015001|oclc=959443394}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, groups generally prefer leaders that do not exceed intelligence prowess of average member by a wide margin, as they fear that high intelligence may be translated to differences in communication, trust, interests and values&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean K.|title=Intelligence and personal influence in groups: Four nonlinear models.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92|issue=4|pages=532–547|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.92.4.532|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism ===

Individuals who take on leadership roles in turbulent situations, such as groups facing a threat or ones in which status is determined by intense competition among rivals within the group, tend to be narcissistic: arrogant, self-absorbed, hostile, and very self-confident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223046510|title=Narcissistic Leadership (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-efficacy for leadership ===

Confidence in one's ability to lead is associated with increases in willingness to accept a leadership role and success in that role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoyt|first=C.

=== Self-monitoring ===

High self-monitors are more likely to emerge as the leader of a group than are low self-monitors, since they are more concerned with status-enhancement and are more likely to adapt their actions to fit the demands of the situation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222434830|title=Can chameleons lead? (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social motivation ===

Individuals who are both success-oriented and affiliation-oriented, as assessed by projective measures, are more active in group problem-solving settings and are more likely to be elected to positions of leadership in such groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorrentino|first=Richard M.|last2=Field|first2=Nigel|title=Emergent leadership over time: The functional value of positive motivation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1091–1099|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.6.1091|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership styles==
{{Main article|Leadership styles}}
A leadership style is a leader's style of providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'', U of Chicago Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;).

Different situations call for different leadership styles. In an emergency when there is little time to converge on an agreement and where a designated authority has significantly more experience or expertise than the rest of the team, an autocratic leadership style may be most effective; however, in a highly motivated and aligned team with a homogeneous level of expertise, a more democratic or [[Laissez-faire]] style may be more effective. The style adopted should be the one that most effectively achieves the objectives of the group while balancing the interests of its individual members.&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lewin | first=K.| author-link=Kurt Lewin| last2=Lippitt | first2=R.| last3=White | first3=R. K.| year=1939| title=Patterns of aggressive behavior in experimentally created social climates| journal=Journal of Social Psychology| volume=10| pages=271–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A field in which leadership style has gained strong attention is that of military science, recently expressing a holistic and integrated view of leadership, including how a leader's physical presence determines how others perceive that leader. The factors of physical presence are military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and [[domain knowledge]]. Domain knowledge for leaders encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). "Army Leadership. Competent, Confident, and Agile". FM 6-22. Washington, D.C., 12 October 2006 p. 18. Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autocratic or authoritarian===

Under the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.

Autocratic leaders do not entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.&lt;ref name=Lewin/&gt;

===Participative or democratic===
The democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality. This has also been called [[shared leadership]].

=== Laissez-faire or Free-rein ===
In Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the sub-ordinates. The sub-ordinates are given complete right and power to make decisions to establish goals and work out the problems or hurdles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317115085|title=(PDF) Modern leadership and management methods for development organizations|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Task-oriented and relationship-oriented===
{{Main article|Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership}}
Task-oriented leadership is a style in which the leader is focused on the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet a certain production goal. Task-oriented leaders are generally more concerned with producing a step-by-step solution for given problem or goal, strictly making sure these deadlines are met, results and reaching target outcomes.

Relationship-oriented leadership is a contrasting style in which the leader is more focused on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ronald J. Ebert, Ricky W.|title=Business essentials|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-705349-0|pages=135–136|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.

Task-oriented leaders are typically less concerned with the idea of catering to group members, and more concerned with acquiring a certain solution to meet a production goal. For this reason, they typically are able to make sure that deadlines are met, yet their group members' well-being may suffer. Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives to having this kind of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer.

==Leadership differences affected by gender==
{{One source|section|date=February 2013}}
Another factor that covaries with leadership style is whether the person is male or female. When men and women come together in groups, they tend to adopt different leadership styles. Men generally assume an [[:agentic leadership]] style. They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented. Women, on the other hand, are generally more communal when they assume a leadership position; they strive to be helpful towards others, warm in relation to others, understanding, and mindful of others' feelings. In general, when women are asked to describe themselves to others in newly formed groups, they emphasize their open, fair, responsible, and pleasant communal qualities. They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts in an attempt to maintain positive relationships among group members. Women connect more positively to group members by smiling, maintaining eye contact and respond tactfully to others' comments. Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done. They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring compliance with procedures, and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done. As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented. However, it is important to note that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-0495599524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
In the past, some researchers have argued that the actual influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders (Meindl &amp; Ehrlich, 1987). Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes (Day &amp; Lord, 1988; Kaiser, Hogan, &amp; Craig, 2008). To facilitate successful performance it is important to understand and accurately measure leadership performance.

Job performance generally refers to behavior that is expected to contribute to organizational success (Campbell, 1990). Campbell identified a number of specific types of performance dimensions; leadership was one of the dimensions that he identified. There is no consistent, overall definition of leadership performance (Yukl, 2006). Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership [[performance]], including outcomes such as leader [[effectiveness]], leader advancement, and leader emergence (Kaiser et al., 2008). For instance, leadership performance may be used to refer to the career success of the individual leader, performance of the group or organization, or even leader emergence. Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct. While these aspects may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.

"Another way to conceptualize leader performance is to focus on the outcomes of the leader’s followers, group, team, unit, or organization. In evaluating this type of leader performance, two general strategies are typically used. The first relies on subjective perceptions of the leader’s performance from subordinates, superiors, or occasionally peers or other parties. The other type of effectiveness measures are more objective indicators of follower or unit performance, such as measures of productivity, goal attainment, sales figures, or unit financial performance (Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006, p. 47)."
&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[toxic leader]] is someone who has responsibility over a group of people or an organization, and who abuses the leader–follower relationship by leaving the group or organization in a worse-off condition than when he/she joined it.

==Traits==
[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar-edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Julius Caesar]], one of the world's greatest military leaders]]
Most theories in the 20th century argued that great leaders were born, not made. Current studies have indicated that leadership is much more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual. Years of observation and study have indicated that one such trait or a set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader. What scholars have been able to arrive at is that leadership traits of an individual do not change from situation to situation; such traits include intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances. The following summarizes the main leadership traits found in research by Jon P. Howell, business professor at New Mexico State University and author of the book ''Snapshots of Great Leadership''.

Determination and drive include traits such as initiative, energy, assertiveness, perseverance and sometimes dominance. People with these traits often tend to wholeheartedly pursue their goals, work long hours, are ambitious, and often are very competitive with others. Cognitive capacity includes intelligence, analytical and verbal ability, behavioral flexibility, and good judgment. Individuals with these traits are able to formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future. Howell provides examples of Steve Jobs and Abraham Lincoln as encompassing the traits of determination and drive as well as possessing cognitive capacity, demonstrated by their ability to adapt to their continuously changing environments.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"/&gt;

Self-confidence encompasses the traits of high self-esteem, assertiveness, emotional stability, and self-assurance. Individuals who are self-confident do not doubt themselves or their abilities and decisions; they also have the ability to project this self-confidence onto others, building their trust and commitment. Integrity is demonstrated in individuals who are truthful, trustworthy, principled, consistent, dependable, loyal, and not deceptive. Leaders with integrity often share these values with their followers, as this trait is mainly an ethics issue. It is often said that these leaders keep their word and are honest and open with their cohorts. Sociability describes individuals who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent. Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted well by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, as well as hold the ability to adapt their social persona to the situation at hand. According to Howell, Mother Teresa is an exceptional example who embodies integrity, assertiveness, and social abilities in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"/&gt;

Few great leaders encompass all of the traits listed above, but many have the ability to apply a number of them to succeed as front-runners of their organization or situation.

==Ontological-phenomenological model==
One of the more recent definitions of leadership comes from [[Werner Erhard]], [[Michael C. Jensen]], Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger who describe leadership as "an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that wasn't going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties...". This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.  This differs from relating to the relevant parties as "followers" and calling up an image of a single leader with others following.  Rather, a future that fulfills on the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties indicates the future that wasn't going to happen is not the "idea of the leader", but rather is what emerges from digging deep to find the underlying concerns of those who are impacted by the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Forthcoming in "The Handbook for Teaching Leadership", by Werner Erhard, Michael, C. Jensen, &amp; Kari Granger; Scott Snook, Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana (Editors) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1681682&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==

===Organizations===
An organization that is established as an [[Legal instrument|instrument]] or means for achieving defined [[Goal|objectives]] has been referred to as a ''formal organization''. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work [[structure]]. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Employees receive a salary and enjoy a degree of tenure that safeguards them from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher one's position in the hierarchy, the greater one's presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Cecil A Gibb|title= Leadership (Handbook of Social Psychology)|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1970|pages=884–89|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc=174777513|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the ''informal organization'' that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal [[Goal|objectives]] and [[goal]]s of the individual [[wikt:Membership|membership]]. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life — the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.

In prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now humanity spends a major portion of waking hours working for organizations. The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Henry P. Knowles |author2=Borje O. Saxberg |title=Personality and Leadership Behavior|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1971|pages=884–89|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc= 118832|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Vugt, M., Hogan, R., &amp; Kaiser, R. (2008). "Leadership, followership, and evolution": Some lessons from the past. ''American Psychologist'', 63, 182–196.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140411195727/http://www.professormarkvanvugt.com/files/LeadershipFollowershipandEvolution-AmericanPsychologist-2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization. Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain co-operation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;

A leader is a person who influences a group of people towards a specific result. It is not dependent on title or formal authority. (Elevos, paraphrased from Leaders, Bennis, and Leadership Presence, Halpern &amp; Lubar.) Ogbonnia (2007) defines an effective leader "as an individual with the capacity to consistently succeed in a given condition and be viewed as meeting the expectations of an organization or society." Leaders are recognized by their capacity for caring for others, clear communication, and a commitment to persist.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, John R. ''Leadership and Futuring: Making Visions Happen''. Thousand Oaks, California: Corwin Press, Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position. However, she or he must possess adequate personal attributes to match this authority, because authority is only potentially available to him/her. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge her/his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt; Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=David|title=The Top 10 Leadership Qualities|url=http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410090435/http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archivedate=2013-04-10|website=HR World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
Over the years the philosophical terminology of "[[management]]" and "leadership" have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between "transactional" leadership (characterized by emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, management by exception) and "transformational" leadership (characterized by charisma, personal relationships, creativity).&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

===Group===
In contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership. In this so-called [[shared leadership]], more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole. It is furthermore characterized by shared responsibility, cooperation and mutual influence among the team members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CARSON|first=J. B.|last2=TESLUK|first2=P. E.|last3=MARRONE|first3=J. A.|title=SHARED LEADERSHIP IN TEAMS: AN INVESTIGATION OF ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS AND PERFORMANCE.|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1217–1234|doi=10.2307/20159921|jstor=20159921|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations have taken this approach in hopes of increasing creativity, reducing costs, or downsizing. Others may see the traditional leadership of a [[wikt:boss|boss]] as costing too much in team performance. In some situations, the team members best able to handle any given phase of the project become the temporary leaders. Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ingrid Bens|year=2006|title=Facilitating to Lead|publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-7731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders who demonstrate persistence, tenacity, determination, and synergistic communication skills will bring out the same qualities in their groups. Good leaders use their own inner [[Mentorship|mentors]] to energize their team and organizations and lead a team to achieve success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Bart Barthelemy|year=1997|title=The Sky Is Not The Limit – Breakthrough Leadership|publisher=St. Lucie Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''According to the National School Boards Association (USA):'''''&lt;ref&gt;National School Boards Association&lt;/ref&gt;

These Group Leaderships or Leadership Teams have specific characteristics:

'''Characteristics of a Team'''
* There must be an awareness of unity on the part of all its members.
* There must be interpersonal relationship. Members must have a chance to contribute, and learn from and work with others.
* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.

'''Ten characteristics of well-functioning teams:'''
* Purpose: Members proudly share a sense of why the team exists and are invested in accomplishing its mission and goals.
* Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.
* Roles: Members know their roles in getting tasks done and when to allow a more skillful member to do a certain task.
* Decisions: Authority and decision-making lines are clearly understood.
* Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.
* Personal traits: members feel their unique personalities are appreciated and well utilized.
* Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.
* Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.
* Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.
* Training: Opportunities for feedback and updating skills are provided and taken advantage of by team members.

===Self-leadership===
[[Communication and Leadership During Change|Self-leadership]] is a process that occurs within an individual, rather than an external act. It is an expression of who we are as people.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, M. &amp; Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''. Long Grove, Illinois: Waveland Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology and Evolution of Leadership===
[[Mark van Vugt]] and [[Anjana Ahuja]] in ''Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership'' (2011) present evidence of leadership in non-human animals, from ants and bees to baboons and chimpanzees. They suggest that leadership has a long evolutionary history and that the same mechanisms underpinning leadership in humans appear in other social species, too.&lt;ref&gt;van Vugt, M., &amp; Ahuja, A. (2011). ''Naturally Selected: the Evolutionary Science of Leadership''. HarperBusiness.&lt;/ref&gt; They also suggest that the evolutionary origins of leadership are different from that of dominance. In a study [[Mark van Vugt]] and his team looked at the relation between basal testosterone and leadership versus dominance. They found that testosterone correlates with dominance but not with leadership. This was replicated in a sample of managers in which there was no relation between hierarchical position and testosterone level.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meij, L., Schaveling, J., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2016). Basal testosterone, leadership and dominance: A field study and meta-analysis. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 72, 72-79.&lt;/ref&gt;.     
[[Richard Wrangham]] and [[Dale Peterson]], in ''[[Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence]]'' (1996), present evidence that only humans and [[chimpanzee]]s, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson (1996). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm ''Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence'']. Mariner Books&lt;/ref&gt; This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which follow castrated bell[[wether (disambiguation)|wethers]]) and many others.

By comparison, [[bonobo]]s, the second-closest species-relatives of humans, do ''not'' unite behind the chief male of the land. The bonobos show deference to an alpha or top-ranking female that, with the support of her coalition of other females, can prove as strong as the strongest male. Thus, if leadership amounts to getting the greatest number of followers, then among the bonobos, a female almost always exerts the strongest and most effective leadership. (Incidentally, not all scientists agree on the allegedly peaceful nature of the bonobo or with its reputation as a "[[hippie]] chimp".&lt;ref&gt;

==Myths==
Leadership, although largely talked about, has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations. Over the years, many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that the existence of several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership often interferes with individuals' conception of what leadership is all about (Gardner, 1965; Bennis, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, J. W. (1965). ''Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennis, W. G. (1975). ''Where have all the leaders gone?'' Washington, D.C.: Federal Executive Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership is innate===
According to some, leadership is determined by distinctive [[dispositional affect|dispositional characteristics]] present at birth (e.g., [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]; [[intelligence]]; [[ingenuity]]). However, according to Forsyth (2009) there is evidence to show that leadership also develops through hard work and careful observation.&lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics'' (5th ed.). Pacific Grove, California: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, effective leadership can result from [[nature versus nurture|nature]] (i.e., innate talents) as well as [[nature versus nurture|nurture]] (i.e., acquired skills).

===Leadership is possessing power over others===
Although leadership is certainly a form of [[Power (social and political)|power]], it is not demarcated by power ''over'' people – rather, it is a power ''with'' people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers (Forsyth, 2009).&lt;ref name=Forsyth/&gt; Despite popular belief, the use of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], [[coercion]], and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership. In actuality, individuals who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders (e.g., class president; court judge).

===Leaders are positively influential===
The [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the assertion that groups flourish when guided by effective leaders can be illustrated using several examples. For instance, according to Baumeister et al. (1988), the [[bystander effect]] (failure to respond or offer assistance) that tends to develop within groups faced with an emergency is significantly reduced in groups guided by a leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Senders | first2 = P. S. | last3 = Chesner | first3 = S. C. | last4 = Tice | first4 = D. M. | year = 1988 | title = Who's in charge here? Group leaders do lend help in emergencies | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 17–22 | doi=10.1177/0146167288141002| pmid = 30045447 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it has been documented that group performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jung | first1 = D. | last2 = Wu | first2 = A. | last3 = Chow | first3 = C.

J.; &amp; Banks, D. J. (2001). "Leadership, vision, and organizational effectiveness". In S. J. Zaccaro and R. J. Klimoski (Editors), ''The Nature of Organizational Leadership: Understanding the Performance Imperatives Confronting Today's Leaders''.

However, the difference leaders make is '''not''' always positive in nature. Leaders sometimes focus on fulfilling their own agendas at the expense of others, including his/her own followers (e.g., [[Pol Pot]]; [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]]). Leaders who focus on personal gain by employing stringent and manipulative leadership styles often make a difference, but usually do so through negative means.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman-Blumen, J. (2005) ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders''. New York: Oxford. University Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaders entirely control group outcomes===
In [[Western culture]]s it is generally assumed that group leaders make ''all'' the difference when it comes to group influence and overall goal-attainment. Although common, this romanticized view of leadership (i.e., the tendency to overestimate the degree of control leaders have over their groups and their groups' outcomes) ignores the existence of many other factors that influence group dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meindl | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Dukerich | first3 = J. M. | year = 1985 | title = The romance of leadership | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 78–102 | doi=10.2307/2392813| jstor = 2392813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[group cohesiveness|group cohesion]], [[organizational communication|communication patterns]] among members, individual personality traits, group context, the nature or orientation of the work, as well as [[norm (social)|behavioral norms]] and established standards influence group functionality in varying capacities. For this reason, it is unwarranted to assume that all leaders are in complete control of their groups' achievements.

===All groups have a designated leader===

Despite preconceived notions, not all groups need have a designated leader. Groups that are primarily composed of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid Mast | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Female dominance hierarchies: Are they any different from males'? | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 29–39 | doi=10.1177/0146167202281003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berdahl | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = C. | year = 2005 | title = Men, women, and leadership centralization in groups over time | url = | journal = Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 45–57 | doi=10.1037/1089-2699.9.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt; are limited in size, are free from stressful decision-making,&lt;ref name=guastello&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guastello | first1 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Nonlinear dynamics and leadership emergence | url = https://epublications.marquette.edu/psych_fac/220| journal = Leadership Quarterly | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 357–369 | doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2007.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or only exist for a short period of time (e.g., student work groups; pub quiz/trivia teams) often undergo a [[diffusion of responsibility]], where leadership tasks and roles are shared amongst members (Schmid Mast, 2002; Berdahl &amp; Anderson, 2007; Guastello, 2007).

===Group members resist leaders===
Although research has indicated that group members' dependence on group leaders can lead to reduced self-reliance and overall group strength,&lt;ref name=Forsyth/&gt; most people actually prefer to be led than to be without a leader (Berkowitz, 1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkowitz | first1 = L | year = 1953 | title = Sharing leadership in small, decision-making groups | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 231–238 | doi=10.1037/h0058076}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "need for a leader" becomes especially strong in troubled groups that are experiencing some sort of conflict. Group members tend to be more contented and productive when they have a leader to guide them. Although individuals filling leadership roles can be a direct source of resentment for followers, most people appreciate the contributions that leaders make to their groups and consequently welcome the guidance of a leader (Stewart &amp; Manz, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = G. L. | last2 = Manz | first2 = C. C. | year = 1995 | title = Leadership for self-managing work teams: A typology and integrative model | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 48 | issue = 7| pages = 747–770 | doi=10.1177/001872679504800702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action-oriented environments==
In most cases, these teams are tasked to operate in remote and changeable environments with limited support or backup (action environments). Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of front line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment. This has been termed action oriented leadership. Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schelten|first1=Andreas|title=Prof.|url=http://www.bpaed.edu.tum.de/fileadmin/tueds02/www/pdfs/publikationen/riedl/2002handoutvariantsriedl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include modern technology deployments of small/medium-sized IT teams into client plant sites. Leadership of these teams requires hands on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home base decision makers. Zachary Hansen was an early adopter of Scrum/Kanban branch development methodologies during the mid 90's to alleviate the dependency that field teams had on trunk based development. This method of just-in-time action oriented development and deployment allowed remote plant sites to deploy up-to-date software patches frequently and without dependency on core team deployment schedules satisfying the clients need to rapidly patch production environment bugs as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=B.W.|title=Software risk management: principles and practices|journal=IEEE Software|volume=8|pages=32–41|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=62930&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D62930|doi=10.1109/52.62930|year=1991|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical thought==

[[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s 1840 "[[Great Man theory]]", which emphasized the role of leading individuals, met opposition in the 19th and 20th centuries.

[[Karl Popper]] noted in 1945 that leaders can [[mislead]] and make mistakes - he warns against deferring to "great men".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]]&lt;ref&gt;
''Profit over People: neoliberalism and global order'', N. Chomsky, 1999 Ch. "Consent without Consent", p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
have subjected the concept of leadership to [[critical thinking]] and have provided an analysis that asserts that people abrogate their responsibility to think and will actions for themselves. While the conventional view of leadership may satisfy people who "want to be told what to do", these critics say that one should question why they are being subjected to a will or intellect other than their own if the leader is not a subject-matter expert ([[Subject Matter Expert|SME]]).

Concepts such as [[Workers' self-management|autogestion]], [[employeeship]], and common [[civic virtue]], etc., challenge the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the leadership principle by stressing [[individual responsibility]] and/or group authority in the workplace and elsewhere and by focusing on the skills and attitudes that a person needs in general rather than separating out "leadership" as the basis of a special class of individuals.

Similarly, various historical calamities (such as [[World War II]]) can be attributed&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

&lt;/ref&gt;
to a misplaced reliance on the [[Führerprinzip|principle of leadership]] as exhibited in [[dictatorship]].

The idea of [[leaderism]] paints leadership and its excesses in a negative light.

==Executives==
Executives are energetic, outgoing, and competitive. They can be visionary, hard-working, and decisive. However, managers need to be aware of unsuccessful executives who once showed management potential but who are later dismissed or retired early. They typically fail because of personality factors rather than job performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperry|first=Len|date=September 1997|title=Leadership Dynamics Character and Character Structure in Executives|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232551186|journal=Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|series=268–284|volume=49|issue=4|pages=|via=}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Terms fallacies in their thinking are:''
* ''Unrealistic optimism fallacy'': Believing they are so smart that they can do whatever they want
* ''Egocentrism fallacy'': Believing they are the only ones who matter, that the people who work for them don't count
* ''Omniscience fallacy'': Believing they know everything and seeing no limits to their knowledge
* ''Omnipotence fallacy'': Believing they are all powerful and therefore entitled to do what they want
* ''Invulnerability fallacy'': Believing they can get away with doing what they want because they are too clever to get caught; even if they are caught, believing they will go unpunished because of their importance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6391">'''Lime-ash floors''' were an economic form of floor construction from the 15th century to the 19th century, for upper floors in parts of [[England]] where [[limestone]] or [[chalk]] were easily available. They were strong, flexible, and offered [[heat insulation|good heat]] and [[sound insulation]].&lt;ref name=Hartley&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartley|1996|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Malthouse, Kirklees Home Farm, Clifton - geograph.org.uk - 177720.jpg|thumb|A malthouse in [[Yorkshire]], England, that uses lime-ash floors]] &lt;!-- I need some better images!--&gt;
Lime-ash is the residue found at the bottom of a wood-fired [[lime kiln]], consisting of waste lime and wood ash.&lt;ref name=BiffVernon&gt;{{Harvnb|Vernon|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kilns became common in the early 15th century and continued to be used until newer technology replaced them in the late 19th century. Lime-ash could also be made in coal-fired kilns. In areas where gypsum was common they were known as plaster floors.{{r|Hartley}} Lime ash was used on the upper floors of yeomans houses and in great houses such as [[Hardwick Hall]] in Derbyshire, where the upper surface would be buffed to a fine finish using a mixture of egg-white, curdled milk and [[isinglass|fish-gelatine]].{{r|BiffVernon}} The underside could be left bare or smoothed with a lime-plaster. Alternatively the floor joist could be concealed with a conventional lath and plaster ceiling.{{r|Hartley}}

Isaac Ware in his ''A Complete Body of Architecture (1756)'' remarks on "the beauty of floors of plaster mixed with other ingredients", comparing them with those of granite.{{r|Hartley-2}}

==Construction==
A lime-ash floor typically occurs on the upper floors of a building. One can expect to find construction beams lying the length of the building with flooring [[joist]]s being placed across at intervals of about 400mm (16&amp;nbsp;in). A bed of [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] (or similar grasses) is placed on the joists making a tight thatch. They are secured by placing oak laths over them and nailing these to the joists. A 50mm slurry of ''lime-ash composition'' is poured over the bedding material which supports it  until the lime-ash has dried out.{{r|BiffVernon}} The reed bed acts as [[Formwork|shuttering]] and laths add to the rigidity of the floor. However laths that are too tightly fixed to the joists hinder the movement the floor must have to cope with settlement and the structural changes during its lifetime which can be counted in centuries.{{r|Hartley-2}}

The lime-ash composition varies according to the materials locally available:

* [[Lime (material)|Lime]]&amp;nbsp;– acts as a binder and contains particles of raw limestone and over burnt lime.
* Fuel ash&amp;nbsp;– this [[pozzolan#Pozzolanic materials|pozzolanic]] material binds its constituent Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with the Ca² ions in a [[pozzolanic reaction]]. It contains burnt wood or coal.
* [[Gypsum]], to help with set
* [[Clay]] with fragments of broken brick and tile, another pozzolanic material
* [[Silica]] or sand, which acts as an [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]]
* Other debris&amp;nbsp;– vegetable or animal and bubbles of air.{{r|Hartley-2}}

Nigel and Mary Kerr in ''Lincolnshire Life'', November 1987, write: "A traditional mix used in Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire and south Lincolnshire was: 'One third lime, one third well sifted coal ashes and one third loamy clay and horse dung from grasses{{'"}}. They add that ox blood and horse hair were sometimes included.{{r|BiffVernon}}&lt;ref name="Kerr"&gt;{{citation|last=Kerr|first=Nigel |author2=Kerr, Mary|year=1987|journal=Lincolnshire Life|volume=1987|issue=November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems occurring===
After long use the surface can start to break up: this can be ignored, or a further [[screed]] of lime-ash composition can be laid over the original floor. This was often done in the past but does increase the weight of the structure. Damp can cause fungi to rot the bedding material, or insects to gnaw away the laths and indeed the joists, taking with it the floor. Knocking through service ducts without due care can destroy the floor, as can overloading due to change of use or addition of partition walls.{{r|Hartley-2}}

===Laying a new floor===
Lime-ash is generally no longer available, so repairs and reconstruction are usually done using a mixture of lime putty, coal ash, Gypsum (Class A hemi hydrate fine casting plaster), unburnt loamy clay and burnt crushed tile. To this are added retardants such as [[Keratin]] (natural) or [[Sodium Citrate]] (manufactured).&lt;ref name=Hartley-3&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartley|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bedding material is repaired with [[water reed]] {{convert|5|ft|mm}}, or [[winter wheat|combed winter wheat]] which is the strongest form of straw, and [[chestnut|chestnut laths]] which can be obtained in {{convert|4|ft|mm}} lengths.

==Geographical variations==
They can be found principally in Derbyshire, Cheshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire and the Welsh borders, Staffordshire, Leicestershire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire; Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and many parts of Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=Hartley-2&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartley|1996|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some floors are made almost entirely of gypsum, particularly around Newark&amp;nbsp;– plaster floors would be a better description.{{r|BiffVernon}}

In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra''' (or '''Lindenbaum algebra''') of a [[model theory#Definition|logical theory]] ''T'' consists of the [[equivalence class]]es of [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s of the theory (i.e., the [[quotient]], under the [[equivalence relation]] ~ defined such that ''p'' ~ ''q'' exactly when ''p'' and ''q'' are provably equivalent in ''T''). That is, two sentences are equivalent if the theory ''T'' proves that each implies the other. The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the [[quotient algebra]] obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this [[congruence relation]].

The algebra is named for [[logician]]s [[Adolf Lindenbaum]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]. 
It was first introduced by Tarski in 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=A. Tarski| title=Logic, Semantics, and Metamathematics — Papers from 1923 to 1938 — Trans. J.H. Woodger| year=1983| publisher=Hackett Pub. Co.| editor=J. Corcoran| edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as a device to establish correspondence between classical [[propositional calculus]] and [[Boolean algebras]]. 
The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern [[algebraic logic]].&lt;ref name=BP&gt;{{cite journal| author=W.J. Blok, Don Pigozzi| title=Algebraizable logics| journal=Memoirs of the AMS| year=1989| month=| volume=77| number=396| pages=| url=http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dpigozzi}}; here: pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==

The operations in a Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra ''A'' are inherited from those in the underlying theory ''T''. These typically include [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[disjunction]], which are [[well-defined]] on the equivalence classes. When [[negation]] is also present in ''T'', then ''A'' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], provided the logic is [[classical logic|classical]]. If the theory ''T'' consists of the [[propositional calculus|propositional tautologies]], the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is the [[free Boolean algebra]] generated by the [[propositional variable]]s.

== Related algebras ==

[[Heyting algebra]]s and [[interior algebra]]s are the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebras for [[intuitionistic logic]] and the [[modal logic]] '''S4''', respectively. 

A logic for which Tarski's method is applicable, is called ''algebraizable''. There are however a number of logics where this is not the case, for instance the modal logics '''S1''', '''S2''', or '''S3''', which lack the [[rule of necessitation]] (⊢φ implying ⊢□φ), so  ~ (defined above) is not a congruence (because ⊢φ→ψ does not imply ⊢□φ→□ψ). Another type of logics where Tarski's method is inapplicable are [[relevance logic]]s, because given two theorems an implication from one to the other may not itself be a theorem in a relevance logic.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt; The study of the algebraization process (and notion) as topic of interest by itself, not necessarily by Tarski's method, has led to the development of [[abstract algebraic logic]].

[[File:Blausen 0657 MultipolarNeuron.png|thumb|300px|Anatomy of a [[multipolar neuron]] ]]

A '''neural circuit''', is a population of [[neuron]]s interconnected by [[synapse]]s to carry out a specific function when activated.&lt;ref name="Neuro"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Purves |first1=Dale |title=Neuroscience |date=2011 |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Mass. |isbn=9780878936953 |page=507 |edition= 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neural circuits interconnect to one another to form [[large scale brain networks]].&lt;ref name="CEI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neural Circuits {{!}} Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function |url=https://www.brainfunction.edu.au/research/research-themes/neural-circuits/ |website=Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en-AU |date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological [[neural network]]s have inspired the design of [[artificial neural network]]s.

==Early study==
[[Image:Cajal actx inter.jpg|thumb|300px|right|From "Texture of the [[Nervous System]] of Man and the [[Vertebrates]]" by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]]. The figure illustrates the diversity of neuronal morphologies in the [[auditory cortex]].]]
Early treatments of neural [[Biological network|networks]] can be found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Psychology'', 3rd edition (1872), [[Theodor Meynert]]'s ''[[Psychiatry]]'' (1884), [[William James]]' ''Principles of [[Psychology]]'' (1890), and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s Project for a Scientific Psychology (composed 1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/papers/ThomasMcCIPCambEncy.pdf | title =Connectionist models of cognition |author1=Michael S. C. Thomas |author2=James L. McClelland | publisher =''[[Stanford University]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rule of neuronal learning was described by [[Donald Olding Hebb|Hebb]] in 1949, in the [[Hebbian theory]]. Thus, Hebbian pairing of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic activity can substantially alter the dynamic characteristics of the synaptic connection and therefore either facilitate or inhibit [[neurotransmission|signal transmission]]. In 1959, the [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]], [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] published the first works on the processing of neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain. |author1=J. Y. Lettvin |author2=H. R. Maturana |author3=W. S. McCulloch |author4=W. H. Pitts | year = 1959 | work = Proc. Inst. Radio Engr. | issue = 47 | pages = 1940–1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed theoretically that networks of artificial neurons could [[implementation|implement]] [[logic]]al, [[arithmetic]], and [[symbol]]ic functions. Simplified [[Biological neuron model|models of biological neurons]] were set up, now usually called [[perceptrons]] or [[artificial neurons]]. These simple models accounted for [[Summation (Neurophysiology)|neural summation]] (i.e., potentials at the post-synaptic membrane will summate in the [[cell body]]). Later models also provided for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission.

==Connections between neurons==
{{See also|Synapse}}

Gray dots represent areas of language comprehension, creating a network for comprehending all language. The semantic circuit of the motor system, particularly the motor representation of the legs (yellow dots), is incorporated when leg-related words are comprehended. Adapted from Shebani et al. (2013).]]
The connections between neurons in the brain are much more complex than those of the [[artificial neuron]]s used in the [[connectionism|connectionist]] neural computing models of [[artificial neural network]]s. The basic kinds of connections between neurons are [[synapse]]s, [[chemical synapse|chemical]] and [[electrical synapse]]s.

The establishment of synapses enables the connection of neurons into millions of overlapping, and interlinking neural circuits. [[Neurexin]]s are central to this process.&lt;ref name="Sudhof"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Südhof |first1=TC |title=Synaptic Neurexin Complexes: A Molecular Code for the Logic of Neural Circuits. |journal=Cell |date=2 November 2017 |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=745–769 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.024 |pmid=29100073|pmc=5694349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One principle by which neurons work is [[Summation (neurophysiology)|neural summation]] – [[postsynaptic potential|potentials]] at the [[Chemical synapse|postsynaptic membrane]] will sum up in the cell body. If the [[depolarization]] of the neuron at the axon goes above threshold an action potential will occur that travels down the axon to the terminal endings to transmit a signal to other neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is realized mostly by [[inhibitory postsynaptic potentials]] (IPSPs) and [[excitatory postsynaptic potentials]] (EPSPs).

On the [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] level, there are various phenomena which alter the response characteristics of individual synapses (called [[synaptic plasticity]]) and individual neurons ([[intrinsic plasticity]]). These are often divided into short-term plasticity and long-term plasticity. Long-term synaptic plasticity is often contended to be the most likely [[memory]] substrate. Usually the term "[[neuroplasticity]]" refers to changes in the brain that are caused by activity or experience.

Connections display temporal and spatial characteristics. Temporal characteristics refer to the continuously modified activity-dependent efficacy of synaptic transmission, called [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]]. It has been observed in several studies that the synaptic efficacy of this transmission can undergo short-term increase (called [[neural facilitation|facilitation]]) or decrease ([[Neural facilitation#Short-term depression|depression]]) according to the activity of the presynaptic neuron. The induction of long-term changes in synaptic efficacy, by [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) or [[long-term depression|depression]] (LTD), depends strongly on the relative timing of the onset of the [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]] and the postsynaptic action potential. LTP is induced by a series of action potentials which cause a variety of biochemical responses. Eventually, the reactions cause the expression of new receptors on the cellular membranes of the postsynaptic neurons or increase the efficacy of the existing receptors through [[phosphorylation]].

Backpropagating action potentials cannot occur because after an action potential travels down a given segment of the axon, the [[Depolarizing pre-pulse#Hodgkin–Huxley model|m gate]]s on [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s close, thus blocking any transient opening of the [[Depolarizing pre-pulse#Hodgkin–Huxley model|h gate]] from causing a change in the intracellular sodium ion (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration, and preventing the generation of an action potential back towards the cell body. In some cells, however, [[neural backpropagation]] does occur through the [[dendrite|dendritic branching]] and may have important effects on synaptic plasticity and computation.

A neuron in the brain requires a single signal to a neuromuscular junction to stimulate contraction of the postsynaptic muscle cell. In the spinal cord, however, at least 75 [[afferent nerve|afferent]] neurons are required to produce firing. This picture is further complicated by variation in time constant between neurons, as some cells can experience their [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential|EPSPs]] over a wider period of time than others.

While in synapses in the [[development of the human brain|developing brain]] synaptic depression has been particularly widely observed it has been speculated that it changes to facilitation in adult brains.

==Circuitry==
An example of a neural circuit is the [[trisynaptic circuit]] in the [[hippocampus]]. Another is the [[Papez circuit]] linking the [[hypothalamus]] to the [[limbic lobe]]. There are several neural circuits in the [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop]]. These circuits carry information between the cortex, [[basal ganglia]], thalamus, and back to the cortex. The largest structure within the basal ganglia, the [[striatum]], is seen as having its own internal microcircuitry.&lt;ref name="Stocco"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stocco |first1=Andrea |last2=Lebiere |first2=Christian |last3=Anderson |first3=John R. |title=Conditional Routing of Information to the Cortex: A Model of the Basal Ganglia's Role in Cognitive Coordination |journal=Psychological Review |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=541–74 |year=2010 |pmid=20438237 |doi=10.1037/a0019077 |pmc=3064519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural circuits in the [[spinal cord]] called [[central pattern generator]]s are responsible for controlling motor instructions involved in rhythmic behaviours. Rhythmic behaviours include walking, [[urination]], and [[ejaculation]]. The central pattern generators are made up of different groups of [[spinal interneuron]]s.&lt;ref name="Guertin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guertin |first1=PA |title=Central pattern generator for locomotion: anatomical, physiological, and pathophysiological considerations. |journal=Frontiers in Neurology |date=2012 |volume=3 |pages=183 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00183 |pmid=23403923|pmc=3567435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study methods==
{{See also|Neuropsychology|Cognitive neuropsychology}}
Different [[neuroimaging]] techniques have been developed to investigate the activity of neural circuits and networks. The use of "brain scanners" or functional neuroimaging to investigate the structure or function of the brain is common, either as simply a way of better assessing brain injury with high resolution pictures, or by examining the relative activations of different brain areas. Such technologies may include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[brain positron emission tomography]] (brain PET), and [[computed axial tomography]] (CAT) scans. [[Functional neuroimaging]] uses specific brain imaging technologies to take scans from the brain, usually when a person is doing a particular task, in an attempt to understand how the activation of particular brain areas is related to the task. In functional neuroimaging, especially fMRI, which measures [[hemodynamic response|hemodynamic activity]] (using [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent imaging|BOLD-contrast imaging]]) which is closely linked to neural activity, PET, and [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) is used.

[[Connectionism|Connectionist]] models serve as a test platform for different hypotheses of representation, information processing, and signal transmission. Lesioning studies in such models, e.g. [[artificial neural network]]s, where parts of the nodes are deliberately destroyed to see how the network performs, can also yield important insights in the working of several cell assemblies. Similarly, simulations of dysfunctional neurotransmitters in neurological conditions (e.g., dopamine in the basal ganglia of [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] patients) can yield insights into the underlying mechanisms for patterns of cognitive deficits observed in the particular patient group. Predictions from these models can be tested in patients or via pharmacological manipulations, and these studies can in turn be used to inform the models, making the process iterative.

==Clinical significance==
Sometimes neural circuitries can become pathological and cause problems such as in [[Parkinson's disease]] when the [[basal ganglia]] are involved.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=French |first1=IT |last2=Muthusamy |first2=KA |title=A Review of the Pedunculopontine Nucleus in Parkinson's Disease. |journal=Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience |date=2018 |volume=10 |pages=99 |doi=10.3389/fnagi.2018.00099 |pmid=29755338|pmc=5933166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems in the [[Papez circuit]] can also give rise to a number of [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disorders]] including Parkinson's.

The number of (1-form) [[hyperplane]]s intersected by a vector equals the [[inner product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|page=57|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[linear algebra]], a '''one-form''' on a [[vector space]] is the same as a [[linear functional]] on the space.  The usage of ''one-form'' in this context usually distinguishes the one-forms from higher-degree [[multilinear form|multilinear functionals]] on the space.  For details, see [[linear functional]].

In [[differential geometry]], a '''one-form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[cotangent bundle]].  Equivalently, a one-form on a manifold ''M'' is a smooth mapping of the [[total space]] of the [[tangent bundle]] of ''M'' to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; whose restriction to each fibre is a linear functional on the tangent space.  Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha : TM \rightarrow {\mathbb{R}},\quad \alpha_x = \alpha|_{T_xM}: T_xM\rightarrow {\mathbb{R}} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is linear.

Often one-forms are described [[local property|locally]], particularly in [[local coordinates]].  In a local coordinate system, a one-form is a linear combination of the [[exterior derivative|differentials]] of the coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_x = f_1(x) \, dx_1 + f_2(x) \, dx_2+ \cdots +f_n(x) \, dx_n ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are smooth functions. From this perspective, a one-form has a [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] transformation law on passing from one coordinate system to another.  Thus a one-form is an order 1 covariant [[tensor field]].

==Examples==

===Applications===
Many real-world concepts can be described as one-forms:

* Indexing into a vector: The second element of a three-vector is given by the one-form [0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0]. That is, the second element of [''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z''] is

:: [0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0]&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;[''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'']&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''.

* [[Mean]]: The mean element of an ''n''-vector is given by the one-form [1/''n'',&amp;nbsp;1/''n'',&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;1/''n'']. That is,

:: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{mean}(v) = [1/n, 1/n,\dots,1/n]\cdot v.&lt;/math&gt;

* [[Sampling (signal processing)|Sampling]]: Sampling with a kernel can be considered a one-form, where the one-form is the kernel shifted to the appropriate location.
* [[Net present value]] of a net [[cash flow]], ''R''(''t''), is given by the one-form ''w''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''i'' is the [[discount window|discount rate]]. That is,
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}(R(t)) = \langle w, R\rangle = \int_{t=0}^\infty \frac{R(t)}{(1+i)^{t}}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

===Differential===
The most basic non-trivial differential one-form is the "change in angle" form &lt;math&gt;d\theta.&lt;/math&gt; This is defined as the derivative of the angle "function" &lt;math&gt;\theta(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; (which is only defined up to a constant), which can be explicitly defined in terms of the [[atan2]] function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = \operatorname{arctan}(y/x).&lt;/math&gt; Taking the derivative yields the following formula for the [[total derivative]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\theta
&amp;= \partial_x\left(\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)\right) dx + \partial_y\left(\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)\right) dy \\
&amp;= -\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} dx + \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} dy
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
While the angle "function" cannot be continuously defined – the function atan2 is discontinuous along the negative ''y''-axis – which reflects the fact that angle cannot be continuously defined, this derivative is continuously defined except at the origin, reflecting the fact that infinitesimal (and indeed local) ''changes'' in angle can be defined everywhere except the origin. Integrating this derivative along a path gives the total change in angle over the path, and integrating over a closed loop gives the [[winding number]].

In the language of [[differential geometry]], this derivative is a one-form, and it is [[closed differential form|closed]] (its derivative is zero) but not [[exact differential form|exact]] (it is not the derivative of a 0-form, i.e., a function), and in fact it generates the first [[de Rham cohomology]] of the [[punctured plane]]. This is the most basic example of such a form, and it is fundamental in differential geometry.

==Differential of a function==
:{{main|Differential of a function}}
Let &lt;math&gt; U \subseteq \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; be [[open set|open]] (e.g., an interval &lt;math&gt; (a,b) &lt;/math&gt;), and consider a [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt; f: U \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;, with [[derivative]] ''f'''. The differential ''df'' of ''f'', at a point &lt;math&gt; x_0\in U &lt;/math&gt;, is defined as a certain [[linear map]] of the variable ''dx''. Specifically, &lt;math&gt;df(x_0, dx): dx \mapsto f'(x_0) dx &lt;/math&gt;. (The meaning of the symbol ''dx'' is thus revealed: it is simply an argument, or independent variable, of the function ''df''.) Hence the map &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto df(x,dx) &lt;/math&gt; sends each point ''x'' to a linear functional ''df(x,dx)''. This is the simplest example of a differential (one-)form.

In terms of the [[de Rham]] complex, one has an assignment from [[zero-form]]s (scalar functions) to one-forms i.e., &lt;math&gt;f\mapsto df&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Overton Window diagram.svg |thumb|right|An illustration of the Overton Window, along with Treviño's degrees of acceptance]]
The '''Overton window''', also known as the '''window of discourse''', describes the range of ideas tolerated in [[public sphere|public discourse]]. The term is derived from its originator, [[Joseph P. Overton]], a former vice president of the [[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]], who, in his description of his window, claimed that an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within the window, rather than on politicians' individual preferences.&lt;ref name="mackinac2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/bio.aspx?ID=12 |title=Joseph Overton biography and article index |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mackinac1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/12887 |title=A Brief Explanation of the Overton Window |last=Lehman |first=Joseph  |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Overton's description, his window includes a range of policies considered politically acceptable in the current climate of [[public opinion]], which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme to gain or keep public office.

==Summary==
Overton described a spectrum from "more free" to "less free" with regard to government intervention, oriented vertically on an axis, to avoid comparison with the left-right political spectrum.&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mackinac.org/11398 |title=Glenn Beck Highlights Mackinac Center's "Overton Window" |last=Lehman |first=Joseph G. |date=November 23, 2009 |publisher=[[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] |access-date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the spectrum moves or expands, an idea at a given location may become more or less politically acceptable. Political commentator [[Joshua Treviño]] postulated that the degrees of acceptance of public ideas are roughly:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/5/9/205251/2950 |title=Why the Right-Wing Gets It--and Why Dems Don't [UPDATED] |last=thereisnospoon |date=May 10, 2006 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unthinkable
* Radical
* Acceptable
* Sensible
* Popular
* Policy

The Overton window is an approach to identifying which ideas define the domain of acceptability within a democracy's possible governmental policies. Proponents of policies outside the window seek to convince or persuade the public in order to move and/or expand the window. Proponents of current policies, or similar ones, within the window seek to convince people that policies outside it should be deemed unacceptable.

After Overton's death, others have examined the concept of adjusting the window by the deliberate promotion of ideas outside of it, or "outer fringe" ideas, with the intention of making less fringe ideas acceptable by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2009/11/5/800804/-Morning-Feature:-Crazy-Like-a-Fox |title=Morning Feature: Crazy Like a Fox? |last=NCrissieB |date=November 5, 2009 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[door-in-the-face technique|"door-in-the-face" technique]] of persuasion is similar.

==Historical precedents==
{{original research|section|date=March 2017}}
The idea echoes several earlier expressions, the most recent and similarly academic being [[Hallin's spheres]]. In his 1986 book ''The Uncensored War'',&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Uncensored War: The Media and Vietnam.|last=Hallin|first=Daniel|publisher=Oxford University press|year=1986|isbn=978-0-19-503814-9|location=New York|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; communication scholar Daniel C. Hallin posits three areas of media coverage into which a topic may fall. The areas are diagrammed as concentric circles called spheres. From innermost to outermost they are the sphere of consensus, the sphere of legitimate controversy, and the sphere of deviance. Proposals and positions can be placed at varying degrees of distance from the metaphorical center, and political actors can fight over and help change these positions.

Hallin's theory is developed and applied primarily as a theory that explains varying levels of objectivity in media coverage, but it also accounts for the ongoing contest among media and other political actors about what counts as legitimate disagreement, potentially leading to changes in the boundaries between spheres. As one study that applies Hallin's theory explains, "the borders between the three spheres are dynamic, depending on the political climate and on the editorial line of the various media outlets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Figenschou |first=Tine Ustad |last2=Beyer |first2=Audun |date=October 2014 |title=The Limits of the Debate How the Oslo Terror Shook the Norwegian Immigration Debate |url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/19/4/430.short |journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics |volume=19 |issue=4 |page=435 |doi=10.1177/1940161214542954}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the idea also captures the tug-of-war over the boundaries between normal and deviant political discourse.

An idea similar to the Overton window was expressed by [[Anthony Trollope]] in 1868 in his novel ''[[Phineas Finn]]'':

{{quote|"Many who before regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical, will now fancy that it is only dangerous, or perhaps not more than difficult. And so in time it will come to be looked on as among the things possible, then among the things probable;—and so at last it will be ranged in the list of those few measures which the country requires as being absolutely needed. That is the way in which public opinion is made."

"It is no loss of time," said Phineas, "to have taken the first great step in making it."

"The first great step was taken long ago," said Mr. Monk,—"taken by men who were looked upon as revolutionary demagogues, almost as traitors, because they took it. But it is a great thing to take any step that leads us onwards."}}

In his "West India Emancipation" speech at Canandaigua, New York, in 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/1857-frederick-douglass-if-there-no-struggle-there-no-progress |title=(1857) Frederick Douglass, "If There Is No Struggle, There Is No Progress" |website=The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |language=en |access-date=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] leader [[Frederick Douglass]] described how public opinion limits the ability of those in power to act with impunity:

{{quote|Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.}}

'''Persiankiwi''' is a user of the [[microblogging|microblog]] service [[Twitter]], who was one of the most followed sources of information about the [[2009 Iranian election protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/5549955/Iran-protest-news-travels-fast-and-far-on-Twitter.html Iran protest news travels fast and far on Twitter] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 16 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Persiankiwi was also referred to as a "popular opposition site,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/world/middleeast/17media.html?ref=technology Washington Taps Into a Potent New Force in Diplomacy] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 17 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of the most reliable and prolific Iranians on Twitter."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/27/iran-uprising-live-bloggi_n_221809.html "PersianKiwi" reportedly arrested] ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post, a leading news source on the 2009 Iranian election protests]]'' 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Persiankiwi attracted readers due to an authentic style, lack of aggressiveness, and up-to-date information apparently coming directly from [[Tehran]]. When most foreign journalists had left the country and Iranian state media outlets were thought to be biased in favor of their own government, Persiankiwi became one of the most important sources of information from inside Iran and was frequently cited in media reports around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/203953/page/1 A Twitter Timeline of the Iran Election] ''[[Newsweek]]'' 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonindependent.com/48301/iran-re-vote-ruled-out Iran Re-Vote Ruled Out] ''[[Center for Independent Media|Washington Independent]]'' 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/06/persiankiwis-recent-tweets.html Persiankiwi's Recent Tweets] ''[[The Atlantic]]'' 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/twitter/5561919/Iran-elections-protesters-use-Twitter-for-updates.html Iran elections: protesters use Twitter for updates] [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph.co.uk]] 17 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Persiankiwi's tweets temporarily stopped on  June 24, 2009 after describing a violent confrontation between protestors and the [[Basij]] militia.  It read "[[Allah]] - you are the creator of all and all must return to you - Allah Akbar," sparking concern about the fate of the person behind the username.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heute.de/ZDFheute/inhalt/22/0,3672,7599574,00.html Iranischer Twitterer verstummt] ''[[ZDF|German state TV ZDF]]'' 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw-world.com%2Fdw%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C4437635%2C00.html&amp;sl=fa&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0= رو به راهی؟] ''[[Deutsche Welle|Deutsche Welle, translated from Persian to English by Google]]'' 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumors arose that Persiankiwi had been arrested, or had been forced to post news under a new alias due to a compromised account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/27/iran-uprising-live-bloggi_n_221809.html "PersianKiwi" reportedly arrested]''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post, a leading news source on the 2009 Iranian election protests]]'' 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Persiankiwi resumed tweeting on February 14, 2011.  Twitter user Oxfordgirl told several of her followers that she was awaiting a confirmation from persiankiwi to verify his or her identity.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The identity and location of the person behind Persiankiwi have not been made public. The user's anonymity prevents a clear picture from being drawn, but efforts have been made to analyze the writing style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/politik/nahost/artikel/1/wo-ist-persiankiwi/ Wo ist persiankiwi?] ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Persiankiwi should not be confused with ''Persiankiwie'' who for a while posed as Persiankiwi on Twitter. Warnings went out on Twitter that ''Persiankiwie'' was a government operative and shortly afterwards this profile disappeared from Twitter.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In 1671 an argument broke out in the French [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] in Paris about whether drawing or color was more important in painting. On one side stood the '''Poussinists''' (Fr. ''Poussinistes'') who were a group of French artists, named after the painter [[Nicolas Poussin]], who believed that drawing was the most important thing.&lt;ref name=BritP&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/473126/Poussinist Poussinist] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side were the '''Rubenists''' (Fr. ''Rubénistes''), named after [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who prioritize color.&lt;ref name=BritR&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511893/Rubenist Rubenist] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong nationalistic flavour to the debate as Poussin was French but Rubens was [[Flemish]], though neither was alive at the time. After over forty years the final resolution of the matter in favor of the Rubenists was signalled when [[Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau's]] ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'' was accepted as his [[reception piece]] by the French Academy in 1717.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt; By that time the French [[Rococo]] was in full swing.

==The argument==
The Poussinists believed in the [[Platonic realism|Platonic]] idea of the existence in the mind of ideal objects that could be reconstructed in concrete form by the selection, using reason, of elements from nature. For the Poussinists, therefore, color was a purely decorative addition to form and drawing (design or ''[[disegno]]''), the use of line to depict form, was the essential skill of painting. Their leader was [[Charles Lebrun]]&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 609. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; (died 1690), Director of the Academy, and their heroes were [[Raphael]], [[the Carracci]], and Poussin himself&lt;ref name=BritP/&gt; whose severe and stoical works exemplified their philosophy. Their touchstones were the forms of classical art.
[[Image:Peter Paul Rubens 083.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt|Hippopotamus Hunt]]'', Rubens, 1616.]]
They were opposed by the Rubenists who believed that colour, not drawing, was superior as it was more true to nature.&lt;ref name=Janson/&gt; Their models were the works of Rubens who had prioritised the accurate depiction of nature over the imitation of classical art. The Rubenists argued that the aim of painting was to deceive the eye by creating an imitation of nature.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt; Drawing, according to the Rubenists, although based on reason, appealed only to a few experts whereas colour could be enjoyed by everyone. The ideas of the Rubenists therefore had revolutionary political connotations as they elevated the position of the lay person and challenged the idea that had held sway since the [[Renaissance]] that painting, as a [[Liberal arts education|liberal art]], could only be appreciated by the educated mind.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 604. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1672, [[Charles Le Brun]], Chancellor of the French Academy, attempted to halt the argument by stating officially that "the function of colour is to satisfy the eyes, whereas drawing satisfies the mind."&lt;ref name=BritP/&gt; He failed, and the debate was continued in the pamphlets of [[Roger de Piles]], who favoured the colourists and set out the arguments in his 1673 ''Dialogue sur le Coloris'' (Dialogue on Colour), and his 1677 ''Conversations sur la Peinture'' (Conversations on Painting).

The argument was similar to the argument over the merits of ''disegno'' and ''colore'' in Italy in the fifteenth century but with a particularly French character as the importance of drawing was one of the key tenets of the French Academy and any attack on it was effectively an attack on everything the Academy stood for, including its political functions in support of the King.
 
To a certain extent, the debate was simply about whether it was acceptable to paint purely in order to give pleasure to the viewer without the nobler purposes typical of a "history" painting.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;Levey, Michael. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700-1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 1. {{ISBN|0300064942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
[[Image:L'Embarquement pour Cythere, by Antoine Watteau, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|Watteau's ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'', 1717.]] 
A success for the Rubenists was achieved when Roger de Piles was elected a member (as an amateur) of the French Academy in 1699 and the final signal that the Rubenists had won came when [[Antoine Watteau]]'s ''The Embarkation for Cythera'' was accepted as his reception piece by the Academy in 1717.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt;

Watteau's acceptance was, however, perhaps not everything that he could have hoped for. When he applied to join the Academy, there was no suitable category for his ''[[fête galante]]'' works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application, describing him as a "peintre des festes galantes".&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred, S. (Ed.) (2011) ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A global history''.  Enhanced 13th edn. Boston: Wadsworth, p. 755. {{ISBN|978-0-495-79986-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, M. &amp; D. (2010) "fête galante" in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms''. oxfordreference.com, [[Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While this acknowledged Watteau as the originator of that genre, and was a significant mark of acceptance both of him and his style of painting, it also prevented him being recognised as a [[History painting|history painter]], the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, tellingly said: "The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Wine and Annie Scottez-De Wambrechies. "Watteau" in ''Grove Art Online''. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T090852pg1 oxfordartonline.com] Oxford University Press. Retrieved 8 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watteau is considered the greatest of the Rubenist artists. Other important Rubenists include [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]. [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] benefited from the new found interest in [[still-life]] and [[genre painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1995, p. 607.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The debate and the overlapping development of the Rococo in eighteenth century France have been seen as a form of revival. [[Michael Levey]] has pointed out that it was during the seventeenth century that the new categories of [[Genre art|genre]], [[Landscape art|landscape]] and still life had become established with their emphasis on the observation of nature, and therefore the arguments of the Rubenists amounted to a revival of existing traditions of naturalism and a call for a greater discipline in painting rather than representing an attitude of general licence or ''laissez faire'' as is sometimes assumed.&lt;ref name=Lev/&gt;

The argument also took place during the beginning of the [[Enlightenment Era|Enlightenment]] and the Rubenists found support in [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) which argued that all ideas derived from experience and that none were innate. [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] observed that what was comprehended through the mind paled compared to what was apprehended through the senses.&lt;ref name=HF/&gt;

'''Pratigha''' (Sanskrit; Pali: paṭigha; Tibetan Wylie: ''khong khro'') is a [[Buddhist]] term that is translated as "anger". It is defined as a hostile attitude towards sentient beings, towards frustration, and towards that which gives rise to one's frustrations; it functions as a basis for faultfinding, for negative actions, and for not finding a moment of peace or happiness.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 728-729.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
''Pratigha'' is identified as:
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Six root unwholesome factors|six root unwholesome mental factors]] within the Mahayana [[Abhidharma]] tradition
* One of the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|ten fetters]] in the Theravada tradition (according to the [[Dhammasangani]])

==Definitions==

===Theravada===
Patigha (Pali) is defined by Theravada sources as: anger, repulsion, collision;&lt;ref name=bd1&gt;[http://dictionary.buddhistdoor.com/en/word/4049/patigha A.P. Buddhadatta Mahathera, Concise Pali-English and English-Pali Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; animosity; irritation; indignation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistteachings.org/buddhadhamma-translations-2/publications/awakened-beings?doing_wp_cron Venerable Ajahn Payutto (Phra Payutto), Awakened Beings, section "Eight Noble Beings"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyanatiloka Mahatheran provides the following definition:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.buddhistdoor.com/en/word/4049/patigha, Buddhist Door, Buddhist Dictionary, entry for "paṭigha"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# In an ethical sense, it means: 'repugnance', grudge, resentment, anger, and is a synonym of byāpāda, 'ill-will' (s. nīvaraṇa) and dosa, 'hate' (s. mūla). It is one of the proclivities (anusaya, q.v.).
# '(Sense-) reaction'. Applied to five-sense cognition, p. occurs in the following contexts:
::(a) as paṭigha-saññā, 'perception of sense-reaction', said to be absent in the immaterial absorptions (s. jhāna 5). Alternative renderings: resistance-perception, reflex-perception;
::(b) as paṭigha-samphassa, '(mental) impression caused by 5fold sensorial reaction' (D. 15); s. phassa;
::(c) as Sappaṭigha-rūpa, 'reacting corporeality', and appaṭigha, 'not reacting', which is an Abhidhammic classification of corporeality, occurring in Dhs. 659, 1050. Sappaṭigha are called the physical sense-organs as reacting (or responding) to sense stimuli; and also the physical sense-objects as impinging (or making an impact) on the sense-organs. All other corporeality is appaṭigha, non-reacting and non-impinging. These 2 terms have been variously rendered as resistant and not, responding and not, with and without impact.

===Mahayana===
The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 
:What is pratigha? It is ill-will with regard to living beings, with regard to suffering and with regard to things pertaining to suffering. Its function is to produce a basis for unhappy states and bad conduct.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula (2007), Kindle Locations 757-759.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] states that ''pratigha'' is aimed at "another limited being, one's own suffering, or situations entailing suffering". This involves being impatient with the objects of the ''pratigha'' (''anger''), and wishing to get rid of them, for example, by striking out against them and harming them. It is based on regarding the object as unattractive or repulsive by its very nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html#xanger Berzin Archives glossary entry for "anger"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Berzin identifies ''[[dvesha]]'' (aversion) as a subcategory of ''pratigha'' (anger) that is directed primarily, although not exclusively, at limited beings.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8974">'''Rabin fairness''' is a fairness model invented by [[Matthew Rabin]]. It goes beyond the standard assumptions in modeling behavior, rationality and self-interest, to incorporate fairness.&lt;ref&gt;Camerer, Colin &amp; Thaler, Richard H. 2003. "[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533003769204407 In Honor of Matthew Rabin: Winner of the John Bates Clark Medal]." ''Journal of Economic Perspectives.'' 17, 159-176&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin's fairness model incorporates findings from the fields of economics and psychology fields to provide an alternative utility model. Fairness is one type of [[social preferences|social preference]].

==Including fairness in the standard utility model==
Past utility models incorporated altruism or the fact that people may care not only about their own well-being, but also about the well-being of others. However, evidence indicates that pure altruism does not occur often, contrarily most altruistic behavior demonstrates three facts (as defined by Rabin) and these facts are proven by past events.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, Matthew. 1993. "[https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt3s87d1tm/qt3s87d1tm.pdf Incorporating Fairness Into Game Theory and Economics]." ''The American Economic Review.''83, 1281-1302.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the existence of these three facts, Rabin created a utility function that incorporates fairness.:
# People are willing to sacrifice their own material well-being to help those who are being kind.
## The attempt to provide public goods without coercion departs from pure self-interest.
## Experiments show that people cooperate to contribute toward a public good to a degree greater than would be implied by pure self-interest.  Individually optimal contribution rates, as defined by the standard utility model, are close to 0 percent.
## During an experiment, the willingness for an individual to contribute to a public good is highly contingent on the behavior of others.
# People are willing to sacrifice their own material well-being to punish those who are being unkind.
## Evidence provided by the [[ultimatum game]], consisting of two people, a proposer and decider, splitting a fixed amount of money.  The proposer offers a division of the money, then the decider decides if he or she refuses or accepts the proposal.  If the decider says yes, they split the money according to the proposer's offer, but if the decider says no, neither person gets any money.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, Richard H., "[http://www.economiapsicologica.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/thaler-mental-accounting-and-consumer-choice.pdf Mental Accounting and Consumer Choice]," ''Marketing Science,'' Summer 1985, ''4'', 199-214.&lt;/ref&gt;
## Standard utility model would find that any offer proposed to the decider should be expected if it is greater than zero because utility should increase with any increase in income. Along the same lines, the standard utility model would predict that the  proposer would offer the smallest amount of money possible to the decider in order to maximize his or her own utility
## However, data shows that deciders are willing to punish any unfair offer and proposers tend to make fair offers.
# Both motivations 1 and 2 have a greater effect on behavior as the material cost of sacrificing becomes smaller.

==Rabin's fairness model==
Rabin formalized fairness using a two-person, modified [[game theory]] matrix with two decisions (a two by two matrix), where i is the person whose utility is being measured. Furthermore, within the game theory matrix payoffs for each person are allocated.  The following formula was created by Rabin to model utility to include fairness:

&lt;math&gt;U_i(a_i, b_j, c_i) = \pi_i(a_i, b_j) + f_j(b_j, c_i) * [1+f_i(a_i, b_j)].&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
# a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents player i's strategy, b&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; represents player i's belief about what player j's strategy will be, and c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents what player i's beliefs about player j's beliefs about player i's strategy.
## Although this seems complicated, a is simply player i's strategy, b is player j's strategy given how he/she believes player i will act, and c is player i's decision given what strategy player j is believed to partake in. 
## In the game below, a, b, and c, will all take the form of either Grab or Share and then the payoffs would be determined and placed into Rabin's Fairness Model.
# &lt;math&gt;\pi_i(a_i, b_j)&lt;/math&gt; represents the payoffs player i receives
# Player i's kindness to player j is given by: &lt;math&gt;f_i(a_i, b_j) = [\pi_j(b_j, a_i) - \pi_j^e(b_j)]/[\pi_j^h(b_j) - \pi_j^\text{min}(b_j)]&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\pi_j^e(b_j)= [\pi_j^h(b_j)+ \pi_j^l(b_j)]/2,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi_j^h(b_j)&lt;/math&gt; is player j's highest payoff and &lt;math&gt;\pi_j^l(b_j)&lt;/math&gt; is player j's lowest payoff among points that are [[Pareto efficient]]
## &lt;math&gt;\pi_j^\text{min}(b_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the worst possible payoff in the matrix for player j
# Player i's belief about how kind player j is being to him is given by: &lt;math&gt;f_j(b_j, c_i) = [\pi_i(c_i, b_j) - \pi_i^e(c_i)]/[\pi_j^h(c_i) - \pi_j^\text{min}(c_i)]&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\pi_i^\text{min}(c_i)&lt;/math&gt; is player i's worst possible payoff
## &lt;math&gt;\pi_i^e(c_i)= [\pi_i^h(c_i)+ \pi_i^l(c_i)]/2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi_i^h(c_i)&lt;/math&gt; is player j's highest payoff and &lt;math&gt;\pi_{i^l}(c_i)&lt;/math&gt; is player i's lowest payoff among points that are Pareto efficient
# The two functions above can now specify player's preferences.  Player i chooses a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to maximize the expected utility of &lt;math&gt;U_i(a_i, b_j, c_i)&lt;/math&gt;

===Fairness model implications===
The fairness model implies that if player j is treating player i badly, if &lt;math&gt;f_j(b_j, c_i) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then player i wishes to treat player j badly as well by choosing an action, a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, that is low or negative.  However, if player j is treating player i kindly, &lt;math&gt;f_j(b_j, c_i) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then player i will act kindly towards player j, as well (For more in depth examples see Rabin (1993)).

==Welfare and fairness: an application==
Rabin also used the fairness model as a utility function to determine [[social welfare]]. Rabin used a game theory "Grabbing Game" which posited that there are two people shopping, with two cans of soup left.  The payoffs for each are given as follows, where player i's payoffs are on the left of each pair and player j's payoffs are on the right of each pair:

{| class="wikitable"
!             !! Grab   !! Share
|-
|  '''Grab''' ||  x, x  || 2x, 0
|-
| '''Share''' ||  0, 2x ||  x, x
|}

If both grab or both share, each player i and j get one can of soup.  However, one grabs, and the other does not, then the person who grabbed gets both cans of soup.  There is a [[Nash Equilibrium]] present of (grab, grab).  Moreover, applying Rabin's fairness model (grab, grab) will always be a fairness equilibrium but for small values of x the cooperative choice (share, share) will Pareto dominate (grab, grab).  The reasoning behind this is that if the two people both grab for and therefore fight over the cans, the angriness and bad tempers that arise are likely to outweigh the importance of receiving the cans.  Therefore, while (Grab, Grab) and (Share, Share) are fairness equilibria when material payoffs are small, (Share, Share) will dominate (Grab, Grab) since people are affected by the kindness, which increases utility, or unkindness, which decreases utility, of others.  This example could be generalized further to describe the allocation of public goods.&lt;ref&gt;Souten, J., DeCremer, D., &amp; van Dijk, Erik. 2006. "[https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Stouten2006VEISD.pdf Violating Equality in Social Dilemmas: Emotional and Retributive Reactions as a Function of Trust, Attribution, and Honesty]." ''Personality &amp; social psychology bulletin. 32,'' 894-906.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public goods provision and fairness===
Stouten (2006) further generalized the principle of fairness to be applied to the provision of public goods. He and his colleagues ran three experiments to find how participants reacted when one member of their group violated the equality rule, which states that all group members will coordinate to equally and fairly contribute to the efficient provision of public goods. Their findings demonstrated that the participants believed that the equality rule should be applied to others and therefore when one person violated this rule punishment was used against this person, in terms of negative reactions. Therefore, the equality rule applied in real life situations should lead to the efficient provision of public goods if violations of the important coordination and fairness rules can be detected. However, often these violations cannot be detected which then leads to the [[free rider problem]] and an under-provision of public goods.

The '''race to the bottom''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] phrase which is used to describe government [[deregulation]] of the business environment, or reduction in tax rates, in order to attract or retain economic activity in their jurisdictions. An outcome of [[globalization]] and [[free trade]], the phenomenon may occur when competition increases between geographic areas over a particular sector of trade and production.&lt;ref name="Economist 2013"&gt;{{cite news|author1=C.W.|title=Racing to the bottom |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/labour-standards |accessdate=15 March 2016|work=[[The Economist]] |date=27 November 2013 |quote=But the race to the bottom operates more subtly than most people suppose. The regressions suggest that while countries do compete with each other by instituting laws that are unfriendly to workers, such competition is not that pronounced. The real problem is that countries compete by enforcing labour laws less vigorously than they might—leading to increases in violations of labour rights prescribed in local laws. Competition between countries to attract investment is less in rules than in their practical application.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal effect and intent of these actions is to make labor rates "more competitive" (i.e. lower), the principal cost of business, together with other factors (pensions, environmental protection and other [[externalities]]),  and thus the metaphor where the bottom is the lowest wage that can be paid for that labor.

==History and usage==
The concept of a regulatory "race to the bottom" emerged in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th century, when there was charter competition among states to attract corporations to domicile in their jurisdiction. Some described the concept as the "race to efficiency", and others, such as Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], as the "race to the bottom".&lt;ref name = "coined" /&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[joint-stock company]] control was being liberalised in Europe, where countries were engaged in competitive liberal legislation to allow local companies to compete. This liberalization reached Spain in 1869, Germany in 1870, Belgium in 1873, and Italy in 1883. In 1890, [[New Jersey]] enacted a liberal corporation charter, which charged low fees for company registration and lower [[franchise tax]]es than other states. [[Delaware]] attempted to [[Delaware corporation|copy the law to attract companies]] to its own state. This competition ended when Governor [[Woodrow Wilson]] tightened New Jersey's laws through a series of seven statutes.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg NJ Del."&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robert E. Wright|title=How Delaware Became the King of U.S. Corporate Charters|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-06-08/how-delaware-became-the-king-of-u-s-corporate-charters|accessdate=15 March 2016| work=Bloomberg View |date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic literature, the phenomenon of regulatory competition reducing standards overall was argued for by A.A. Berle and G.C. Means in ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932), while the concept received formal recognition by the [[US Supreme Court]] in a decision of Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] in the 1933 case ''[[Ligget Co. v. Lee]]'' (288 U.S. 517, 558–559).&lt;ref name = "coined"&gt;{{cite book| last =Meisel| first =Nicolas| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2004| title =Governance Culture and Development: A Different Perspective on Corporate Governance | publisher =Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| location =| isbn = 92-64-01727-5 }} p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ind"&gt;{{cite book| last =Kelly| first =John E.| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2002| title =Industrial Relations: critical perspectives on business and management | publisher =Routledge| location =UK| isbn = 0-415-22986-3 }} p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "sch"&gt;{{cite book| last =Schram| first =Sanford F.| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2000| title =After Welfare: The Culture of Postindustrial Social Policy | publisher =NYU Press| location =| isbn = 0-8147-9755-5 }} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandeis's "race to the bottom" metaphor was updated in 1974 by [[William L. Cary|William Cary]], in an article in the [[Yale Law Journal]], "Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections Upon Delaware," in which Carey argued for the imposition of national standards for [[corporate governance]].

Sanford F. Schram explained in 2000 that the term "race to the bottom":

{{cquote|...has for some time served as an important metaphor to illustrate that the United States federal system—and every federal system for that matter—is vulnerable to interstate competition. The "race to the bottom" implies that the states compete with each other as each tries to underbid the others in lowering taxes, spending, regulation...so as to make itself more attractive to outside financial interests or unattractive to unwanted outsiders. It can be opposed to the alternative metaphor of "[[Laboratories of democracy|Laboratories of Democracy]]". The laboratory metaphor implies a more sanguine federalism in which [states] use their authority and discretion to develop innovative and creative solutions to common problems which can be then adopted by other states.&lt;ref name = "sch" /&gt;}}

The term has also been used to describe a similar type of competition between corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.popularresistance.org/walmart-creates-a-race-to-the-bottom-throughout-the-supplyline/ |work=Popular Resistance |author=Charles Fishman |date=November 27, 2013 |title=Walmart Creates A Race To The Bottom Throughout The Economy}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/24/taskrabbit-uber-economy_n_6538540.html |work=Huffington Post |author=Alexis Kleinman |date=Jan 24, 2015 |title=How The Uber Economy Can Become A Race To The Bottom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, in response to reports that British supermarkets had cut the price of [[banana]]s, and by implication had squeezed revenues of banana-growing developing nations, Alistair Smith, international co-coordinator of Banana Link, said "The British supermarkets are leading a race to the bottom. Jobs are being lost and producers are having to pay less attention to social and environmental agreements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=N/A |newspaper=[[The Times]] |department=Business Section |date=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Another example is the cruise industry, which registers its ship with flags of convenience, circumventing wage requirements, and other expenses required by developed countries, thus providing the business model for the industry.&lt;ref name="Cruise Ships"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Elizabeth Becker|title=Destination Nowhere: The Dark Side of the Cruise Industry|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2014/04/17/health-and-family/travel/the-dark-side-of-the-cruise-ship-industry.html|accessdate=15 March 2016 |work=The Saturday Evening Post |date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used in the context of a trend for some European states to seize refugees' assets.&lt;ref name="Newsweek Refugees"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Josh Lowe|title=U.N. Slams 'Race To The Bottom' On Refugee Cash |url=http://www.newsweek.com/un-slams-race-bottom-refugee-cash-denmark-germany-switzerland-418278 |accessdate=15 March 2016| work=Newsweek |date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental policy ==
The race to the bottom has been a tactic widely used among states within the United States of America. The race to the bottom in environmental policy involves both scaling back policies already in place and passing new policies that encourage less environmentally friendly behavior. Some states use this as an economic development strategy, especially in times of financial hardship.  For example, in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker decreased state environmental staff’s capacity in order to accelerate the approval time for a proposed development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Environmental policy : new directions for the twenty-first century |last1=Vig |first1=Norman J. |last2=Kraft |first2=Michael E. |isbn=9781506383460 |edition=10th |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=CQ Press, an imprint of SAGE Publications, Inc. |year=2019 |oclc=1005057455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuing a race to the bottom philosophy in environmental politics allows states to foster economic growth, but has great consequences for the environment of that state. Conversely, some states have begun to pursue a race to the top strategy, which stresses innovative environmental policies at the state level, with the hopes that these policies will later be adopted by other states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When a state pursues either a race to the bottom or a race to the top strategy, it speaks to its overall environmental agenda.

'''Rammed earth''', also known as '''''taipa'''''&lt;ref name="Pev"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleming |first1=John |authorlink1=John Fleming (art historian)|last2=Honour |first2=Hugh |authorlink2=Hugh Honour |last3=Pevsner |first3=Nikolaus |authorlink3=Nikolaus Pevsner |others=drawings by David Etherton |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture |date=1966 |edition=1st |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=London, England, UK and New York, New York, USA |isbn=978-0-14-051241-0 |oclc=638962596}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Portuguese, '''''tapial''''' or '''''tapia''''' in Spanish, '''''pisé (de terre)''''' in French, and '''''hangtu''''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|夯土}}|p=hāngtǔ}}), is a technique for [[construction|constructing]] foundations, floors, and walls using natural raw materials such as [[soil|earth]], [[chalk]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], or [[gravel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pise |title=Pisé terminology |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ancient method that has been revived recently as a [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[building material]] used in a technique of [[natural building]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Rammed earth is simple to manufacture, non-combustible, [[Thermal mass|thermally massive]], strong, and durable. However, structures such as walls can be laborious to construct of rammed earth without machinery, e. g., powered tampers, and they are susceptible to water damage if inadequately protected or maintained.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in a range of environments including temperate, wet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-CAT-lecture-theatre.htm |title=Rammed Earth Lecture Theatre, CAT |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a [[architecture|building design]] appropriate for local [[climate|climatic conditions]] are the factors that favour its use.

==Composition and use==
{{Original research | section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Tapialdebarro.jpg|thumb|left|Model of construction of a wall of rammed earth on a foundation]]
Manufacturing rammed earth involves compressing a damp mixture of [[soil|earth]] that has suitable proportions of [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and/or an added stabilizer into an externally supported frame or mold, forming either a solid wall or individual blocks. Historically, additives such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or animal blood were used to stabilize it,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} while modern construction adds [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], or [[asphalt]] emulsions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} To add variety, some modern builders also add coloured oxides or other materials, e.g. bottles, tires, or pieces of timber.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the "[[formwork]]", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork to a depth of {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the [[formwork]]. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing [[pneumatic]]ally powered tampers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Paderne Morrish Castle 26 Nov 2007 (6).JPG|thumb|right|Taipa fortifications at [[Paderne Castle]] in the Algarve, Portugal]]

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression, because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Construction is optimally done in warm weather so that the walls can dry and harden.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[compression strength]] of the rammed earth increases as it cures; some time is necessary for it to dry and as long as two years can be necessary for complete curing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Exposed walls must be sealed to prevent water damage.

In modern variations of the technique, rammed-earth walls are constructed on top of conventional [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]] or a [[reinforced concrete]] slab base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Where blocks made of rammed earth are used, they are generally stacked like regular blocks and are bonded together with a thin mud slurry instead of cement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Special machines, usually powered by small engines and often portable, are used to compress the material into blocks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Presently more than 30% of the world's population uses earth as a building material.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Rammed earth has been used globally in a wide range of climatic conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed-earth housing may resolve homelessness caused by otherwise expensive construction techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Qualities ==
[[File:Rammed earth wall surface.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the surface of a rammed-earth wall: apart from the patches of damage, the surface shows regular horizontal lines caused by the wooden [[formwork]] and subtler horizontal strata from successive courses.]]

The [[compressive strength]] of rammed earth is a maximum of {{convert|4.3|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. This is less than that of [[concrete]] but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.ashlandctc.org/jnapora/hum-faculty/syllabi/trad.html |title=A Traditional Research Paper: Rammed Earth Construction |first=Robert O. |last=Cassell  |work=Ashland  Community  and Technical College|date= 17 December 2001 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rammedearthconstructions.com.au/index.php?mp_id=5 |title=BENEFITS OF BUILDING IN RAMMED EARTH |work=Rammed Earth Constructions |publisher=Rammed Earth Constructions P/L |location=[[Maleny]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rammed earth reinforced with [[rebar]], wood, or [[bamboo]] can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See [[1960 Agadir earthquake]] for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.&lt;ref name="USDA Farmer Bulletin 1500"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 1500: Rammed Earth Walls for Buildings - Rammed Earth Books - The Boden Hauser |first1=Morris Cotgrave |last1=Betts |first2=Thomas Arrington Huntington |last2=Miller |work=The Boden Hauser |page=20 |date=May 1937 |origyear=1925 |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |oclc=600507592 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224741/http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }} Originally published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Washington, DC, USA.

Soil is a widely available, inexpensive, and [[sustainable]] resource.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earth.sustainablesources.com/#Soils |title=Soils for Rammed Earth, Caliche Block, and Soil Material Construction |publisher=Sustainable Sources |location=Austin, TX, USA| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable.{{vague|date=July 2017|reason=Viable in what sense? Compared to what? Under which circumstances?}} Unskilled labour can do most of the necessary work.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated [[formwork]] it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a {{convert|200|to|220|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} house.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high [[thermal mass]]: like [[brick]] or [[concrete]], it can absorb heat during daytime and nocturnally release it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for [[air conditioning]] and [[heating]]. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated with [[Styrofoam]] or a similar insert. It must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthstructures.com.au/rammed-earth-construction/ |title=Rammed Earth Construction |work=Earth Structures |location=Victoria, Australia |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%, which is the ideal range for [[asthma]] sufferers{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and for the storage of susceptible objects such as books.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices, which avoids problems of condensation but prevents significant loss of heat.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Untouched, rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are avoided because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Well-cured walls accept nails and screws easily, and can be effectively patched with the same material used to build them.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.

The thickness, typically {{convert|30|to|35|cm|in}}, and [[density]] of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for [[soundproofing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are also inherently [[fireproof]], resistant to [[termite]] damage, and non-toxic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Environmental effects and sustainability ==

[[File:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|left|Rammed-earth [[trombe wall]] constructed by [[Design Build Bluff]]]]

Edifices of rammed earth are thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than popular techniques of construction. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low [[embodied energy]] and generate very little waste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The soils used are typically [[subsoil]]s low in [[clay]], between 5% and 15%,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which conserve the [[topsoil]] for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid masonry edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than "earth".

[[Formwork]] is removable and can be reused, reducing the need for lumber.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html |title=Natural Building Colloquium: Compressed Earth Blocks |first=Wayne |last=Nelson |publisher=NetWorks Productions |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy and humidity regulation because manufacture of the cement itself adds to the global carbon dioxide burden at a rate of 1.25 tonnes per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-cement-co2.htm |title=Rammed Earth – Pollution and Cement |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial substitution of cement with alternatives such as [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]] has not been demonstrated to be effective, and implicates other questions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |title=Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |location=Washington, DC, USA |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for [[passive solar]] heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Rammed-earth construction may also reduce the ecological impacts of [[deforestation]] and the toxicity of artificial materials associated with conventional construction techniques.

Although it has low [[greenhouse emission]]s in theory, [[transportation]] and the production of [[cement]] can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

== History ==
[[File:JiayuguanWall.jpg|thumb|right|A ''taipa'' section of the [[Great Wall of China]]]]
[[File:Grange.Bassey.Saint.Nicolas.Macherin.jpg|thumb|right|Rammed-earth edifice on a farm in [[France]]]]

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in [[Neolithic]] archaeological  sites of the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]], dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 ''Hāng tǔ'') were commonly used for walls and foundations in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Xujie Liu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Xujie |first=Liu  |editor1-first=Nancy Shatzman |editor1-last=Steinhardt  |display-authors=etal  |title=Chinese Architecture |publisher=New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press and Beijing, China: New World Press |date=2002 |pages = 12–14, 21–2 |oclc=186413872 |isbn=978-0-300-09559-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the [[United States]] by the book ''Rural Economy'' by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the [[Borough House Plantation]]&lt;ref name="Borough House"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743001/ |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Borough House Plantation, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, vicinity of Stateburg) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, SC, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Holy Cross (Stateburg, South Carolina)|Church of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref name="Church of the Holy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743002/index.htm |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Church of the Holy Cross, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, Stateburg vicinity) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stateburg, South Carolina]], both being [[National Historic Landmarks]].

Johnson}}
An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in [[Canada]] is [[St. Thomas Anglican Church (Shanty Bay, Ontario)|St. Thomas Anglican Church]] in [[Shanty Bay]], [[Ontario]], erected between 1838 and 1841.

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. [[South Dakota State College]] extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of [[South Carolina]] published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled "Rammed Earth Building Construction".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1936, on a homestead near [[Gardendale, Alabama]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The [[US Agency for International Development]] is working with [[undeveloped countries]] to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also financed the authorship of the ''Handbook of Rammed Earth''&lt;ref name="Handbook For Building Homes of Earth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolfskill |first1=Lyle A. |last2=Dunlap |first2= Wayne A. |last3=Gallaway |first3=Bob M. |title=Handbook For Building Homes of Earth |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE689.pdf |publisher=[[Texas Transportation Institute]] |location=College Station, Texas, USA |work=Texas Transportation Institute bulletin |number=21 |edition=1453 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[Texas Transportation Institute]]. The ''Handbook'' was unavailable for purchase by the public until the Rammed Earth Institute International gained permission to reprint it.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Interest in rammed earth declined after [[World War II]] when the cost of modern construction materials decreased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth was considered substandard, and still is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen who are unfamiliar with earthen construction techniques.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Chile]], for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A notable example of 21st century use of rammed earth is the façade of the [[Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada. As of 2014 it is the largest rammed earth wall in [[North America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Reproductive coercion''' (also called '''coerced reproduction''') is threats or acts of violence against a partner's reproductive health or reproductive decision-making and is a collection of behaviors intended to pressure or coerce a partner into initiating, keeping, or terminating a pregnancy.&lt;ref name=ACOG&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = ACOG Committee opinion no. 554: reproductive and sexual coercion | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 121 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 411–5 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23344307 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000426427.79586.3b | url = https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Health-Care-for-Underserved-Women/Reproductive-and-Sexual-Coercion | ref = harv | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|LWW]] | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive coercion is a form of [[domestic violence]], also known as [[intimate partner violence]], where behavior concerning [[reproductive health]] is used to maintain power, control, and domination within a relationship and over a partner through an unwanted pregnancy.  It is considered a serious public health issue.&lt;ref name=ACOG/&gt;&lt;ref name=FVPF/&gt; This reproductive control is highly correlated to [[unintended pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coker AL | title = Does physical intimate partner violence affect sexual health? A systematic review | journal = Trauma, Violence &amp; Abuse | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–77 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17545572 | doi = 10.1177/1524838007301162 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838007301162 | ref = harv | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common forms of reproductive coercion are pregnancy pressure, pregnancy coercion, and birth control sabotage; they can exist independently or occur simultaneously. Not complying with the partner's wishes may result in the partner acting out violently.&lt;ref name=ACOG/&gt; 

==Pregnancy pressure==
Pregnancy pressure is enacted by a woman's sexual partner when he pressures her into having unprotected sex in order to become pregnant, or into continuing or [[abortion|terminating the pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=ACOG /&gt; It might involve pregnancy coercion, which are threats or acts of violence if the woman does not comply with the perpetrator's demands or wishes.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sueda&gt;{{cite web | first = Alexandra | last = Sueda | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Department of Ob/Gyn, Kaiser Permanente | url =  http://www.stoptheviolence.org/files/Alexa_Sueda_-_Reproductive_Coercion.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160517210158/https://domesticviolenceactioncenter.org/files/Alexa_Sueda_-_Reproductive_Coercion.pdf | archive-date = 3 January 2012 | dead-url = yes | title = Contraceptive Coercion }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller E, Silverman JG | title = Reproductive coercion and partner violence: implications for clinical assessment of unintended pregnancy | journal = Expert Review of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 511–515 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 22355296 | pmc = 3282154 | doi = 10.1586/eog.10.44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reproductive pressure behaviors may result in several [[unintended pregnancies]] that are then followed by multiple [[forced abortion|coerced abortion]]s. Women who seek abortions are nearly three times as likely to have experienced reproductive pressure by a partner in the past year, compared to women continuing their pregnancies.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt; A [[Guttmacher Institute]] policy analysis states that forcing a woman to terminate a pregnancy she wants or to continue a pregnancy she does not want violates the basic human right of her [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name=Guttmacher&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barot | first = Sneha | name-list-format = vanc | title = Governmental coercion in reproductive decision making: see it both ways | journal = [[Guttmacher Policy Review]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | publisher = [[Guttmacher Institute]]| date = Fall 2012 | url = http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/15/4/gpr150407.html | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth control sabotage==
Reproductive coercion can take the form of birth control sabotage, either as verbal sabotage, behavioral sabotage, and/or acts as an active interference with contraceptive methods.  Direct actions are taken to ensure the failure of birth control (such as poking holes in or breaking condoms) or complete removal of contraception (such as flushing birth control pills down the toilet or removing contraceptive rings or patches from the body).  Partners can also forbid women from using [[family planning]] or force them to have sex without protection.&lt;ref name=ACOG/&gt;&lt;ref name=FVPF/&gt;

Birth control sabotage is frequently associated with [[Domestic violence|physical]] or [[sexual violence]], and is a contributor to high pregnancy rates—especially [[teenage pregnancy]] rates—among abused, disadvantaged women and teenagers.&lt;ref name=FVPF/&gt;

Studies on the birth control sabotage performed by males against female partners have indicated a strong correlation between [[domestic violence]] and birth control sabotage. These studies have identified two main classes of the phenomenon:&lt;ref name=Teen/&gt;
*Verbal sabotage—verbal or emotional pressure not to use birth control or to become pregnant.
*Behavioral sabotage—the use of force to have unprotected sexual intercourse or not to use birth control.

14% of surveyed young mothers reported undergoing birth control sabotage.&lt;ref name=Teen&gt;''[http://www.impactresearch.org/documents/birthcontrolexecutive.pdf Domestic Violence and Birth Control Sabotage: A Report from the Teen Parent Project].'' Chicago: Center for Impact Research, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  A separate study found that 66% of teen mothers on public assistance who had recently experienced intimate partner violence disclosed birth control sabotage by a dating partner.  When women did try to negotiate condom use with their abusive partners, 32% said they were verbally threatened,  21% reported physical abuse, and 14% said their partners threatened abandonment.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

Gender and sexual power dynamics and coercion associated with sexual power dynamics are both linked to condom nonuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hendriksen ES, Pettifor A, Lee SJ, Coates TJ, Rees HV | title = Predictors of condom use among young adults in South Africa: the Reproductive Health and HIV Research Unit National Youth Survey | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97 | issue = 7 | pages = 1241–8 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17538062 | pmc = 1913066 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2006.086009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even women with high [[Sexually transmitted disease|STI]] knowledge are more likely to use condoms inconsistently than women with low STI knowledge when there is a high level of fear for abuse.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

==Teen pregnancy==
Teenage girls in physically violent relationships are 3.5 times more likely to become pregnant and are 2.8 times more likely to fear the possible consequences of negotiating condom use than non-abused girls. They are also half as likely to use condoms consistently compared to non-abused girls, and teenage boys perpetrating dating violence are also less likely to use condoms.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt; There are actions girls and women can take if their contraception has been [[stealthed]] or sabotaged:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brocail|first1=McKinzie | name-list-format = vanc |title=Stealthing &amp; Sabotaging Condoms: What You Need To Know|url=https://www.stdcheck.com/blog/stealthing-legal-what-to-do-after/|access-date=21 May 2017|work=STDcheck|date=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, Plan B (the morning after pill) can be acquired by girls 15 years or older. When taken within 72 hours, it can help prevent an unwanted pregnancy. It is approximately 95% effective when taken within 24 hours and is approximately 89% effective when taken within 72 hours.

Teenage mothers are nearly twice as likely to have a repeat pregnancy within 2 years if they experienced abuse within three months after delivery.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

26% of abused teenage girls reported that their boyfriends were trying to get them pregnant.&lt;ref name=FWV&gt;Futures Without Violence. Feb 27, 2012 [http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/Feb%2027%202012%20Final.pdf Teen Dating Violence and Reproductive Coercion: Innovative Opportunities for Programs and Partnerships]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence ==
[[Domestic violence]], also called "intimate partner violence", is monitored by the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).  Their survey on domestic violence measures five types of domestic violence, including control of reproductive health, citing pregnancy pressure and birth control sabotage specifically.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Michele C. | last1 = Black | first2 = Kathleen C. | last2 = Basile | first3 = Matthew J. | last3 = Breiding | first4 = Sharon G. | last4 = Smith | first5 = Mikel L. | last5 = Walters | first6 = Melissa T. | last6 = Merrick | first7 =

The Center for Disease Control found that:&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;
* approximately 8.6% (or an estimated 10.3 million) of women in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant when they did not want to, or refused to use a condom, with 4.8% having had an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant when they did not want to, and 6.7% having had an intimate partner who refused to wear a condom;  
* approximately 10.4% (or an estimated 11.7 million) of men in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control, with 8.7% having had an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control and 3.8% having had an intimate partner who refused to wear a condom.

==Assessment and intervention==
A typical assessment of women's reproductive health includes the following questions:&lt;ref name=FVPF&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Chamberlain | first1 = Linda | first2 = Rebecca | last2 = Levenson | name-list-format = vanc | url =  http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/Repro_Guide.pdf | title = Reproductive Health and Partner Violence Guidelines: An Integrated Response to Intimate Partner Violence and Reproductive Coercion | location = San Francisco | publisher = Family Violence Prevention Fund | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Has a current or former partner not let you use birth control, destroyed your birth control, or refused to wear a condom?
* Has your partner ever tried to get you pregnant when you didn't want to be?
* Has your partner ever forced you to have an abortion or caused you to have a miscarriage?
* Has your partner ever purposely given you an STD?
* Are you worried you might be pregnant?&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

Due to the findings related to reproductive coercion and its prevalence, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has called for its members to be vigilant for reproductive coercion.&lt;ref name=ACOG/&gt;   Clinical implications discovered through case studies are the following: to assess for reproductive coercion as a part of a routine family planning care; to assess reproductive coercion before discussing contraceptive options; to offer discreet birth control methods; and to assess safety.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;  Some believe that all reproductive health care settings should have a written protocol for identifying and responding to domestic violence that includes reproductive coercion, and agencies that already have a protocol should be reviewed and expanded to address reproductive coercion.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

==Law==

In Mexico, the government permits [[abortion]], which is otherwise illegal, for women who have been coerced into pregnancy.&lt;ref name=CusackCI2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cusack | first1 = Carmen M. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2011 | title = Consensual Insemination, An Analysis of Social Deviance within Gender, Family, or the Home | url = http://www.lsd-journal.net/archives/Volume2/Consensual%20Insemination.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Law &amp; Social Deviance | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reputation''' or '''image''' of a social entity (a [[person]], a [[social group]], or an [[organization]]) is an opinion about that entity, typically as a result of social evaluation on a set of criteria.

Reputation is known to be a [[ubiquitous]], [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneous]], and highly efficient [[mechanism of social control]] in natural societies. It is a subject of study in social, [[management]] and [[technological]] [[science]]s. Its influence ranges from competitive settings, like markets, to cooperative ones, like firms, organizations, institutions and communities. Furthermore, reputation acts on different levels of agency, individual and supra-individual. At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). It affects phenomena of different scales, from everyday life to relationships between nations. Reputation is a fundamental instrument of [[social order]], based upon distributed, spontaneous [[social control]].

The concept of reputation is considered important in [[business]], [[education]], [[online communities]], and many other fields, and it may be considered as a component of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].

== Cognitive view ==
Until very recently the [[cognitive]] nature of reputation was substantially ignored. This has caused a misunderstanding of the effective role of reputation in a number of real-life domains and related scientific fields. In the study of [[cooperation]] and [[social dilemma]]s, the role of reputation as a partner selection [[Mechanism (sociology)|mechanism]] started to be appreciated in the early 1980s.

Working toward such a definition, reputation as a socially transmitted (meta-) [[belief]] (i.e., belief about belief) concerns properties of agents, namely their [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s toward some socially desirable [[behaviour]], be it cooperation, [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], or [[norm (sociology)|norm]]-compliance. Reputation plays a crucial role in the [[evolution]] of these behaviours: reputation transmission allows socially desirable behaviour to spread. Rather than concentrating on the property only, the cognitive [[Mental model|model]] of reputation accounts also for the transmissibility and therefore for the propagation of reputation.

To model this aspect, it is necessary to specify and understand a more refined [[Taxonomy (general)|classification]] of reputation.

A recommendation can be extremely precise; in the [[stock market]], for example, an [[Financial adviser|adviser]], when discussing the reputation of a [[Bond (finance)|bond]], can supplement his informed [[opinion]] with both historical series and current events. On the other hand, in informal settings, [[gossip]], although vague, may contain precious hints both to facts ("I've been told this [[physician]] has shown questionable behavior") and to conflicts taking place at the information level (if a [[candidate]] for a [[role]] spreads defamatory information about another candidate, whom should you trust?).

Moreover, the expression "it is said that John Smith is a cheater" is intrinsically a reputation spreading act, because on the one hand it refers to a (possibly false) common opinion, and on the other the very act of saying "it is said" is self-assessing, since it provides at least one factual occasion when that something is said, exactly for the fact the person who says so (the gossiper), while appearing to spread the saying a bit further, may actually be in the phase of initiating it.

Gossip can also be used as an identifier only - as when gossiping about unreachable [[icons]], like [[Royal family|royalty]] or [[show business|showbiz]] [[celebrities]] - useful only to show the gossiper belongs to the group of the informed ones. While most cases seem to share the characteristic of being primarily used to predict future behavior, they can have, for example, manipulative sub-goals, even more important than the forecast.

Considering, for example, the case of a communication between two parties, one (the advisee) that is requesting advice about the [[potential]] for [[Risk|danger]] in a [[financial transaction]] with another party (the potential partner, target), and the other (the adviser, evaluator) that is giving [[advice (opinion)|advice]].

Roughly speaking, the advice could fall under one of the following three categories :
# the adviser declares it believes the potential partner is (is not) good for the transaction in object;
# the adviser declares it believes another (named or otherwise defined) agent or set of agents believes the potential partner is (is not) good for the transaction in object;
# the adviser declares it believes in an undefined set of agents, hence there is a belief the potential partner is (is not) good for the transaction in object;

Note the care to maintain the possible levels of truth (the adviser declares - but could be lying - it believes - but could be wrong - etc..). The cases are listed, as it is evident, in decreasing order of responsibility. While one could feel most actual examples fall under the first case, the other two are not unnecessarily complicated nor actually infrequent. Indeed, most of the common gossip falls under the third category, and, except for electronic [[interaction]], this is the most frequent form of referral. All examples concern the evaluation of a given object (target), a social agent (which may be either individual or supra-individual, and in the latter case, either a group or a collective), held by another social agent, the evaluator.

The examples above can be turned in more precise definitions using the concept of [[social]] [[evaluation]] defined above. At this point, we can propose to coin a new [[lexical item]], ''image'', whose character should be immediately evident from the following:

=== Image ===
'''Image''' is a global or averaged evaluation of a given target on the part of an agent. It consists of (a set of) social evaluations about the characteristics of the target. Image as an object of communication is what is exchanged in examples 1 and 2, above. In the second case, we call it third-party image. It may concern a subset of the target's characteristics, i.e., its willingness to comply with socially accepted norms and customs, or its [[skills]] (ways), or its definition as pertaining to a precise agent. Indeed, we can define special cases of image, including third-party image, the evaluation that an agent believes a third party has of the target, or even shared image, that is, an evaluation shared by a [[Social group|group]]. Not even this last is reputation, since it tries to define too precisely the mental status of the group.

'''Reputation''', as distinct from image, is the process and the effect of transmission of a target image. To be more precise, we call reputation transmission a communication of an evaluation without the specification of the evaluator, if not for a group attribution, and only in the default sense discussed before. This covers the case of example 3 above. More precisely, reputation is a believed, social, meta-evaluation; it is built upon three distinct but interrelated objects :
# a cognitive representation, or more precisely a believed evaluation - this could be somebody's image, but is enough that this consist of a communicated evaluation;
# a population object, i.e., a propagating believed evaluation; and
# an objective emergent property at the agent level, i.e., what the agent is believed to be.

In fact, reputation is a highly dynamic [[phenomenon]] in two distinct senses: it is subject to change, especially as an effect of corruption, errors, [[deception]], etc.; and it emerges as an effect of a multi-level bidirectional process. Reputation is also how others know and perceive you as an individual.

While ''image'' only moves (when transmitted and accepted) from one individual cognition to another, the [[Anonymity|anonymous]] character of reputation makes it a more complex phenomenon. Reputation proceeds from the level of individual cognition (when is born, possibly as an image, but not always) to the level of social propagation (at this level, it not necessarily believed as from any specific agent) and from this level back to individual cognition again (when it is accepted).

Moreover, once it gets to the population level, reputation gives rise to a further property at the agent level. It is both what people think about targets and what targets are in the eyes of others. From the very moment an agent is targeted by the [[community]], his or her life will change whether he or she wants it or not or believes it or not. Reputation has become the immaterial, more powerful equivalent of a [[Scarlet Letter (disambiguation)|scarlet letter]] sewed to one's clothes. It is more powerful because it may not even be perceived by the individual to whom it sticks, and consequently it is out of the individual's power to control and manipulate.

More simply speaking for those who want a working [[definition]] of reputation, reputation is the [[:wikt:sum|sum]] of impressions held by a [[company]]'s [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s. In other words, reputation is in the "eyes of the beholder". It need not be just a company's reputation but could be the reputation of an individual, country, [[brand]], [[political party]], [[industry]]. But the key point in reputation is not what the [[leadership]] insists but what others perceive it to be. For a company, its reputation is how esteemed it is in the eyes of its [[employee]]s, [[customer]]s, [[investor]]s, [[skilled worker|talent]], [[wikt:prospective|prospective]] candidates, [[competitor]]s, [[industry analyst|analyst]]s, [[alumni]], [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] and the list goes on.

===Reputation-based decisions===
Image and reputation are distinct objects. Both are social in two senses: they concern properties of another agent (the target's presumed attitude toward socially desirable behavior), and they may be shared by a multitude of agents. However, the two notions operate at different levels. Image is a belief, namely, an evaluation. Reputation is a meta-belief, i.e., a belief about others' evaluations of the target with regard to a socially desirable behavior. To better understand the difference between image and reputation, the mental decisions based upon them must be analyzed at the following three levels:

;'''[[Epistemic]]''': accept the beliefs that form either a given image or acknowledge a given reputation. This implies a believed evaluation gives rise to one's direct evaluation. Suppose I know the friend I mostly admire has a good opinion of Mr. Berlusconi. However puzzled I may be by this [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonance]]-inducing [[news]], I may be convinced because of my [[friendship]] to accept this evaluation and share it.
;'''[[wikt:pragmatic|Pragmatic]]&amp;ndash;[[strategic]]''' : use image to decide whether and how to interact with the target. Once I have my own opinion (perhaps resulting from acceptance of others' evaluations) about a target, I will use it to make decisions about my future actions concerning that target. Perhaps, I may [[abstain]] from participating in political activity against Mr. Berlusconi.
;'''[[Memetic]]''' : transmit my (or others') evaluative beliefs about a given target to others. Whether or not I act in [[conformity]] with a propagating evaluation, I may decide to spread the news to others.

==Corporate==

===Reputation management===
{{main article|Reputation management}}
Many businesses have [[public relations]] departments dedicated to managing their reputation. In addition, many public relations firms describe their expertise in terms of [[reputation management]]. The public relations industry is growing due to the demand for companies to build corporate credibility and hence reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldreport.holmesreport.com/|title=Global PR Industry Growth Surges To 11% in 2013|publisher=Arun Sudhaman|accessdate=3 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115100426/http://worldreport.holmesreport.com/|archivedate=15 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents which damage a company's reputation for honesty or safety may cause serious damage to finances. For example, in 1999 [[Coca-Cola]] lost $60 million (by its own estimate) after schoolchildren reported suffering from symptoms like [[headache]]s, [[nausea]] and [[shivering]] after drinking its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zurich.com/main/productsandsolutions/industryinsight/2004/june2004/industryinsight20040603_003.htm |title="Share price is always vulnerable" |accessdate=2005-03-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503043118/http://www.zurich.com/main/productsandsolutions/industryinsight/2004/june2004/industryinsight20040603_003.htm |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the rising interest in reputation, few companies have reputation officers. Although many companies{{who|date=April 2012}} will say company reputation is the job of the CEO, managing reputation is a daily function and can best be given to an individual in the organization.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} There are only a handful of people in the business world with the word "reputation" in their titles – [[Dow Chemical]], [[SABMiller]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Allstate]], [[Repsol YPF]], [[Weber Shandwick]], and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (although no longer). [[Hoover's]] has a list of officers with the term "reputation" in their titles. Foro de Reputación Corporativa is a group of 11 companies in Spain that has reputation officers. Despite the great interest in reputation, there only remains 25 or fewer people as reputation officers.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some{{who|date=April 2012}} would argue reputation-building and protection is the job of the CEO and not any direct report. Others{{who|date=April 2012}} would say that the CEO has too many responsibilities to focus on reputation.

Twitter presence is growing in the corporate world and knowing how to handle backlash on social media is important. There are two main routes that customers might take when complaining - individual-direct response or broadcast-based response. For a company, it takes more to respond to a individual-direct response. Study shows that "72 per cent of customers expect a reply within one hour."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-08-14|title=Tweeting your way out of disaster|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/SD-05-2017-0079|journal=Strategic Direction|volume=33|issue=8|pages=17–19|doi=10.1108/sd-05-2017-0079|issn=0258-0543|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to best recover from negative complaints on Twitter, it is best to prove genuineness and to be more specific with a response to the direct person. Due to its growing popularity, Twitter is becoming the number one place for placing and solving complaints for companies.

===Reputation capital===
{{main article|Reputation capital}}
According to Joachim Klewes and Robert Wreschniok, reputation can be managed, accumulated and traded in for trust, legitimisation of a position of power and social recognition, a premium price for goods and services offered, higher customer loyalty,&lt;ref name="Falkenreck"&gt;Falkenreck, C. &amp; Wagner, R.: The Impact of Perceived Innovativeness on Maintaining a Buyer-Seller Relationship in Health Care Markets: A Cross-Cultural Study. In: Journal of Marketing Management 3-4 (2011), Nr. 27, S. 225-242.&lt;/ref&gt; a stronger willingness among shareholders to hold on to shares in times of crisis, or a stronger readiness to invest in the company's stock. Therefore, reputation is one of the most valuable forms of "capital" of a company.

::"Delivering functional and social expectations of the public on the one hand and manage to build a unique identity on the other hand creates trust and this trust builds the informal framework of a company. This framework provides "return in cooperation" and produces [[reputation capital]]. A positive reputation will secure a company or organisation long-term competitive advantages. The higher the Reputation Capital, the less the costs for supervising and exercising control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Klewes, Joachim  |author2=Wreschniok, Robert |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010|title=Reputation Capital: Building and Maintaining Trust in the 21st Century|isbn=978-3-642-01629-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building reputation through stakeholder management===
The [[stakeholder theory]] says [[corporation]]s should be run for the benefit of all "stakeholders," not just the [[shareholder]]s. Stakeholders of a company include any individual or  group that can influence or is influenced by a company's practices. The stakeholders of a company can be [[Supply chain|supplier]]s, [[consumer]]s, employees, shareholders, [[financial]] community, [[government]], and [[Mass media|media]]. Companies must properly manage the relationships between stakeholder groups and they must consider the [[Project stakeholder|interest]](s) of each stakeholder group carefully. Therefore, it becomes essential to integrate [[public relation]]s into corporate governance to manage the relationships between these stakeholders which will enhance the organization's reputation. Corporations or institutions which behave [[ethics|ethically]] and govern in a good manner build reputational [[Social capital|capital]] which is a [[competitive advantage]]. According to Fombrun, a good reputation enhances profitability because it attracts customers to products, investors to securities and employees to its jobs. A company's reputation is an [[asset]] and [[wealth]] that gives that company a competitive advantage because this kind of a company will be regarded as a reliable, credible, trustworthy and responsible for employees, customers, shareholders and financial markets. In addition, according to [[MORI]]'s survey of about 200 [[Management|managers]] in the private sector, 99%
responded that the management of corporate reputation is very (83%) or fairly (16%)
important. Reputation is a reflection of companies’ [[company culture|culture]] and [[Corporate identity|identity]]. Also, it is the outcome of managers' efforts to prove their success and excellence. It is sustained through acting reliably, credibly, trustworthily and responsibly in the market. It can be sustained through consistent communication activities both internally and externally with key stakeholder groups. This directly influences a public company's stock prices in the financial market. Therefore, this reputation makes a reputational capital that becomes a strategic asset and advantage for that company.  As a consequence, public relations must be used in order to establish long lasting relationships with the stakeholders, which will enhance the reputation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Özekmekçi, Abdullah, Mert (2004) "The Correlation between Corporate Governance and Public Relations", Istanbul Bilgi University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes and consequences===
According to Kevin Money and Carola Hillenbrand, there are many different and often conflicting models of reputation.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Terminology such as reputation, branding, image and identity is often used interchangeably, or to distinguish differences between related constructs. Much of this confusion has been alleviated by recent work integrating reputation models in terms of underlying psychological theory. According to Money and Hillenbrand reputation models can be placed in a framework that relates to reputation, its causes and its consequences. In this approach it is important not only to understand reputation, but also to identify the causes of reputation and its consequences.

'''Causes of reputation''' are seen to reside in stakeholder experiences. Stakeholder experiences relate to a company's day-to-day business operations, its branding and marketing and "noise" in the system, such as the media and word of mouth. Further causes of reputation may include the perceived innovativeness of a company, the customers' expectations, the (perceived) quality of the company's goods and services and the subsequent customer satisfaction, all of which differ according to the respective customers' cultural background.&lt;ref name ="Falkenreck" /&gt;

'''Reputation''' is seen to reside in the beliefs that stakeholders hold about a company (the cognitive element)and the feelings that stakeholders have about a company (the affective element). While the cognitive element of reputation can reflect the uniqueness of a company or of products in term characteristics such as brand attributes (whether an organisation is delivering high quality products, is international, friendly etc.), the affective element is always evaluative. In other words, it gives an indication of whether stakeholders like, admire or trust a company and its attributes. A unique and distinctive cognitive evaluation of a company only has value if this results in a positive affective evaluation and positive consequences of reputation.

'''The consequences of reputation''' reside in the behaviors (supportive or otherwise) that stakeholders demonstrate towards a company. Behaviors such as advocacy, commitment and cooperation are key positive outcomes of a positive reputation.

===Reputation recovery===
{{essay|section|date=June 2010}}
The [[wikt:convergence|convergence]] of [[globalization]], instantaneous news and online [[citizen]] [[journalism]] magnifies corporate wrongdoing or missteps. Some companies face new [[assault]]s on its reputation daily. Reputation recovery is often a long and arduous process to rebuilding [[brand equity|equity]] in a company's name. Research has found it takes approximately 3.5 years to fully recover reputation. [[James C. Collins]] of ''[[Good to Great]]'' fame says it takes a company seven years to go from good to great. The path is clearly long. The reason reputation recovery has risen in importance is that the "stumble rate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaines-Ross|first=Leslie|title=Corporate Reputation: 12 Steps to Safeguarding and Recovering Reputation|publisher=Wiley|date=2 January 2008|isbn=0470171502}}&lt;/ref&gt; among companies has risen exponentially over the past five years. In fact, 79% of the world's most admired companies have lost their number one positions in industries in that time period. Companies which were once heralded as [[wikt:invincible|invincible]] no longer are.

===Reputation transfer===
In the context of [[brand extension]] strategies, many companies rely on reputation transfer as a means of transferring the good reputation of a company and its existings products to new markets and new products. Consumers who are already familiar with other products of an established [[brand]], exhibiting [[customer satisfaction]] and loyalty, will more easily accept new products of the same brand. In contrast to brand extension, the general concept of reputation transfer also requires the transfer of a company's values and identity to the new products and/or services and the related brands when entering new markets. It is important, however, to pay attention to the image fit between preexisting and new brands, for this factor has been proven to be critical for the success of brand extensions.&lt;ref&gt;Voelckner, F and Sattler, H. (2007) ‘Empiric Generalizability of Consumer Evaluations of Brand Extensions’, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 24, pp. 149-162.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the special case of brand extension, the general concept of reputation transfer also requires the transfer of the values and identity of a company to the new products and/or services and the related brands when entering new markets. A strong image might therefore even hamper the introduction of new product lines if customers do not associate the competences relevant to the new market/category/product line with the existing company or brand.
A company's reputation is furthermore influenced by [[culture]], as nationalities differ with regard to how valued specific aspects of the company's [[brand identity]] are in the respective national culture (e.g. environmental concerns or work ethics) as well as with regard to popular cultural dimensions (e.g. [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Hofstede]]). Subsequently, these differences impact the success of reputation transfer significantly.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;Falkenreck, C. &amp; Wagner, R.: Impact of Direct Marketing Activities on Company Reputation Transfer Success: Empirical Evidence from Five Different Cultures. Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Corporate Reputation, Brand Identity, and Competitiveness. Beijing: 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{tone|date=December 2011}}
{{see also|Reputation system|Reputation management|Online identity}}
Online reputation is a factor in any [[online community]] where [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] is important. Examples include [[eBay]], an [[auction]] service which uses a system of customer feedback to publicly rate each member's reputation, or [[Amazon.com]] which has a similar review system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=885568|title=The Dimensions of Reputation in Electronic Markets|author=Anindya Ghose, Panagiotis G. Ipeirotis, and  [[Arun Sundararajan]], |date=February 2006|publisher=NYU Center for Digital Economy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that a good reputation added 7.6% to the price received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ironreputation.com/why-reputation-management-is-important/|title=Why Reputation Management is Important|publisher=Iron Reputation|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, building and maintaining a good reputation can be a significant [[Motivations for contributing to online communities|motivation]] for [[online participation|contributing to online communities]].

Individuals employ monitoring to ensure that they keep up with their online reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep Track of your Reputation Online|url=http://www.myreputationrepair.com.au/reputation-management/keep-track-reputation-online/|publisher=MyReputationRepair|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the number of sites on the Internet, it is impossible to  manually monitor the entire web for pages that may affect one's online reputation. Free tools such as [[Google Alerts]] can be used to keep track online reputations on a small scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchmarketinggurus.com/search_marketing_gurus/2009/06/online-marketing-tips-video-online-reputation-management.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606204126/http://www.searchmarketinggurus.com/search_marketing_gurus/2009/06/online-marketing-tips-video-online-reputation-management.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 June 2009|title=Online Marketing Tips Video: Online Reputation Management|last=Evans|first=Li|date=3 June 2009|publisher=Search Marketing Gurus|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while larger businesses and clients may use more powerful analytics to monitor online interactions and mentions.

Paid tools for online reputation management focus on either brand protection or online reputation. These tools track mentions of a brand or product on the Internet, on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], blogs, and other [[social networking]] sites and websites.

Online reputation can be evaluated by how well it is being [[impression management|managed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2008/03/03/34-online-reputation-management-tools/|title=34 Online Reputation Management Tools|last=Jantsch|first=John|date=3 March 2008|publisher=Duct Tape Marketing|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of reputation is usually called web or digital reputation to distinguish it from the online reputation.{{dubious|date=May 2013}}{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Indeed, digital or web reputation does not concern the virtual online reputation only, but the whole real reputation of a person or a company as it is affected by the Internet. Online reputation furthermore should not be confused with a company's [[digital identity]].

An online reputation is the perception that one generates on the Internet based on their [[digital footprint]]. Digital footprints accumulate through all of the content shared, feedback provided and information that is created online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshreputation.com/online-reputation|title=Online Reputation|publisher=FreshReputation|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that if someone has a bad online reputation, he can easily change his pseudonym, new accounts on sites such as eBay or Amazon are usually distrusted. If an individual or company wants to manage their online reputation, they will face many more difficulties.

According to one study, 84% of responding business leaders saw the greatest reputation threat online to companies as negative media coverage.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The next two greatest threats are customer complaints in the media or on grievance sites online (71%) and negative word of mouth (54%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tej9.com/online-reputation-management-guide/ |title=Online Reputation Management: A Proactive Guide to Build Your Digital Presence |deadurl=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This negative word of mouth could be from dissatisfied customers but from employees as well. With the power of business review websites and customer forums, a company's online reputation can be damaged anonymously online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help My Business is Under Attack|url=http://www.reputationstation.co.uk/help-my-business-is-under-attack/|website=Reputation Station|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Employers have begun using the online reputations of job applicants to help their hiring choices. By checking a candidate's [[social networking]] profiles on sites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[MySpace]], employers gain insight into a candidate's character and suitability for a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reputation.com/how_to/how-your-online-social-network-could-cost-you-a-new-job/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090120/http://www.reputation.com/how_to/how-your-online-social-network-could-cost-you-a-new-job/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-09-24|title=How Your Online Social Network Could Cost You a New Job|publisher=Reputation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals and organizations hire reputation management companies to attempt to hide truthful but unflattering information about themselves.  A recent alleged example is that of Dr. [[Anil Potti]], who resigned from [[Duke University]] after it was discovered that he had misrepresented himself on his resume and became the subject of a [[scientific misconduct]] investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2011/04/potti-hires-online-reputation-manager |title=Potti hires online reputation manager |last=Doherty |first=Taylor |date=30 April 2018 |publisher=The Chronicle |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;'''Reverse computation''' is a [[computer software|software]] application of the concept of [[reversible computing]].

Because it offers a possible solution to the heat problem faced by chip manufacturers, reversible computing has been extensively studied in the area of computer architecture.  The promise of reversible computing is that the amount of heat loss for reversible architectures would be minimal for significantly large numbers of transistors.&lt;ref&gt;

The concept of reverse computation is somewhat simpler than reversible computing in that reverse computation is only required to restore the ''equivalent'' state of a software application, rather than support the reversibility of the set of all possible instructions.  Reversible computing concepts have been successfully applied as ''reverse computation'' in software application areas such as database design,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; suggest the application of reverse computation to reduce state saving overheads
in ''parallel discrete event simulation'' (PDES). They define an approach based on reverse event codes (which can be automatically generated), and
demonstrate performance advantages of this approach over
traditional state saving for fine-grained applications (those
with a small amount of computation per event).
The key property that reverse computation
exploits is that a majority of the operations that modify the
state variables are “constructive” in nature. That is, the [[undo]]
operation for such operations requires no history. Only the
most current values of the variables are required to undo the
operation. For example, operators such as ++, ––, +=, -=, *=
and /= belong to this category. Note, that the *= and /= operators
require special treatment in the case of multiply or divide
by zero, and overflow / underflow conditions. More complex
operations such as circular shift (swap being a special case),
and certain classes of random number generation also belong
here.

Operations of the form a = b, modulo and bit-wise computations
that result in the loss of data, are termed to be destructive.
Typically these operations can only be restored using
conventional state-saving techniques. However, we observe
that many of these destructive operations are a consequence
of the arrival of data contained within the event being
processed. For example, in the work of Yaun, Carothers, et al., with large-scale TCP simulation,&lt;ref&gt;

The swap operation makes this operation reversible.

&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, the technique known as ''Reverse Computation'' has only been applied in software for optimistically synchronized, parallel discrete event simulation.

In December 1999, Michael Frank graduated from the [[University of Florida]].  His [[doctoral thesis]] focused on reverse computation at the hardware level, but included descriptions of both an instruction set architecture and a high level programming language (R) for a processor based on reverse computation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Dr. Frank maintains two websites of his publications on [http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/revcomp/writing.html reverse computation to 2004] and [http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~mpf/pubs.htm later].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Carothers and Perumalla published a paper for the Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation workshop&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pads-workshop.org/ PADS]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their graduate studies under Richard Fujimoto, introducing technique of Reverse Computation as an alternative rollback mechanism in optimistically synchronized parallel discrete event simulations (Time Warp).  In 1998, Carothers became an associate professor at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].   Working with graduate students David Bauer and Shawn Pearce, Carothers integrated the Georgia Tech Time Warp design into Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS), which supported only reverse computation as the rollback mechanism.   Carothers also constructed RC models for BitTorrent at General Electric, as well as numerous network protocols with students (BGP4, TCP Tahoe, Multicast).  Carothers created a course on Parallel and Distributed Simulation in which students were required to construct RC models in ROSS.

Around the same time, Perumalla graduated from [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] and went to work at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL).  There he built the uSik simulator, which was a combined optimistic / conservative protocol PDES.  The system was capable of dynamically determining the best protocol for LPs and remapping them during execution in response to model dynamics.  In 2007 Perumalla tested uSik on [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/L|Blue Gene/L]] and found that, while scalability is limited to 8K processors for pure Time Warp implementation, the conservative implementation scales to 16K available processors.  Note that benchmarking was performed using PHOLD with a constrained remote event rate of 10%, where the timestamp of events was determined by an exponential distribution with a mean of 1.0, and an additional lookahead of 1.0 added to each event.  This was the first implementation of PDES on Blue Gene using reverse computation.

From 1998 to 2005 Bauer performed graduate work at RPI under Carothers, focusing solely on reverse computation.  He developed the first PDES system solely based on reverse computation, called Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; for combined shared and distributed memory systems.  From 2006 to 2009 Bauer worked under E.H. Page at [[Mitre Corporation]], and in collaboration with Carothers and Pearce pushed the ROSS simulator to the 131,072 processor [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/P|Blue Gene/P]] (Intrepid).  This implementation was stable for remote event rates of 100% (every event sent over the network).  During his time at RPI and MITRE, Bauer developed the network simulation system ROSS.Net&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that supports semi-automated experiment design for black-box optimization of network protocol models executing in ROSS.  A primary goal of the system was to optimize multiple network protocol models for execution in ROSS.  For example, creating an LP layering structure to eliminate events being passed between network protocol LPs on the same simulated machine optimizes simulation of TCP/IP network nodes by eliminating zero-offset timestamps between TCP and IP protocols.  Bauer also constructed RC agent-based models for social contact networks to study the effects of infectious diseases, in particular pandemic influenza, that scale to hundreds of millions of agents; as well as RC models for Mobile ad-hoc networks implementing functionality of mobility (proximity detection) and highly accurate physical layer electromagnetic wave propagation (Transmission Line Matrix model).&lt;ref&gt;

There has also been a recent push by the PDES community into the realm of continuous simulation.  For example, Fujimoto and Perumalla, working with Tang et al.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; have implemented an RC model of particle-in-cell and demonstrated excellent speedup over continuous simulation for models of light as a particle.  Bauer and Page demonstrated excellent speedup for an RC Transmission Line Matrix model (P.B. Johns, 1971), modeling light as a wave at microwave frequencies.  Bauer also created an RC variant of [[Compartmental models in epidemiology|SEIR]] that generates enormous improvement over continuous models in the area of infectious disease spread.  In addition, the RC SEIR model is capable of modeling multiple diseases efficiently, whereas the continuous model explodes exponentially with respect to the number of combinations of diseases possible throughout the population.

In [[scientific visualization]] '''skin friction lines''' are used to visualize flows on 3D-surfaces. They are obtained by calculating the [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] of a derived vector field on the surface, the [[wall shear stress]]. [[Parasitic drag#Skin_friction|Skin friction]]  arises from the friction of the fluid against the "skin" of the object that is moving through it and forms a vector at each point on the surface. A skin friction line is a curve on the surface tangent to skin friction vectors. A '''limit streamline''' is a streamline where the distance normal to the surface tends to zero. Limit streamlines and skin friction lines coincide.&lt;ref name="Délery"&gt;{{Citation | title=Separation in three-dimensional flow: critical points, separation lines and vortices | author=Jean Délery | date=2011 | url=http://www.onera.fr/conferences-en/3d-separation/Onera-3D-separation-jean-delery-2011-1a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines can be visualized by placing a viscous film on the surface.&lt;ref name="Délery"/&gt;

The skin friction lines may exhibit a number of different types of singularities: attachment nodes, detachment nodes, Isotropic nodes, Saddle points, and foci.&lt;ref name="Délery"/&gt;

'''Sophia''' ({{lang-grc-koi|Σοφíα}} "Wisdom", {{lang-cop|ⲧⲥⲟⲫⲓⲁ}} "the Sophia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nag Hammadi Codex II, 2-7|editor-first=Bentley|editor-last=Layton|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=Leiden|year=1989|ISBN=90-04-09019-3|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DpV2JWlHxBoC&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 158–9], [https://books.google.com/books?id=DpV2JWlHxBoC&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;pg=PA252#v=onepage 252–3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a major theme, along with Knowledge ({{lang|grc|γνῶσις}} ''[[gnosis]]'', Coptic ''sooun''), among many of the early Christian knowledge-theologies grouped by the heresiologist [[Irenaeus]] as ''gnostikos'', "learned". [[Gnosticism]] is a 17th-century term expanding the definition of Irenaeus' groups to include other syncretic and mystery religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/236343/Gnosticism |title= Gnosticism|author= Michael Williams|date= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=17 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In gnosticism, Sophia is a feminine figure, analogous to the human soul but also simultaneously one of the feminine aspects of [[God]]. Gnostics held that she was the ''syzygy'' (female twin [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|divine Aeon]]) of [[Jesus]] (i.e. the [[Bride of Christ]]), and [[Holy Spirit]] of the [[Trinity]]. She is occasionally referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent of ''Achamōth'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀχαμώθ}}, {{lang-he|חכמה}} ''[[chokhmah]]'') and as ''Prunikos'' ({{lang|grc|Προύνικος}}).  In the [[Nag Hammadi]] texts, Sophia is the lowest Aeon, or anthropic expression of the emanation of the light of God. She is considered to have fallen from grace in some way, in so doing creating or helping to create the material world.

==Gnostic mythos==
{{Original research|"Gnostic mythos" section|date=October 2011}}

Almost all Gnostic systems of the [[Gnosticism#Major Gnostic schools and their texts|Syrian or Egyptian]] type taught that the universe began with an original, unknowable [[God]], referred to as the Parent or [[Bythos]], or as the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]] by [[Monoimus]]. From this initial unitary beginning, the One spontaneously [[emanationism|emanated]] further [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]s, being pairs of progressively 'lesser' beings in sequence. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the ''[[Pleroma]]'', or fullness, of God, and thus should not be seen as distinct from the divine, but symbolic abstractions of the divine nature. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in one of the Aeons.

In most versions of the Gnostic mythos, it is Sophia who brings about this instability in the Pleroma, in turn bringing about the creation of materiality. According to some Gnostic texts, the crisis occurs as a result of Sophia trying to emanate without her syzygy or, in another tradition, because she tries to breach the barrier between herself and the unknowable [[Bythos]]. After cataclysmically falling from the Pleroma, Sophia's fear and anguish of losing her life (just as she lost the light of the One) causes confusion and longing to return to it. Because of these longings, [[matter]] (Greek: ''[[hyle|hylē]]'', ὕλη) and  [[soul]] (Greek: ''psychē'', ψυχή) accidentally come into existence. The creation of the [[Demiurge]] (also known as Yaldabaoth, "Son of Chaos") is also a mistake made during this exile. The Demiurge proceeds to create the physical world in which we live, ignorant of Sophia, who nevertheless manages to infuse some spiritual spark or ''[[pneuma]]'' into his creation.

In the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', Christ is sent from the Godhead in order to bring Sophia back into the fullness (Pleroma). Christ enables her to again see the light, bringing her knowledge of the [[spirit]] (Greek: ''pneuma'', πνευμα). Christ is then sent to earth in the form of the man [[Jesus]] to give men the [[Gnosis]] needed to rescue themselves from the physical world and return to the [[Spirit|spiritual world]]. In Gnosticism, the Gospel story of Jesus is itself allegorical: it is the Outer [[Mysteries of Eleusis|Mystery]], used as an introduction to Gnosis, rather than it being literally true in a historical context. For the Gnostics, the drama of the redemption of the Sophia through Christ or the [[Logos]] is the central drama of the universe. The Sophia resides in all of us as the [[Divine Spark]].

==Book of Proverbs==
Jewish Alexandrine religious philosophy was much occupied with the concept of the Divine ''Sophia'', as the revelation of God's inward thought, and assigned to her not only the formation and ordering of the natural universe (comp. [[Clementine literature|Clem. ''Hom.'']] [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Pseudo-Clementine Literature/The Clementine Homilies/Homily XVI/Chapter 12|xvi. 12]]) but also the communication of all insight and knowledge to mankind. In {{bibleverse||Proverbs|8}} Wisdom (the noun is feminine) is described as God's Counsellor and Workmistress (Master-workman, R.V.), who dwelt beside Him before the Creation of the world and sported continually before Him.

In accordance with the description given in the Book of Proverbs, a dwelling-place was assigned by the Gnostics to the Sophia, and her relation to the upper world defined as well as to the seven planetary powers which were placed under her. The seven planetary spheres or heavens were for the ancients the highest regions of the created universe. They were thought of as seven circles rising one above another, and dominated by the seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]]. These constituted the (Gnostic) Hebdomad. Above the highest of them, and over-vaulting it, was the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]], the sphere of immutability, which was nigh to the spiritual world ([[Clemens Alexandrinus]], ''[[Stromata]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book IV./Chapter XXIII.|iv. 25]], 161; comp. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter XVI.|vi. 16]], 138 sqq.). Now we read in {{bibleverse||Proverbs|9:1}}:
{{Quote|Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:}}
These seven pillars being interpreted as the planetary heavens, the habitation of the Sophia herself was placed above the Hebdomad in the Ogdoad (''Excerpt. ex Theodot''. 8, 47). It is said further of the same divine wisdom ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|8:2}}):
{{Quote|She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.}}
This meant, according to the Gnostic interpretation, that the Sophia has her dwelling-place "on the heights" above the created universe, in the place of the midst, between the upper and lower world, between the Pleroma and the ''ektismena''. She sits at "the gates of the mighty," i.e. at the approaches to the realms of the seven Archons, and at the "entrances" to the upper realm of light her praise is sung. The Sophia is therefore the highest ruler over the visible universe, and at the same time the mediatrix between the upper and the lower realms. She shapes this mundane universe after the heavenly prototypes, and forms the seven star-circles with their Archons under whose dominion are placed, according to the astrological conceptions of antiquity, the fates of all earthly things, and more especially of man. She is "the mother" or "the mother of the living." ([[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiph]]. ''[[Panarion|Haer]]''. 26, 10). As coming from above, she is herself of pneumatic essence, the ''mētēr phōteinē'' (Epiph. 40, 2) or the ''anō dynamis'' (Epiph. 39, 2) from which all pneumatic souls draw their origin.

==Descent==
In reconciling the doctrine of the pneumatic nature of the Sophia with the dwelling-place assigned her, according to the Proverbs, in the kingdom of the midst, and so outside the upper realm of light, there was envisioned a descent of Sophia from her heavenly home, the Pleroma, into the void (''[[kenōma]]'') beneath it. The concept was that of a seizure or robbery of light, or of an outburst and diffusion of light-dew into the ''kenōma'', occasioned by a vivifying movement in the upper world. But inasmuch as the light brought down into the darkness of this lower world was thought of and described as involved in suffering, this suffering must be regarded as a punishment. This inference was further aided by the [[Platonism|Platonic]] notion of a spiritual fall.

==Mythos of the soul==
Alienated through their own fault from their heavenly home, souls have sunk down into this lower world without utterly losing the remembrance of their former state, and filled with longing for their lost inheritance, these fallen souls are still striving upwards. In this way the [[mythos]] of the fall of Sophia can be regarded as having a typical significance. The fate of the "mother" was regarded as the prototype of what is repeated in the history of all individual souls, which, being of a heavenly pneumatic origin, have fallen from the upper world of light their home, and come under the sway of evil powers, from whom they must endure a long series of sufferings until a return into the upper world be once more vouchsafed them.

But whereas, according to the Platonic philosophy, fallen souls still retain a remembrance of their lost home, this notion was preserved in another form in Gnostic circles. It was taught that the souls of the Pneumatici, having lost the remembrance of their heavenly derivation, required to become once more partakers of Gnosis, or knowledge of their own pneumatic essence, in order to make a return to the realm of light. In the impartation of this Gnosis consists the redemption brought and vouchsafed by Christ to pneumatic souls. But the various fortunes of such souls were wont to be contemplated in those of Sophia, and so it was taught that the Sophia also needed the redemption wrought by Christ, by whom she is delivered from her ''agnoia'' and her ''pathe'', and will, at the end of the world's development, be again brought back to her long lost home, the Upper Pleroma, into which this mother will find an entrance along with all pneumatic souls her children, and there, in the heavenly bridal chamber, celebrate the marriage feast of eternity.

==Syrian Gnosis==
The [[Sophia mythos]] has in the various Gnostic systems undergone great variety of treatment. The oldest, the Syrian Gnosis, referred to the ''Sophia'' the formation of the lower world and the production of its rulers the Archons; and along with this they also ascribed to her the preservation and propagation of the spiritual seed.

===Formation of the lower world ===
[[Image:SophiaMystical.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A mystical depiction of Sophia from ''Geheime Figuren der [[Rosicrucianism|Rosenkreuzer]]'', [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], 1785.]]
As described by [[Irenaeus]], the great Mother-principle of the universe appears as the first woman, the Holy Spirit (''rūha d'qudshā'') moving over the waters, and is also called the mother of all living. Under her are the four material elements—water, darkness, abyss, and chaos. With her, combine themselves the two supreme masculine lights, the first and the second man, the Father and the Son, the latter being also designated as the Father's ''ennoia''. From their union proceeds the third imperishable light, the third man, Christ. But unable to support the abounding fulness of this light, the mother in giving birth to Christ, suffers a portion of this light to overflow on the left side. While, then, Christ as ''dexios'' (He of the right hand) mounts upward with his mother into the imperishable Aeon, that other light which has overflowed on the left hand, sinks down into the lower world, and there produces matter. And this is the Sophia, called also ''Aristera'' (she of the left hand), ''Prouneikos'' and the male-female.

There is here, as yet, no thought of a fall, properly so called, as in the Valentinian system. The power which has thus overflowed leftwards, makes a voluntary descent into the lower waters, confiding in its possession of the spark of true light. It is, moreover, evident that though mythologically distinguished from the ''humectatio luminis'' (Greek: ''ikmas phōtos'', ἰκμὰς φωτός), the Sophia is yet, really nothing else but the light-spark coming from above, entering this lower material world, and becoming here the source of all formation, and of both the higher and the lower life. She swims over the waters, and sets their hitherto immoveable mass in motion, driving them into the abyss, and taking to herself a bodily form from the ''hylē''. She compasses about, and is laden with material every kind of weight and substance, so that, but for the essential spark of light, she would be sunk and lost in the material. Bound to the body which she has assumed and weighed down thereby, she seeks in vain to make her escape from the lower waters, and hasten upwards to rejoin her heavenly mother. Not succeeding in this endeavour, she seeks to preserve, at least, her light-spark from being injured by the lower elements, raises herself by its power to the realm of the upper region, and there spreading herself out she forms out of her own bodily part, the dividing wall of the visible firmament, but still retains the ''aquatilis corporis typus''. Finally seized with a longing for the higher light, she finds, at length, in herself, the power to raise herself even above the heaven of her own forming, and to fully lay aside her corporeity. The body thus abandoned is called "Woman from Woman."

===Creation and redemption===
The narrative proceeds to tell of the formation of the seven Archons by Sophia herself, of the creation of man, which "the mother" (i.e. not the first woman, but the Sophia) uses as a mean to deprive the Archons of their share of light, of the perpetual conflict on his mother's part with the self-exalting efforts of the Archons, and of her continuous striving to recover again and again the light-spark hidden in human nature, till, at length, Christ comes to her assistance and in answer to her prayers, proceeds to draw all the sparks of light to Himself, unites Himself with the Sophia as the bridegroom with the bride, descends on Jesus who has been prepared, as a pure vessel for His reception, by Sophia, and leaves him again before the crucifixion, ascending with Sophia into the world or Aeon which will never pass away ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXX.|Irenaeus, i. 30]]; Epiph. 37, 3, sqq.; Theodoret, h. f. i. 14).

===As world-soul===
In this system the original cosmogonic significance of the Sophia still stands in the foreground. The antithesis of Christus and Sophia, as He of the right (''ho dexios'') and She of the Left (''hē aristera''), as male and female, is but a repetition of the first Cosmogonic Antithesis in another form. The Sophia herself is but a reflex of the "Mother of all living" and is therefore also called "Mother." She is the formatrix of heaven and earth, for as much as mere matter can only receive form through the light which, coming down from above has interpenetrated the dark waters of the ''hylē;'' but she is also at the same time the spiritual principle of life in creation, or, as the world-soul the representative of all that is truly pneumatic in this lower world: her fates and experiences represent typically those of the pneumatic soul which has sunk down into chaos.

==''Prunikos''==
{{Quote box|align=right|For I am the first and the last.&lt;br&gt;I am the honored one and the scorned one.&lt;br&gt;I am the whore and the holy one.|—''[[The Thunder, Perfect Mind]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nag Hammadi Library in English|first=George|last=MacRae|editor1-first=James M.|editor1-last=Robinson|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1990|location=San Francisco|chapter=The Thunder: Perfect Mind|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/thunder.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the Gnostic system described by Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXI.|I. xxi.]]; see [[Ophites]]) the name Prunikos several times takes the place of Sophia in the relation of her story. The name Prunikos is also given to Sophia in the account of the kindred Barbeliot system, given in the preceding chapter of Irenaeus. [[Celsus]], who shows that he had met with some Ophite work, exhibits acquaintance with the name Prunikos ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXIV|Orig. ''Adv. Cels''. vi. 34]]) a name which Origen recognizes as Valentinian. That this Ophite name had really been adopted by the Valentinians is evidenced by its occurrence in a Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxxi. 5). Epiphanius also introduces Prunikos as a technical word in the system of the [[Simonians]] (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxi. 2) of those whom he describes under the head of [[Nicolaitans]] (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxv. 3, 4) and of the Ophites (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxxvii. 4, 6).

===Etymology===
Neither Irenaeus nor Origen indicates that he knew anything as to the meaning of this word; and we have no better information on this subject than a conjecture of Epiphanius (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxv. 48). He says that the word means "wanton" or "lascivious," for that the Greeks had a phrase concerning a man who had debauched a girl, ''Eprounikeuse tautēn''. One feels some hesitation in accepting this explanation. Epiphanius was deeply persuaded of the filthiness of Gnostic morals, and habitually put the worst interpretation on their language. If the phrase reported by Epiphanius had been common, it is strange that instances of its use should not have been quoted from the Greek comic writers. It need not be denied that Epiphanius had heard the phrase employed, but innocent words come to be used in an obscene sense, as well by those who think ''[[double entendre]]'' witty, as by those who modestly avoid the use of plainer language. The primary meaning of the word ''prouneikos'' seems to be a porter, or bearer of burdens, the derivation being from ''enenkein'', the only derivation indeed that the word seems to admit of. Then, modifying its meaning like the word ''agoraios'', it came to be used in the sense of a turbulent violent person. The only distinct confirmation of the explanation of Epiphanius is that [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] (''s. v. Skitaloi'') has the words ''aphrodisiōn kai tēs prounikias tēs nykterinēs''. This would be decisive, if we could be sure that these words were earlier in date than Epiphanius.

In favour of the explanation of Epiphanius is the fact, that in the Gnostic cosmogonical myths, the imagery of sexual passion is constantly introduced. It seems on the whole probable that ''prouneikos'' is to be understood in the sense of ''propherēs'' which has for one of its meanings&lt;ref&gt;See the references in [[Liddell and Scott]].&lt;/ref&gt; "precocious in respect of sexual intercourse." According to [[Ernst Wilhelm Möller]] (1860) the name is possibly meant to indicate her attempts to entice away again from the lower Cosmic Powers the seed of Divine light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ernst Wilhelm|last=Möller|title=Geschichte der Kosmologie in der griechischen Kirche bis auf Origenes. Mit Specialuntersuchungen über die gnostischen Systeme|location=Halle|year=1860|page=270 sqq}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the account given by Epiphanius (''Haer''. 37:6) the allusion to enticements to sexual intercourse which is involved in this name, becomes more prominent.

However, in the ''[[Exegesis on the Soul]]'' text found at Nag Hammadi, the soul is likened to a woman which fell from perfection into prostitution, and that the Father will elevate her again to her original perfect state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nag Hammadi Library in English|first=William C. |last=Robinson Jr.|editor1-first=James M.|editor1-last=Robinson|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1990|location=San Francisco|chapter=Exegesis on the Soul|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/exe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the female personification of the soul resembles the passion of Sophia as Prunikos.

==The womb, ''mētra''==
Nigh related to this is the notion widely diffused among Gnostic sects of the impure ''mētra'' ([[womb]]) from whence the whole world is supposed to have issued. As according to the Italian Valentinians the Soter opens the ''mētra'' of the lower Sophia, (the ''Enthymēsis''), and so occasions the formation of the universe ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter III.|Iren. I. 3]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter III.|4]]) so on the other hand the ''mētra'' itself is personified. So Epiphanius reports the following cosmogony as that of a branch of the Nicolaitans:
{{Quote|In the beginning were Darkness, Chaos, and Water (''skotos, kai bythos, kai hydōr''), but the Spirit indwelling in the midst of them, divided them one from another. From the intermingling of Darkness with Spirit proceeds the ''mētra'' which again is kindled with fresh desire after the Spirit; she gives birth first to four, and then to other four aeons, and so produces a right and a left, light and darkness. Last of all comes forth an ''aischros aiōn'', who has intercourse with the ''mētra'', the offspring whereof are Gods, Angels, Daemons, and Spirits.|Epiphanius, ''Haer''. 25, 5}}
The [[Sethians]] ([[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]]. ''[[Philosophumena|Philosophum]].'' [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book X/Part 8|v. 7]]) teach in like manner that from the first concurrence (''syndromē'') of the three primeval principles arose heaven and earth as a ''megalē tis idea sphragidos''. These have the form of a ''mētra'' with the ''[[omphalos]]'' in the midst. The pregnant ''mētra'' therefore contains within itself all kinds of animal forms in the reflex of heaven and earth and all substances found in the middle region. This ''mētra'' also encounters us in the great ''[[Simonians#The Great Declaration|Apophasis]]'' ascribed to Simon where it is also called Paradise and [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] as being the locality of man's formation.

These cosmogonic theories have their precedent in the Thalatth or [[Tiamat]] of Syrian mythology, the life-mother of whom [[Berossus]] has so much to relate, or in the world-egg out of which when cloven asunder heaven and earth and all things proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Richard Adelbert Lipsius|first=Richard Adelbert|last=Lipsius|title=Gnosticismus|page=119 sqq|year=1860|publisher=Brockhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of this Berossian Thalatth meets us again among the [[Peratae]] of the ''[[Philosophumena]]'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book V/Part 10|Hippolytus, ''Philosophum.'' v. 9]]) and is sometimes mistakenly identified with that of the sea—''[[Thalassa (mythology)|thalassa]]''.

==Baruch-Gnosis==
A similar part to that of the ''mētra'' is played by Edem, consort of [[Elohim]] in the Gnostic book ''Baruch'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book V/Part 19|Hippolytus, ''Philosoph''. v. 18 sqq.]]) who there appears as a two-shaped being formed above as a woman and from the middle downwards as a serpent ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book V/Part 22|21]]).

Among the four and twenty Angels which she bears to Elohim, and which form the world out of her members, the second female angelic form is called ''Achamōs'' [''Achamōth'']. Like to this legend of the ''Philosophumena'' concerning the Baruch-Gnosis is that which is related by Epiphanius of an Ophite Party that they fabled that a Serpent from the Upper World had had sexual intercourse with the Earth as with a woman (Epiphanius, ''Haer''. 45: 1 cf. 2).

== Barbeliotae ==
Very nigh related to the doctrines of the Gnostics in Irenaeus are the views of the so-called Barbeliotae ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIX.|Iren. I. 29]]). The name [[Barbelo]], which according to one interpretation is a designation of the upper [[Tetrad (Greek philosophy)|Tetrad]], has originally nothing to do with the Sophia. This latter Being called also ''Spiritus Sanctus'' and ''Prunikos'' is the offspring of the first angel who stands at the side of the Monogenes. Sophia seeing that all the rest have each its ''syzygos'' within the Pleroma, desires also to find such a consort for herself; and not finding one in the upper world she looks down into the lower regions and being still unsatisfied there she descends at length against the will of the Father into the deep. Here she forms the Demiurge (the ''Proarchōn''), a composite of ignorance and self-exaltation. This Being, by virtue of pneumatic powers stolen from his mother, proceeds to form the lower world. The mother, on the other hand, flees away into the upper regions and makes her dwelling there in the Ogdoad.

==The [[Ophites]]==
We meet this Sophia also among the [[Ophites|Ophiana]] whose "[[Ophite Diagrams|Diagram]]" is described by [[Celsus]] and [[Origen]], as well as among various Gnostic (Ophite) parties mentioned by Epiphanius. She is there called Sophia or Prunikos, the upper mother and upper power, and sits enthroned above the Hebdomad (the seven Planetary Heavens) in the Ogdoad (Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum|Against Celsus]]''. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXI|vi. 31]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXIV|34]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXV|35]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXVIII|38]]; Epiphan. ''Haer''. 25, 3 sqq. 26, 1,10. 39, 2 ; 40, 2). She is also occasionally called ''Parthenos'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXI|Orig. ''c. Cels.'' vi. 31]]) and again is elsewhere identified with the Barbelo or Barbero (Epiph. ''Haer''. 25, 3 ; 26, 1, 10).

==[[Simon Magus]]==
[[Image:Leighton Helen of Troy.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Helen of Troy|Helen]] on the Ramparts of Troy'' by [[Frederick Leighton]]; an incarnation of the ''Ennoia'' in the [[Simonians|Simonian]] system.]]

===The ''Ennoia''===
{{anchor|Ennoia}}This mythos of the soul and her descent into this lower world, with her various sufferings and changing fortunes until her final deliverance, recurs in the [[Simonians|Simonian]] system under the form of the All-Mother who issues as its first thought from the ''Hestōs'' or highest power of God. She generally bears the name ''Ennoia'', but is also called Wisdom (Sophia), Ruler, Holy Spirit, Prunikos, Barbelo. Having sunk down from the highest heavens into the lowest regions, she creates angels and archangels, and these again create and rule the material universe. Restrained and held down by the power of this lower world, she is hindered from returning to the kingdom of the Father. According to one representation she suffers all manner of insult from the angels and archangels bound and forced again and again into fresh earthly bodies, and compelled for centuries to wander in ever new corporeal forms. According to another account she is in herself incapable of suffering, but is sent into this lower world and undergoes perpetual transformation in order to excite by her beauty the angels and powers, to impel them to engage in perpetual strife, and so gradually to deprive them of their store of heavenly light. The ''Hestōs'' himself at length comes down from the highest heaven in a phantasmal body in order to deliver the suffering ''Ennoia'', and redeem the souls held in captivity by imparting gnosis to them.

===The lost sheep===
The most frequent designation of the Simonian ''Ennoia'' is "the lost" or "the wandering sheep." The Greek divinities [[Zeus]] and [[Athena]] were interpreted to signify ''Hestōs'' and his ''Ennoia'', and in like manner the Tyrian sun-god [[Herakles]]-[[Melkart]] and the moon-goddess [[Selene]]-[[Astarte]]. So also the [[Homer]]ic [[Helen of Troy|Helena]], as the cause of quarrel between Greeks and [[Troy|Trojans]], was regarded as a type of the ''Ennoia''. The story which the fathers of the church handed down of the intercourse of [[Simon Magus]] with his consort Helena ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIII.|Iren. i. 23]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/A Treatise on the Soul/Chapter XXXIV|Tertullian ''de Anima'', 34]]; Epiphanius ''Haer''. 21; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Anti-Marcion/Appendix: Against All Heresies/I|Pseudo-Tertullian ''Haer''. 1]]; Philaster, ''Haer''. 29; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 15|''Philos''. vi. 14]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 16|15]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Pseudo-Clementine Literature/The Recognitions of Clement/Book II/Chapter 12|''Recogn''. Clem. ii. 12]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Pseudo-Clementine Literature/The Clementine Homilies/Homily II/Chapter 25|''Hom''. ii. 25]]), had probably its origin in this allegorical interpretation, according to [[Richard Adelbert Lipsius]] (1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Adelbert|last=Lipsius|title=Zur Quellenkritik des Epiphanios|location=Wien|year=1867|page=74 sqq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hestōs''===
In the Simonian ''[[Simonians#The Great Declaration|Apophasis]]'' the great ''dynamis'' (also called ''[[Nous]]'') and the great ''epinoia'' which gives birth to all things form a syzygy, from which proceeds the male-female Being, who is called ''Hestōs'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 14|''Philos''. vi. 13]]). Elsewhere ''nous'' and ''epinoia'' are called the upper-most of the three Simonian Syzygies, to which the ''Hestōs'' forms the Hebdomad: but on the other hand, ''nous'' and ''epinoia'' are identified with heaven and earth ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 10|''Philos''. vi. 9sqq.]]).

==[[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]]==
[[File:Valentinianpleroma-Matter.png|thumb|right|"Plérome de Valentin," from ''Histoire critique du Gnosticisme;'' Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. II, Plate II.]]

The most significant development of this Sophia mythos is found in the [[Valentinianism|Valentinian]] system. The descent of the Sophia from the Pleroma is ascribed after [[Plato]]'s manner to a fall, and as the final cause of this fall a state of suffering is indicated which has penetrated into the Pleroma itself. Sophia or ''Mētēr'' is in the doctrine of Valentinus the last, i.e. the thirtieth Aeon in the Pleroma, from which having fallen out, she now in remembrance of the better world which she has thus forsaken, gives birth to the Christus "with a shadow" (''meta skias tinos''). While Christus returns to the Pleroma, Sophia forms the Demiurge and this whole lower world out of the ''skia'', a right and a left principle ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XI.|Iren. ''Haer''. i. 11, 1]]). For her redemption comes down to Sophia either Christus himself ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XV.|Iren. i. 15, 3]]) or the ''Soter'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XI.|Iren. i. 11, 1]], cf. ''exc. ex Theod''. 23; 41), as the common product of the Aeons, in order to bring her back to the Pleroma and unite her again with her ''syzygos''.

===Motive===
The motive for the Sophia's fall was defined according to the [[Anatolia]]n school to have lain therein, that by her desire to know what lay beyond the limits of the knowable she had brought herself into a state of ignorance and formlessness. Her suffering extends to the whole Pleroma. But whereas this is confirmed thereby in fresh strength, the Sophia is separated from it and gives birth outside it (by means of her ''ennoia'', her recollections of the higher world), to the Christus who at once ascends into the Pleroma, and after this she produces an ''ousia amorphos'', the image of her suffering, out of which the Demiurge and the lower world come into existence; last of all looking upwards in her helpless condition, and imploring light, she finally gives birth to the ''spermata tēs ekklēsias'', the pneumatic souls. In the work of redemption the Soter comes down accompanied by the masculine angels who are to be the future ''syzygoi'' of the (feminine) souls of the Pneumatici, and introduces the Sophia along with these Pneumatici into the heavenly bridal chamber (''Exc. ex Theod.'' 29-42; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter II.|Iren. i. 2, 3]]). The same view, essentially meets us in the accounts of [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]], ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVIII.|Iren. i. 18, 4]]; cf. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XV.|15, 3]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVI.|16, 1, 2]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XV.|17, 1]]) and in the Epitomators of the Syntagma of Hippolytus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Anti-Marcion/Appendix: Against All Heresies/XII|Pseudo-Tertullian ''Haer''. 12]]; [[Philastrius|Philaster]], ''Haer''. 38).

==Achamōth==
The Italic school distinguished on the other hand a two-fold Sophia, the ''ano Sophia'' and the ''katō Sophia'' or Achamoth.

===Ptolemaeus===

====Fall====
According to the doctrine of [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemaeus]] and that of his disciples, the former of these separates herself from her ''syzygos'', the ''thelētos'' through her audacious longing after immediate Communion with the Father of all, falls into a condition of suffering, and would completely melt away in this inordinate desire, unless the ''[[Valentinianism#Horos|Horos]]'' had purified her from her suffering and established her again in the Pleroma. Her ''enthymēsis'', on the other hand, the desire which has obtained the mastery over her and the consequent suffering becomes an ''amorphos kai aneideos ousia'', which is also called an ''ektrōma'', is separated from her and is assigned a place beyond the limits of the Pleroma.

====The place of the Midst====
From her dwelling-place above the Hebdomad, in the place of the Midst, she is also called [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]] (Ὀγδοάς), and further entitled ''Mētēr'', ''Sophia'' also, and ''he [[Jerusalem|Hierousalēm]], Pneuma hagion'', and (''arsenikōs'') ''[[Kyrios]]''. In these names some partial reminiscences of the old Ophitic Gnosis are retained.

====Repentance====
The Achamoth first receives (by means of Christus and ''Pneuma hagion'' the Pair of Aeons within the Pleroma whose emanation is most recent), the ''morphōsis kat' ousian''. Left alone in her suffering she has become endued with penitent mind (''epistrophē''). Now descends the son as the common fruit of the Pleroma, gives her the ''morphōsis kata gnōsin'', and forms out of her various affections the Demiurge and the various constituents of this lower world. By his appointment the Achamoth produces the pneumatic seed (the ''ekklēsia'').

====Redemption====
The end of the world's history is here also (as above) the introduction of the lower Sophia with all her pneumatic offspring into the Pleroma, and this intimately connected with the second descent of the Soter and his transient union with the psychical Christus; then follows the marriage-union of the Achamoth with the Soter and of the pneumatic souls with the angels ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter VII.|Iren. i. 1-7]]; ''exc. ex Theod''. 43-65).

===Two-fold Sophia===
The same form of doctrine meets us also in Secundus, who is said to have been the first to have made the distinction of an upper and a lower Sophia ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XI.|Iren. i. 11, 2]]), and in the account which the ''Philosophumena'' give us of a system which most probably referred to the school of [[Heracleon]], and which also speaks of a double Sophia ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI|''Philos''. vi.]]). The name Jerusalem also for the ''exō Sophia'' meets us here ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 30|''Philos''. vi. 29]]). It finds its interpretation in the fragments of Heracleon (ap. Origen. ''in Joann.'' tom. x. 19). The name Achamoth, on the other hand, is wanting both in Hippolytus and in Heracleon. One school among the [[Marcosians]] seems also to have taught a two-fold Sophia ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVI.|Iren. i. 16, 3]]; cf. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXI.|21, 5]]).

===Etymology===
[[August Hahn]] (1819) debated whether the name ''Achamōth'' (Ἀχαμώθ) is originally derived from the Hebrew ''[[Chokhmah]]'' (חָכְמָ֑ה), in Aramaic ''Ḥachmūth'' or whether it signifies 'She that brings forth'—'Mother.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=August|last=Hahn|title=Bardesanes gnosticus, Syrorum primus hymnologus: commentatio historico-theologica|year=1819|page=64 sqq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syriac form ''Ḥachmūth'' is testified for us as used by [[Bardesanes]] (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55), the Greek form ''Hachamōth'' is found only among the Valentinians: the name however probably belongs to the oldest Syrian Gnosis.

==[[Bardesanes]]==
Cosmogonic myths play their part also in the doctrine of [[Bardesanes]]. The ''locus foedus'' whereon the gods (or Aeons) measured and founded Paradise (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55) is the same as the impure ''mētra'', which [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephraim]] is ashamed even to name (cf. also Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 14). The creation of the world is brought to pass through the son of the living one and the Rūha d' Qudshā, the Holy Spirit, with whom Ḥachmūth is identical, but in combination with "creatures," i.e. subordinate beings which co-operate with them (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 3). It is not expressly so said, and yet at the same time is the most probable assumption, that as was the case with the father and mother so also their offspring the son of the Living One, and the Rūha d' Qudshā or Ḥachmūth, are to be regarded as a Syzygy. This last (the Ḥachmūth) brings forth the two daughters, the "Shame of the Dry Land" i.e. the ''mētra'', and the "Image of the Waters" i.e. the ''Aquatilis Corporis typus'', which is mentioned in connection with the Ophitic Sophia (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55). Beside which, in a passage evidently referring to Bardesanes, air, fire, water, and darkness are mentioned as aeons (Īthyē: ''Hymn'' 41) These are probably the "Creatures" to which in association with the Son and the Rūha d' Qudshā, Bardesanes is said to have assigned the creation of the world.

Though much still remains dark as to the doctrine of Bardesanes we cannot nevertheless have any right to set simply aside the statements of Ephraim, who remains the oldest Syrian source for our knowledge of the doctrine of this Syrian Gnostic, and deserves therefore our chief attentions. Bardesanes, according to Ephraim, is able also to tell of the wife or maiden who having sunk down from the Upper Paradise offers up prayers in her dereliction for help from above, and on being heard returns to the joys of the Upper Paradise (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55).

==''Acts of Thomas''==
These statements of Ephraim are further supplemented by the ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'' in which various hymns have been preserved which are either compositions of Bardesanes himself, or at any rate are productions of his school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Adelbert|last= Lipsius|title=Apocrypha Apostelgeschichten|volume=I|pages=292–321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddJJAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=1883|publisher=C.A. Schwetschke und sohn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hymn of the Pearl''===
In the Syriac text of the Acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=William Wright (orientalist)|first=William|last=Wright|title=Apocryphal Acts of Apostles|year=1871|pages=238–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; we find the ''[[Hymn of the Pearl]]'', where the soul which has been sent down from her heavenly home to fetch the pearl guarded by the serpent, but has forgotten here below her heavenly mission until she is reminded of it by a letter from "the father, the mother, and the brother," performs her task, receives back again her glorious dress, and returns to her old home.

===''Ode to the Sophia''===
Of the other hymns which are preserved in the Greek version more faithfully than in the Syriac text which has undergone Catholic revision, the first deserving of notice is the ''Ode to the Sophia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Alfred Maximilien Bonnet|first=Alfred Maximilien|last=Bonnet|title=Supplementum Codicis apocryphi|location=Leipsic|year=1883|volume=I|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaUMAAAAIAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8|title=The Wedding-Song of Wisdom|volume=Volume 11 of Echoes From the Gnosis|first=G.R.S.|last=Mead|publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society|year=1908|location=London and Benares}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes the marriage of the "maiden" with her heavenly bridegroom and her introduction into the Upper Realm of Light. This "maiden," called "daughter of light," is not as the Catholic reviser supposes the Church, but Ḥachmūth (Sophia) over whose head the "king," i.e. the father of the living ones, sits enthroned; her bridegroom is, according to the most probable interpretation, the son of the living one, i.e. Christ. With her the living Ones i.e. pneumatic souls enter into the Pleroma and receive the glorious light of the living Father and praise along with "the living spirit" the "father of truth" and the "mother of wisdom."

===First prayer of consecration===
The Sophia is also invoked in the first prayer of consecration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Maximilien Bonnet|Bonnet]], p. 20 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; She is there called the "merciful mother," the "consort of the masculine one," "revealant of the perfect mysteries," "Mother of the Seven Houses," "who finds rest in the eighth house," i.e. in the Ogdoad. In the second Prayer of Consecration&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; she is also designated, the "perfect Mercy" and "Consort of the Masculine One," but is also called "Holy Spirit" (Syriac ''Rūha d' Qudshā'') "Revealant of the Mysteries of the whole Magnitude," "hidden Mother," "She who knows the Mysteries of the Elect," and "she who partakes in the conflicts of the noble Agonistes" (i.e. of Christ, cf. ''exc. ex Theod''. 58 ''ho megas agōnistēs Iēsous'').

There is further a direct reminiscence of the doctrine of Bardesanes when she is invoked as the Holy Dove which has given birth to the two twins, i.e. the two daughters of the Rūha d' Qudshā (ap. Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55).

==''Pistis Sophia''==
A special and richly coloured development is given to the mythical form of the Sophia of the Gnostic Book ''[[Pistis Sophia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pistis sophia: opus gnosticum Valentino adiudicatum|editor1-first=Julius Heinrich|editor1-last=Petermann|editor2-first=Moritz Gotthilf|editor2-last=Schwartze|location=Berlin|year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two first books of this writing to which the name ''Pistis Sophia'' properly belongs, treat for the greater part (pp.&amp;nbsp;42–181) of the fall, the Repentance, and the Redemption of the Sophia.

===Fall===
She has by the ordinance of higher powers obtained an insight into the dwelling-place appropriated to her in the spiritual world, namely, the ''thēsauros lucis'' which lies beyond the XIIIth Aeon. By her endeavours to direct thither her upward flight, she draws upon herself the enmity of the ''Authadēs'', Archon of the XIIIth Aeon, and of the Archons of the XII Aeons under him; by these she is enticed down into the depths of chaos, and is there tormented in the greatest possible variety of ways, in order that she may thus incur the loss of her light-nature.

===Repentance===
In her utmost need she addresses thirteen penitent prayers (''metanoiai'') to the Upper Light. Step by step she is led upwards by Christus into the higher regions, though she still remains obnoxious to the assaults of the Archons, and is, after offering her XIIIth ''Metanoia'', more vehemently attacked than ever, until at length Christus leads her down into an intermediate place below the XIIIth Aeon, where she remains until the consummation of the world, and sends up grateful hymns of praise and thanksgiving.

===Redemption===
The earthly work of redemption having been at length accomplished, the Sophia returns to her original celestial home. The peculiar feature in this representation consists in the further development of the philosophical ideas which find general expression in the Sophia mythos. According to [[Karl Reinhold von Köstlin]] (1854), Sophia is here not merely, as with Valentinus, the representative of the longing which the finite spirit feels for the knowledge of the infinite, but at the same time a type or pattern of faith, of repentance, and of hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Karl Reinhold von|last=Köstlin|title=Das Gnostische System des Buches Pistis Sophia''|editor1-last=Baur|editor1-first=F.C.|editor2-last=Zeller|editor2-first=Eduard|journal=Theol. Jahrbücher|year=1854|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her restoration she announces to her companions the twofold truth that, while every attempt to overstep the divinely ordained limits, has for its consequence suffering and punishment, so, on the other hand, the divine compassion is ever ready to vouchsafe pardon to the penitent.

===Light-Maiden===
We have a further reminiscence of the Sophia of the older Gnostic systems in what is said in the book ''Pistis Sophia'' of the Light-Maiden (''parthenos lucis''), who is there clearly distinguished from the Sophia herself, and appears as the archetype of [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the [[Constellation]] [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Reinhold von Köstlin|Köstlin]], p. 57 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; The station which she holds is in the place of the midst, above the habitation assigned to the Sophia in the XIIIth Aeon. She is the judge of (departed) souls, either opening for them or closing against them the portals of the light-realm (pp.&amp;nbsp;194–295). Under her stand yet seven other light-maidens with similar functions, who impart to pious souls their final consecrations (p.&amp;nbsp;291 sq. 327 sq. 334). From the place of the ''parthenos lucis'' comes the sun-dragon, which is daily borne along by four light-powers in the shape of white horses, and so makes his circuit round the earth (p.&amp;nbsp;183, cf. p.&amp;nbsp;18, 309).

==[[Manichaeism]]==
This light-maiden (''parthenos tou phōtos'') encounters us also among the [[Manichaeans]] as exciting the impure desires of the Daemons, and thereby setting free the light which has hitherto been held down by the power of darkness (''Dispuiat. Archelai et Manetis'', c. 8, n. 11; Theodoret., h. f. I. 26).&lt;ref&gt;Anathemat. Manich. ap. Cotelier on the ''Recogn.'' Clement IV., 27 ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Johann Karl Thilo|editor-first=Johann Karl|editor-last=Thilo|title=Acta S. Thomae apostoli from the Paris Codex|location=Leipzig|publisher=Vogel|year=1823|page=128 sqq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Ferdinand Christian Baur|first=Ferdinand Christian|last=Baur|title=Die Manichäische Religionssystem|year=1831|page=219 sqq}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the place of the Gnostic Sophia is among Manichaeans taken by the "Mother of Life" (''mētēr tēs zōēs''), and by the [[Anima mundi|World-Soul]] (''psychē hapantōn''), which on occasions is distinguished from the Life-Mother, and is regarded as diffused through all living creatures, whose deliverance from the realm of darkness constitutes the whole of the world's history ([[Titus of Bostra]], ''adv. Manich''. I., 29, 36, ed. Lagarde, p.&amp;nbsp;17 sqq. 23; [[Alexander Lycopolitus]] c. 3; Epiphan. ''Haer''. 66, 24; ''Acta dispatat. Archelai et Manetis'', c. 7 sq. et passim).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Baur, p. 51 sqq. 64, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gustav|last=Flügel|title=Mani, seine Lehren und seine Schriften. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Manichäismus|year=1862|page=201 sq. 210, 233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their return to the world of light is described in the famous ''Canticum Amatorium'' (ap. Augustin. c. Faust, iv. 5 sqq).

==[[Nag Hammadi]] texts==
In ''[[On the Origin of the World (Nag Hammadi)|On the Origin of the World]]'', Sophia is depicted as the ultimate destroyer of this material universe, [[Yaldabaoth]] and all his Heavens:

{{Quote|She [Sophia] will cast them down into the abyss. They [the Archons] will be obliterated because of their wickedness. For they will come to be like volcanoes and consume one another until they perish at the hand of the prime parent. When he has destroyed them, he will turn against himself and destroy himself until he ceases to exist. And their heavens will fall one upon the next and their forces will be consumed by fire. Their eternal realms, too, will be overturned. And his heaven will fall and break in two. His [...] will fall down upon the [...] support them; they will fall into the abyss, and the abyss will be overturned. The light will [...] the darkness and obliterate it: it will be like something that never was.}}

==Mythology==
[[Carl Jung]] linked the figure of Sophia to the highest archetype of the [[Anima and animus|anima]] in depth psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jung and the Human Psyche: An Understandable Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjCb8rbaaK8C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ovVLPhNQK0&amp;sig=x2A_BlCyjg_mgolf1THqS9bZQe4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K486ULOgFvO_2QXD4oCYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|first=M.A.|last=Mattoon
|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|ISBN=1583911103|page=55 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archetypal fall and recovery of Sophia is additionally linked (to a varying degree) to many different myths and stories (see [[damsel in distress]]). Among these are:
*[[Isis]], who while still in the cosmic womb, brings forth the flawed Elder [[Horus]] without a consort&lt;ref&gt;As told by [[Plutarch]], [http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm ''On the Worship of Isis and Osiris'', LIV, 5-6]. See {{Citation | authorlink = G.R.S.

*The abduction and rescue of [[Helen of Troy]]
*[[Persephone]] and her descent into [[Hades]], from which she returns to life [but is bound to return to Hades for 6 months every year]
*The fall of [[Eve]] and the birth of Christ through the [[Virgin Mary]]
*The descent of [[Orpheus]] into the underworld to rescue his wife, [[Eurydice]]
*The return of [[Odysseus]] to his kingdom, [[Ithaca]], to reclaim his wife, [[Penelope]]
*The rescue of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] by [[Perseus]]
*[[Ishtar]]'s descent to the Underworld, in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]
*[[Pandora]]
* [[Cinderella]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]]
*The [[Saint George and the Dragon|slaying of the Dragon]] by [[St. George]] to rescue the Princess
*The rescue of the kidnapped [[Sita]] by her husband, the god-king [[Rama]], with the help of [[Hanuman]] in the [[Ramayana]]

Note that many of these myths have alternative psychological interpretations.  For example, Jungian psychologist [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] interpreted fairy tales like Sleeping Beauty as symbolizing the 'rescue' or reintegration of the [[anima and animus|anima]], the more 'feminine' part of a man's unconscious,  but not wisdom or ''sophia'' per se.

[[File:Comic balloons 4 types 1x4.svg|thumb|The four most common speech balloons, top to bottom: speech, whisper, thought, scream.]]

'''Speech balloons''' (also '''speech bubbles''', '''dialogue balloons''' or '''word balloons''') are a graphic convention used most commonly in [[comic book]]s, [[comic]]s and [[cartoon]]s to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing the speech or thoughts of a given character in the comic. There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a '''thought bubble'''.

==History==
[[Image:Strigel 1506-detail.jpg|thumb|Before the 20th century,{{specify}} speech was depicted using bands, flags, scrolls, or sheets of paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugpowder.com/andy/e.speechballoons.evolution.html Evolution of speech balloons].

One of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the "[[speech scroll]]s", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in [[Mesoamerican]] art between 600 and 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper| author=Hull, Kerry Michael| title=Verbal Art and Performance in Ch’orti’ and Maya Hieroglyphic Writing| year=2003| url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012021647/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| archivedate=2006-10-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as "banderoles") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the [[American Revolution]] (including some published by [[Benjamin Franklin]]) often used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/erelrev.htm|title=Religion and the American Revolution, Divining America, TeacherServe®, National Humanities Center|work=rtp.nc.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/wood/ykid/illustrated.htm The Yellow Kid on paper and stage, Contemporary illustrations]''. Retrieved October 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation.&lt;ref name=ArtOfCaricature&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofcaricature00wrig#page/134/mode/2up/ The Art of Caricature], p. 134, by Grant Wright; published September 1904, by Baker &amp; Taylor Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the [[comics]] industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.

[[Richard F. Outcault]]'s [[Yellow Kid]] is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' and the early [[Tarzan (comics)|''Tarzan'' comic strip]] in the 1930s. In Europe, where [[text comics]] were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like [[Alain Saint-Ogan]]'s ''[[Zig et Puce]]'' (1925), [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (1929)  and [[Rob-Vel]]'s ''[[Spirou (comics)|Spirou]]'' (1938).

==Popular forms==

===Speech bubbles===
The most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.

When one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in [[Mad Magazine]], due to its "[[call-and-response]]" dialogue-based humor.

An off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being "off screen") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in [[manga]], has the tail pointing ''into'' the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of [[Marjane Satrapi]] (author of ''[[Persepolis (graphic novel)|Persepolis]]'').

In American &lt;!--- Is the description American necessary? Isn't this technique also used in manga, etc? ---&gt; comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the [[point of view (literature)|viewpoint character]], often as an unspecified member of a crowd.

Characters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to [[voice-over]] in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast.  In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or [[quotation mark]]s.

===Thought bubbles===
Thought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the "fuzzy" bubble.

The chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, [[cloud]]-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.

Often animal characters like [[Snoopy]] and [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] "talk" using thought bubbles.  Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.

Another, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the "fuzzy" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as [[Ken Akamatsu]]), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.

Writers and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.

===Other forms===
The shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:
*''Scream bubbles'' indicate a character is screaming or shouting, usually with a jagged outline or a thicker line which can be colored.  Their lettering is usually larger or bolder than normal.
*''Broadcast bubbles'' (also known as ''radio bubbles'') may have a jagged tail like the conventional drawing of a lightning flash and either a squared-off or jagged outline. Letters are sometimes italicised without also being bold. Broadcast bubbles indicate that the speaker is communicating through an electronic device, such as a radio or television, or is robotic.
*''Whisper bubbles'' are usually drawn with a dashed (dotted) outline, smaller font or gray lettering to indicate the tone is softer, as most speech is printed in black. &lt;BR&gt;Another form, sometimes encountered in manga, looks like an occidental thought bubble.
*''Icicle bubbles'' have jagged "icicles" on the lower edge, representing "cold" hostility.  
*''Monster bubbles'' have blood or slime dripping from them.
*''Colored bubbles'' can be used to convey the emotion that goes with the speech, such as red for anger or green for envy. This style is seldom used in modern comics. Alternatively (especially in online-published comics), colours can be used to provide an additional cue about who is speaking. Main characters often have individual thematic colours, and their speech bubbles are frequently tinted with their colour; especially in situations when there are no characters visible for speech bubbles to point to.

==Captions==
Captions are generally used for [[narration]] purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.&lt;ref name=Piekos&gt;Piekos, Nate. [http://www.blambot.com/articles_grammar.shtml "Comic Book Grammar &amp; Tradition" (Updated 2015)], Blambot website. Accessed Jan. 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist-specific variations==
[[Image:YellowKid.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Yellow Kid]]'s words appear on his shirt]]

Some characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the [[Yellow Kid]], an early [[United States|American]] [[comic strip]]. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run [[Shirt Tales#TV series|American animated TV series of the early 1980s]] used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the "T-shirts" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. 

Also noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by [[Dave Sim]] for his comic ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]''. Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.

An early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was [[Walt Kelly]], in his ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in [[blackletter]], P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, "Mr. Pig" (a take on [[Nikita Khrushchev]]) speaks in [[faux Cyrillic]], etc.

In the famous French comic series ''[[Asterix]]'', [[René Goscinny|Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]] use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in [[blackletter]], Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with "Nørdic åccents", Egyptians in faux [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''. The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.

Font variation is a common tactic in comics. ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' series, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Letterer|lettered]] by [[Todd Klein]], features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven [[Characters of The Sandman#Matthew|Matthew]] speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|title= Comics You Should Own – ''Sandman''|first= Greg|last= Burgas|date= January 7, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140410022316/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|archivedate= April 10, 2014|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'''s recurring ''[[Monroe (comic strip)|Monroe]]'' comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.

In [[manga]], there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice.  [[Characters of Negima (16-31)#Satsuki Yotsuba|Satsuki Yotsuba]] in the manga series [[Negima]] is notable because she speaks almost ''entirely'' in side scribble.

==Graphic symbols==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Speech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.

===Punctuation marks===
One of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big [[question mark]] (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An [[exclamation mark]] (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.

In [[manga]], the [[ellipsis]] (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the [[Japan]]ese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition.  Japanese even has a sound effect for "deafening silence", {{nihongo|''shiin''|シーン|}}.

===Foreign languages===
In many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by [[Brackets|angle brackets]] or chevrons {{angbr|like this}}.

[[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s series about [[Love and Rockets (comics)|Palomar]] is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a [[Hispanic]] country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main [[Hispanophone]] characters in the series.

Some comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in ''Asterix''.

Another convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, [[Asterix and the Goths|''Asterix''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Goths]] speak in [[blackletter]].

Since the Japanese language uses [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two writing directionalities]] (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.

===The big Z===
It is a convention in [[United States|American]] comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to [[Rudolph Dirks]]' early 20th-century strip ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil. [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/42997/why-does-z-stand-for-snoring-and-how-do-other/ "The Straight Dope: Why Does Z Stand for Snoring? And how do other languages represent the sound?,"] ''Washington City Paper'' (July 27, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strips.

Originally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the [[English language]], but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries.  An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Megan. [https://www.wired.com/2015/05/using-emoji-wrong/ "WE’RE ALL USING THESE EMOJI WRONG,"] ''Wired'' (05.21.15).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawings within the speech bubble===
Singing characters usually have [[musical note]]s drawn into their word balloons. [[Archie Comics]]' [[Melody Valentine]], a character in their ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.

The above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the ''Asterix'' series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually  preceding a violent outburst by the same character).

A stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.

[[Light bulbs]] are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.

In the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&amp;%$@*$#), sometimes called [[The Lexicon of Comicana|grawlixes]]. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is [[censorship|censored]] by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.

One example is the [[Spain|Spanish]] ''[[Mortadelo]]'' series, created by [[Francisco Ibáñez Talavera|Francisco Ibáñez]]. Although not specifically addressed to children, ''Mortadelo'' was born during [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[dictatorship]], when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.

When ''Mortadelo'' was portrayed on film by Spanish director [[Javier Fesser]] in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: "When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?"

==Order==
In order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in [[English language|English]], the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are "stacked", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.

==Lettering==
Traditionally, a cartoonist or occupational [[letterer]] would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand.  A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs.  The [[font]]s used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.

Traditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in [[upper-case]], with a few exceptions:
* Name particles such as ''de'' and ''von'', and the "c" in a [[surname]] of Scottish or Irish origin starting with ''Mc''
* To indicate a frightened or quiet manner of speech
* An interjection such as "er", "um", etc.

When hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, Drew. [http://multiversitycomics.com/columns/looking-at-lettering-caps-vs-mixed-case/ "Looking at Lettering: CAPS vs Mixed Case,"] ''Multiversity Comics'' (April 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing.  Since the mid-1980s, [[mixed case]] lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).

From 2002–2004, [[Marvel Comics]] experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.

In many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, [[serif]] versions of "I" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a [[sanserif]] (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun "I" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as [[Blambot]]'s "DigitalStrip.ttf" and "AnimeAce.ttf" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.

==Substance of balloons==
In several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous [[meta-]]like purposes. In ''[[Peanuts]]'', for example, the notes played by [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip ''[[Sturmtruppen]]'' they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an [[Archie (comics)|Archie]] comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.

In the Flemish ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the [[pensieve]] in the [[Harry Potter]] series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at [[supersonic]] speed.

In the novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'', the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.

==Computer-generated speech balloons==
Many digital artists generate speech balloons with [[List of vector graphics editors|general-purpose illustration software]].  Products like [[Comic Book Creator]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Comic Life]] for [[Mac OS X]] and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.

[[Image:THES-Heptapyrgion spolia 3.jpg|thumb|Fragments of Greek inscriptions in the masonry of the Ottoman [[Heptapyrgion (Thessaloniki)|Heptapyrgion]] (Yedikule) fortress (1431), [[Thessaloniki]].]]

'''''Spolia''''' ([[Latin]], 'spoils'), repurposed building stone for new construction, or decorative sculpture reused in new monuments, is the result of an ancient and widespread practice whereby stone that has been quarried, cut, and used in a built structure, is carried away to be used elsewhere.  The practice is of particular interest to historians, archaeologists and architectural historians since the gravestones, monuments and architectural fragments of antiquity are frequently found embedded in structures built centuries or millennia later.

Archaeologist [[Philip A. Barker]] gives the example of a late Roman period (probably 1st century) tombstone from [[Wroxeter]] that could be seen to have been cut down and undergone weathering while in use as part of an exterior wall, then, possibly as late as the 5th century, reinscribed for reuse as a tombstone.&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=A. Philip|title=Techniques of Archaeological Excavation|date=1977 |publisher=Routledge|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was common in [[late antiquity]].  Entire obsolete structures, including underground foundations, are known to have been demolished to enable the construction of new structures.  According to Baxter, two churches in Worcester  (one 7th century and one 10th,) are thought to have been deconstructed so that  their building stone could be repurposed by [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|St. Wulstan]] to construct a cathedral in 1084.&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;  And the parish churches of [[Atcham]], [[Wroxeter]], and [[Upton Magna]] are largely built of stone taken from the buildings of [[Viroconium Cornoviorum]].&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;

Roman examples include the [[Arch of Janus]], the earlier imperial reliefs reused on the [[Arch of Constantine]], the colonnade of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]; examples in Byzantine territories include the exterior sculpture on the [[Panagia Gorgoepikoos]] church in [[Athens]]); in the medieval West Roman tiles were reused in [[St Albans Cathedral]], in much of the medieval architecture of [[Colchester]], porphyry columns in the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], and the colonnade of the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]]. Spolia in the medieval Islamic world include the columns in the [[hypostyle]] mosques of [[Kairouan]], [[Great Mosque of Gaza|Gaza]] and [[Mezquita|Cordoba]].
[[Image:Trastevere 1.jpg|thumb|left|Re-used reliefs as decoration in Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome]]
Although the modern literature on spolia is primarily concerned with these and other medieval examples, the practice is common and there is probably no period of art history in which evidence for "spoliation" could not be found.

Interpretations of spolia generally alternate between the "ideological" and the "pragmatic." Ideological readings might describe the re-use of art and architectural elements from former empires or dynasties as triumphant (that is, literally as the display of "spoils" or "booty" of the conquered) or as revivalist (proclaiming the renovation of past imperial glories). Pragmatic readings emphasize the utility of re-used materials: if there is a good supply of old marble columns available, for example, there is no need to produce new ones. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there is certainly no one approach that can account for all instances of spoliation, as each instance must be evaluated within its particular historical context.

Spolia had [[apotropaic]] spiritual value. Clive Foss has noted&lt;ref&gt;Foss, "Late Antique and Byzantine Ankara" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''31''' (1977:65).&lt;/ref&gt; that in the fifth century crosses were inscribed on the stones of pagan buildings, as at [[Ankara#Roman history|Ankara]], where crosses were inscribed on the walls of the temple of [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]] and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Religion and Imperium under Augustus|Augustus]]. Clive Foss suggests that the purpose of this was to ward off the ''[[daimon]]es'' that lurked in stones that had been consecrated to pagan usage.

Liz James extends Foss's observation&lt;ref&gt;James, "'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople" ''Gesta'' '''35'''.1 (1996:12–20) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in noting that statues, laid on their sides and facing outwards, were carefully incorporated in Ankara's city walls in the Seventh century, at a time when spolia were also being built into city walls in [[Miletus]], [[Sardis]], [[Ephesus]] and [[Pergamum]]: "laying a statue on its side places it and the power it represents under control. It is a way of acquiring the power of rival gods for one's own benefit," Liz James observes. "Inscribing a cross works similarly, sealing the object for Christian purposes".&lt;ref&gt;James 1996, noting O. Hjort, "Augustus Christianus—Livia Christiana: ''Sphragis'' and Roman portrait sculpture", in L. Ryden and J.O. Rosenqvist, ''Aspects of Late Antiquity and Early Byzantium'' (Transactions of the Swedish Institute in Istanbul, IV) 1993:93–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa, 2012#District 4}}
Iowa lost a district as a result of the 2010 census. King's district was renumbered the 4th, and pushed well to the east, absorbing [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]] and [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]]. This placed King and his predecessor, Latham, in the same district. Latham opted to move to the reconfigured 3rd District to challenge Democratic incumbent [[Leonard Boswell]]. The reconfigured district was, at least on paper, much more competitive than King's old district. The old 5th had a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+9, while the new 4th has a PVI of R+4. The new 4th was also mostly new to him; he retained only 45% of his former territory. Geographically it was more Latham's district than King's; it closely resembled the territory that Latham had represented from 1995 to 2003.

Soon afterward, former Iowa first lady [[Christie Vilsack]], the wife of former governor and then current U.S. agriculture secretary [[Tom Vilsack]], announced she was moving to the new 4th to challenge King. King received the endorsement of [[Mitt Romney]], who said, "I'm looking here at Steve King because this man needs to be your congressman again.

King is considered an outspoken fiscal and social conservative.

King sponsored legislation to ban abortion of a fetus that has a detectable heartbeat, which can in some cases occur as early as 6 weeks (before many women know they are pregnant).

===Animal rights===
In February 2010, King [[twitter|tweeted]] about chasing and shooting a raccoon that had tried to enter his house during a blizzard, prompting criticism from animal rights groups. He defended his actions, saying the animal might have been [[rabies|rabid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hayworth, Bret |title=King's raccoon run-in draws PETA's scorn |url=http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/article_07591d82-1064-58d2-aabf-3b8d6b78f953.html|work=Sioux City Journal |date=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, King opposed the McGovern Amendment (to the 2012 [[United States farm bill|Farm Bill]]) to establish [[misdemeanor]] penalties for knowingly attending an organized [[blood sport|animal fight]] and [[felony]] penalties for bringing a minor to such a fight. He was also one of 39 members of the House to vote against an upgrade of penalties for transporting fighting animals across state lines in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The HSUS Calls Out Steve King on Opposition to Anti-Dogfighting Bill|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2012/08/steve_king_dogfighting_081212.html|publisher=The U.S. Humane Society|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; King received a score of zero on the 2012 [[Humane Society]] Legislative Fund's ''Humane Scorecard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humane Scorecard|url=http://www.hslf.org/pdfs/HumaneScorecard-2012-online-preview.pdf|work=Final Report for the 112th Congress Preview Version—September 2012|publisher=Humane Society Legislative Fund|accessdate=November 30, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123084528/http://www.hslf.org/pdfs/HumaneScorecard-2012-online-preview.pdf|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.wn.com/view/2013/05/16/Congressional_Votes_on_Farm_Bill_Bring_Good_News_Bad_News_fo/#/related_news|title=Congressional Votes on Farm Bill Bring Good News, Bad News for Animals (The Humane Society of the United States)|work=World News|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agri-pulse.com/House-ag-committee-passes-farm-bill-05152013.asp|title=House Agriculture Committee passes new farm bill|publisher=Agri-pulse.com|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, he put out a video clarifying his position, stating that it would be putting animals above humans if it were legal to watch humans fight but not animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rep.

In July 2012, King introduced an amendment to the House Farm Bill that would legalize previously banned [[animal agriculture]] practices such as [[docking (animal)|tail-docking]], putting arsenic in chicken feed, and keeping impregnated pigs in small crates. "My language wipes out everything they've done with pork and veal," King said of his amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressman brags his bill will 'wipe out' animal rights laws|url=http://now.msn.com/rep-steve-king-sponsored-an-amendment-to-reverse-animal-rights-laws?ocid=vt_twmsnnow|publisher=MSN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012110130/http://now.msn.com/rep-steve-king-sponsored-an-amendment-to-reverse-animal-rights-laws?ocid=vt_twmsnnow|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) President [[Wayne Pacelle]] said the measure could nullify "any laws to protect animals, and perhaps ... laws to protect the environment, workers, or public safety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=John|title=Will the Farm Bill Nullify Laws Against Animal Cruelty?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-robbins/farm-bill-animal-cruelty_b_1692264.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, King introduced another amendment to the House Farm Bill, the Protect Interstate Commerce Act (PICA), saying, "PICA blocks states from requiring 'free range' eggs or 'free range' pork."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steveking.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4440:two-king-amendments-included-in-farm-bill&amp;catid=71:press-releases&amp;Itemid=300164 |title=Congressman Steve King &amp;#124; Representing the 4th District of Iowa |website=Steveking.house.gov |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the controversial provision was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Solomon (January 27, 2014).

===LGBT rights===
On April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court [[Varnum v. Brien|ruled]] unanimously that a [[Same sex marriage in Iowa|state ban]] on same-sex marriage violated Iowa's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090403/NEWS/90403010|title=Unanimous ruling: Iowa marriage no longer limited to one man, one woman|work=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=January 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629165642/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090403/NEWS/90403010|archivedate=June 29, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; King soon commented that the justices "should resign from their position" and the state legislature "must also enact marriage license residency requirements so that Iowa does not become the gay marriage Mecca."&lt;ref&gt;[http://iowaindependent.com/13513/king-fears-iowa-to-become-gay-marriage-mecca]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409132954/http://iowaindependent.com/13513/king-fears-iowa-to-become-gay-marriage-mecca|date=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; King, along with others, mounted a campaign against the three Iowa Supreme Court justices who were up for retention and had ruled on the gay marriage case. King bought $80,000 of radio advertising across the state calling for Iowans to vote against their retention. None of the three were retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theiowarepublican.com/home/2010/11/04/the-winners-of-the-2010-election/ |title=The Winners of the 2010 Election |publisher=The Iowa Republican |date=November 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201085224/http://theiowarepublican.com/home/2010/11/04/the-winners-of-the-2010-election/ |archive-date=December 1, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Supreme Court's 2015 decision ''[[Obergefell v.

In January 2017, King said that in the wake of the 2016 presidential election "it has become abundantly clear that the American people have overwhelmingly rejected Obamacare time and time again" and called for congressional Republicans to "take swift action to fulfill our promise to We the People and repeal this unconstitutional and egregious law passed by hook, crook and legislative shenanigan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.stormlakepilottribune.com/story/2375303.html|title=King, Grassley celebrate efforts to kill Affordable Health Care Act|date=January 9, 2017|publisher=stormlakepilottribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, King said he had moved from supporting the [[American Health Care Act]], the Republican replacement to the Affordable Care Act, to being unsure as a result of benefits such as emergency services, hospitalization and prescription drugs that were added following his backing of the measure: "Once they negotiated [essential health benefits] with the Freedom Caucus and Tuesday Group, it is hard for me to imagine they will bring that language in the Senate, or that it will be effective because they diluted this thing substantially." King added that he and Trump agreed on the need for the federal government to not have a role in health insurance and that Republicans would not have had difficulty repealing the Affordable Care Act had the party prioritized its replacement within the first week of the 115th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/03/politics/steve-king-health-care-cnntv/index.html|title=Rep.

===Hurricane Katrina aid===
King gained prominence as one of 11 in Congress to vote against the $52 billion [[Hurricane Katrina]] aid package, claiming fiscal responsibility and a need for a comprehensive plan for spending aid money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/30/steve-king-hurricane-katrina-aid_n_2045172.html|title=Steve King: Opposing Aid For Hurricane Katrina 'A Good Vote'|last=Foley|first=Elise|date=2012-10-30|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political lobbying===
On February 26, 2010, King went to the House floor to protest Democrats' handling of health care reform and said, "Lobbyists do a very effective and useful job on this Hill ... There's a credibility there in that arena that I think somebody needs to stand up for the lobby, and it is a matter of providing a lot of valuable information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Vaida| first=Bara| title=Rep.

In October 2018, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, [[Steve Stivers]], condemned King as a racist, saying that King's actions and comments were "completely inappropriate" and constituted "white supremacy and hate."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2018-elections/2018/10/31/ted-cruz-stops-short-condemning-steve-king-racist-retweeting-neo-nazi-endorsing-white-supremacist|title=Ted Cruz calls Steve King support of white supremacists 'divisive,' stops short of condemning him|date=2018-10-31|work=Dallas News|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRCC said it would not help King in his 2018 re-election efforts.&lt;ref name="Mangan" /&gt; Representative [[Carlos Curbelo]] described King's comments and actions as "disgusting" and said that he would never vote for someone like King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/414085-gop-lawmaker-i-would-never-vote-for-someone-like-steve-king|title=Rep.

=== Immigration and multiculturalism ===
King is a staunch opponent of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] and [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/steve-king-neonazi-tweet-republicans.html|title=Steve King's Inflammatory Behavior Is Met With Silence From G.O.P.|last=|first=|date=|work=|accessdate=2018-06-16|language=en|quote=In Mr. King's case, his eight-term incumbency and his own history of racist comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/13/14908184/steve-king-racist|title=Rep.

In April 2006, when asked if "the US economy simply couldn't function without" the presence of illegal immigrants, King said that he rejected that position "categorically". He said the 77.5 million people between the ages of 16 and 65 in the United States who are not part of the workforce "could be put to work and we could invent machines to replace the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lustig, interviewing King on the [[BBC]]'s programme 'The World Tonight' on BBC Radio 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, King called for an electrified fence on the US border, noting that such fences were successful in containing livestock.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

In July 2013, speaking about proposed immigration legislation, King said of undocumented immigrants: "For every one who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds—and they've got calves the size of [[cantaloupe]]s because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/king-norquist-attacks-immigration/2013/07/18/id/515882#ixzz2ZzUshoF4|title=Rep.

In July 2015, referencing HUD secretary [[Julian Castro]]'s remarks on how poorly the Republican Party was doing with Hispanic voters, King responded, "What does Julian Castro know?

King displayed the [[Confederate flag]] on his office desk in 2016, despite the fact that Iowa was part of the Union during the American Civil War. He removed it after a Confederate flag-waver shot two Iowa police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/king-removed-confederate-flag-from-desk-after-iowa-police-slayings/article_fe58eaad-142f-555f-8ab5-1519a16c1dc2.html|title=King removed Confederate flag from desk after Iowa police slayings|first=Bret|last=Hayworth|publisher=Sioux City Journal|date=March 8, 2017|access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, King wrote "culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies." When asked about his comments, King stood by them, saying: "you need to teach your children your values" and "with the inter-marriage, I'd like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same".&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/steve-king-republican-geert-wilders-tweet-wants-everyone-to-look-the-same-a7627216.html|title=Republican politician who sent anti-Islam tweet wants 'an America so homogeneous that we look the same'|work=The Independent|accessdate=2018-08-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was rebuked by members of his own party, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, but praised by white supremacist [[David Duke]] and ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'', a neo-Nazi website.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

In July 2017, the [[House Appropriations Committee]] voted to fund the [[Mexico–United States barrier|US-Mexico border wall]], allocating $1.6 billion for it. King called for an additional $5 billion for the wall, to be paid for with federal dollars coming from [[Planned Parenthood]], [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]], and other federal welfare programs,&lt;ref name="Eberhardt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/341626-rep-steve-king-build-mexico-border-wall-with-funds-from-planned-parenthood|title=Steve King: Build border wall with funds from Planned Parenthood, food stamps|last1=Eberhardt|first1=Robin|date=July 12, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2017|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "I would find half of a billion of dollars of that right out of Planned Parenthood's budget, and the rest of it could come out of food stamps and the entitlements that are being spread out for people who have not worked in three generations."&lt;ref name="Glassman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/07/12/steve-king-says-donald-trumps-border-wall-could-be-funded-if-we-cut-food-stamps-to-pay-for-it/|title=Steve King says Donald Trump's border wall could be funded if we cut food stamps to pay for it|last1=Glassman|first1=Michael|date=July 12, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2017|publisher=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, he retweeted a comment by [[Mark Collett]], a British [[neo-Nazi]] and self-described admirer of Hitler, about Europe "waking up" to mass immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/06/13/a-gop-congressman-retweeted-a-self-described-nazi-sympathizer-his-party-did-not-rebuke-him/|title=A GOP congressman retweeted a self-described 'Nazi sympathizer.'

=== President Barack Obama ===&lt;!-- Everything in this section is sourced. The location of the ref=s should not indicate to the editor that anything requires further citation.  --&gt;
On March 7, 2008, during his press engagements to announce his reelection campaign, King made remarks about then U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] and his middle name "Hussein", saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't want to disparage anyone because of their race, their ethnicity, their name—whatever their religion their father might have been, I'll just say this: When you think about the optics of a Barack Obama potentially getting elected President of the United States – I mean, what does this look like to the rest of the world? What does it look like to the world of Islam? I will tell you that, if he is elected president, then the radical Islamists, the [[al-Qaida]], the radical Islamists and their supporters, will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on [[September 11 attacks|September 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spencerdailyreporter.com/story/1316727.html |title=Local News: King announced bid for fourth term (03/08/08) |work=Spencer Daily Reporter |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 10, King defended his comments to the [[Associated Press]], saying "[Obama will] certainly be viewed as a savior for them... That's why you will see them supporting him, encouraging him."&lt;ref name="Obama"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-03-10-king-obama_N.htm|title=Rep. King defends comments on Obama|date=March 11, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama said he did not take the comments too seriously, describing King as a person who thrives on making controversial statements to get media coverage. He said, "I would hope Senator McCain would want to distance himself from that kind of inflammatory and offensive remarks." The McCain campaign disavowed King's comments, saying "John McCain rejects the type of politics that degrades our civics… and obviously that extends to Congressman King's statement."&lt;ref name="Obama" /&gt;

In mid-January 2009, King acknowledged that terrorists were not dancing in the streets, adding, "They have made statements against Obama." But he also claimed that he found Obama's decision to use his middle name "Hussein" when he was to be sworn in as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|44th President of the United States]] on January 20, 2009, to be "bizarre" and "a double standard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17506.html|title=King: Obama 'bizarre' to use 'Hussein'|author=Daniel Libit|date=January 15, 2009|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, King said that Obama "has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race, on the side that favors the black person."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Racial profiling===
{{See also|Henry Louis Gates arrest controversy}}
On June 14, 2010, King said on the House floor that racial profiling is an important component of law enforcement: "Some claim that the Arizona law will bring about racial discrimination profiling. First let me say, Mr. Speaker, that profiling has always been an important component of legitimate law enforcement. If you can't profile someone, you can't use those common sense indicators that are before your very eyes. Now, I think it's wrong to use racial profiling for the reasons of discriminating against people, but it's not wrong to use race or other indicators for the sake of identifying people that are violating the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2010/06/15/king-racial-profiling-is-important-for-law-enforcement/|title=King: Racial profiling is important for law enforcement|work=The Des Moines Register|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711122529/http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2010/06/15/king-racial-profiling-is-important-for-law-enforcement/|archive-date=July 11, 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=January 8, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of profiling, King described an instance when a taxi driver would stop for him before he had to hail a cab, just because he was in a business suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/rep-steve-king-tells-congress-he-is-a-victim-of-profiling-as-a-white-man-in-a-suit/|title=Steve King – Illegal Immigration – Racial Profiling – Mediaite|date=June 15, 2010|publisher=Mediaite.com|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, on [[G. Gordon Liddy]]'s radio program, King said that Obama's policies favored black people: "The president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race—on the side that favors the black person in the case of Professor Gates and Officer Crowley."&lt;ref name=CbsJan8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20007729-503544.html|title=Steve King Says Obama "Favors the Black Person"|date=June 15, 2010|publisher=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comments on Western civilization ===
On July 18, 2016, King participated in a panel discussion on [[MSNBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/18/rep-steve-king-wonders-what-sub-groups-besides-whites-made-contributions-to-civilization/|title=Rep.

King responded, "This whole 'old white people' business does get a little tired, Charlie. I'd ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about? Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?"&lt;ref name="danielvictor"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/us/politics/steve-king-nonwhite-subgroups.html|title=What, Congressman Steve King Asks, Have Nonwhites Done for Civilization?|last=Victor|first=Daniel|date=July 18, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 19, 2016|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panel moderator [[Chris Hayes (journalist)|Chris Hayes]] later described King's comments as odious and preposterous.&lt;ref name="danielvictor" /&gt; Panel member [[April Ryan]] described them as "in-my-face racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/steve-king-white-people-republican-convention|title=Congressman Steve King: whites aided civilization more than any 'sub-groups'|last=Bixby|first=Scott|date=July 19, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That evening, King was asked about his comments during an interview with [[ABC News]]. King said he had meant to say that "Western civilization," rather than "white people," is the "superior culture": "when you describe Western civilization, that can mean much of Western civilization happens to be Caucasians. But we should not apologize for our culture or our civilization. The contributions that were made by Western civilization itself, and by Americans, by Americans of all races, stand far above the rest of the world. The Western civilization and the American civilization are a superior culture."&lt;ref&gt;Faulders, Katherine; Parkinson, John.

=== Affirmative action ===
King opposes [[affirmative action]]. He has said, "There's been legislation that's been brought through this House that sets aside benefits for women and minorities. The only people that it excludes are white men...

=== Support for far-right politics ===
On March 12, 2017, King expressed his support for [[Geert Wilders]], a [[far-right]] [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician known for his [[criticism of Islam|anti-Islam]] views, leading up to the election in the Netherlands, stating, "Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny"&lt;ref name="wilders-bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="king-nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/us/politics/steve-king-babies-civilization.html|title=Steve King, Hurling Insults at Immigrants, Is Rebuked by His Own Party|last1=STEINHAUER|first1=JENNIFER|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies," referring to his views on ending [[birthright citizenship]] and promoting "an America that's just so homogenous that we look a lot [sic] the same."&lt;ref name="wilders-bbc" /&gt; His statements received criticism from other politicians, including several Republicans, with [[Jeb Bush]] responding that "America is a nation of immigrants"; despite the backlash, King firmly defended his statements.&lt;ref name="king-nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wilders-bbc" /&gt; Others noted that King's statements were well received among [[white nationalists]], garnering support from prominent members of that community.&lt;ref name="wilders-bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="king-nyt" /&gt; The next day on CNN, King said he was referring to culture, not ethnicity, saying "It's the culture, not the blood.

King supported French right-wing populist politician, leader of the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] [[Marine Le Pen]] in the [[French presidential election, 2017|French 2017 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/SteveKingIA/status/861126549399101440|title=Steve King on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=May 8, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent her a message stating: "Our shared civilization must be saved".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

King supported [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Hungarian Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Orbán]], a right-wing populist and strong opponent of admitting migrants during the [[European migrant crisis]]. On December 8, 2017, King tweeted Orbán's quote that "Diversity is not our strength. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, 'Mixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/stevekingia/status/939117527375990790 Steve King] [[Twitter]] December 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; "Assimilation has become a dirty word to the multiculturalist Left.

On August 24, 2018, King was interviewed by the Austrian website ''Unzensuriert'' (''Uncensored''), which is connected to the country's [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]], part of the [[Kurz government]]. He agreed with the interviewer that American financier [[George Soros]] is involved with the "[[The Great Replacement conspiracy theory|Great Replacement]]", a far-right conspiracy theory that claims to have identified a plot to replace white Europeans with minorities and immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/holocaust-memorial-group-unwittingly-funded-rep-kings-meeting-with-far-right-austrians/2018/10/25/a18f4f6a-d875-11e8-83a2-d1c3da28d6b6_story.html?utm_term=.3548aff1341b|title=Rep.

King has also endorsed [[Faith Goldy]] for mayor of Toronto. Goldy has participated in a Neo-Nazi podcast.&lt;ref name="Mangan" /&gt; In response to the Goldy endorsement and King’s other racially contentious remarks, [[Land O Lakes]] ended its support for his reelection.&lt;ref name="goldy"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-10-30/land-o-lakes-pulls-financial-support-for-iowa-congressman-steve-king&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White genocide ===
''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' has claimed that King subscribes to the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]], demonstrating the existence of the view in the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/1/18/16897358/racism-donald-trump-immigration|title=The scary ideology behind Trump's immigration instincts|date=18 June 2018|publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ThinkProgress]]'' has accused King of endorsing "a slightly more genteel" version of the conspiracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/steve-king-defends-racist-tweet-urges-white-people-to-have-more-babies-7f9a319acbef/|title=Steve King went on Breitbart radio to clarify his racist tweet.

=== Antisemitism controversy in 2018 ===
In late October 2018, after the [[Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]] director [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] sent [[Paul Ryan]] an open letter calling upon him to censure King, citing King's relationship with far-right [[Freedom Party of Austria]] and other far-right groups in Europe. The letter began, "After the events of this weekend, I knew that ADL could be silent no more", and said King had engaged in [[Antisemitic canard|antisemitic smearing]] of [[George Soros]]. It concluded, "Rep. King has brought dishonor onto the House of Representatives. We strongly urge you and the congressional leadership to demonstrate your revulsion with Rep. King’s actions by stripping him of his subcommittee chairmanship and initiating proceedings to formally censure or otherwise discipline him."&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;

King responded: “These attacks are orchestrated by nasty, desperate, and dishonest fake news. Their ultimate goal is to flip the House and impeach Donald Trump. Establishment Never-Trumpers are complicit.”

'''Sustainable markets''' can be loosely defined as those that contribute to stronger livelihoods and more [[sustainable]] environments. In linking with the pursuit of ‘[[sustainable development]]’, such markets have a multiple focus on social, environmental and economic outcomes. Sustainable markets aim to reflect the true costs (or [[externalities]]) of [[natural resource]] [[Environmental degradation|degradation]], [[environmental pollution]], and promote just and [[Occupational safety and health|safe labour]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll Foundation (2015) ‘Sustainable Markets page’ http://www.skollfoundation.org/issue/sustainable-markets/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key tools ==

In transitioning to sustainable markets, formal rules sometimes called [[market governance mechanism]]s (MGMS)are key potential tools to shape and govern markets. Examples could include Fairtrade certification, sustainable reporting and metrics, payments for [[ecosystem services]] or other market-based instruments. MGMs change the behaviour of consumers, investors or producers so that their decisions result in more sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;IIED Sustainable Markets Group (2011) ‘Research prospectus – Shaping Sustainable Markets’ http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/sites/shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/files/20110520%20Research%20prospectus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; MGMs could provide economic signals or incentives, for example in pricing externalities. Regulatory mechanisms could prohibit or require certain practices by consumers or producers. Or cooperative mechanisms could create voluntary or more formal partnerships around environmental norms or standards.

== Debates ==

There are a number of contentious issues and ongoing debates around sustainable markets, particularly in how to achieve sustainable markets. There are questions around the appropriate mix of policy instruments or mechanisms, and for which context. For example, a developing world country may require specific mechanisms to build sustainable markets, particularly where more informal or fledgling economies exist. These also involve wider debates over how economic globalisation and trade can benefit countries where local capacities or institutions are weak.

Furthermore, there are unresolved debates over how much regulation or [[economic interventionism|government intervention]] is appropriate in order to govern sustainable markets. For example, in pricing pollution like [[greenhouse gases]] (GHGs), there are competing arguments over whether there should be government-mandated taxes to limit pollution by economic disincentives or whether a market should determine the price to pollute. In many cases a mixture of both may be favourable.

Broader questions remain over whether sustainable markets can ever fully account for environmental externalities, such as those associated with pollution. This relates to whether an economic model focused on [[GDP]] rather than wellbeing can truly bring about the transformation outlined in sustainable development. There have been suggestions that a move away from a pure focus on GDP is required, towards an emphasis represented in methods such as [[natural capital]] accounting.

== Organizations ==

A number of organizations are working in the sustainable markets field.

* The [[International Institute for Environment and Development]]’s Sustainable Markets Group develops research and analysis towards sustainable markets and the debates and innovations shaping markets.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Environment and Development (2015) http://www.iied.org/group/sustainable-markets&lt;/ref&gt; This research also includes a database of market governance mechanisms. 
* The U.S based [[Skoll Foundation]] runs a programme on sustainable markets which focuses on areas such as responsible supply chains, access to finance for sustainable small and medium enterprises including clean energy companies and work on environmental standards and certification.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll Foundation (2015) ‘Sustainable Markets page’ http://www.skollfoundation.org/issue/sustainable-markets/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] runs the Sustainable Markets and Responsible Trade initiative.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Sustainable Development (2013) ‘Sustainable Markets and Responsible Trade’ https://www.iisd.org/markets/&lt;/ref&gt; This focuses on the sustainability of international trade and the design and implementation of supply chains. 
* The Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets, based at [[Stockholm School of Economics]], aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors. Misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms: Sustainability in Financial Markets (Mistra Financial Systems), Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (2015) http://www.hhs.se/misum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mistra.org/forskning/pagaende-forskning/misum---mistra-center-for-sustainable-markets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}
'''Treaty rights''' are certain rights that were reserved by [[indigenous peoples]] when they signed [[treaties]] with [[settler societies]] in the wake of [[European colonization]].  This applies to the rights of [[Alaska Natives]] and [[Native Americans in the United States]] and [[First Nations in Canada]], as well as to a smaller number of [[Inuit]] and [[Metis in Canada]] who have entered into treaties.

Treaty rights are not the only [[Aboriginal rights|rights claimed by indigenous peoples]].  Indigenous people claim inherent rights to [[self-determination]], which implies that they be recognized as [[rights-bearing]] groups (called "tribes", "bands", or "nations" depending on the place and time) capable of [[self-determination]] and [[cultural survival]].&lt;ref name="AJI"&gt;AJI Report, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the state recognizes that there is another [[body corporate]] with [[legal personality]] capable of making binding agreements on behalf of its members, then negotiations can begin for mutual exchange and aid: a treaty.  The earliest of these agreements, between [[colonialism|colonial powers]] such the French, British, and the Dutch and various indigenous peoples of the [[Atlantic world|Atlantic coastal regions]] had the character of [[military alliances]], as between peers.  Later treaties, however, were generally about the [[cession of land]] from weakened Aboriginal peoples to expanding settler states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100028602/1100100028603|title=Treaty Rights|last=Branch|first=Government of Canada; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Communications|date=|website=www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] [[the Crown|the British Crown (i.e. the state)]] declared that individual British subjects could not buy land from native nations; only the Crown could obtain land from native nations through treaty, which it could then redistribute to individuals.  This principle, which was adopted by both Canada and the United States upon gaining independence from Britain, became the legal impetus for all subsequent treaties in North America.

By signing treaties, indigenous peoples traded vast amounts of their land and resources in exchange for reserved areas of land ([[Indian reservation]]s [US terminology] and [[Indian reserves]] [Canadian terminology]) and things like protection (from attacks on their lands), [[Treaty 6|health care]], [[:Category:Indigenous education|education]], and [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]], protection of hunting and fishing rights, and sometimes some monies as well. Because [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article Six]] of the [[United States Constitution]] declares treaties to be the supreme law of the land, treaties are just as valid today as they were the day they were signed, and treaty rights are still legally binding as well.  Likewise treaty rights were enshrined in Canada under [[section 35]] by the [[patriation|package of constitutional reforms of 1982]].

A common critique of the treaty relationship is that treaty rights are [[In-group favoritism|"special" rights]] given to indigenous people by the state because of their [[racial preference|racial status]].  Defenders of the treaty system argue however, that the government does not "give" treaty rights to anyone – native people reserved them when they signed treaties in a government-to-government relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arcbc.tripod.com/marshall-Rights.htm|title=What are treaty rights?|last=|first=|date=|website=arcbc.tripod.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treaty rights are frequently subject to public debate, particularly hunting and fishing rights. Many Native nations have reserved rights to hunt and fish in their [[ancestral domain|accustomed places]], which are often lands that was given up at the treaty signing, or "ceded land". This leads to conflict with sports and commercial hunters and fishers, who are competing for the same [[Resource|limited resource]] in the same place.

Another common source of conflict is [[land management|management decisions about the land or rivers]] on which Native people have rights. Things like dams and logging have huge effects on fish and wildlife populations.  In Canadian law, government how have a court-mandated "[[duty to consult]]" indigenous peoples regarding the management process of these lands and rivers.  In the United States, no such mandate exists.

=== Annexation of Hawaii ===
{{Main|Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii}}
Throughout the nineteenth century, the United States made a number of treaties with the then [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], the final being in 1887. These treaties recognized the Kingdom of Hawaii as being sovereign and independent. In 1893, [[John L. Stevens]], US minister assigned to the Kingdom of Hawaii, led a group of non-indigenous people to overthrow [[Queen Lili‘uokalani]], which was backed by United States naval forces. They established a Provisional government, which then declared itself the Republic of Hawaii. In 1899, the US annexed Hawaii. Many Hawaiian sovereignty activists feel that because of the aforementioned treaties, Hawaii should today be its own Nation instead of part of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.hawaii.edu/sites/www.law.hawaii.edu/files/content/Faculty/NHRts-HSBJ806.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Rights of the Native Hawaiian People|last=Van Dyke|first=Jon|last2=MacKensie|first2=Melody|date=July 2006|website=University of Hawaii at Mānoa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dakota Access Pipeline ===

In [[logic]], an [[argument]] is '''valid''' if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the [[premise|premises]] to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not required that a valid argument have premises that are actually true,&lt;ref&gt;Jc Beall and Greg Restall, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/logical-consequence/ "Logical Consequence"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion. A [[well-formed formula|formula]] is valid [[if and only if]] it is true under every [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], and an argument form (or schema) is valid if and only if every argument of that [[logical form]] is valid.

==Arguments==

An  [[argument]] is valid if and only if the truth of its premises [[Logical consequence|entails]] the truth of its conclusion and each step, sub-argument, or logical operation in the argument is valid.  Under such conditions it would be self-contradictory to affirm the premises and deny the conclusion.  The [[corresponding conditional]] of a valid argument is a [[logical truth]] and the negation of its corresponding conditional is a [[contradiction]]. The conclusion is a [[logical consequence]] of its premises.

An argument that is not valid is said to be "invalid".

An example of a valid argument is given by the following well-known [[syllogism]]:
: All men are mortal.
: Socrates is a man.
: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

What makes this a valid argument is not that it has true premises and a true conclusion, but the logical necessity of the conclusion, given the two premises. The argument would be just as valid were the premises and conclusion false. The following argument is of the same [[logical form]] but with false premises and a false conclusion, and it is equally valid:

: All cups are green.
: Socrates is a cup.
: Therefore, Socrates is green.

No matter how the universe might be constructed, it could never be the case that these arguments should turn out to have simultaneously true premises but a false conclusion.  The above arguments may be contrasted with the following invalid one:

: All men are immortal.
: Socrates is a man.
: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

In this case, the conclusion contradicts the deductive logic of the preceding premises, rather than deriving from it. Therefore, the argument is logically 'invalid', even though the conclusion could be considered 'true' in general terms. The premise 'All men are immortal' would likewise be deemed false outside of the framework of classical logic. However, within that system 'true' and 'false' essentially function more like mathematical states such as binary 1s and 0s than the philosophical concepts normally associated with those terms.

A standard view is that whether an argument is valid is a matter of the argument's [[logical form]].  Many techniques are employed by logicians to represent an argument's logical form.  A simple example, applied to two of the above illustrations, is the following:  Let the letters 'P', 'Q', and 'S' stand, respectively, for the set of men, the set of mortals, and Socrates.  Using these symbols, the first argument may be abbreviated as:

: All P are Q.
: S is a P.
: Therefore, S is a Q.

Similarly, the third argument becomes:

: All P are not Q.
: S is a P.
: Therefore, S is a Q.

An argument is termed formally valid if it has structural self-consistency, i.e. if when the operands between premises are all true, the derived conclusion is always also true. In the third example, the initial premises cannot logically result in the conclusion and is therefore categorized as an invalid argument.

==Valid formula==
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

A formula of a [[formal language]] is a valid formula if and only if it is true under every possible [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the language. In propositional logic, they are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

==Statements==
A statement can be called valid, i.e. logical truth, if it is true in all interpretations.

==Soundness==

Validity of deduction is not affected by the truth of the premise or the truth of the conclusion. The following deduction is perfectly valid:

: All animals live on Mars.
: All humans are animals.
: Therefore, all humans live on Mars.

The problem with the argument is that it is not ''[[soundness|sound]]''.  In order for a deductive argument to be sound, the deduction must be valid and '''all'''  the premises true.

==Satisfiability==
{{Main|Satisfiability}}

[[Model theory]] analyzes formulae with respect to particular classes of interpretation in suitable mathematical structures.  On this reading, formula is valid if all such interpretations make it true.  An inference is valid if all interpretations that validate the premises validate the conclusion.  This is known as ''semantic validity''.&lt;ref&gt;L. T. F. Gamut, ''Logic, Language, and Meaning: Introduction to Logic'', University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==

In '''truth-preserving''' validity, the interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true'.

In a '''false-preserving''' validity, the interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cogan, ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step'', University Press of America, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fit9rjXiLBUC&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is a scion of European civilization, it also incorporates, to varying degrees, elements of indigenous American civilizations, absent from North America and Europe.

Both Europe and North America felt the effects of the Reformation and combined Catholic and Protestant culture. Historically, Latin America has been only Catholic, although this may be changing.

The '''Western world''' refers to various nations depending on the context, most often including at least part of [[Europe]], [[Australasia]] and the [[Americas]], with the status of [[Latin America]] being disputed by some authors. Also known as '''the West''', there are many accepted definitions, all closely interrelated.&lt;ref name="Western Civilization1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170811111356/http://www.mmisi.org/ir/39_01_2/kurth.pdf Western Civilization], Our Tradition; James Kurth; accessed 30 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Western world is also known as the '''Occident''' (from the [[Latin]] word ''occidens'', "sunset, ''West"'') in contrast to the [[Orient]] (from Latin word ''oriens'', "rise, East") or [[Eastern world]].

Over time, their associated [[empire]]s grew first to the east and west to include the rest of [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]] coastal areas, conquering and absorbing. Later, they expanded to the north of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to include [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Central Europe|Central]], and [[Southeastern Europe]]. [[Christianization of Ireland]] (5th century), [[Christianization of Bulgaria]] (9th century), [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] ([[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]]; 10th century), [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] ([[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]]; 12th century) and [[Christianization of Lithuania]] (14th century) brought the rest of present-day European territory into Western civilization.

In either view, between the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall]] of the Western Roman Empire and the Renaissance, the West (or those regions that would later become the heartland of the culturally "western sphere") experienced a period of first, considerable decline,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe Middle Ages] "Of the three great civilizations of Western Eurasia and North Africa, that of Christian Europe began as the least developed in virtually all aspects of material and intellectual culture, well behind the Islamic states and Byzantium."&lt;/ref&gt; and then readaptation, reorientation and considerable renewed material, technological and political development. This whole period of roughly a millennium is known as the [[Middle Ages]], its early part forming the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", designations that were created during the [[Renaissance]] and reflect the perspective on history, and the self-image, of the latter period.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

If the Greek was the father, then the Arab was the foster-father of the scientific method of dealing with reality, that is to say, by absolute frankness, the utmost simplicity of statement and explanation, exact record, and exhaustive criticism.

==Western/European culture==

The term "Western culture" is used very broadly to refer to a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] of [[social norms]], [[ethics|ethical values]], [[tradition|traditional customs]], [[religion|religious]] beliefs, [[political system]]s, and specific [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] and [[technology|technologies]].

Specifically, Western culture may imply:
:*a [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Christian culture|Christian cultural]] influence in spiritual thinking, customs and either ethic or moral traditions, around the [[Post-Classical Era]] and after.
:*European cultural influences concerning artistic, musical, folkloric, ethic and oral traditions, whose themes have been further developed by [[Romanticism]].
:*a [[Graeco-Roman]] [[Classics|Classical]] and [[Renaissance]] cultural influence, concerning artistic, philosophic, literary, and [[Western law|legal]] themes and traditions, the cultural social effects of [[migration period]] and the heritages of [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and other ethnic groups, as well as a tradition of [[rationalism]] in various spheres of life, developed by [[Hellenistic philosophy]], [[Scholasticism]], [[Humanism]]s, the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment.

The concept of Western culture is generally linked to the classical definition of the ''Western world''. In this definition, Western culture is the set of literary, scientific, political, artistic and philosophical principles that set it apart from other civilizations. Much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Duran 1995, p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has come to apply to countries whose history is strongly marked by European immigration or settlement, such as the Americas, and [[Oceania]], and is not restricted to Europe.

Some tendencies that define modern Western [[societies]] are the existence of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], [[laicism]], generalization of [[middle class]], prominent [[subcultures]] or [[counterculture]]s (such as [[New Age]] movements), increasing cultural [[syncretism]] resulting from [[globalization]] and [[human migration]]. The modern shape of these societies is strongly based upon the Industrial Revolution and the societies' associated social and environmental problems, such as [[class (social)|class]] and [[pollution]], as well as reactions to them, such as [[syndicalism]] and [[environmentalism]].

==Historical divisions==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
The geopolitical divisions in Europe that created a concept of ''East'' and ''West'' originated in the [[Classical antiquity|ancient]] tyrannical and imperialistic [[Graeco-Roman]] times.&lt;ref name="BideleuxJeffries48" /&gt; The Eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] was home to the highly urbanized cultures that had [[Greek language|Greek]] as their common language (owing to the older empire of [[Alexander the Great]] and of the [[Diadochi|Hellenistic successors]].), whereas the West was much more rural in its character and more readily adopted Latin as its common language. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the beginning of the Medieval times (or ''[[Middle Ages]]''), Western and Central Europe were substantially cut off from the East where ''[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]'' Greek culture and [[Eastern Christianity]] became founding influences in the Eastern European world such as the Eastern and Southern Slavic peoples.

[[File:Explorations english.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map with the main travels of the [[Age of Discovery]] (began in 15th century).]]
[[Roman Catholic]] Western and Central Europe, as such, maintained a distinct identity particularly as it began to redevelop during the Renaissance. Even following the Protestant Reformation, Protestant Europe continued to see itself as more tied to Roman Catholic Europe than other parts of the perceived ''civilized world''.
Use of the term ''West'' as a specific cultural and geopolitical term developed over the course of the [[Age of Exploration]] as Europe spread its culture to other parts of the world. [[Roman Catholics]] were the first major religious group to immigrate to the [[New World]], as settlers in the colonies of Portugal and Spain (and later, France) belonged to that faith. English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included [[Anglican]]s, Dutch [[Calvinists]], English [[Puritans]] and other [[nonconformists]], [[Maryland Toleration Act|English Catholics]], Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, French [[Huguenot]]s, German and Swedish [[Lutherans]], as well as [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Ancient Greek-Hellenistic worlds (13th–1st centuries BC)===
{{Main|Ancient Greece|Hellenistic civilization}}
[[File:Location greek ancient.svg|280px|thumb|left|The [[Greek colonies|Ancient Greek world]], {{circa}} 550 BC]]
[[File:Diadochi_satraps_babylon-it.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|The [[Hellenistic period|Ancient Hellenistic Greek world]] from 323 BC.]]
[[Ancient Greek civilization]] had been growing in 1st millennium BC into wealthy [[poleis]], so-called [[city-states]] (geographically loose political entities which in time, inevitably end giving way to larger organisations of society, including the [[empire]] and the [[nation-state]])&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, "Ideal of Human Unity" included in ''Social and Political Thought'', 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Classical Athens|Athens]], [[Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], by [[Middle East|Middle]] and [[Near East|Near]] Eastern ones ([[Sumer]]ian cities such as [[Uruk]] and [[Ur]]; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian city-states, such as [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]; the [[Phoenicia]]n [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]; the five [[Philistines|Philistine]] city-states; the [[Berber people|Berber]] city-states of the [[Garamantes]]).

The then [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] division between the [[barbarian]]s (term used by Ancient Greeks for all non-Greek-speaking people) and the [[Greek people|Greeks]] contrasted in many societies the [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] culture of the Greek settlements around the Mediterranean to the surrounding non-Greek cultures. [[Herodotus]] considered the [[Persian Wars]] of the early 5th century BC a conflict of Europa versus Asia (which he considered all land north and east of the [[Sea of Marmara]], respectively).

Depictions of Athena have influenced other symbols of western freedom, including the [[Statue of Liberty]], representing [[Libertas]], the [[Roman Goddess]] of [[liberty]], by [[Marianne]], the national symbol of France.

}}

The terms ''"West"'' and "East" were not used by any Greek author to describe that conflict. The anachronistic application of those terms to that division entails a stark logical contradiction, given that, when the term ''"West"'' appeared, it was used by Hellenistic [[Roman Catholic]] of Greek heritage but also of Latin-speaking culture, in opposition to the [[Greek Orthodox]] and their Greek-speaking culture.

[[Greek culture]], is said to have influenced [[Roman civilization]] in all aspects of society, from [[History of architecture|architecture]] to [[philosophy]], [[Ancient Greek art|art]] and [[Ancient Greek warfare|war]].

According to a few writers, the future conquest of parts of the Roman Empire by Germanic peoples and the subsequent dominance by the Western Christian [[Papacy]] (which held combined political and spiritual authority, a [[State of affairs (sociology)|state of affairs]] absent from Greek civilization in all its stages), resulted in a rupture of the previously existing ties between the Latin West and Greek thought,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Freeman (history writer)|Charles Freeman]].

===Ancient Roman world (509 BC–AD 476)===
{{Main|Roman Republic|Roman Empire}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Ancient Rome]] (753 BC – AD 476) was a [[Villanovan culture|civilization]] that grew from a [[city-state]] founded on the [[Italian Peninsula]] about the 8th century BC to a massive empire straddling the Mediterranean Sea. In its 10-centuries expansion, Roman civilization shifted from a small [[monarchy]] (753 – 509 BC), to a [[Roman Republic|republic]] (509 – 27 BC), to an [[autocracy|autocratic]] empire (27 BC – AD 476). It came to dominate Western, Central and Southeastern Europe and the entire area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea through conquest using the [[Roman legions]] and then through [[cultural assimilation]] by eventually giving Roman citizenship privileges to the whole population. Nonetheless, despite its great legacy, a number of factors led to the eventual decline and [[fall of the Roman Empire]].

}}
The [[Roman Empire]] succeeded the approximately 500-year-old [[Roman Republic]] ({{circa}} 510 BC – 30 BC), which had been weakened by the conflict between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Sulla]] and the civil war of [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Brutus]].  During these struggles hundreds of senators were killed, and the [[Roman Senate]] had been refilled with loyalists{{Vague|date=July 2018}} of the [[First Triumvirate]] and later those of the [[Second Triumvirate]].{{efn|Several dates are commonly proposed to mark the transition from Republic to Empire, including the date of Julius Caesar's appointment as perpetual [[Roman dictator]] (44 BC), the victory of Caesar's heir [[Augustus|Octavian]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] (2, 31 September BC), and the Roman Senate's granting to Octavian the [[honorific]] ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''. (16, 27 January BC). Octavian/Augustus officially proclaimed that he had saved the Roman Republic and carefully disguised his power under republican forms: [[Consul]]s continued to be elected, [[tribune]]s of the plebeians continued to offer legislation, and senators still debated in the [[curia|Roman Curia]]. However, it was Octavian who influenced everything and controlled the final decisions, and in final analysis, had the legions to back him up, if it became necessary.}} In 350 years, from the successful and deadliest [[Second Punic War|war]] with the [[Phoenicia]]ns began in 218 BC to the rule of [[Emperor Hadrian]] by AD 117, Ancient Rome expanded up to twenty-five times its area. The same time passed before its fall in AD 476. Rome had expanded long before the empire reached its zenith with the conquest of [[Dacia]] in AD 106, under Emperor Trajan. During its territorial peak, the Roman Empire controlled about {{Convert|5000000|km2|}} of land surface and had a population of 100 million. From the time of Caesar (100 – 44 BC) to the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, Rome dominated [[Southern Europe]], the Mediterranean coast of [[Northern Africa]] and the Western [[Middle East]], including the ancient trade [[Amber Road|routes]] with population living outside. Ancient Rome has contributed greatly to the development of law, war, art, literature, architecture, technology and language in the ''Western world'', and its [[History of Rome|history]] continues to have a major influence on the world today. [[Latin language]] has been the base from which [[Romance languages]] evolved and it has been the official language of the [[Catholic Church]] and all Catholic religious ceremonies all over Europe until 1967, as well as an or the official language of countries such as Poland (9th–18th centuries).&lt;ref&gt;Karin Friedrich et al., The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569–1772, Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-58335-7}}, Google Print, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 395, a few decades before its Western collapse, the Roman Empire formally split into a [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and an [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] one, each with their own emperors, capitals, and governments, although ostensibly they still belonged to one formal Empire. The [[Western Roman Empire]] provinces eventually were replaced by [[Northern European]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ruled kingdoms in the 5th century due to [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|civil wars, corruption, and devastating Germanic invasions]] from such tribes as the [[Goths]], the [[Franks]] and the [[Vandals]] by their late [[Migration period|expansion]] throughout Europe. The three-day Visigoths's [[Sack of Rome (410)|AD 410 sack of Rome]] who had been raiding Greece not long before, a shocking time for [[Graeco-Roman]]s, was the first time after almost 800 years that Rome had fallen to a foreign enemy, and [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], living in Bethlehem at the time, wrote that "The City which had taken the whole world was itself taken."&lt;ref&gt;St Jerome, ''Letter CXXVII. To Principia'', [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume VI/The Letters of St. Jerome/Letter 127]] paragraph 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Pope]] would be spearing slaughter and destruction by the followed [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack of AD 455]] lasted 14 days this time conducted by the [[Vandals]], retaining Rome's ethernal spirit through the [[Holy See of Rome]] (the [[Latin Church]]) for centuries to come.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Selwood, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/02/day-ad-455-beginning-end-rome/ "On this day in AD 455: the beginning of the end for Rome"] 2 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irina-Maria Manea, [https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/alaric-barbarians-and-rome-a-complicated-relationship "Alaric, Barbarians and Rome: a Complicated Relationship"].&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[Barbarian]] tribes, often composed of well-trained Roman soldiers paid by Rome to guard the extensive borders, had become militarily sophisticated 'romanized barbarians', and mercilessly slaughtered the Romans conquering their Western territories while looting their possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wqwMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=barbarians+romans+slaughter+western&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wGVZVw7NgO&amp;sig=iyoMp01vWUMwo3R6EmXjtccwBoA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2ir7_17PcAhUL16QKHdcYDn0Q6AEIzgEwIQ#v=onepage&amp;q=barbarians%20romans%20slaughter%20western&amp;f=false "How the West Won: The Neglected Story of the Triumph of Modernity"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Empire is where the idea of ''"the West"'' began to emerge. By Rome's central location at the heart of the Empire, ''"West"'' and "East" were terms used to denote provinces west and east of the capital itself. Therefore, [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] (Portugal and Spain), [[Gaul]] (France), Mediterranean coast of [[North Africa]] (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco) and [[Britannia]] were all part of the ''"West"'', while Greece, Cyprus, Anatolia, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, and Libya were part of the "East". Italy itself was considered central, until the reforms of [[Diocletian]], with the idea of formally dividing the Empire into true two halves: Eastern and Western.{{Vague|date=July 2018}}

The dissolution of the Western half (nominally in AD 476, but in truth a long process that ended by AD 800) left only the Eastern Roman Empire alive. The East continued to call themselves Eastern Romans even after AD 610 – 800 when Greek had become official language of the empire (was Latin) and the Pope's crowning of [[Charlemagne]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor|''Emperor of the Romans'']], while the West began thinking in terms of Western Latins (those living in the old Western Empire) and Eastern Greeks (those inside the Roman remnant to the east).

The [[Eastern Roman Empire]], governed from [[Constantinople]], is usually referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 476, the traditional date for the "fall of the Western Roman Empire" and beginning of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Eastern Roman Empire surviving the fall of the Western, protected Roman legal and cultural traditions, combining them with Greek and Christian elements, for another thousand years.  The name Byzantine Empire was used after the Byzantine Empire ended, the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire continued to call themselves Romans for long time as the term “Roman” was meant to signify all [[Christianity|Christians]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In the early 4th century (AD 330), [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] had established the city of [[Constantinople]] (formerly [[Byzantium]]) as the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] Roman Empire, later recognized as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Eastern Roman Empire included lands south-west of the [[Black Sea]] and bordering on the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and parts of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. This division into Eastern and Western Roman Empires was reflected in the administration of the [[Greek East and Latin West|Roman Catholic and Eastern Greek Orthodox]] churches, with Rome and Constantinople debating over whether either city was the capital of [[Catholicity|Western religion]].

As the [[Orthodox Christianity|Eastern (Orthodox)]] and Western (firstly Catholic, then Protestant as well) churches spread their influence, the line between Eastern and Western Christianity was moving. Its movement was affected by the influence of the Byzantine empire and the fluctuating power and influence of the Catholic church in Rome. Beginning in the Middle Ages religious cultural hegemony slowly waned in Europe generally. This process may have prompted the geographic line of religious division to approximately follow a line of [[cultural divide]].
The influential American conservative [[political scientist]], adviser and academic [[Samuel P. Huntington]] argued that this cultural division still existed during the Cold War as the approximate Western boundary of those countries that were allied with the [[Soviet Union]].{{efn|Others have fiercely criticized these views arguing they confuse the Eastern Roman Empire with Russia, especially considering the fact that the country that had the most historical roots in Byzantium (Greece) expelled communists and was allied with the West during the Cold War. Still, Russia accepted Eastern Christianity from the Byzantine Empire (by the Patriarch of Constantinople: Photios I) linking Russia very close to the Eastern Roman Empire world. Later on, in 16th century Russia created its own religious centre in Moscow. Religion survived in Russia beside severe persecution carrying values alternative to the communist ideology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}}}

In AD 800 under [[Charlemagne]], the [[Early Medieval]] Franks established an empire that was recognized by the [[Pope]] in Rome as the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (Latin Christian revival of the ancient Roman Empire, under perpetual Germanic rule from AD 962) inehiriting ancient Roman Empire's prestige but offending the Roman Emperor in Constantinople. The crowning of the Emperor by the Pope led to the assumption that the highest power was the [[history of the Papacy|papal hierarchy]], quintessential Roman Empire's spiritual heritage authority, establishing then, until the [[Protestant Reformation]], the civilization of [[Christendom|West Christendom]].

The [[Latin Rite]] Catholic Church of western and central Europe split with the eastern [[Greek Rite|Greek-speaking]] Patriarchates by the Christian [[East–West Schism]], also known as the "Great Schism", during the [[Gregorian Reforms]] (calling for a more central status of the Roman-Catholic Church Institution), three months after [[Leo IX|Pope]]'s death in April 1054.&lt;ref name=WUP&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfO1J6hjcdgC&amp;pg=PA210 |editor-first=Kenneth Meyer |editor-last=Setton |title=A History of the Crusades |publisher=Wisconsin University Press |year=1969 |isbn=9780299048341 |pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following 1054 [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]], both the [[Western Christianity|Western]] Church and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] Church continued to consider themselves ''uniquely'' orthodox and catholic. [[Augustine]] wrote in On True Religion: “Religion is to be sought... only among those who are called Catholic or orthodox Christians, that is, guardians of truth and followers of right.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dulles S.J.|first1=Avery|editor1-last=Reno|editor1-first=R.R.|year=2012|title=The Orthodox Imperative: Selected Essays of Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J.|publisher=First Things Press|pages=224|edition=Kindle|url=https://www.amazon.com/Orthodox-Imperative-Selected-Essays-Cardinal-ebook/dp/B008R551PO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the [[Western Church]] gradually identified with the "Catholic" label, and people of Western Europe gradually associated the "Orthodox" label with the Eastern Church (although in some languages, the "Catholic" label is not necessarily identified with the Western Church). This was in note of the fact that both Catholic and Orthodox were in use as ecclesiastical adjectives as early as the 2nd and 4th centuries respectively.

In 1071, the Byzantine army was defeated by the [[Muslim]] [[Turco-Persian]]s of medieval [[Asia]], resulting in the loss of most of [[Asia Minor]]. The situation was a serious threat to the future of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Emperor sent a plea to the [[Papacy|Pope]] in Rome to send military aid to restore the lost territories to Christian rule. The result was a series of western European military campaigns into the eastern Mediterranean, known as the ''Crusades''. Unfortunately for the Byzantines, the crusaders (belonging to the members of high aristocracy from France, western Germany, the Low countries, and Italy) had no allegiance to the Byzantine Emperor and established their own states in the conquered regions, including the heart of the Byzantine Empire.
Meanwhile, the extent of both Christendoms expanded, as Germanic peoples, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, Scandinavia, Baltic peoples, British Isles and the other non-Christian lands of the northwest were converted by the [[Western Church]], while Slavic peoples, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Georgia were converted by the [[Eastern Church]]. The Holy Roman Empire would [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|dissolve]] on 6 August 1806, after the [[French Revolution]] and the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] by [[Napoleon]].

[[Decline of the Byzantine Empire]] (13th-15th centuries) began by [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Christian]] [[Fourth Crusade]] in AD 1202-04, considered to be one of the most prominent acts that solidified the [[East-West Schism|schism]] between the [[Christianity|Christian]] churches of [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Byzantine Rite]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] [[Roman Rite]].

This much profitable [[Central Europe]]an Fourth Crusade had prompted 14th century [[Renaissance Italy|Renaissance]] (translated as 'Rebirth') of [[Italian city-states]] including [[Papal States]], ushering the following [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] (which established the [[Roman Inquisition]] after the [[Medieval Inquisition]]) of the 1500s by discovery of the American continent, and consequent dissolution of West Christendom as even a theoretical unitary political body, later resulting in the religious [[Eighty Years War]] (1568-1648) and [[Thirty Years War]] (1618-1648) between [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|various Protestant and Catholic states]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (and emergence of [[Protestantism|religiously diverse]] [[Criticism of the Catholic Church|confessions]]). In this context, the Protestant Reformation (1515) may be viewed as a schism within the [[Catholic Church]]. German monk [[Martin Luther]], in the wake of precursors, broke with the pope and with the emperor by the Catholic Church's abusive commercialization of [[indulgences]] in the [[Late Medieval Period]], backed by many of the German princes and helped by the development of the [[printing press]] in an attempt to reform corruption within the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/jones/his101/web/37luther.htm |title=Background to Against the Sale of Indulgences by Martin Luther |publisher=West Chester University of Pennsylvania|website=Wcupa.edu |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markedbyteachers.com/as-and-a-level/history/how-important-was-the-role-of-the-princes-in-bringing-about-the-success-of-the-lutheran-reformation-in-germany-in-the-years-1525-to-1555.html |title=How important was the role of the princes in bringing about the success of the Lutheran Reformation in Germany in the years 1525 to 1555? |publisher=Marked by Teachers|website=markedbyteachers.com |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/reformation |title=The Reformation |publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|website=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|These changes were adopted by the [[Scandinavia]]n kings.

This process of influence (and imposition) began with the [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization, conquest, and exploitation]] of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] enforced as well by [[papal bull]]s in 1450s (by the [[fall of the Byzantine Empire]]), granting Portugal navigation, war and trade monopoly for any newly discovered lands,&lt;ref name="Daus33"&gt;{{harvnb|Daus|1983|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and competing [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] navigators. It continued with the rise of the [[Dutch East India Company]] by the destabilising Spanish [[discovery of the New World]], and the creation and expansion of the [[British Empire|English]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial empires, and others.

Due to the reach of these empires, Western institutions expanded throughout the world. Even after demands for self-determination from subject peoples within Western empires were met with [[decolonization]], these institutions persisted. One specific example was the requirement that [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] societies were made to form nation-states (in the Western tradition), which often created arbitrary boundaries and borders that did not necessarily represent a whole nation, people, or culture, and are often the cause of international conflicts and friction even to this day. Although not part of Western colonization process proper, following the [[Middle Ages]] Western culture in fact entered other global-spanning cultures during the colonial 15th-20th centuries.

With the discovery of the American continent, the [[New World]] in 1492-1493, the European colonial [[Age of Discovery]] and exploration was born revisiting an [[Imperialism|imperialistic]] view accompanied by the invention of [[history of gunpowder#Europe|firearms]], while marking the start of the [[Modern Era]]. During this long period the [[Catholic Church]] had inaugurated a major effort to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and others, by a 'Modern West' emerging from [[Late Middle Ages]] (after the Renaissance and fall of Constantinople) as a new civilization greatly influenced by the interpretation of Greek thought preserved in the Byzantine Empire, and [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|transmitted]] from there by Latin [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translations]] and [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|emigration of Greek scholars]] through [[Renaissance humanism]] (popular [[typefaces]] such as [[italics]] were inspired and designed from transcriptions during this period).

[[History of colonialism|Colonialisation]] by Western/European powers (and others) since 1492.
}}
In the 13th and 14th centuries, a number of European travelers, many of them Christian [[missionary|missionaries]], had sought to cultivate trading with [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. By start of the Crusades and relative contraction of Orthodox [[Byzantine silk|Byzantine]]'s large silk industry [[History of silk#Spread of production|in favour of Catholic Western European]] and rise of [[Papal States|Western Papacy]], most famous of these [[Chronology_of_European_exploration_of_Asia#Middle_Ages|merchant travelers]] after the [[Spice_trade#Age_of_European_Discovery:_finding_a_new_route_and_a_New_World|East-West trade]] was Venetian [[Marco Polo]]. But these journeys had little permanent effect on the East-West trade because of a series of political developments in Asia in the last decades of the 14th century, which put an end to further European exploration of Asia: namely the new [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] rulers were found to be unreceptive of religious proselytism by European missionaries and merchants. Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] consolidated control over the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], closing off key overland trade routes.

The [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] spearheaded the drive to find oceanic routes that would provide cheaper and easier access to South and East Asian goods, by advancements in maritime technology such as the [[caravel]] ship introduced in the mid-1400s. This chartering of oceanic routes between East and West began with the unprecedented voyages of Portuguese and [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] sea captains, and would eventually expand across the globe initiating [[European colonialism]] by [[Hispano]]-[[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian]] 1492 [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|exploring voyage]] by merchant, navigator, and [[colonialism|colonizer]] [[Christopher Columbus]]. These voyages were influenced by medieval European adventurers after the European [[spice trade]] with Asia, who had journeyed overland to the Far East contributing to geographical knowledge of parts of the Asian continent upon their return, and are of enormous significance in [[History of Western civilization|Western history]] as they marked the beginning of the [[European ethnic groups|European]] exploration, [[colonization]] and exploitation of [[Americas|the American continents]] and that of their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#European colonization|native inhabitants]].{{efn|Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418–19, using recent developments in navigation, cartography and maritime technology such as the [[caravel]], in order that they might find a sea route to the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]].
In 1488, [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa under the sponsorship of Portugal's [[John II of Portugal|John II]], from which point he noticed that the coast swung northeast ([[Cape of Good Hope]]).

In 1492 [[Christopher Columbus]] would land on an island in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]] on behalf of the Spanish, and documenting the [[Atlantic Ocean]]'s routes would be granted a [[Coat of Arms]] by [[Pope Alexander VI]] ''[[motu proprio]]'' in 1502.
In 1497 Portuguese navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] made the first open voyage from Europe to India.
In 1520, [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a Portuguese navigator in the service of the [[Crown of Castile]] ('[[Spain]]'), found a sea route into the [[Pacific Ocean]].}}{{efn|In the 16th century, the Portuguese broke the (overland) Medieval monopoly of the Arabs and Italians of trade (goods and slaves) between Asia and [[Europe]] by the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] around the Cape of Good Hope.&lt;ref&gt;M. Weisner-Hanks, Early Modern Europe 1450–1789 (Cambridge, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; With the ensuing rise of the rival Dutch East India Company, Portuguese influence in Asia was gradually eclipsed; Dutch forces first established fortified independent bases in the East and then between 1640 and 1660 wrestled some southern Indian ports, and the lucrative [[Japan]] trade from the Portuguese. Later, the [[English people|English]] and the [[France|French]] established some settlements in [[India]] and a trade with [[China]], and their own acquisitions would gradually surpass those of the Dutch. In 1763, the British eliminated French influence in India and established the [[British East India Company]] as the most important political force on the [[Indian Subcontinent]].}}{{efn|Although Christianized by early Middle Ages, [[Ireland]] is soon colonised in 16th- and 17th-century with settlers from the neighboring island of [[Great Britain]] (several people committed in the establishment of these colonies in Ireland, would later also colonise North America initiating the British Empire), while [[Iceland]] still uninhabited long after the rest of [[Western Europe]] had been settled, by 1397–1523 would eventually be united in [[Kalmar Union|one alliance]] with all of the Nordic states (kingdoms of [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]]).}} The [[European colonization of the Americas]] was the outset of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] between the 1490s and the 1800s, which also contributed to the development of African intertribal warfare and racist ideology. Until the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, the [[British Empire]] alone (which had started colonial efforts [[British Empire#"First" British Empire (1583–1783)|in 1578]], almost a century after Portuguese and Spanish empires) was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Niall |last=Ferguson |authorlink=Niall Ferguson |title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2004 |p=62 |isbn=978-0-465-02329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy Roman Empire]] dissolved in 1806 by the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]; abolition of the [[Roman Catholic Inquisition]] followed.

In early-19th century the systematic [[urbanisation]] process (migration from villages in search of jobs to places where factories were set up) had began, and the concentration of labour into factories led to the rise in the population of the towns particularly (world population had been rising as well, it is estimated it reached one billion for the first time in 1804),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |title=The World at Six Billion|publisher=United Nations |date=October 12, 1999 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the new philosophical movement later known as [[Romanticism]] originated after the previous [[17th-century philosophy|Reason]] of the 1600s and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of 1700s, that enabled 19th century ''Western world'''s sustained economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite publication |author=Wim Van Den Doel |title=The Dutch Empire.

Europeans had not been able to sell much to the Asians in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but after the Industrial Revolution the situation was completely different, and the European textile industry, for example, was easily able to sell its cheap products throughout Asia. Improved transport methods also meant that European products could reach the Asian market at a relatively low cost. From about 1800, what historians term ‘the [[great divergence]]’ took place, which was the separation of the economic development of the Western World, on the one hand, and of almost all of Asia and Africa on the other.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the urbanisation and industrialization of the 1800s, demand for oriental goods such as [[porcelain]], [[silk]], [[spice]]s and [[tea]] remained the driving force behind European imperialism in Asia, and (with the important exception of British East India Company rule in India) the European stake in Asia remained confined largely to trading stations and strategic outposts necessary to protect trade.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = The global expansion of western Europe between the 1760s and the 1870s differed in several important ways from the expansionism and colonialism of previous centuries. Along with the rise of the Industrial Revolution, which economic historians generally trace to the 1760s, and the continuing spread of industrialization in the empire-building countries came a shift in the strategy of trade with the colonial world. Instead of being primarily buyers of colonial products (and frequently under strain to offer sufficient salable goods to balance the exchange), as in the past, the industrializing nations increasingly became sellers in search of markets for the ''growing'' volume of their machine-produced goods.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Industrialisation]], however, dramatically increased European demand for Asian raw materials; and the severe Long Depression of the 1870s provoked a scramble for new markets for European industrial products and financial services in Africa, the Americas, Eastern Europe, and especially in Asia (Western powers exploited their advantages in [[China]] for example by the [[Opium Wars]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/colonialism/European-expansion-since-1763 |title=European expansion since 1763 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in so-called "[[New Imperialism]]", which saw a shift in focus between trade, [[indirect rule]] and formal colonial control of vast overseas territories ruled as political extensions of their mother countries.{{efn|The [[Scramble for Africa]] was the occupation, division, and colonization of African territory by European powers during the period of [[New Imperialism]], between 1881 and 1914. It is also called the 'Partition of Africa' and by some the 'Conquest of Africa'. In 1870, only 10 percent of Africa was under formal Western/European control; by 1914 it had increased to almost 90 percent of the continent, with only [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] (Abyssinia), the [[Dervish state]] (a portion of present-day [[Somalia]])&lt;ref&gt;Jihad in the Arabian Sea 2011, Camille Pecastaing, In the land of the Mad Mullah: Somalia&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liberia]] still being independent.}} The later years of the 19th century saw the transition from "informal imperialism" ([[hegemony]]){{efn|In [[ancient Greece]] (8th century BC – AD 6th century), hegemony denoted the politico-military dominance of a [[city-state]] over other city-states.&lt;ref name="TheColumbia"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=Fifth|year=1994|location=New York |publisher= Columbia University Press |isbn= 0-231-08098-0|editor-first=Barbara A.|editor-last=Chernow|editor2-first= George A.|editor2-last=Vallasi |page=1215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant state is known as the ''hegemon''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'': "A leading or paramount power; a dominant state or person"&lt;/ref&gt;}} by military influence and economic dominance, to direct rule (a revival of colonial [[imperialism]]) in the [[African continent]] and [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="Shillington"&gt;Kevin Shillington, ''History of Africa''. Revised second edition (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1870s and 1914 (so-called [[Belle Epoque|Beautiful Era]], socioeconomically optimistic and innovative decades by the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]), the established colonial powers in Asia (United Kingdom, France, Netherlands) added to their empires also vast expanses of territory in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and [[South East Asia]]. Japan was involved primarily in the so-called [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912), though earlier contact with the Portuguese, the Spaniards and the Dutch were also present in the recognition of European nations as strategically important to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]]. The traditional Japanese society was virtually overturned into an industrial and militarist power like Western countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], the [[French Third Republic]], and similarly to the [[German Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[United States]], following the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, quickly emerged as new imperial powers in [[East Asia]] and in the [[Pacific Ocean#European exploration|Pacific Ocean area]]. By 1913, the [[British Empire]] held sway over 412 million people, {{Percentage|412,000,000|1,791,020,000}} of the world population at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMaddison2001|Maddison 2001]], pp.&amp;nbsp;97 "The total population of the Empire was 412 million [in 1913]", 241 "[World population in 1913 (in thousands):] 1&amp;nbsp;791&amp;nbsp;020".&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1920, it covered {{convert|35500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1997|title=Expansion and Contraction Patterns of Large Polities: Context for Russia|journal=[[International Studies Quarterly]]|volume=41|issue=3|page=502|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00053|author=Rein Taagepera|authorlink=Rein Taagepera|jstor=2600793}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Percentage|35,500,000|148,940,000}} of the Earth's total land area:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=10 September 2016|quote=land: 148.94 million sq km}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its apex, the phrase "[[the empire on which the sun never sets]]" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJackson2013|Jackson]], pp.&amp;nbsp;5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, its political, [[Common law|legal]], [[English language|linguistic]] and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|cultural]] legacy is widespread throughout the ''Western World''.

In the [[aftermath of the Second World War]], decolonizing efforts were employed by all Western powers under [[United Nations]] (ex-[[League of Nations]]) international directives.

Though the overt colonial era has passed, Western nations, as comparatively rich, well-armed, and culturally powerful states, still wielded a [[Neocolonialism|large degree of influence]] throughout the world.

=== Cold War context (1947–1991) ===
{{Main|Cold War|Western Bloc|First World}}
During the [[Cold War]], a new definition emerged. Earth was divided into three "worlds". The [[First World]], analogous in this context to what was called ''the West'', was composed of NATO members and other countries aligned with the United States. The Second World was the [[Eastern bloc]] in the Soviet [[sphere of influence]], including the Soviet Union (15 republics including presently independent Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries like Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, East Germany (now united with Germany), [[Czechoslovakia]] (now split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia).

The Third World consisted of countries, many of which were [[Non-Aligned Movement|unaligned with either]], and important members included India, [[Yugoslavia]], Finland ([[Finlandization]]) and Switzerland ([[Foreign relations of Switzerland|Swiss Neutrality]]); some include the [[People's Republic of China]], though this is disputed, since the People's Republic of China, as communist, had friendly relations — at certain times — with the Soviet bloc, and had a significant degree of importance in global geopolitics. Some Third World countries aligned themselves with either the US-led West or the Soviet-led Eastern bloc.

A number of countries did not fit comfortably into this neat definition of partition, including Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], which chose to be neutral. [[Finland]] was under the ''Soviet Union's'' military sphere of influence (see [[FCMA treaty]]) but remained neutral and was not communist, nor was it a member of the Warsaw Pact or Comecon but a member of the EFTA since 1986, and was west of the [[Iron Curtain]]. In 1955, when Austria again became a fully independent republic, it did so under the condition that it remain neutral, but as a country to the west of the Iron Curtain, it was in the ''United States''' sphere of influence. Spain did not join the NATO until 1982, towards the end of the Cold War and after the death of the authoritarian [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].

The exact scope of the ''Western world'' is somewhat subjective in nature, depending on whether cultural, economic, spiritual or political criteria are employed. It is a generally accepted western view to recognize the existence of at least three "major worlds" (or "cultures", or "civilizations"), broadly in contrast with the Western: the ''[[Eastern world]]'', the ''[[Arab world|Arab]]'' and the ''[[Africa]]n'' worlds, with no clearly specified boundaries. Additionally, ''[[Latin America]]n'' and ''[[Eastern Orthodoxy by country|Orthodox]]'' worlds are sometimes separately considered "akin" to the West.

Many anthropologists, sociologists and historians oppose "the West and the Rest" in a categorical manner.&lt;ref name="LabyrinthofKinship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review - Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=24 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same has been done by Malthusian demographers with a sharp distinction between European and non-European family systems. Among anthropologists, this includes [[Durkheim]], [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Dumont]] and [[Lévi-Strauss]].&lt;ref name="LabyrinthofKinship"/&gt;

As the term "''Western world''" does not have a strict international definition, governments do not use the term in legislation of [[Treaty|international treaties]] and instead rely on other definitions.

===Cultural definition===
{{further|Western culture|Culture of Europe}}
In modern usage, ''Western world'' refers to [[Europe]] and to areas whose populations largely [[European diaspora|originate from Europe]], through the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery's]] imperialism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChristImp2011/&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Post-Christianity|Christianity declined]] in influence in many Western countries, mostly in the European Union where some member states have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years,&lt;ref name="About SecE"&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-02-21-god-europe_x.htm|title=What place for God in Europe|accessdate=24 July 2009|date=22 February 2005|first=Peter|last=Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also elsewhere. [[Secularism]] (separating religion from politics and science) increased. However, while church attendance is in decline, in some western countries (i.e. Italy, Poland and Portugal) more than half the people state that [[Importance of religion by country|religion is important]],&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Special [[Eurobarometer]] 225 |title=Social values, Science and Technology|publisher=Europa, web portal|author=[[Eurostat]]|year=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|page=9|accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most Westerners nominally identify themselves as Christians (e.g. 59% in the United Kingdom) and attend church on major occasions, such as Christmas and Easter. In the Americas, Christianity continues to play an important societal role, though in areas such as Canada, low level of religiosity is common as a result of experiencing processes of secularization similar to European ones. The [[State religion|official religions]] of the United Kingdom and some Nordic countries are forms of Christianity, even though the majority of European countries have no official religion. Despite this, Christianity, in its different forms, remains the largest faith in most Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;See ARDA data archives: http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/regions/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity remains the dominant religion in the ''Western world'', where 70% are Christians.&lt;ref name="Global Christianity"&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS |url=http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-exec.aspx |title=Global Christianity |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that 76.2% of [[Europe]]ans, 73.3% in [[Oceania]], and about 86.0% in the [[Americas]] (90% in [[Latin America]] and 77.4% in [[North America]]) described themselves as Christians.&lt;ref name="Global Christianity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS |url=http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-europe.aspx |title=Europe |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS |url=http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-americas.aspx |title=Americas |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS |url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-christians.aspx |title=Global religious landscape: Christians |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Western world'' countries also, are the most keen on digital and televisual media technologies, as they were in the postwar period on television and radio: from 2000 to 2014, [[internet]]'s [[market penetration]] was twice that of non-''Western'' regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Roche|title=Mega-Events and Social Change: Spectacle, Legacy and Public Culture|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1BonDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22western+world%22+tv+age&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x-2sEIYApr&amp;sig=pYf98JZu_mXGm4rhpRLa6XFk8h0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiomuOhq8LeAhVhIcAKHWAGBsUQ6AEwGXoECFcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22western%20world%22%20tv%20age&amp;f=false|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brooklyn Bridge 20080501.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|[[New York City]] has been a dominant global [[financial center]] in the 1900s.]]
The term ''"Western world"'' is sometimes interchangeably used with the term [[First World]] or [[Developed Country|developed countries]], stressing the difference between First World and the [[Third World]] or [[Developing country|developing countries]]. This usage occurs despite the fact that many countries that may be culturally "Western" are [[developing countries]] - in fact, a significant percentage of the Americas are developing countries. It is also used despite many [[developed countries|developed countries or regions]] not being Western (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Qatar, Israel), and therefore left out when "''Western world''" is used to denote developed countries. [[Privatization]] policies (involving government enterprises and public services) and [[multinational corporations]] are often considered a visible sign of Western nations's economic presence, especially in Third World countries, and represent common institutional environment for powerful politicians, enterprises, trade unions and firms, bankers and thinkers of the ''Western world''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Starr, [https://www.princeton.edu/~starr/articles/articles80-89/Starr-MeaningPrivatization-88.htm "The Meaning of Privatization," Yale Law and Policy Review 6: 6-41" 1988].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James C.

The existence of "The North" implies the existence of "[[North-South divide|The South]]", and the [[socio-economic]] divide between North and South. The term "the North" has in some contexts replaced earlier usage of the term ''"the West"'', particularly in the critical sense, as a more robust demarcation than the terms ''"West"'' and "East". The North provides some absolute geographical indicators for the location of wealthy countries, most of which are physically situated in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], although, as most countries are located in the northern hemisphere in general, some have considered this distinction equally unhelpful. Modern [[financial services]] and [[Financial technology|technologies]] are largely developed by Western nations: [[Bitcoin]], most known [[digital currency]] is subject to skepticism in the Eastern world whereas Western nations are more open to it.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Gavin, [[Daily Express]], [https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/935737/bitcoin-news-cryptocurrency-law-latest-price "MAPPED: Where is Bitcoin legal?

Controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montejano |first1=David |title=Who is Samuel P.

Huntington]] considered Latin America and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] world somewhat distinct from his conception of the ''Western world'' for his geopolitical analysis.&lt;ref name=WorldOfCivil&gt;[http://s02.middlebury.edu/FS056A/Herb_war/clash3.htm THE WORLD OF CIVILIZATIONS: POST-1990] scanned image {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312101415/http://s02.middlebury.edu/FS056A/Herb_war/clash3.htm |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However he further dwells on the subject by stating that while in general researchers consider that the ''West'' has three main components, European, North America and Latin American. In his view, Latin America has followed a different development path from Europe and North America. Although it is a scion of European civilization, it also incorporates, to an extent, elements of indigenous American civilizations, absent from North America and Europe. It has had a corporatist and authoritarian culture that Europe had to a much lesser extent and America did not have at all. Both Europe and North America felt the effects of the Reformation and combined Catholic and Protestant culture. Historically, Latin America has been only Catholic, although this may be changing due to the influx of Protestants into the region. Some regions in Latin America incorporates indigenous cultures, which did not exist in Europe, and which were effectively annihilated in North America, and whose importance oscillates between two extremes: Mexico, Central America, Peru and Bolivia, on the one hand, and Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay on the other. However, he does mention that the modus operandi of the Catholic Church was to incorporate native elements of pagan European cultures into the general dogma of Catholicism, and the Native American elements could be perceived in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clash of Civilizations|last=|first=|author=Huntington, Samuel P.|year=1991|isbn=	978-0-684-84441-1|edition=6th|location=Washington, DC|pages=110–111|via=http://www.mercaba.org/SANLUIS/Historia/Universal/Huntington,%20Samuel%20-%20El%20choque%20de%20civilizaciones.pdf (in Spanish)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectively, Latin Americans themselves are divided when it comes to identifying themselves. Some say: "Yes, we are part of the West." Others say: "No, we have our own unique culture"; and a vast bibliographical material produced by Latin Americans and North Americans exposes in detail their cultural differences. Huntington goes on to mention that Latin America could be considered a sub-civilization within Western civilization, or a separate civilization, intimately related to the West and divided as to its belonging to it. While for an analysis focused on the international political consequences of civilizations, including relations between Latin America, on the one hand, and North America and Europe, on the other, the second option is the most appropriate and useful; he also mentions that the underlying conflict of Latin American belonging to the West must be eventually addressed in order to develop a cohesive Latin American identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clash of Civilizations|last=|first=|author=Huntington, Samuel P.|year=1991|isbn=978-0-684-84441-1|edition=6th|location=Washington, DC|pages=38–39|quote= The origin of western civilization is usually dated to 700 or 800 AD.

A series of scholars of civilization, including [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Alfred Kroeber]] and [[Carroll Quigley]] have identified and analyzed "Western civilization" as one of the [[civilization]]s that have historically existed and still exist today. Toynbee entered into quite an expansive mode, including as candidates those countries or cultures who became so heavily influenced by the West as to adopt these borrowings into their very self-identity; carried to its limit, this would in practice include almost everyone within the West, in one way or another. In particular, Toynbee refers to the ''intelligentsia'' formed among the educated elite of countries impacted by the European expansion of centuries past. While often pointedly nationalist, these cultural and political leaders interacted within the West to such an extent as to change both themselves and the West.&lt;ref name="Arnold J. Toynbee 1966"/&gt;

The [[theologian]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] conceived of the West as the set of civilizations descended from the [[Civilizations#Nile Valley Civilizations|Nile Valley Civilization]] of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Teilhard de Chardin, ''Le Phenomene Humain'' (1955), translated as ''The Phenomena of Man'' (New York 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian-American literary critic [[Edward Said]] uses the term occident in his discussion of [[orientalism]]. According to his [[binary opposition|binary]], the West, or Occident, created a romanticized vision of the East, or Orient to justify colonial and imperialist intentions. This Occident-Orient binary focuses on the Western vision of the East instead of any truths about the East. His theories are rooted in [[Hegel]]'s [[Master-slave dialectic]]: The Occident would not exist without the Orient and vice versa. Further, Western writers created this irrational, feminine, weak "Other" to contrast with the rational, masculine, strong West because of a need to create a difference between the two that would justify imperialist ambitions, according to the Said-influenced Indian-American theorist [[Homi K. Bhabha]].{{confusing-inline|date=July 2018}}

From a very different perspective, it has also been argued that the idea of the West is, in part, a non-Western invention, deployed in the non-West to shape and define non-Western pathways through or against modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett, A. 2004. ''The Idea of the West''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on torn countries===
According to [[Samuel P. Huntington]], Turkey, whose political leadership has systematically tried to Westernize the predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]] country with only 3% of its territory within Europe since the 1920s, is his chief example of a "torn country" that is attempting to join Western civilization.&lt;ref name=WorldOfCivil/&gt; The country's elite started the [[Westernization]] efforts, beginning with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], who took power as the first president of the modern Turkish nation-state in 1923, imposed western institutions and dress, removed the Arabic alphabet and embraced the Latin alphabet, joined NATO, and are seeking to [[accession of Turkey to the European Union|join the European Union]] since the 1960s with very slow progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order|author=Samuel P. Huntington|publisher=The Free Press|pages=144–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico and Russia are also considered to be torn by Huntington. He also gives the example of Australia as a country torn between its Western civilizational heritage and its growing economic engagement with Asia. Russia, Japan, and India also, are what Huntington terms 'swing civilizations'.

However, unlike the game theory concept, zero-sum thinking refers to a psychological [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]]—a person's subjective interpretation of a situation. Zero-sum thinking is captured by the saying "your gain is my loss" (or conversely, "your loss is my gain"). Rozycka-Tran et al. (2015) defined zero-sum thinking as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A general belief system about the antagonistic nature of social relations, shared by people in a society or culture and based on the [[implicit assumption]] that a finite amount of goods exists in the world, in which one person’s winning makes others the losers, and vice versa [...] a relatively permanent and general conviction that social relations are like a zero-sum game. People who share this conviction believe that success, especially economic success, is possible only at the expense of other people’s failures." (pps. 526–528).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Causes of zero-sum thinking ==
Zero-sum thinking is the result of both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate and ultimate causes]].

=== Ultimate causes ===
In terms of ultimate causation, zero-sum thinking might be a legacy of human evolution. Specifically, it might be understood to be a [[psychological adaptation]] that facilitated successful resource competition in the [[Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of ancestral humans]] where resources like mates, status, and food were perpetually scarce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Darwinian Politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom|last=Rubin|first=Paul|publisher=Rutgers|year=2002|isbn=9780813530963|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, Rubin suggests that the pace of technological growth was so slow during the period in which modern humans evolved that no individual would have observed any growth during their lifetime: "Each person would live and die in a world of constant technology and income. Thus, there was no incentive to evolve a mechanism for understanding or planning for growth" (p.&amp;nbsp;162).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rubin also points to instances where the understanding of laypeople and economists about economic situations diverge, such as the [[Lump of labour fallacy|lump-of-labor fallacy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From this perspective, zero-sum thinking might be understood as the default way that humans think about resource allocations, which must be unlearned by, for example, an education in basic [[economics]].

=== Proximate causes ===
Zero-sum thinking can also be understood in terms of proximate causation, which refers to the [[Ontogeny|developmental history of individuals within their own lifetime]]. The proximate causes of zero-sum thinking include the experiences that individuals have with resource allocations, as well as their [[belief]]s about specific situations, or their [[World view|beliefs about the world in general]].

==== Resource-scarce environments ====
One of the proximate causes of zero-sum thinking is the experiences that individuals have with scarce resources or zero-sum interactions in their developmental environment.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=George M.|date=1965-04-01|title=Peasant Society and the Image of Limited Good*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1965.67.2.02a00010/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=293–315|doi=10.1525/aa.1965.67.2.02a00010|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[George M. Foster (anthropologist)|George M. Foster]] argued that members of "peasant" societies have an "[[Limited good|Image of Limited Good]]," which he argued was learned through by experiences in a society that was essentially zero-sum.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The model of cognitive orientation that seems to me best to account for peasant behavior is the "Image of Limited Good." By "Image of Limited Good" I mean that broad areas of peasant behavior are patterned in such fashion as to suggest that peasants view their social, economic, and natural universes—their total environment—as one in which all of the desired things in life such as land, wealth, health, friendship and love, manliness and honor, respect and status, power and influence, security and safety, exist in finite quantity and are always in short supply, as far as the peasant is concerned. Not only do these and all other "good things" exist in finite and limited quantities, but in addition there is no way directly within peasant power to increase the available quantities [...] When the peasant views his economic world as one in which Limited Good prevails, and he can progress only at the expense of another, he is usually very near the truth." (pps. 67-68) &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;More recently, Rozycka-Tran et al. (2015) conducted a [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural study]] that compared the responses of individuals in 37 nations to a scale of zero-sum beliefs. This scale asked individuals to report their agreement with statements that measured zero-sum thinking. For example, one item on the scale stated that "Successes of some people are usually failures of others". Rozycka-Tran et al. found that individuals in countries with lower [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] showed stronger zero-sum beliefs on average, suggesting that "the belief in zero-sum game seems to arise in countries with lower income, where resources are scarce" (p.&amp;nbsp;539).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Similarly, Rozycka-Tran et al. found that individuals with lower [[socioeconomic status]] displayed stronger zero-sum beliefs.

==== Resource scarcity beliefs ====
Related to experiences with resource-scarce environments is the belief that a resource is scarce or finite. For example, the [[lump of labour fallacy]] refers to the belief that in the economy there is a fixed amount of work to be done, and thus the allocation of jobs is zero-sum.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/07/opinion/lumps-of-labor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is the belief that the amount of wealth in the economy is fixed, and so when some individuals become more wealthy, it is at the expense of others (because there is assumed to be no growth in the "pie").&lt;ref name="forbes-2006"&gt;https://www.forbes.com/global/2006/0109/035A.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although the belief that a resource is scarce might develop through experiences with resource scarcity, this is not necessarily the case. For example, individuals might come to believe that wealth is finite because it is a claim that has been repeated by politicians or journalists.&lt;ref name="forbes-2006" /&gt;

==== Resource entitlement beliefs ====
Another proximate cause of zero-sum thinking is the belief that one (or one's group) is entitled to a certain share of a resource.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobo|first=Lawrence|last2=Hutchings|first2=Vincent L.|date=1996-01-01|title=Perceptions of Racial Group Competition: Extending Blumer's Theory of Group Position to a Multiracial Social Context|jstor=2096302|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=61|issue=6|pages=951–972|doi=10.2307/2096302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An extreme case is the belief that one is entitled to all of a resource that exists, implying that any gains by another is one's own loss. Less extreme is the belief that one (or one's group) is superior and therefore entitled to more than others. For example, perceptions of zero-sum group competition have been associated with the [[Social dominance orientation#Dominance Sub-Scale|Dominance sub-scale]] of the [[Social dominance orientation|Social Dominance Orientation]] personality trait, which itself has been characterized as a zero-sum worldview ("a view of human existence as zero-sum," p.&amp;nbsp;999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidanius|first=Jim|last2=Pratto|first2=Felicia|last3=Bobo|first3=Lawrence|title=Social dominance orientation and the political psychology of gender: A case of invariance?|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.998|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67|issue=6|pages=998–1011|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who practice monogamy have also been found to think about love in [[Polyamory|consensually nonmonogamous]] relationships as zero-sum, and it was suggested that this might be because they believe that individuals in romantic relationships have an entitlement to their partner's love.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Effects of zero-sum thinking ==
When individuals think that a situation is zero-sum, they will be more likely to act competitively (or less cooperatively) towards others, because they will see others as a competitive threat. For example, when students think that they are being [[Grading on a curve|graded on a curve]]—a grading scheme that makes the allocation of grades zero-sum—they will be less likely to provide assistance to a peer who is proximate in status to themselves, because that peer's gain could be their own loss.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When individuals perceive that there is a zero-sum competition in society for resources like jobs, they will be less likely to hold pro-immigration attitudes (because immigrants would deplete the resource).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Zero-sum thinking may also lead to certain social prejudices. When individuals hold zero-sum beliefs about love in romantic relationships, they are more prejudiced against [[Polyamory|consensual nonmonogamists]] (presumably because the perception of zero-sumness makes consensual nonmonogamy seem inadequate or unfair).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
