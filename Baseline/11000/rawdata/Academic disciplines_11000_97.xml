      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">'''Abraham Zevi Idelsohn''' ({{lang-he-n|אַבְרָהָם צְבִי אידלסון}} ''Avrohom Tzvi Idelsohn'' in [[Ashkenazi]] Hebrew; middle name also rendered '''''Tzvi''''', '''''Zvi''''', '''''Zwi''''', or '''''Zebi'''''; July 14, 1882 – August 14, 1938) was a prominent [[Jewish]] [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[musicology|musicologist]] and [[composer]], who conducted several comprehensive studies of [[Jewish music]] around the world.

Idelsohn was born in [[Feliksberg]], [[Latvia]] and trained as a [[Hazzan|cantor]]. He worked briefly in both Europe and [[South Africa]] before emigrating to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1905 and establishing a school of Jewish music there in 1919. In 1922 he moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] to take a position as professor of Jewish music at [[Hebrew Union College]]. He died in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lebrecht, ''The complete companion to 20th century music'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000. p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Idelsohn is generally acknowledged as the “father” of modern Jewish musicology. During his time in Jerusalem, he noted a great diversity of musical traditions among the Jews living in the region.  Idelsohn examined these traditional melodies and found recurring motifs and progressions that were not found in any other national music. This suggested a common origin for musical phrases that went back to Israel/Palestine in the first century C.E. He found that these motifs fell into three distinct tonal centers, which corresponded to the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes of the ancient Greeks. Each of these modes elicited a distinct psycho-emotional response. The Dorian Mode was used for texts of an elevated and inspired nature; the Phrygian for sentimental texts, with their very human outbreaks of feeling, both of joy and grief; and the Lydian was used in composing music for the texts of lamenting and confessions of sins. Idelsohn further categorized and defined these motives as ones that either prepared a musical phrase,  began it, or concluded it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Echoes: Rediscovering Music &amp; Chant of Middle Eastern Spirituality |publisher=San Antonio Vocal Arts Ensemble. savae.org|url=http://www.savae.org/echoes1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324162522/http://www.savae.org/echoes1.html |archive-date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works include the monumental ''Thesaurus of Hebrew Oriental Melodies'' (10 volumes, 1914–1932) and ''Jewish Music'' (1929). He is considered to be the author of the lyrics of the famous Jewish [[Folk music|folk song]] "[[Hava Nagila]]."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.radiohazak.com/Havahist.html ''Who Wrote Havah Nagilah?'' at RadioHazak.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "jofferadio4"&gt;[[Joel Joffe]] mentioned his grandfather and his grandfather's role in writing [[Hava Nagila]] in an appearance on [http://www.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m14s49s53&amp;SecId=53&amp;AId=56480&amp;ATypeId=1 BBC Radio 4 Desert Island Discs on 28 October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the maternal grandfather of [[Joel Joffe|Joel Goodman Joffe (Baron Joffe)]].&lt;ref name = "jofferadio4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More evidence of the relationship between Idelsohn and Joffe is provided in [http://himelfarb.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I669&amp;tree=Markel this family tree]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2753">'''Asset health management''' or ('''AHM''') is the field of study which looks at how to manage the "health" of an [[asset]] or assets.  This often includes methods to establish asset health and effort to decide the appropriate actions to be taken to manage the assets' health. This also includes the discussion of health at end of life to ensure the asset's full life is used efficiently.

Asset health management includes many different methods which can sometime overlap in their intended scope and methods.  Asset health management has become a difficult field to discuss due to the use of the same acronym to describe multiple different approaches and the use of the same approach with different names.  

Asset health management can be considered a subset of [[Asset management]]

==Asset health management taxonomy==
Asset health management consists of multiple strategies and parts but a rough description is given as follows.{{cn|date=July 2016}}
* Asset health [[diagnostics]]
: Methods used to establish the current health of the asset
* Asset health [[prognostics]]
: Methods used to predict how the health of the asset will change in the future
* Asset health maintenance
: see [[:Category:Maintenance]]
: including [[maintenance, repair, and operations]] (better referred to as maintenance, repair,and overhaul)  These methods are used to keep an asset health, restore health to an asset or through major work restore usable life to an asset.
* Asset end of life decisions
* Asset disposal

==Management of multiple assets==
There is often also a consideration of additional work done to manage the health of multiple assets within the same framework.
Sometimes referred to as Fleet health management and falling within the study of [[Fleet management]]. Although it is common to need to manage the health of multiple assets they are not always vehicles and frequently of mixed type.

When resources are constrained it is a fascinating management problem to consider how best to manage the health of assets.  It is rare that assets can be managed in an unconstrained way  as resources are always limited by a need to make efficient use of them.

==Asset health management relevant standards==
A collection of some standards which are often use to manage the health of assets.
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list and will organically improve.
* [[Open O&amp;M]]
* [[MSG-3]]

==Asset health management examples==
A short list is provided to illustrate the many methods that are some sort of asset health management method or philosophy.
* [[IVHM]]
* [[Built-in_self-test]]
* [[Built-in_test_equipment]]
* [[HUMS]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">'''CI1 fossils''' refer to alleged morphological evidence of [[microfossils]] found in five CI1 [[carbonaceous chondrite]] [[meteorite fall]]: Alais, [[Orgueil (meteorite)|Orgueil]], Ivuna, Tonk and Revelstoke. The research was published in March 2011 in the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]'' by [[Richard B. Hoover]], an engineer. However, NASA distanced itself from Hoover's claim and his lack of expert peer-reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kerry | last = Sheridan | title = NASA shoots down alien fossil claims | date = 7 March 2011 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/08/3157645.htm | work = ABC News | accessdate = 2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
{{Main|Journal of Cosmology#Hoover paper controversy}}
Hoover's team used Environmental ([[ESEM]]) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy ([[FESEM]]) to analyze the meteorite samples, studying internal surfaces. Hoover also produced  electron micrographs which he believes resemble the shape of [[trichomic]] [[cyanobacteria]] and other trichomic [[prokaryotes]] such as the [[filamentous sulfur bacteria]]. For comparison, Hoover compared the samples to those of terrestrial minerals and biological materials. Hoover concludes from these results that the CI1 fossils are indigenous to the samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journalofcosmology.com/Life100.html | journal=[[Journal of Cosmology]] | year= 2011 | volume=  13 | title=Fossils of Cyanobacteria in CI1 Carbonaceous Meteorites:  Implications to Life on Comets, Europa, and Enceladus | first=Richard B. |last=Hoover| accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims were initially submitted to the ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]'', which rejected the paper,&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt; but were eventually published by the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]''. NASA distanced itself from Hoover's claims,&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;

The '''Center for International Political Analysis''' ('''CIPA''') is a research center at the [[Policy Research Institute]] (PRI) at the [[University of Kansas]].
The primary project focus at present is on gathering information regarding the nature of inter-state relations during times of conflict in several localized areas: the [[Middle East]], Southern, Western, and Central Africa, and the [[Balkans]].

==Purpose==
Using filtered news leads in conjunction with a series of numeric codes, these inter-state relations can be quantified—both in number and intensity—through computer-aided coding.
In addition, CIPA employs several human coders to track mass atrocities throughout the world.
CIPA operates with funding from multiple sources with different research needs, although the overarching goal of the project is predictive in nature.
In all facets of the project's research, the intent is to advance efforts to understand and anticipate civil strife, [[genocide]], and mass killings.

== Project History ==

The Center for International Political Analysis is an outgrowth of [[Philip Schrodt]]'s and [[Deborah Gerner]]'s work on the [[Kansas Event Data System]] (KEDS). The initial focus of the KEDS project was the development of techniques for converting English-language reports of political events into event data.
&lt;br&gt;This replaced labor-intensive and error-prone process of human coding with inexpensive, transparent and reproducible automated coding.
&lt;br&gt;The centerpiece of this effort is the [[American Political Science Association|APSA]]-award-winning KEDS computer program, a [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] program with a user-friendly interface and a variety of output options. In support of KEDS, Schrodt and Gerner's staff produced several programs for filtering texts and aggregating the resulting event data so that it can be used in [[statistical analysis]]. The KEDS program has now been used in about half-a-dozen [[National Science Foundation]]-funded event data projects, as well as a number of dissertations and other smaller projects. The development and popularization of the KEDS software paved the way for CIPA's current framework, Tabari.

The early KEDS work focused primarily on the [[Levant]] region from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. Most of this research focused on the development of early warning techniques for political change, primarily using the Levant as a case study. The project experimented with a number of different methods, including factor analysis, discriminant analysis, an assortment of clustering algorithms, and [[hidden Markov]] models.

In recent years, grants from [[Science Applications International Corporation]] and the National Science Foundation have allowed CIPA to expand the scope of its research into [[Africa]], [[Yemen]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In addition, these grants have facilitated a shift in the CIPA project focus. Upcoming data sets will likely reflect a greater emphasis on contentious intrastate political relations.

==History==

CQUPT was founded in 1950 along with the foundation of the People's Republic of China and the communist takeover of Chongqing. It was initially founded in the name of Chongqing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. In 1965, it was entitled to have postgraduate programs as one of the first 10 colleges that had the right to have such programs in the then Sichuan Province (Chongqing separated from Sichuan Province as a Municipality in 1997).

In 2000, under the university system reform in China, the university became co-governed and co-financed by the Chinese Central Government with the Chongqing government. In 2006, CQUPT contracted with MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China) to become one of the universities supported by Ministry and Province (Municipalities) government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/xxgk/lsyg.php History of CQUPT]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16032">'''Classwide Peer Tutoring''' ('''CWPT''') is a variation of [[peer-mediated instruction]] that has been used in elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms. In CWPT students form pairs and take turns in the roles of tutor and student. Students earn points for their teams by participating in the tutoring and the winning team is recognized. Researchers have investigated CWPT's effectiveness in several different academic areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) is a form of [[peer-mediated instruction]] where the teacher creates pairs of students that alternately fill the roles of tutor and student. The tutor asks questions, records points, and provides feedback on whether the student's response matches the correct response designated by the teacher. The student responds orally and/or in writing to the questions and practices the correct answer three times if he or she makes an error.&lt;ref name=Terry&gt;{{cite web|last=Terry|first=Barbara|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/~kucrl/cgi-bin/drupal/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring|work=University of Kansas Special Connections|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher supervises the tutoring and awards points for good tutoring.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; A classroom's student pairs are divided into two teams, and they earn points for their respective teams by answering questions correctly, correcting their incorrect answers, and tutoring appropriately.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|journal=Behavior and Social Issues|year=1997|volume=7|issue=1|page=52-57|doi=10.5210/bsi.v7i1.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a week, the team that has earned the most points is recognized as the winning team.&lt;ref name="Best Evidence Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview: Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.bestevidence.org/overviews/C/classwide.htm|work=Best Evidence Encyclopedia|publisher=Johns Hopkins University School of Education|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CWPT has been used to help students learn [[spelling]], math facts, basic word reading, reading fluency, [[vocabulary]], and facts related to an area of study.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; There appear to be more published studies of CWPT with positive outcomes in the area of spelling than in other areas. The CWPT technique has been used with several different age levels: pre-school, elementary, middle school, and high school.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT was initially developed and researched in the early 1980s at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs that Work: Classwide Peer Tutoring Program|url=http://www.promisingpractices.net/program.asp?programid=99|publisher=Promising Practices Network|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
The developers of CWPT suggest that this technique provides students more opportunities to practice content or skills, encourages them to engage in [[active learning]], and lets them receive immediate feedback.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT is also thought to provide students with practice using [[social skills]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamps Barbetta Leonard &amp; Delquadri"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamps|first=Debra|author2=Barbetta, Patricia |author3=Leonard, Betsy |author4= Delquadri, Joseph |title=Classwide Peer Tutoring: An Integration Strategy To Improve Reading Skills And Promote Peer Interactions Among Students With Autism And General Education Peers|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|page=49-61|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-49|pmc=1297776}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation as an evidence-based practice ===
==== What Works Clearinghouse rating ====
The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[What Works Clearinghouse]] has evaluated CWPT for effectiveness in the areas of General Reading Achievement and [[English language learning and teaching|English Language Learning]] (ELL). These evaluations resulted in a "potentially positive" effectiveness rating in the area of General Reading Achievement for elementary school students, and no rating for ELL due to the fact that no existing studies met What Works Clearinghouse criteria for evaluation.&lt;ref name="WWC reading"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring Beginning Reading|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=81|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWC ELL"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring English Language Learners|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=83|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Works Clearinghouse does not currently provide reports for CWPT's effectiveness in any other areas.

==== Promising Practices Network rating ====
Promising Practices Network considers CWPT a "Proven Program".&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt; The website states that CWPT meets full criteria for a "Proven Program" by having research outcomes that fall in the category of the website's target areas, having at least one outcome that is changed by at least 20% or .25 [[standard deviation]]s, having at least one outcome with a statistically significant and meaningful [[effect size]], having studies that use comparison groups, having studies with sample sizes of 30 or more, and by having research findings publicly available.&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A few studies have shown CWPT to have few advantages over more traditional methods of classroom instruction with middle or high school students, such as teacher-centered instruction or independent practice.&lt;ref name="Allsopp 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allsopp|first=David|title=Using classwide peer tutoring to teach beginning algebra problem-solving skills in heterogeneous classrooms.|journal=Remedial and Special Education|year=1997|volume=18|issue=6|page=367-379|doi=10.1177/074193259701800606}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman-Perrott 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman-Perrott|first=Lisa|author2=Greenwood, Charles R |author3=Tapia, Yolanda |title=The efficacy of CWPT used in secondary alternative school classrooms with small teacher/pupil ratios and students with emotional and behavioral disorders.|journal=Education &amp; Treatment of Children|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|page=65-87|doi=10.1353/etc.2007.0014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also found that while CWPT may increase the positive social interactions of students with ADHD during the tutoring, it does not necessarily affect their social behavior in other settings.&lt;ref name="Plumer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plumer|first=Pamela|author2=Stoner, Gary|title=The relative effects of classwide peer tutoring and peer coaching on the positive social behaviors of children with ADHD.|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|year=2005|volume=9|issue=1|page=290-300|doi=10.1177/1087054705280796}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cog''' is a type of ship that first appeared in the 10th century, and was widely used from around the 12th century on. Cogs were [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker-built]], generally of [[oak]], which was an abundant timber in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region of [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]. This vessel was fitted with a single [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] and a [[square-rigged]] single sail. These vessels were mostly associated with seagoing trade in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], especially the [[Hanseatic League]], particularly in the [[Baltic Sea]] region. They ranged from about {{convert|15|to|25|m|ft|sp=us}} in length with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|5|to|8|m|ft|sp=us}}, and the largest cog ships could carry up to about 200 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamburg Museum - Medieval Hamburg (4) - The Cog - A Cargo-carrying Vessel of the Middle Ages|url=http://www.hamburgmuseum.de/e/htm_e/neu/t-1og-mittelalter04.html|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cogs were a type of round ship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100430604|title=Round ship|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=en|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by a flush-laid flat bottom at midships but gradually shifted to overlapped [[strake]]s near the posts. They had full [[Clinker (boat building)|lapstrake, or clinker,]] planking covering the sides, generally starting from the bilge strakes, and [[Nail (fastener)|double-clenched]] [[iron]] nails for plank fastenings. The [[keel]], or keelplank, was only slightly thicker than the adjacent [[Strake#Special strakes|garboards]] and had no [[rabbet]]. Both [[stem (ship)|stem]] and [[sternpost|stern posts]] were straight and rather long, and connected to the keelplank through intermediate pieces called hooks. The lower plank hoods terminated in rabbets in the hooks and posts, but upper hoods were nailed to the exterior faces of the posts. [[Caulking]] was generally tarred moss that was inserted into curved grooves, covered with wooden laths, and secured by metal staples called ''sintels''. Finally, the cog-built structure could not be completed without a stern-mounted hanging central [[rudder]], which was a unique northern development.&lt;ref name="Crumlin-Pedersen"/&gt; Cogs used to have open hulls and could be rowed short distances. In the 13th century they received decks.

==History==
Cogs are first mentioned in 948 AD, in [[Muiden]] near Amsterdam. These early cogs were influenced by the Norse [[Knarr]], which was the main trade vessel in northern Europe at the time, and probably used a steering oar, as there is nothing to suggest a stern rudder in northern Europe until about 1240.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.se/~m10354/mar/cog.htm|title=The Cog|last=Åkesson|first=Per|date=January 1999|accessdate=14 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326002623/https://www.abc.se/~m10354/mar/cog.htm|archivedate=26 March 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bremen Hansekogge RolandvonBremen.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Reconstruction of the cog ''Roland von Bremen'']]
Current archaeological evidence points to the [[Frisia]]n coast or Western [[Jutland]] as the possible birthplace of this type of vessel. The transformation of the cog into a true seagoing trader came not only during the time of the intense trade between West and East, but also as a direct answer to the closure of the western entrance to the [[Limfjord]]. For centuries, Limfjord in northern Jutland offered fairly protected passage between the [[North Sea]] and the Baltic. Due to unusual geographical conditions and strong currents, the passage was constantly filling with sand and was completely blocked by the 12th century. This change produced new challenges. Bigger ships that could not be pulled across the sand bars had to sail around the Jutland peninsula and circumnavigate the dangerous Cape [[Skagen]] to get to the Baltic. This resulted in major modifications to old ship structures, which can be observed by analyzing evolution of the earliest cog finds of ''Kollerup'', ''Skagen'', and ''Kolding''.

The need for spacious and relatively inexpensive ships led to the development of the first workhorse of the [[Hanseatic League]], the cog. The new and improved cog was no longer a simple Frisian coaster but a sturdy seagoing trader, which could cross even the most dangerous passages. Fore and stern castles would be added for defense against [[pirate]]s, or to enable use of these vessels as warships, such as used at the [[Battle of Sluys]]. The stern castle also afforded more cargo space below by keeping the crew and tiller up, out of the way. 

Eventually, around the 14th century, the cog reached its structural limits, resulting in the desperate need for a quick replacement. The replacement, the [[hulk (medieval ship type)|hulk]], already existed but awaited reconditioning. Although there is no evidence that hulks descended from the cogs, it is clear that a lot of technological ideas were adapted from one to the other and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Crumlin-Pedersen"/&gt; The transition from cogs to hulks was not linear. According to some interpretations, both vessels coexisted for many centuries but followed diverse lines of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gardiner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Unger|editor2-first=Richard W.|date=August 1994|title=Cogs, Caravels and Galleons: The Sailing Ship, 1000-1650|series=Conway's History of the Ship|location=London|publisher=[[Conway Maritime Press]]|isbn=978-0-85177-560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
[[Image:Hansekogge Bremerhaven uf.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Reconstructed excavated cog from 1380 at [[Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum]]]]
The most famous cog still in existence today is the [[Bremen cog]], depicted at left. It dates from the 1380s, and was found in 1962; until then cogs had only been known from medieval documents and seals.

In 1990, well-preserved remains of a Hanseatic cog were discovered in the estuary sediment of the [[Pärnu River]] in [[Estonia]]&lt;ref name="101 Eesti laeva"&gt;Õun, Mati and Hanno Ojalo. 2015. ''101 Eesti laeva''. Tallinn, Kirjastus Varrak, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Pärnu Cog has been dated to 1300.&lt;ref name="101 Eesti laeva"/&gt;

In 2012, a cog preserved from the keel up to the decks in the silt was discovered alongside two smaller vessels in the river [[IJssel]] in the city of [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]], in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruimtevoorderivierijsseldelta.nl/nl/excavation-recovery-and-conservation-of-a-15th-century-cog-from-the-river-ijssel-near-kampen-in-the/|title=Excavation, recovery and conservation of a 15th century Cog from the river IJssel near Kampen|website=Ruimte voor de Rivier IJsseldelta|publisher=[[Rijkswaterstaat]]|date=September 2015|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship, dating from the early 15th century, was suspected to have been deliberately sunk into the river to influence its current. Consequently, little was expected to be found in the wreck, but during excavation and recovery in February 2016 an intact brick dome oven and glazed tiles were found in the galley as well as a number of other artifacts about the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/53734-dutch-shipwreck-hauled-from-water.html|title=Medieval Shipwreck Hauled from the Deep|last=Ghose|first=Tia|date=17 February 2016|website=[[Live Science]]|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/late-medieval-cog-from-kempen/|title=Late Medieval Cog from Kampen|date=21 February 2016|website=Medieval Histories|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In The [[United States]] [[criminal justice system]], a '''Courtroom Workgroup''' is an informal arrangement between a criminal [[prosecutor]], [[criminal defense attorney]], and the [[judicial officer]]. This foundational concept in the academic discipline of [[criminal justice]] recharacterizes the seemingly adversarial courtroom participants as collaborators in "doing justice." The courtroom workgroup was proposed by Eisenstein and Jacob in 1977 to explain their observations of the ways courts, especially lower level courts, actually come to decisions.

Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works, it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants. The academic theory of the courtroom workgroup has four cornerstone concepts that recognize this fact: Speed, Pragmatic Cynicism, Collegiality, and Secrecy. Efficient courtroom workgroups seek to process cases rather than dispense justice. This has been confirmed to greater and lesser extents in different courts.  [[Defendant]]s are assumed to be guilty. The procedural merits of the case are the true determinative factors of an outcome. Prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in a comparison of charges against possible procedural flaws and possible defenses to arrive at the going rate for a crime.  These factors are used to determine how much punishment the plea bargain will offer.  For example, group relationships and the desire to "maintain" a healthy working relationship are important to group members. The workings of the courtroom group and the "going rate" for given crimes are not matters for public disclosure. Estimates can be given to clients, but usually couched in terms of the prosecution's willingness to negotiate. (Summarized by O'Connor, T.R., 2005)

The courtroom workgroup is a mechanism for [[prosecutorial discretion]].  Various techniques are used to convince the defendant that the evidence against him or her is overwhelming.  “Charge stacking” is a process by which police and prosecutors create a case with numerous charges or numerous instances of the same charge to convince the defendant that the risk of not pleading guilty is intolerable.  The defendant may be convinced to plead guilty to a few of the charges in return for not being prosecuted for the remaining charges.

The courtroom workgroup is, in some sense, a response to a lack of resources for public defenders.  Defense attorneys in public defender offices often do not have sufficient time to prepare a case in detail for all of their clients.  Further, they often do not have the budget to fully investigate the facts of a case through either staff or private investigators.  They often must rely solely on police reports for such information.  In some jurisdictions, clients do not meet their attorneys until they are in court.  Typically, public defenders will meet briefly with clients in holding facilities or jails.  The defense attorney defends his or her client by seeking less punishment.  Huemann (1977) indicates that many defense attorneys feel pressured to keep up with their caseloads.  This pressure can manifest in the courtroom through rebukes by the judge for delays.  Many subtle pressures combine to encourage participation in the courtroom workgroup.

The concept of a courtroom workgroup is associated with plea bargaining. The courtroom workgroup shows remarkable explanatory power in overburdened courts dealing with large caseloads.  The courtroom workgroup model is best suited to explain jurisdictions where defense attorneys are more or less permanently assigned, but even occasionally appointed lawyers can participate in these practices. While many of the higher level prosecutions still follow the adversarial model, there is evidence that lower-level proceedings follow the courtroom workgroup model. Boland, Brady, Tyson, &amp; Bassler (1983) indicate that approximately 90 percent of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain. This figure appears to be stable over the last twenty years (Rainville &amp; Reaves, 2003). Some collaborative efforts on the part of the courtroom workgroup simply must be present to facilitate this high percentage of pleas.

[[File:Sullivan by Millais.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Sullivan by [[John Everett Millais]]]]
The critical reputation of the British composer '''[[Arthur Sullivan]]''' has fluctuated markedly in the 150 years since he came to prominence. At first, critics regarded him as a potentially great composer of serious masterpieces, the long-awaited great English composer.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 28 and 42&lt;/ref&gt; When Sullivan made a series of popular successes in [[Gilbert and Sullivan|comic operas]] with the librettist [[W.S. Gilbert]], [[Victorian era|Victorian]] critics generally praised the operettas but reproached Sullivan for not concentrating on composing solemn choral works and grand opera instead. Immediately after Sullivan's death, his reputation was attacked by critics who condemned him for not taking part in what they conceived of as an "English musical renaissance". By the latter part of the 20th century, Sullivan's music was being critically reassessed, beginning with the first book devoted to a study of his music, ''The Music of Arthur Sullivan'' by [[Gervase Hughes]] (1960).

==Early career==
[[File:arthur sullivan by ape.jpg|right|thumb|Sullivan by the cartoonist [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|'Ape']].]]
When the young [[Arthur Sullivan]] returned to England after his studies in Leipzig, critics were struck by his potential as a composer. His incidental music to ''The Tempest'' received an acclaimed premiere at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] on 5 April 1862. The ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' wrote:

{{quote|It was one of those events which mark an epoch in a man's life; and, what is of more universal consequence, it may mark an epoch in English music, or we shall be greatly disappointed. Years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise, so full of fancy, showing so much conscientiousness, so much skill, and so few references to any model elect.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

His ''Irish Symphony'' of 1866 won similarly enthusiastic praise: "The symphony...is not only by far the most noticeable composition that has proceeded from Mr. Sullivan's pen, but the best musical work, if judged only by the largeness of its form and the number of beautiful thoughts it contains, for a long time produced by any English composer."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', quoted in Jacobs, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; But as [[Arthur Jacobs]] notes, "The first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last." A comment that may be taken as typical of those that would follow the composer throughout his career was that "Sullivan's unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan was also occasionally cited for a lack of diligence. For instance, of his early oratorio, ''The Prodigal Son'', his teacher, [[John Goss (composer)|John Goss]], wrote:
{{quote|All you have done is most masterly – Your orchestration superb, &amp; your effects many of them original &amp; first-rate. ... Some day, you will, I hope, try another oratorio, putting out all your strength, but not the strength of a few weeks or months, whatever your immediate friends may say ... only don't do anything so pretentious as an oratorio or even a Symphony without ''all your power'', which seldom comes in one fit.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 22 December 1869, quoted in Allen and Gale, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Transition to opera==
By the mid-1870s, Sullivan had turned his attention mainly to works for the theatre, for which he was generally admired. For instance, after the first performance of ''Trial by Jury'' (1875), the ''Times'' said that "It seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Allen, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; But serious music critics began to express disapproval. The music critic [[Peter Gammond]] writes of "misapprehensions and prejudices, delivered to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd.&amp;nbsp;... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art."&lt;ref&gt;Gammond, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; By the time ''The Sorcerer'' appeared in 1877, there were charges that Sullivan was wasting his talents in comic opera:

{{quote|There is nothing whatever in Mr. Sullivan's score which any theatrical conductor engaged at a few pounds a week could not have written equally well.... We trust Mr. Sullivan is more proud of it than we can pretend to be. But we must confess to a sense of disappointment at the downward art course Mr. Sullivan appears to be now drifting into.... [He] has all the ability to make him a great composer, but he wilfully throws his opportunity away. A giant may play at times, but Mr. Sullivan is always playing.... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling.&lt;ref&gt;''Figaro'', quoted in Allen, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Implicit in these comments was the view that comic opera, no matter how carefully crafted, was an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. The ''Athenaeum's'' review of ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'' expressed a similar complaint: "It might be wished that in some portions Mr Sullivan had taken a loftier view of his theme, but at any rate he has written some most charming music, and orchestration equal, if not superior, to any that has ever proceeded from the pen of an English musician. And, further, it is an advantage to have the composer of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' occupying himself with a worthier form of art."&lt;ref&gt;25 October 1880, quoted in Jacobs, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The operas with Gilbert themselves, however, garnered Sullivan high praise from the theatre reviewers.  For instance, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, "The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account ''Iolanthe'' his best effort in all the Gilbertian series."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Allen, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ''Theatre'' would say that "the music of ''Iolanthe'' is Dr Sullivan's ''chef d'oeuvre''. The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works.... In every respect ''Iolanthe'' sustains Dr Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced."&lt;ref&gt;Beatty-Kingston, William. ''The Theatre'', 1 January 1883, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan received honorary  doctorates of music from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;"University Intelligence", ''The Times'', 18 May 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and Oxford in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;"University Intelligence", ''The Times'', 11 June 1879, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

|style="text-align: center;" |"A HUMOROUS KNIGHT."
|-
|style="text-align: center;" |["It is reported that after the Leeds Festival Dr. Sullivan will be knighted." Having read this in a column of gossip, a be-nighted Contributor, who has "the Judge's Song" on the brain, suggests the following verse, adapted to probabilities.]
|-
|style="text-align: left;" |
:As a boy I had such a musical bump,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And its size so struck Mr. H&lt;small&gt;ELMORE&lt;/small&gt;,
:That he said, "Though you sing those songs like a trump,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You shall write some yourself that will sell more."
:So I packed off to Leipsic, without ''looking back,''
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And returned in such classical fury,
:That I sat down with H&lt;small&gt;ANDEL&lt;/small&gt; and H&lt;small&gt;AYDN&lt;/small&gt; and B&lt;small&gt;ACH&lt;/small&gt;,—
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And turned out "''Trial by Jury."
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:But W.S.G. he jumped for joy
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As he said, "Though the job dismay you,
:Send Exeter Hall to the deuce, my boy;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's the ''haul'' with me that'll pay you."
:And we hauled so well, mid jeers and taunts,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That we've settled, spite all temptations,
:To stick to our Sisters and our Cousins and our Aunts,—
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And continue our pleasant relations.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:Yet I know a big Duke, and I've written for Leeds,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And I think (I don't wish to be snarly),
:If honour's poured out on a chap for his deeds,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm as good-—come, as M&lt;small&gt;ONCKTON&lt;/small&gt; or C&lt;small&gt;HARLEY&lt;/small&gt;!
:So the next "first night" and the Opéra C.,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Let's hope, if you're able to find him,
:You'll cry from the pit, "There's W. S. G.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the stalls,—''with a'' K&lt;small&gt;NIGHT&lt;/small&gt; ''behind him!'"
|}

After Sullivan was knighted in 1883, serious music critics renewed the charge that the composer was squandering his talent. The ''Musical Review'' of that year wrote:

{{quote|[S]ome things that Mr Arthur Sullivan may do, Sir Arthur ought not to do. In other words, it will look rather more than odd to see announced in the papers that a new comic opera is in preparation, the book by Mr W. S. Gilbert and the music by Sir Arthur Sullivan. A musical knight can hardly write shop ballads either; he must not dare to soil his hands with anything less than an anthem or a madrigal; oratorio, in which he has so conspicuously shone, and symphony, must now be his line. Here is not only an opportunity, but a positive obligation for him to return to the sphere from which he has too long descended [and] do battle for the honour of English art&amp;nbsp;... against all foreign rivals, and arouse us thoroughly from our present half-torpid condition..&lt;ref name=Baily250&gt;Baily, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Sir George Grove, who was an old friend of Sullivan's, recognised the artistry in the Savoy Operas while urging the composer to bigger and better things: "Surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice, orchestra, and stage effect—master, too, of so much genuine sentiment—may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest."&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Grove, George. "Sullivan, Arthur Seymour" ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', London 1879–89, p. 762, quoted in Sarema, Meinhard. [http://www.sullivan-forschung.de/meinhard/berlinas "In the Purgatory of Tradition: Arthur Sullivan and the English Musical Renaissance"], Deutsche Sullivan Gesellschaft, 2000, accessed 10 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere of ''The Golden Legend'' at the Leeds Festival in 1886 finally brought Sullivan the acclaim for a serious work that he had previously lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, pp. 161–63&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the critic of the ''Daily Telegraph'' wrote that "a greater, more legitimate and more undoubted triumph than that of the new cantata has not been achieved within my experience."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' hailed it as a "triumph of English art".&lt;ref&gt;"Leeds Music Festival", ''The Observer'', 17 October 1886, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Louis Engel in ''The World'' called it: "one of the greatest creations we have had for many years. Original, bold, inspired, grand in conception, in execution, in treatment, it is a composition which will make an "epoch" and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory. The effect it produced at rehearsal was enormous. The effect of the public performance was unprecedented."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harris, p. IV&lt;/ref&gt; Hopes for a new departure were evident in the ''Daily Telegraph'''s review of ''The Yeomen of the Guard'', Sullivan's most serious opera to that point:
{{quote|The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly.... We place the songs and choruses in ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Allen, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==1890s==
The advance that the ''Daily Telegraph'' was looking for would come with Sullivan's only grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1891), which opened to largely favourable reviews,&lt;ref&gt;Dailey, pp. 129–33&lt;/ref&gt; but attracted some significant negative ones. For instance, [[John Alexander Fuller Maitland|J. A. Fuller Maitland]] wrote in ''The Times'' that the opera's "best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;  In her 1891 essay "Arthur Seymour Sullivan", Florence A. Marshall reviewed Sullivan's music up to that time, concluding that Sullivan was torn between his interests in comedy and tragedy. She wrote that he was "no dreamy idealist, but thoroughly practical ... apprehending and assimilating all the tendencies in the life of society around him, and knowing how to turn them all to account ... music is, in his hands, a plastic material, into which he can mold anything. His mastery of form and of instrumentation is absolute, and he wields them without the slightest semblance of effort. His taste is ... unerring; his perceptions of the keenest; his sense of humor infectious and irresistible."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Florence A.  [http://www.haddon-hall.com/Libretti/FamousComposersSullivan.pdf "Arthur Seymour Sullivan"], ''Famous Composers and Their Works'', vol. 1, Millet Co.,1891&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, Sullivan's successes were fewer and farther between than earlier in his career. The ballet ''[[Victoria and Merrie England]]'' (1898) won praise from most critics:&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Arthur Sullivan's New Ballet", ''The Daily News'', 26 May 1897, p. 8; "Alhambra Theatre", ''The Morning Post'', 26 May 1897, p. 7; "Sir Arthur Sullivan's New Ballet 'Victoria'", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 26 May 1897, p. 7; "Music", ''The Illustrated London News'', 29 May 1897, p. 730; and "Victoria And Merrie England", ''The Era'', 29 May 1897, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Sir Arthur Sullivan's music is music for the people. There is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience. The melodies are all as fresh as last year's wine, and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne. There is not one tune which tires the hearing, and in the matter of orchestration our only humorous has let himself run riot, not being handicapped with libretto, and the gain is enormous.... All through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy, tunes of alarming simplicity, but never a tinge of vulgarity, and a total absence of the cymbal-brassy combination which some ballets never do without.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tillett 1998, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

After ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), the ''Daily Telegraph'' said that "The musician is once again absolutely himself", while the ''Musical Times'' opined that "it is music that to hear once is to want to hear again and again."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, Sullivan composed a popular song, "[[The Absent-Minded Beggar]]", to a text by [[Rudyard Kipling]], donating the proceeds of the sale to "the wives and children of soldiers and sailors" on active service in the Boer War. Fuller Maitland disapproved in ''The Times'', but Sullivan himself asked a friend, "Did the idiot expect the words to be set in cantata form, or as a developed composition with symphonic introduction, [[contrapuntal]] treatment, etc.?"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive Sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible, he was, nevertheless, "the nation's ''de facto'' composer laureate".&lt;ref&gt;Maine, Basil. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.001.0001/odnb-9780192683120-e-32988 "Elgar, Sir Edward William"], 1949, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' archive, accessed 20 April 2010 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan was considered the natural candidate to compose a ''Te Deum'' for the end of the Boer War, which he duly completed, despite serious ill-health; it was performed posthumously. Gian Andrea Mazzucato wrote this glowing summary of Sullivan's career in ''The Musical Standard'' of 16 December 1899:
{{quote|As regards music, the English history of the 19th century could not record the name of a man whose "life work" is more worthy of honour, study and admiration than the name of Sir Arthur Sullivan, whose useful activity, it may be expected, will extend considerably into the 20th century; and it is a debatable point whether the universal history of music can point to any musical personality since the days of [[Haydn]], Mozart and Beethoven, whose influence is likely to be more lasting than the influence the great Englishman is slowly, but surely, exerting, and whose results shall be clearly seen, perhaps, only by our posterity. I make no doubt that when, in proper course of time, Sir Arthur Sullivan's life and works have become known on the continent, he will, by unanimous consent, be classed among the epoch-making composers, the select few whose genius and strength of will empowered them to find and found a national school of music, that is, to endow their countrymen with the undefinable, yet positive means of evoking in a man's soul, by the magic of sound, those delicate nuances of feeling which are characteristic of the emotional power of each different race.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the ''Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Journal'', No. 34, Spring 1992, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

After Sullivan's death, [[George Grove|Sir George Grove]] wrote, "Form and symmetry he seems to possess by instinct; rhythm and melody clothe everything he touches; the music shows not only sympathetic genius, but sense, judgement, proportion, and a complete absence of pedantry and pretension; while the orchestration is distinguished by a happy and original beauty hardly surpassed by the greatest masters.".&lt;ref name=musicaltimes&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3368297 "Arthur Sullivan",] ''The Musical Times'' (1 December 1900), pp. 785–87 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary in ''The Times'' called him England's "most conspicuous composer ... the musician who had such power to charm all classes. ... The critic and the student found new beauties at every fresh hearing. What ... set Sullivan in popular esteem far above all the other English composers of his day was the tunefulness of his music, that quality in it by which ... [it] was immediately recognized as a joyous contribution to the gaiety of life. ... Sullivan’s name stood as a synonym for music in England." The obituary also stated: "Many who are able to appreciate classical music regret that Sir Arthur Sullivan did not aim consistently at higher things, that he set himself to rival Offenbach and Lecocq instead of competing on a level of high seriousness with such musicians as Sir Hubert Parry and Professor Stanford. If he had followed this path, he might have enrolled his name among the great composers of all time. ... That Sir Arthur Sullivan could aim high and succeed he proved by ''The Golden Legend'' and by a good deal of ''Ivanhoe''".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan's Obituary in ''The Times'', 23 November 1900, pp. 7 and 9, [http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/html/obit.html reprinted] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 12 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next decade, however, Sullivan's reputation sank considerably among music critics. In 1901, shortly after the composer's death, Fuller Maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries, citing the composer's failure to live up to the early praise of his ''Tempest'' music:
{{quote|Among the lesser men who are still ranked with the great composers, there are many who may only have reached the highest level now and then, but within whose capacity it lies to attain great heights; some may have produced work on a dead-level of mediocrity, but may have risen on some special occasion to a pitch of beauty or power which would establish their claim to be numbered among the great. Is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of Sir Arthur Sullivan, who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius, and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life?. &amp;nbsp;...  Though the illustrious masters of the past never did write music as vulgar, it would have been forgiven them if they had, in virtue of the beauty and value of the great bulk of their productions. It is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater, perhaps, than fell to any English musician since the time of [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]] – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them.... If the author of ''The Golden Legend'', the music to ''The Tempest'', ''Henry VIII'' and ''Macbeth'' cannot be classed with these, how can the composer of "Onward Christian Soldiers" and "The Absent-Minded Beggar" claim a place in the hierarchy of music among the men who would face death rather than smirch their singing robes for the sake of a fleeting popularity?&lt;ref&gt;Fuller Maitland, J. A. "Obituary", ''Cornhill Magazine'', March 1901, pp. 300–09&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[File:Sullivan to MacKenzie.png|thumb|left|250px|1897 cartoon relishing the irony of the failure of [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Mackenzie]]'s ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'', after Mackenzie and his Academy had claimed that Sullivan was "wasting his talent" on comic opera.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie wrote the comic opera ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' in 1897. The caption reads, "Don't find composing Comic-Opera so easy as you thought, do you, Mackenzie?"&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Edward Elgar]], to whom Sullivan had been particularly kind,&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; rose to Sullivan's defence, branding Fuller Maitland's obituary "the shady side of musical criticism&amp;nbsp;... that foul unforgettable episode."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Young, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller Maitland was later discredited when it was shown that he had falsified the facts, inventing a banal lyric, passing it off as genuine and condemning Sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity.&lt;ref name=burton/&gt; In 1929 Fuller Maitland admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss Sullivan's comic operas as "ephemeral".&lt;ref&gt;"Light Opera", ''The Times'', 22 September 1934, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''History of Music in England'' (1907) [[Ernest Walker (composer)|Ernest Walker]], was even more damning of Sullivan than Fuller Maitland had been in 1901:
{{quote|After all, Sullivan is merely the idle singer of an empty evening; with all his gift for tunefulness, he could never raise it to the height of a real strong melody of the kind that appeals to cultured and relatively uncultured alike as a good folk-song does – often and often on the other hand (but chiefly outside the operas) it sunk to mere vulgar catchiness. He laid the original foundations of his success on work that as a matter of fact he did extremely well; and it would have been incalculably better for the permanence of his reputation if he had realised this and set himself, with sincerity and self-criticism, to the task of becoming – as he might easily have become – a really great composer of musicianly light music. But anything like steadiness of artistic purpose was never one of his endowments, and without that, a composer, whatever his technical ability may be, is easily liable to degenerate into a mere popularity-hunting trifler.&lt;ref name="Hughes, p. 6"&gt;Hughes, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Fuller Maitland incorporated similar views in the second edition of ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', which he edited, while Walker's ''History'' was re-issued in 1923 and 1956 with his earlier verdict intact. As late as 1966, [[Frank Howes]], former music critic of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote:
{{quote|Outside the Savoy operas, little enough of Sullivan has survived... Yet a post-mortem is a valuable form of inquest, not only to ascertain the cause of death, but to discover why Sullivan's music as a whole had not in it the seeds of the revival that was on the verge of taking place. The lack of sustained effort, that is artistic effort proved by vigorous self-criticism, is responsible for the impression of weakness, the streaks of poor stuff among the better metal, and the consequent general ambiguity that is left by his music. His contemporaries deprecated his addiction to high life, the turf, and an outward lack of seriousness. Without adopting the simplified morality of the women's magazines, it is possible to urge that his contemporaries were really right, in that such addiction implied a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art.&lt;ref&gt;Howes, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

There were other writers who rose to praise Sullivan. For example, [[Thomas Dunhill]] wrote an entire chapter of his 1928 book, ''Sullivan's Comic Operas'', titled "Mainly in Defence", which reads in part:
{{quote|It should not be necessary to defend a writer who is so firmly established in popular esteem that his best works are more widely known and more keenly appreciated over a quarter of a century after his death than they were at any period during his lifetime....  But no critical appreciation of Sullivan can be attempted to-day which does not, from the first, adopt a defensive attitude, for his music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles. These attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius.&lt;ref&gt;Dunhill 1928, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[Henry Wood|Sir Henry Wood]] continued to perform Sullivan's serious music.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Henry Wood Jubilee Concert at Albert Hall", ''The Times'', 6 October 1938, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 Wood presented a Sullivan centenary concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]],&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; but it was not until the 1960s that Sullivan's music other than the Savoy operas began to be widely reassessed and revived.

In 1960 Hughes published the first full-length book about Sullivan's music and picked up the trail where Dunhill left off:
{{quote|Dunhill's achievement was that of a pioneer, a preliminary skirmish in a campaign whose advance has yet to be implemented. Today there may be few musicians for whom – as for Ernest Walker – Sullivan is merely 'the idle singer of an empty evening'; there are many who, while acknowledging his great gifts, tend to take them for granted.... The time is surely ripe for a comprehensive study of his music as a whole, which, while recognising that the operettas "form his chief title to fame" will not leave the rest out of account, and while taking note of his weaknesses (which are many) and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste (which were comparatively rare) will attempt to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship.&lt;ref name="Hughes, p. 6"/&gt;|}} 

In recent decades, Sullivan's work outside of the Savoy Operas has begun to be re-assessed. The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, founded in 1977, and books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young (1971) and Jacobs (1986) contributed to the re-evaluation of Sullivan's serious music.&lt;ref name=burton/&gt; Since the late 1960s most of Sullivan's major non-Savoy music has been professionally recorded.&lt;ref name=Sulldiscog&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/sullidx.htm "Discography of Sir Arthur Sullivan"], the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 10 July 2010, accessed 5 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Symphony in E'' had its first professional recording in 1968; his solo piano and chamber music in 1974; the cello concerto in 1986; ''Kenilworth'' in 1999; ''The Martyr of Antioch'' in 2000; ''The Golden Legend'' in 2001. In 1992 and 1993, Naxos released four discs featuring performances of Sullivan's ballet music and his incidental music to plays. Of his operas apart from Gilbert, ''Cox and Box'' (1961 and several later recordings), ''The Zoo'' (1978), ''The Rose of Persia'' (1999), and ''The Contrabandista'' (2004) have had professional recordings.&lt;ref name=Sulldiscog/&gt;

In recent decades, several publishers have issued scholarly critical editions of Sullivan's works, including [[Ernst Eulenburg (musical editions)|Ernst Eulenburg]] (''The Gondoliers''), Broude Brothers (''Trial by Jury'', ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''Iolanthe''), [[David Russell Hulme]] for [[Oxford University Press]] (''Ruddigore''), Robin Gordon-Powell at [http://www.amber-ring.co.uk/ The Amber Ring] (''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]'', the ''Marmion'' overture, the ''Imperial March'', ''[[The Contrabandista]]'', ''[[The Prodigal Son (Sullivan)|The Prodigal Son]]'', ''[[On Shore and Sea]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'' incidental music, ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' and ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''), and [https://archive.is/20121216110432/http://www.r.clyde.dial.pipex.com/ R. Clyde] (''Cox and Box'', ''Haddon Hall'', ''Overture "In Memoriam"'', ''Overture di Ballo'' and ''The Golden Legend'').&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

In 1957 a review in ''The Times'' explained Sullivan's contributions to "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas": "Gilbert's lyrics ... take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music.&amp;nbsp;... [Sullivan, too, is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody".&lt;ref&gt;"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan: Operas of an Artificial World", ''The Times'', 14 February 1957, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 article in ''The Musical Times'' by Nigel Burton noted the resurgence of Sullivan's reputation beyond the comic operas:
{{quote|We must assert that Sullivan has no need to be "earnest" (though he could be), for he spoke naturally to all people, for all time, of the passions, sorrows and joys which are forever rooted in the human consciousness. He believed, deeply, in the moral expressed at the close of [[Cherubini]]'s ''[[Les deux journées]]'': that the human being's prime duty in life is to serve humanity. It is his artistic consistency in this respect which obliges us to pronounce him our greatest Victorian composer. Time has now sufficiently dispersed the mists of criticism for us to be able to see the truth, to enjoy all his music, and to rejoice in the rich diversity of its panoply. Now, therefore, one hundred years after his death, let us resolve to set aside the "One-and-a-half-hurrahs" syndrome once and for all, and, in its place, raise THREE LOUD CHEERS.&lt;ref name=burton&gt;Burton, Nigel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2268">The '''darwin''' (d) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[evolution]]ary change, defined by [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B.S. Haldane]] (1949). "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2405451 Suggestions as to quantitative measurement of rates of evolution]." ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'' 3:51–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  One darwin is defined to be an [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]-fold (about 2.718) change in a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] over one million years.  Haldane named the unit after [[Charles Darwin]].

==Equation==
The equation for calculating evolutionary change in darwins (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) is:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{{\rm ln} X_2 - {\rm ln} X_1}{\Delta  t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; are the initial and final values of the trait and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is the change in time in millions of years.  An alternative form of this equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{{\rm ln} \frac{X_2}{X_1}}{\Delta  t}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the difference between two [[natural logarithm]]s is a [[dimension]]less [[ratio]], the trait may be measured in any [[Units of measurement|unit]].  Also for this reason the darwin is a specialist form of the inverse [[mega-annum]] (&lt;math&gt;Ma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Application==
The measure is most useful in [[palaeontology]], where [[macroevolutionary]] changes in the dimensions of [[fossil]]s can be compared.  Where this is used it is an indirect measure as it relies on [[phenotypic]] rather than [[genotypic]] data.  Several data points are required to overcome natural variation within a population.  The darwin only measures the evolution of a particular [[Trait (biology)|trait]] rather than a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]; different traits may evolve at different rates within a lineage.  The evolution of traits can however be used to infer as a [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] the evolution of lineages.

Genetic information cannot be obtained from fossils, but modern (post-Haldane) techniques on extant organisms now rely on genetic data (q.v. [[phylogenetics]]).

'''Demolition''' or '''razing''' is the tearing down of [[building]]s and other man-made [[structure]]s. Demolition contrasts with [[deconstruction (building)|deconstruction]], which involves taking a building apart while carefully preserving valuable elements for reuse purposes.

For small buildings, such as [[house]]s, that are only two or three stories high, demolition is a rather simple process. The building is pulled down either manually or mechanically using large hydraulic equipment: elevated work platforms, cranes, [[excavator]]s or [[bulldozer]]s. Larger buildings may require the use of a [[wrecking ball]], a heavy weight on a cable that is swung by a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] into the side of the buildings. Wrecking balls are especially effective against masonry, but are less easily controlled and often less efficient than other methods. Newer methods may use rotational hydraulic shears and silenced rock-breakers attached to excavators to cut or break through wood, steel, and concrete. The use of shears is especially common when flame cutting would be dangerous.

The tallest planned demolition of a building was the 47-story [[Singer Building]] in [[New York City]], which was built in 1908 and torn down in 1967–1968 to be replaced by [[One Liberty Plaza]].

Before any demolition activities can take place, there are many steps that must be carried out beforehand, including performing [[asbestos abatement]], removing hazardous or regulated materials, obtaining necessary permits, submitting necessary notifications, disconnecting utilities, rodent baiting and the development of site-specific safety and work plans.

The typical razing of a building is accomplished as follows:

Hydraulic excavators may be used to topple one- or two-story buildings by an undermining process. The strategy is to undermine the building while controlling the manner and direction in which it falls. The demolition project manager/supervisor will determine where undermining is necessary so that a building is pulled in the desired manner and direction. The walls are typically undermined at a building's base, but this is not always the case if the building design dictates otherwise. Safety and cleanup considerations are also taken into account in determining how the building is undermined and ultimately demolished.

In some cases a crane with a [[wrecking ball]] is used to demolish the structure down to a certain manageable height. At that point undermining takes place as described above. However crane mounted demolition balls are rarely used within demolition due to the uncontrollable nature of the swinging ball and the safety implications associated.

High reach demolition excavators are more often used for tall buildings where explosive demolition is not appropriate or possible.  Excavators with shear attachments are typically used to dismantle steel structural elements.  Hydraulic hammers are often used for concrete structures and concrete processing attachments are used to crush concrete to a manageable size, and to remove reinforcing steel.  For tall concrete buildings, where neither explosive or high reach demolition with an excavator is safe or practical, the "inside-out" method is used, whereby remotely operated mini-excavators demolish the building from the inside, whilst maintaining the outer walls of the building as a scaffolding, as each floor is demolished.

To control dust, fire hoses are used to maintain a wet demolition. Hoses may be held by workers, secured in fixed location, or attached to lifts to gain elevation.

Loaders or bulldozers may also be used to demolish a building. They are typically equipped with "rakes" (thick pieces of steel that could be an I-beam or tube) that are used to ram building walls. Skid loaders and loaders will also be used to take materials out and sort steel.

The technique of Vérinage is used in France to weaken and buckle the supports of central floors promoting the collapse of the top part of a building onto the bottom resulting in a rapid, symmetrical, collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2td63_hd20h20070822chunk2_news |title=HD_20h_20070822_chunk_2 - Vidéo Dailymotion |publisher=Dailymotion.com |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese company [[Kajima Construction]] has developed a new method of demolishing buildings which involves using computer-controlled [[hydraulic jack]]s to support the bottom floor as the supporting columns are removed. The floor is lowered and this process is repeated for each floor. This technique is safer and more environmentally friendly, and is useful in areas of high [[population density]].&lt;ref name=popsci-kajima&gt;{{cite news | title=Kajima Demolition Tech |url=http://www.popsci.com/bown/2008/product/kajima-demolition-tech | publisher=Popular Science | date=December 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To demolish bridges, [[Hoe ram|hoe rams]] are typically used to remove the concrete road deck and piers, while hydraulic shears are used to remove the bridge's [[structural steel]].

Large buildings, tall [[chimney]]s, [[smokestack]]s, bridges, and increasingly some smaller structures may be destroyed by building implosion using [[explosive]]s. Imploding a structure is very fast—the collapse itself only takes seconds—and an expert can ensure that the structure falls into its own footprint, so as not to damage neighboring structures. This is essential for tall structures in dense urban areas.

Any error can be disastrous, however, and some demolitions have failed, severely damaging neighboring structures. One significant danger is from flying debris, which, when improperly prepared for, can kill onlookers.

Another dangerous scenario is the partial failure of an attempted implosion. When a building fails to collapse completely the structure may be unstable, tilting at a dangerous angle, and filled with un-detonated but still primed explosives, making it difficult for workers to approach safely.

A third danger comes from air overpressure that occurs during the implosion. If the sky is clear, the [[shock wave]], a wave of energy and sound, travels upwards and disperses, but if cloud coverage is low, the shock wave can travel outwards, breaking windows or causing other damage to surrounding buildings.&lt;ref name=bnet&gt;{{cite news | title=Blasting a path to world markets |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n1-2_v118/ai_19118720/pg_3 | first=Curtice | last=Cultice | publisher=BNET Business Network | year=1997 | accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephanie Kegley of CST Environmental described shock waves by saying, "The shock wave is like a water hose. If you put your hand in front of the water as it comes out, it fans to all sides. When cloud coverage is below 1,200 feet, it reacts like the hand in front of the hose. The wave from the shock fans out instead of up toward the sky."&lt;ref name=Kegley&gt;{{cite news | first=Maura | last=Bohart | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | title=Demolition Eliminates Final Remnant of Charlotte Hornets |url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=9327 | date=26 September 2007 | accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controlled implosion, being spectacular, is the method that the general public often thinks of when discussing demolition; however, it can be dangerous and is only used as a last resort when other methods are impractical or too costly. The destruction of large buildings has become increasingly common as the massive [[housing project]]s of the 1960s and 1970s are being leveled around the world. At {{convert|439|ft|m}} and {{convert|2200000|sqft|m2}}, the [[J. L. Hudson Department Store and Addition]] is the tallest steel framed building and largest single structure ever [[Building implosion|imploded]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.controlled-demolition.com/default.asp?reqLocId=7&amp;reqItemId=20030225133807 |title=J.L. Hudson Department Store |publisher=Controlled Demolition, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparation ===
It takes several weeks or months to prepare a building for implosion. All items of value, such as copper wiring, are stripped from a building. Some materials must be removed, such as [[glass]] that can form deadly projectiles, and insulation that can scatter over a wide area. Non-load bearing partitions and [[drywall]] are removed.&lt;ref name = "Nova1"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] |title=Interview with Stacey Loizeaux |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/kaboom/loizeaux.html |work=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA Online]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |date=December 1996 |accessdate=2009-04-29 |quote=She learned the fine art of demolition from her father, Mark Loizeaux, and her uncle, Doug Loizeaux—president and vice-president of the company. NOVA spoke with Ms. Loizeaux a few days before Christmas, 1996.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected columns on floors where explosives will be set are drilled and [[high explosives]] such as [[nitroglycerin]], [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[RDX]], or C4 are placed in the holes. Smaller columns and walls are wrapped in [[detonating cord]]. The goal is to use as little explosive as possible so that the structure will fail in a [[progressive collapse]] therefore only a few floors are rigged with explosives, so that it is safer (fewer explosives) and costs less. The areas with explosives are covered in thick [[geotextile]] fabric and fencing to absorb flying debris.&lt;ref name="Nova1"/&gt; Far more time-consuming than the demolition itself is the clean-up of the site, as the debris is loaded into trucks and hauled away.

== Deconstruction ==
{{main|Deconstruction (building)}}
A new approach to demolition is the deconstruction of a building with the goal of minimizing the amount of materials going to [[landfill]]s. This "green" approach is applied by removing the materials by type material and segregating them for reuse or [[recycling]]. With proper planning this approach has resulted in landfill diversion rates that exceed 90% of an entire building and its contents in some cases. It also vastly reduces the [[carbon dioxide emissions|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]] of the removing of a building in comparison to demolition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition Taisei Corporation's Tecorep reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 85%]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of plant and equipment has allowed for the easier segregation of [[demolition waste]] types on site and the reuse within the construction of the replacement building. On site crushers allow the demolished concrete to be reused as type 1 crushed aggregate either as a piling mat for ground stabilization or as aggregate in the mixing of concrete.

Timber waste can be shredded using specialist timber shredders and composted, or used to form manufactured timber boards, such as [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] or [[Particle board|chipboard]].

Safety is paramount; a site safety officer is usually assigned to each project to enforce all safety rules and regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">A '''design code''' is a document that sets rules for the design of a new development in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a tool that can be used in the design and planning process, but goes further and is more regulatory than other forms of guidance commonly used in the English planning system over recent decades. It can be thought of as a process and document – and therefore a mechanism – which operationalises design guidelines or standards which have been established through a masterplan process. The masterplan or design framework is the vision. It should be accompanied by a [[design rationale]] that explains the objectives, with the design code providing instructions to the appropriate degree or precision of the more detailed design work.

In this way a design code may be a tool which helps ensure that the aspirations for quality and quantity for housing developments, particularly for large-scale projects, sought by the Government and other agencies are actually realised in the final schemes. It has the potential to deliver the consistency in quality exposed as lacking by [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment|CABE]]’s [[Housing Audit]] (2004).

Examples of developments where design codes are being used include:
*[[Poundbury]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]
*[[Fairford Leys]], [[Aylesbury]]
*[[Fairfield Park]], [[Letchworth]]
*[[Ashford Barracks]], [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]]
*[[Upton, Northamptonshire|Upton, Northampton]]

'''Duodenal cytochrome B''' ('''Dcytb''') has been identified as the reductase [[enzyme]] which [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the reduction of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the process of iron absorption in the [[duodenum]] of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Latunde-Dada GO, Van der Westhuizen J, Vulpe CD |title=Molecular and functional roles of duodenal cytochrome B (Dcytb) in iron metabolism |journal=Blood Cells Mol.

Furthermore, Dcytb has also been shown to exist in other tissues besides the apical region of the duodenum; and as such, it is believed to play a major role in [[iron metabolism]] in tissues.

Its scope covers scientific research and teaching [[epigraphy]]. It tryes to become more interested on the youngest and the general public.

It has been developed with funding from the Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad) and [[University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epigraphia3d.es/ |title=Epigraphia 3D - Inicio |website=Epigraphia3d.es |date= |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2013, [[Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología]] (FECYT) funded the project "Descifrando inscripciones romanas en 3D: Ciencia epigráfica virtual" (''Decrypting Roman inscriptions in 3D: virtual epigraphic Science''). This project was proposed as a multidisciplinary work where participate historians, linguists and engineers. Its objective was to provide "the first collection of Roman inscriptions in 3D, worldwide",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epigraphia.hypotheses.org/421 |title=Epigraphia 3D: proyecto de innovación científica en epigrafía &amp;#124; E-pigraphia |website=Epigraphia.hypotheses.org |date=1 December 2014|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the epigraphy more interesting to the youngest and facilitating its study.

The first phase comprised the collection 37 inscriptions from [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|Museo Arqueológico Nacional]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antigüedades Griegas y Romanas.|url=http://www.man.es/man/museo/el-museo-por-dentro/departamentos-investigacion/clasicas.html|website=Museo Arqueológico Nacional|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Natio''nal'' Archaeological Museum of Spain''), of different types (funerary, votive ...) and support (stone, metal, clay ...). It was made a bibliography card for each inscription, with its main data. In 2014 the project was funded again from the FECYT to model a selection of 59 inscriptions from the collection of the [[Museo Nacional de Arte Romano de Mérida]] (National Museum of Roman Art in Mérida).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La ULPGC obtiene un nuevo proyecto de innovación científica concedido por la FECYT para digitalizar inscripciones del Museo de Arte Romano de Mérida|url=https://www.ulpgc.es/noticia/ulpgc-obtiene-nuevo-proyecto-innovacion-cientifica-concedido-fecyt-digitalizar-inscripciones|accessdate=11 January 2016|work=ULPGC - Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|date=27 February 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This second phase of the project continues to be developed. Still it is not possible to visualise any of the inscriptions in the official website. However, it can be visualized  the inscriptions that already have been  modelling in the profile of [[Sketchfab]] of Epigraphia 3D.

==Project results==
[[File:Captura_Sketcfab_Epigraphia_3d.png|alt= Captura del perfil de Sketchfab de Epigraphia 3D|thumb|316x316px|Captura del perfil de Sketchfab de Epigraphia 3D]]
At the beginning of 2016, Epigraphia accumulated 97 3D models on Sketchfab,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sketchfab.com/epigraphia3d/ |title=epigraphia3d on |website=Sketchfab.com |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate = 10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of the publics and with its respective bibliography card.

The project has a website with information about the own project, galleries with the 3D models and a section with "Resources" created by the researchers with the objective of to introduce the Latin epigraphy to the general public. This divulgative section has:
* '''Introduction''': what is epigraphy, its history, specialized resources (journals and databases), about the epigraphic supports and how to study and edit an inscription.
* '''Language and Literature: '''an introduction to [[Latin]], their cases and declensions, transcription of names, verb forms and structure for each type of inscriptions.
* '''Latin script''': on the Latin alphabet and types of writing ([[Roman square capitals]] and [[Roman cursive|cursive]]).
* '''Roman family''': introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of the [[Roman family]], marriage and a series of activities.
* '''Roman religion''': introduction to [[Roman temple]], its gods, priests, rites and imperial cult started in the time of [[Augustus]].
* '''Funerary world''': about death and life in the Roman afterlife, and their rites and funerary inscriptions.
Besides, it has an interactive map in which they have marked the origin of each one of the 37 pertaining registrations to the collection.

[[Image:Ladderfuels.png|thumb|right|380 px|Illustration from U.S. government publication, Introduction to Wildland Fire Behavior (S-190), showing the fuel ladder]]

A '''fuel ladder''' is a [[firefighting]] term for live or dead [[vegetation]] that allows a [[fire]] to climb up from the [[landscape]] or [[forest floor]] into the tree [[canopy (forest)|canopy]]. Common fuel ladders include tall [[grass]]es, [[shrub]]s, and [[tree]] [[branch]]es, both living and dead. It is also part of [[Defensible space (fire control)|Defensible Space]] 'Firescaping' practices.

==Fire precautions==
Potential fuel ladders should be removed to reduce the risk of fire bridging the gap to the canopy. To remove the ladder requires pruning any low limbs up to a minimum of 8 feet, and potentially as high as 15 feet. The required height depends on how low the branch tips hang, the steepness of slope, and the height and spacing of other nearby vegetation. 

The desired result is to create a situation in which a low-burning fire could burn to the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a tree, which is protected by its [[Bark (botany)|bark]], without having thinner, more flammable branches, [[leaf|leaves]] or [[Pine needle|needles]] within easy reach of the fire.

==Other fuel ladders==
Apart from tree limbs, anything that would help that fire move up into the tree canopy is a fuel ladder. This includes shrubs and even tall grass or weeds. Non-vegetation fuel sources such as woodpiles, wooden fenceposts and structures should also be considered. 

The intent is to maintain a break in vertical and horizontal continuity so that, if for example a woodpile caught fire, it would not be positioned next to ''[[manzanita]]'' [[shrubs]] or directly under trees that could then easily catch fire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16471">A '''fusion gene''' is a hybrid gene formed from two previously separate genes. It can occur as a result of: [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]], [[Deletion (genetics)|interstitial deletion]], or [[chromosomal inversion]].

[[File:Gene Fusion Types.png|thumb|A schematic showing the ways a fusion gene can occur at a chromosomal level.]]

==History==
The first fusion gene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |first2=B |first3=F}}&lt;/ref&gt; was described in cancer cells in the early 1980s. The finding was based on the discovery in 1960 by Peter Nowell and David Hungerford in Philadelphia of a small abnormal marker [[chromosome]] in patients with [[chronic myeloid leukemia]]—the first consistent chromosome abnormality detected in a human malignancy, later designated the [[Philadelphia chromosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=PC |last1=Nowell |first2=DA |last2=Hungerford |year=1960 |title=A minute chromosome in chronic granulocytic leukemia |journal=Science | doi = 10.1126/science.132.3438.1488 |pmid=17739576 | volume=132 | issue=3438 | pages=1488–1501 [1497] | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1985/A1985ABM0800002.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode=  1960Sci...132.1488.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[Janet Rowley]] in Chicago showed that the Philadelphia chromosome had originated through a translocation between chromosomes [[Chromosome 9 (human)|9]] and [[chromosome 22 (human)|22]], and not through a simple deletion of chromosome 22 as was previously thought. Several investigators in the early 1980s showed that the Philadelphia [[chromosome translocation]] led to the formation of a new BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, composed of the 3' part of the ABL1 gene in the breakpoint on chromosome 9 and the 5' part of a gene called BCR in the breakpoint in chromosome 22. In 1985 it was clearly established that the fusion gene on chromosome 22 produced an abnormal [[Fusion protein|chimeric]] BCR/ABL1 protein with the capacity to induce chronic myeloid leukemia.

At present, scientists have identified 21,404 gene fusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mitelman F|author2=Johansson B|author3=Mertens F|title=Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer|url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These genes have been found in practically all main subtypes of human neoplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews.

==Oncogenes==
It has been known for 30 years that the corresponding gene fusion plays an important role in tumorgenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Edwards  |year=2009 |title= Fusion genes and chromosome translocations in the common epithelial cancers |journal= Journal of Pathology | doi =10.1002/path.2632 |pmid=19921709  | volume=220  |issue=2  | pages=244–254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fusion genes can contribute to tumor formation because fusion genes can produce much more active abnormal protein than non-fusion genes. Often, fusion genes are [[oncogene]]s that cause [[cancer]]; these include [[Philadelphia chromosome|BCR-ABL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=PC |last1=Nowell |first2=DA |last2=Hungerford |year=1960 |title=A minute chromosome in chronic granulocytic leukemia |journal=Science | doi = 10.1126/science.132.3438.1488 |pmid=17739576 | volume=132 | issue=3438 | pages=1488–1501 [1497] | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1985/A1985ABM0800002.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode=  1960Sci...132.1488.}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEL-AML1 ([[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia|ALL]] with t(12 ; 21)), AML1-ETO ([[M2 AML]] with t(8 ; 21)), and [[TMPRSS2]]-[[ERG (gene)|ERG]] with an interstitial deletion on [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome&amp;nbsp;21]], often occurring in prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16254181 |year=2005 |last1=Tomlins |first1=SA |last2=Rhodes |last3=Perner |last4=Dhanasekaran |last5=Mehra |last6=Sun |last7=Varambally |last8=Cao |last9=Tchinda |title=Recurrent fusion of TMPRSS2 and ETS transcription factor genes in prostate cancer |volume=310 |issue=5748 |pages=644–8 |doi=10.1126/science.1117679 |journal=Science |first2=DR |first3=S |first4=SM |first5=R |first6=XW |first7=S |first8=X |first9=J|last10=Kuefer |first10=R |last11=Lee |first11=C |last12=Montie |first12=J.

In the case of TMPRSS2-ERG, by disrupting androgen receptor (AR) signaling and inhibiting AR expression by oncogenic ETS transcription factor, the fusion product regulates the prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Jindan |last1= Yu | first2=Jianjun |last2= Yu|year=2010|title= An Integrated Network of Androgen Receptor, Polycomb, and TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer Progression Cancer Cell |journal= Cancer Cell| doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.03.018 | volume=17 | issue=5| pages=443–454| pmid=20478527 | pmc=2874722}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most fusion genes are found from [[Hematological malignancy|hematological cancer]]s, [[sarcoma]]s, and [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews.

[[BCAM-AKT2]] is a fusion gene that is specific and unique to high-grade [[serous ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/deciphering-the-cancer-transcriptome/5729/ Deciphering the Cancer Transcriptome. 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oncogenic fusion genes may lead to a gene product with a new or different function from the two fusion partners. Alternatively, a proto-oncogene is fused to a strong [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]], and thereby the oncogenic function is set to function by an [[Downregulation and upregulation|upregulation]] caused by the strong promoter of the upstream fusion partner. The latter is common in [[lymphoma]]s, where oncogenes are juxtaposed to the promoters of the [[immunoglobulin]] genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12946230 |year=2003 |last1=Vega |first1=F |last2=Medeiros |title=Chromosomal translocations involved in non-Hodgkin lymphomas |volume=127 |issue=9 |pages=1148–60 |journal=Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine |first2=LJ |doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2003)127&lt;1148:CTIINL&gt;2.0.CO;2|doi-broken-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oncogenic [[fusion transcript]]s may also be caused by [[trans-splicing]] or [[Conjoined gene|read-through]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21261984 |year=2011 |last1=Nacu |first1=S |last2=Yuan |last3=Kan |last4=Bhatt |last5=Rivers |last6=Stinson |last7=Peters |last8=Modrusan |last9=Jung |title=Deep RNA sequencing analysis of readthrough gene fusions in human prostate adenocarcinoma and reference samples |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=11 |journal=BMC Med.

Since chromosomal translocations play such a significant role in neoplasia, a specialized database of chromosomal aberrations and gene fusions in cancer has been created.  This database is called Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mitelman F|author2=Johansson B|author3=Mertens F|title=Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer|url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostics==
Presence of certain chromosomal aberrations and their resulting fusion genes is commonly used within cancer diagnostics in order to set a precise diagnosis. Chromosome [[Cytogenetics|banding analysis]], [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|fluorescence ''in situ'' hybridization]] (FISH), and [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR) are common methods employed at diagnostic laboratories. These methods all have their distinct shortcomings due to the very complex nature of cancer [[genome]]s. Recent developments such as [[DNA sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19136943 |year=2009 |last1=Maher |first1=CA |last2=Kumar-Sinha |last3=Cao |last4=Kalyana-Sundaram |last5=Han |last6=Jing |last7=Sam |last8=Barrette |last9=Palanisamy |title=Transcriptome Sequencing to Detect Gene Fusions in Cancer |volume=458 |issue=7234 |pages=97–101 |doi=10.1038/nature07638 |journal=Nature |first2=C |first3=X |first4=S |first5=B |first6=X |first7=L |first8=T |first9=N |last10=Chinnaiyan |first10=Arul M. |pmc=2725402|display-authors=8 |bibcode=2009Natur.458...97M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and custom [[DNA microarray]]s bear promise of introduction of more efficient methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19152679 |year=2009 |last1=Skotheim |first1=RI |last2=Thomassen |last3=Eken |last4=Lind |last5=Micci |last6=Ribeiro |last7=Cerveira |last8=Teixeira |last9=Heim |title=A universal assay for detection of oncogenic fusion transcripts by oligo microarray analysis |volume=8 |pages=5 |doi=10.1186/1476-4598-8-5 |journal=Molecular Cancer |first2=GO |first3=M |first4=GE |first5=F |first6=FR |first7=N |first8=MR |first9=S |last10=Rognes |first10=Torbjørn |last11=Lothe |first11=Ragnhild A |pmc=2633275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Gene fusion plays a key role in the evolution of gene architecture. We can observe its effect if gene fusion occurs in coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Pascal |last1= Durrens  | first2= Macha |last3= Sherman  |first3= David  |last2= Nikolski |year=2008|title= Fusion and Fission of Genes Define a Metric between Fungal Genomes |journal= PLoS Comput Biol| volume=4 | issue=10| pages=443–454|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000200|pmid= 18949021  |pmc= 2557144  |bibcode= 2008PLSCB...4E0200D  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duplication, sequence divergence, and recombination are the major contributors at work in gene evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Eichler |last1= EE |year=2001|title= Recent duplication, domain accretion and the dynamic mutation of the human genome |journal= Trends in Genetics |volume=17| issue=11| pages=661–669|doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(01)02492-1 |pmid= 11672867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events can probably produce new genes from already existing parts. When gene fusion happens in non-coding sequence region, it can lead to the misregulation of the expression of a gene now under the control of the [[cis-regulatory element|cis-regulatory]] sequence of another gene. If it happens in coding sequences, gene fusion cause the assembly of a new gene, then it allows the appearance of new functions by adding peptide modules into multi domain protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Pascal |last1= Durrens  | first2= Macha |last3= Sherman  |first3= David  |last2= Nikolski |year=2008|title= Fusion and Fission of Genes Define a Metric between Fungal Genomes |journal= PLoS Comput Biol| volume=4 | issue=10| pages=443–454|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000200|pmid= 18949021  |pmc= 2557144  |bibcode= 2008PLSCB...4E0200D  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The detecting methods to inventory gene fusion events on a large biological scale can provide insights about the multi modular architecture of proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Enright |last1= AJ | first2= Ouzounis |last2= CA |year=2001|title= Functional associations of proteins in entire genomes by means of exhaustive detection of gene fusions |journal= Genome Biology | volume=2| issue=9| pages=341–347|pmid=11820254|doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-9-research0034 | pmc=65099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Yanai |last1= I | first2= DeLisi |last3= Delisi |first3= C. |last2= C |year=2001|title= Genes linked by fusion events are generally of the same functional category: a systematic analysis of 30 microbial genomes |journal= Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume=98|issue= 14 | pages= 7940–7945 |pmc=35447 | pmid=11438739 | doi=10.1073/pnas.141236298|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.7940Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Pasek |last1= S| first2= Risler |last3= Delisi|first3= Charles|last2= JL | year=2006|title=  Gene fusion/fission is a major contributor to evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins|journal= Bioinformatics | volume=22|issue= 14| pages= 1418–1423 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl135 | pmid=16601004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
In recent years, next generation sequencing technology has already become available to screen known and novel gene fusion events on a genome wide scale. However, the precondition for large scale detection is a paired-end sequencing of the cell's [[transcriptome]]. The direction of fusion gene detection is mainly towards data analysis and visualization. Some researchers already developed a new tool called Transcriptome Viewer (TViewer) to directly visualize detected gene fusions on the transcript level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Jochen |last1= Supper | first2=Claudia |last2= Gugenmus |year=2013 |title= Detecting and visualizing gene fusions. Methods |journal= Methods| doi =10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.09.013 |pmid= 23036331 | volume=59 | issue=1| pages=24–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==
Biologists may also deliberately create fusion genes for research purposes. The fusion of [[reporter gene]]s to the regulatory elements of genes of interest allows researches to study gene expression. Reporter gene fusions can be used to measure activity levels of gene regulators, identify the regulatory sites of genes (including the signals required), identify various genes that are regulated in response to the same stimulus, and artificially control the expression of desired genes in particular cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.]|first1=Leland H. Hartwell ... [et|title=Genetics : from genes to genomes|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0073525266|pages=533–534|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by creating a fusion gene of a protein of interest and [[green fluorescent protein]], the protein of interest may be observed in [[cell (biology)|cells]] or [[biological tissue|tissue]] using fluorescence [[microscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=28749 |year=1978 |last1=Prendergast |first1=FG |last2=Mann |title=Chemical and physical properties of aequorin and the green fluorescent protein isolated from Aequorea forskålea |volume=17 |issue=17 |pages=3448–53 |journal=Biochemistry |doi=10.1021/bi00610a004 |first2=KG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein synthesized when a fusion gene is [[gene expression|expressed]] is called a ''[[fusion protein]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7301">[[musical notation|Notation]] plays a relatively minor role in the oral traditions of [[Indonesia]]n [[gamelan]] but, in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], several systems of '''gamelan notation''' were devised beginning at the end of the 19th century, initially for archival purposes.

==Kepatihan==
[[Image:Kepatihan gamelan notation slendro.png|thumb|right|75px|A short melody in slendro notated using Kepatihan notation.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"&gt;Lindsay, Jennifer (1992). ''Javanese Gamelan'', p.43-45. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-588582-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Kepatihan''' is a type of cipher [[musical notation]] that was devised for notation of the [[Indonesia]]n [[gamelan]].

===History===

The system was devised around 1900  at the ''Kepatihan'' (the Grand Vizier's compound) in Surakarta, and was based upon the Galin-Paris-Chevé system, imported in the nineteenth century by Christian missionaries to allow the notation of hymns.&lt;ref&gt;''Gamelan: Cultural Interaction and Musical Development in Central Java'' (1995) by [[Sumarsam]], {{ISBN|0-226-78010-4}} (cloth) 0226780112 (paper)&lt;/ref&gt; It superseded several other notation systems of Javanese origin devised around the same time.

To this day, the value of notation is disputed. As the kepatihan cipher system records primarily the skeletal melody line (or balungan), the wide range of improvisational techniques performed upon this line by the various instruments in gamelan are not represented. Whether they should be represented has been a matter of discussion in modern Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1513116 "Komposisi Baru": On Contemporary Composition in Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notation===

The pitches of the seven-tone [[pélog]] [[musical tuning|tuning]] system are designated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; while the five-tone [[slendro]] pitches are notated as 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. The [[octave]]s are noted by dots above and below the numbers, as in [[Music of China|Chinese]] [[jianpu]], although of course the pitches do not correspond. A dot over a note indicates the octave above, and a dot below a note represents the octave below. Two dots over a note indicate a note two octaves higher than standard, and so on.

Depending on the tuning of the individual gamelan, it is often possible to hear the pitches 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of slendro as an anhemitonic pentatonic scale,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Javanese-Gamelan-Pocketbooks-Musicology/dp/3795902819 Mantle Hood, The Evolution of the Javanese Gamelan, Book II]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solfège|do-re-mi-sol-la]]. However, in the pélog system pitches are simply numbered from low to high 1&amp;ndash;7 and there is no question of interpreting these sounds [[diatonic scale|diatonically]]. As the pélog [[scale (music)|scale]] is essentially a five-note scale, the notes 4 and 7 function similarly to '[[accidental (music)|accidentals]]' in Western terms: a 4 may serve as a 'sharp' or raised 3 (common in [[pathet|patet lima or nem]]) or as a 'flat' or lowered 5 (usual in patet barang). Similarly 7 functions as a 'flat' 1 in patet lima or nem; 1 in patet barang may function as a 'sharp' 7, but is more often interpreted as a temporary change of pathet. 

By default, ''kepatihan'' notes are assumed all to have the same [[duration (music)|duration]]. Deviations from these regular [[rhythm]]s are noted in two ways. [[Beam (music)|Beams]] or lines (overscores) above notes indicate half the standard duration (although this is an area of notation that is often inaccurate in practice). A dot (''pin'') in the place of a note indicates the continuation of the previous note, not a rest. In vocal parts the figure 0 represents a rest, but rests are not written in instrumental parts, because the instruments normally play continuously and any rests are part of the basic playing style of the instrument. Additional symbols are needed for some instruments; for example, [[melisma]]s and slurred bowing are noted by lines above or underneath the numbers. Strokes on [[colotomy|colotomic]] instruments are indicated by diacritical marks over or around the ''kepatihan'' numbers. There are numerous sets of such marks in use; for example, one set (not an agreed standard) uses a circle for [[gong ageng]], parentheses for [[gong suwukan]], ^ for [[kenong]], ˇ for [[kempul]], + for [[ketuk]], and &amp;ndash; for [[kempyang]]. All or some of these marks may be omitted, as they can usually be determined from the form ([[bentuk]]).

Ordinarily the system only notates the [[balungan]] (the core melody as it is played by the [[saron (instrument)|saron]]s) and [[gerongan]] (choral parts). However, for pedagogical purposes, other patterns, such as the [[melodic formula]]s [[sekaran]] and [[cengkok]] used on the [[panerusan]] instruments may be notated.

==Other systems==
The description above applies to central Javanese music. In the Sundanese music of West Java, the system works in reverse, with 1 representing the highest note instead of the lowest; also a dot over a note indicates the octave below, and a dot below a note represents the octave above.

[[Image:Surakarta gamelan notation slendro.png|thumb|The same notated using the Surakarta method.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt;]]

===Surakarta===

[[Image:Western gamelan notation slendro.png|thumb|The same approximated using Western notation.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; {{audio|Western gamelan notation slendro.mid|Play}}]]

The [[Surakarta|Solo]]nese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the [[Sindhen|pesinden]] with a squiggle on a horizontal staff.

===Yogyakarta===
[[Image:Yogyakarta gamelan notation slendro.png|thumb|100px|The same notated using the Yogyakarta method or 'chequered notation'.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt;]]

In Yogyakarta a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the balungan by dots and also included important drum strokes.

==Western==
''Kepatihan'' is widely used in [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] studies of the gamelan, sometimes accompanied by transcriptions into Western [[staff notation]] with approximate mapping of [[slendro]] and [[pelog]] [[Musical tuning|tuning]] systems of gamelan onto the western staff, with and without various symbols for [[microtonal music|microtones]]. The relative merits of ''kepatihan'' and staff notation are sometimes debated, but staff notation is essentially incompatible with the 'end-weighted' nature of melodic structures in Indonesian music. In this respect, ''kepatihan'' is more suitable, although the usage of overscores (taken from the Galin-Paris-Chevé system) continues to cause practical difficulties.

The '''Gas Council Engineering Research Station''' was a former engineering [[research institute]] on Tyneside, situated in a distinctively-shaped and listed building, now occupied by the [[North Tyneside|Metropolitan Borough of North Tyneside]]. 

==History==
===Design===
It was designed by Ryder &amp; Yates in 1965, who also designed the [[Television Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Ryder and Yates had formed in 1953 in Newcastle. It was built under the former [[Northumberland County Council]]. The Northern Gas Board had its main headquarters in Killingworth. It was first announced in November 1965. It was built in anticipation of North Sea gas. Killingworth was a north-east new town, known as Killingworth Township. It was planned to open in the summer of 1968. It was built on the site of [[Killingworth Colliery]]. The modernist architecture is developed from [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Berthold Lubetkin]]. 

===Construction===
It was built from 1966-67 on a 10-acre site. An extension was added from 1975-76 to contain a restaurant. 

It was Grade II listed on 27 January 1997 by [[English Heritage]] ([[Historic England]] since 2015).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1259313 Listing at Historic England]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
It is situated&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1831584 Geograph]&lt;/ref&gt; directly between the B1505 to east and the [[East Coast Main Line]] (ECML) to the west, in the west of Killingworth. Nearby to the south was the former distinctively-designed headquarters, Norgas House, of the [[Northern Gas Board]], also designed by Ryder &amp; Yates, until North Tyneside agreed its demolition in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/norgas-house-killingworth-set-demolished-1372524 Norgas House demolition 2012 Evening Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Block A housed the Engineering Research Station and Block B housed the School of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://northtyneside-consult.limehouse.co.uk/portal/lp_draft_15?pointId=1392895878394 North Tyneside Enhancing the Built Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
It housed the main research function of British Gas, where the [[National Transmission System]] (NTS) was designed. The research centre's first function was to design the pipeline system around the UK. It researched [[metallurgy]] and pipelines, and avoiding any cracks in the UK's pipelines.

British Gas left the site in 1995 and North Tyneside Council moved in. In 2008, North Tyneside moved most of its functions to Cobalt Park on the [[A19 road|A19]].

The '''''Geschiedenis der Vaderlandsche Schilderkunst''''', often called ''Van Eynden and Van der Willigen'', is a 19th-century dictionary of artist biographies from the [[Netherlands]] published 1816-1842.

The reference work was started by [[Roeland van Eynden]], a painter and writer from the Northern Netherlands, as a follow-up to the work published by [[Arnold Houbraken]] and [[Jan van Gool]].&lt;ref name=Huygens&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/retroboeken/vaderlandsche_schilderkunst/ ''Geschiedenis der Vaderlandsche Schilderkunst''] on the Huygens website&lt;/ref&gt; The work was published first in two volumes listing painters active before 1800. The third volume was published with contemporary painters, and it was finished after Van Eynden's death by publishing a 4th volume with corrections and additions which was written by his friend and colleague, [[Adriaan van der Willigen]], a Dutch writer known for his travelogues.&lt;ref name=Huygens/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2115">'''Heterotrophic nutrition''' is the mode of nutrition in which organisms depend upon other organisms to survive. 
All animals and non green plants are heterotrophic.

Heterotrophic organisms have to acquire and take in all the organic substances they need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/22/m022p101.pdf Heterotrophic nutrition and control of bacterial density]&lt;/ref&gt;

All heterotrophs (except blood and gut [[parasite]]s) have to convert solid food into soluble compounds capable of being absorbed (digestion).Then the soluble products of digestion for the organism are being broken down for the release of energy (respiration). All heterotrophs depend on [[Autotroph|autotrophs]] for their nutrition. Heterotrophic plants have only four types.

The four main types of heterotrophic nutrition are: 
#[[Holozoic nutrition]]: the word holozoic is made from two words- holo= whole and zoikos= animals and literally means animals which eat their food whole. Complex food is taken into a specialist digestive system and broken down into small pieces to be absorbed. This consists of 5 stages, [[ingestion]], [[digestion]], [[Absorption (small intestine)|absorption]], [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] and [[egestion]]. E.g.: human 
#[[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprobiontic]]/[[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytic]] nutrition: Organisms feed on dead organic remains of other organisms. E.g.: decomposers
#[[Parasitism|Parasitic nutrition]]: Organisms obtain food from other living organisms (the host), with the host receiving no benefit from the parasite.When a parasite is present inside the body of the host, it is known as an endoparasite. These parasites suck and feed on the blood of the host.  E.g.: tapeworms
#[[Symbiosis|Symbiotic nutrition]]:Two organisms live in close association to benefit each other or one of the two benefits the other whilst it itself suffers neither loss but nor does it gain.  E.g.: fungi and algae, rizobium and leguminous plants roots.

{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

An '''incest taboo ''' is any [[Convention (norm)|cultural rule]] or [[Norm (social)|norm]] that prohibits [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]] between closely related persons. [[Cultural universal|All human cultures]] have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible [[Sexual partner|sexual]] or [[marriage]] partners, making such relationships [[taboo]]. However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not. The sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called [[Incest|incestuous relationship]]s.

Some cultures proscribed sexual relations between [[clan]]-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. In many cultures, certain types of cousin relations are preferred as sexual and marital partners, whereas in others these are taboo. Some cultures permit sexual and marital relations between aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces. In some instances, brother–sister marriages have been practiced by the elites with some regularity. Parent–child and sibling–sibling unions are almost universally taboo.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tapestry of Culture An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology'', Ninth Edition, Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press. {{ISBN|9780759111394}}. p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source of the taboo==
Debate about the origin of the incest taboo has often been framed as a question of whether it is based in [[nature or nurture]].

One explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since [[inbreeding]] may have detrimental outcomes. The most widely held hypothesis proposes that the so-called [[Westermarck effect]] discourages adults from engaging in sexual relations with individuals with whom they grew up. The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005&gt;''Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century'', Arthur P. Wolf and William H. Durham (Editors),  Stanford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0804751414}}. Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

Another school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group [[exogamy]], which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable [[Alliance theory|alliances]] that improve the ability for both groups to thrive. According to this view, the incest taboo is not necessarily universal, but is likely to arise and become more strict under cultural circumstances that favour exogamy over [[endogamy]], and likely to become more lax under circumstances that favor endogamy. This hypothesis has also achieved some empirical support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Limits to biological evolution of taboo===
While it is theoretically possible that [[natural selection]] may, under certain [[genetics|genetic]] circumstances, select for individuals that [[instinct]]ively avoid mating with (close) relatives, biological evolution cannot select for punishing others for incest, since even genetically weakened, [[inbreeding|inbred]] individuals are better watchposts against [[predator]]s than none at all, and weak individuals are useful for the stronger individuals in the group as looking out for predators without being able to seriously compete with the stronger individuals.&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, New York, Knopf, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design, Richard Dawkins, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Punishing both parties in an incestous relation cannot even be beneficial for the genes of individuals punishing a somewhat more distant relative for mating with a closer relative, since punishing the closer relative as well is counterproductive to any function of protecting the closer relative and the health of its offspring (in a context where predation and [[starvation]] are significant factors, as opposed to a rich [[welfare state]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gorrell J.C., McAdam A.G., Coltman D.W., Humphries M.M., Boutin S., Jamieson C.; McAdam, Andrew G.; Coltman, David W.; Humphries, Murray M.; Boutin, Stan (June 2010). "Adopting kin enhances inclusive fitness in asocial red squirrels". Nature Communications 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Sewall (1922). "Coefficients of inbreeding and relationship". American Naturalist 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic sexual attraction]] theory is also incompatible with the theory of [[Odor|smell]] being a significant factor in avoiding inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;Smelling Away: How the sense the smell can influence our behavior, Lorena Vernaz Asadi, Park university&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on the taboo==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

Modern [[anthropology]] developed at a time when a great many human societies were illiterate, and much of the research on incest taboos has taken place in societies without legal codes, and, therefore, without written laws concerning marriage and incest. Nevertheless, anthropologists have found that the institution of marriage, and rules concerning appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, exist in every society.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 253&lt;/ref&gt; The following excerpt from ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'' (1951), a well-established field manual for [[ethnographic]] research, illustrates the scope of ethnographic investigation into the matter:

{{quote|''Incest is sexual intercourse between individuals related in certain prohibited degrees of [[kinship]].'' In every society there are rules prohibiting incestuous unions, both as to sexual intercourse and recognized marriage. The two prohibitions do not necessarily coincide. There is no uniformity as to which degrees are involved in the prohibitions. The rules regulating incest must be investigated in every society by means of the [[Genealogical Method]]. The prohibition may be so narrow as to include only one type of parent–child relationship (though this is very rare), or those within the elementary family; or so wide as to include all with whom genealogical or classificatory kinship can be traced. The more usual practice is that unions with certain relatives only are considered incestuous, the relationships being regulated by the type of descent emphasized. In some societies unions with certain persons related by [[affinity (law)|affinity]] are also considered incestuous.

What penalties fall on (a) the individuals concerned; (b) the community as a whole? Are such penalties enforced by authority, or are they believed to ensure automatically by all action of supernatural force?  Is there any correlation between the severity of the penalty and the nearness of the blood-tie of the partners in guilt? Should children be born as the result of incestuous unions, how are they treated? Are there any methods, ritual or legal, by which persons who fall within the prohibited degrees and wish to marry can break the relationship and become free to marry?&lt;ref&gt;A Committee of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 1951. ''Notes and Queries on Anthropology'', 6th edition. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, Ltd. p. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As this excerpt suggests, anthropologists distinguish between social norms and actual social behavior; much social theory explores the difference and relationship between the two. For example, what is the purpose of prohibitions that are routinely violated (as for example when people claim that incest is taboo yet engage in incestuous behavior)?

It should be further noted that in these theories anthropologists are generally concerned solely with brother–sister incest, and are not claiming that all sexual relations among family members are taboo or even necessarily considered incestuous by that society. These theories are further complicated by the fact that in many societies people related to one another in different ways, and sometimes distantly, are classified together as siblings, and others who are just as closely related genetically are not considered family members.

Moreover, the definition restricts itself to sexual intercourse; this does not mean that other forms of sexual contact do not occur, or are proscribed, or prescribed. For example, in some Inuit societies in the Arctic, and traditionally in [[Bali]], mothers would routinely stroke the penises of their infant sons; such behavior was considered no more sexual than breast-feeding.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Jean Louise ''Never in anger: portrait of an Eskimo family'' 1970 Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bateson, ''Steps to an ecology of mind: collected essays in anthropology, psychiatry, evolution, and epistemology'' preface by Mark Engel 1972 Chandler, San Francisco 112–115&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that, in these theories, anthropologists are primarily concerned with marriage rules and not actual sexual behavior. In short, anthropologists were not studying "incest" per se; they were asking informants what they meant by "incest", and what the consequences of "incest" were, in order to map out social relationships within the community.

This excerpt also suggests that the relationship between sexual and marriage practices is complex, and that societies distinguish between different sorts of prohibitions. In other words, although an individual may be prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with many people, different sexual relations may be prohibited for different reasons, and with different penalties.

For example, [[Trobriand Islanders]] prohibit both sexual relations between a woman and her brother,&lt;ref&gt;Bronislow Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 389, 392&lt;/ref&gt; and between a woman and her father,&lt;ref name=Malinowski29&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 384&lt;/ref&gt; but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations between a woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations among members of the same clan; relations between a woman and her father do not.&lt;ref name=Malinowski29/&gt; This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations between a man and his mother's sister (and mother's sister's daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations between a man and his father's sister are not.&lt;ref&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 450–451&lt;/ref&gt;  A man and his father's sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father's sister or the daughter of his father's sister to have sexual relations or marry.&lt;ref&gt;Bronislaw Malinowski 1929 ''The Sexual Life of Savages in North-West Melanesia: An Ethnographic Account of Courtship, Marriage and Family Life Among the Natives of the Trobriand Highlands, British New Guinea'' Boston: Beacon Press 449–450&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instinctual and genetic explanations===
{{technical|section|date=August 2015}}
An explanation for the taboo is that it is due to an instinctual, inborn aversion that would lower the adverse [[Heredity|genetic effects]] of [[inbreeding]] such as a higher incidence of congenital [[birth defect]]s (see article [[Inbreeding depression]]). Since the rise of modern genetics, belief in this theory has grown.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Richard 1977 "Natural Selection and the Analyusis of Human Sociology" in ''The Changing Scenes in the Natural Sciences, 1776–1976'' pp. 283–337 Academy of Natural Science Special Publication 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bittles | display-authors = etal  | year = 1991 | title = Reproductive Behavior and Health in Consangueneous Marriages | url = | journal = Science | volume = 2 | issue = 52| pages = 789–794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/ng1094-117"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bittles | first1 = A.

The increase in frequency of birth defects often attributed to inbreeding results directly from an increase in the frequency of homozygous alleles inherited by the offspring of inbred couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = Frank B | year = 1969 | title = Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 45–62 | doi=10.1086/201009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to an increase in homozygous allele frequency within a population, and results in diverging effects. Should a child inherit the version of homozygous alleles responsible for a birth defect from its parents, the birth defect will be expressed; on the other hand, should the child inherit the version of homozygous alleles not responsible for a birth defect, it would actually decrease the ratio of the allele version responsible for the birth defect in that population. The overall consequences of these diverging effects depends in part on the size of the population. In small populations, as long as children born with inheritable birth defects die (or are killed) before they reproduce, the ultimate effect of inbreeding will be to ''decrease'' the frequency of defective genes in the population; over time, the gene pool will be healthier. However, in larger populations, it is more likely that large numbers of carriers will survive and mate, leading to more constant rates of birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, Nancy, ed. 1993 ''The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding''. Chicago: UNiversity of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Besides recessive genes, there are also other reasons why inbreeding may be harmful, such as a narrow range of certain [[immune system]]s genes in a population increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases (see [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]). The biological costs of incest also depend largely on the degree of genetic proximity between the two relatives engaging in incest. This fact may explain why the cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions against sex between close relatives but less often includes prohibitions against sex between more distal relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antfolk|first1=Jan|last2=Lieberman|first2=Debra|last3=Santtila|first3=Pekka|title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2012|volume=7|issue=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613|pages=e50613|pmid=23209792|pmc=3509093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children born of close relatives have decreased survival.&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/ng1094-117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moral"/&gt; Many mammal species, including humanity's closest [[primate]] relatives, avoid incest.&lt;ref name="WolfDurham2005"/&gt;

The [[Westermarck effect]], first proposed by [[Edvard Westermarck]] in 1891, is the theory that children reared together, regardless of biological relationship, form a sentimental attachment that is by its nature non-erotic.&lt;ref&gt;Westermarck, Edvard A. (1921). ''The history of human marriage'', 5th edn. London: Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melford Spiro]] argued that his observations that unrelated children reared together on Israeli Kibbutzim nevertheless avoided one another as sexual partners confirmed the Westermarck effect.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, M. (1965). Children of the Kibbutz. New York: Schocken.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Shepher in a study examined the second generation in a kibbutz and found no marriages and no sexual activity between the adolescents in the same peer group. This was not enforced but voluntary. Looking at the second generation adults in all kibbutzim, out of a total of 2769 marriages, none were between those of the same peer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepher | first1 = J. | title = Mate selection among second generation kibbutz adolescents and adults: Incest avoidance and negative imprinting | doi = 10.1007/BF01638058 | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 293–307 | year = 1971 | pmid =  24179077| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a book review by John Hartung of a book by Shepher, out of 2516 marriages documented in Israel, 200 were between couples reared in the same kibbutz. These marriages occurred after young adults reared on kibbutzim had served in the military and encountered tens of thousands of other potential mates, and 200 marriages is higher than what would be expected by chance. Of these 200 marriages, five were between men and women who had been reared together for the first six years of their lives, which would argue against the Westermarck effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartung | first1 = John | year = 1985 | title = Review of ''Incest: A Biological View'' by J.

''Sexual attraction and childhood association: a Chinese

Another approach is looking at moral objections to third-party incest. This increases the longer a child has grown up together with another child of the opposite sex. This occurs even if the other child is genetically unrelated.&lt;ref name=moral/&gt; Humans have been argued to have a special kin detection system that besides the incest taboo also regulates a tendency towards [[altruism]] towards kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = D. | last2 = Tooby | first2 = J. | last3 = Cosmides | first3 = L. | doi = 10.1038/nature05510 | title = The architecture of human kin detection | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7129 | pages = 727–731 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17301784| pmc = 3581061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One objection against an instinctive and genetic basis for the incest taboo is that incest does occur.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicchetti and Carlson eds. 1989 ''Child Maltreatment: Theory and Research on the Causes and Consequences of Child Abuse and Neglect. New York, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glaser and Frosh 1988 ''Child and Sexual Abuse'' Chicago: Dorsey Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists have also argued that the social construct "incest" (and the incest taboo) is not the same thing as the biological phenomenon of "inbreeding". For example, there is equal genetic relation between a man and the daughter of his father's sister and between a man and the daughter of his mother's sister, such that biologists would consider mating incestuous in both instances, but Trobrianders consider mating incestuous in one case and not in the other. Anthropologists have documented a great number of societies where marriages between some first cousins are prohibited as incestuous, while marriages between other first cousins are encouraged. Therefore, it is argued that the prohibition against incestuous relations in most societies is not based on or motivated by concerns over biological closeness.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies on cousin marriages have found support for a biological basis for the taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kushnick | first1 = G. | last2 = Fessler | first2 = D.

===Sociological explanations===
[[Psychoanalytic theory]]—in particular, the claimed existence of an [[Oedipus complex]], which is not an instinctual aversion against incest but an instinctual desire—has influenced many theorists seeking to explain the incest taboo using sociological theories.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005/&gt;

====Exogamy====
The anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] developed a general argument for the universality of the incest taboo in human societies. His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against [[endogamy]], and the effect is to encourage [[exogamy]]. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity. That is, Lévi-Strauss views marriage as an exchange of women between two social groups. This theory is based in part on [[Marcel Mauss]]'s theory of ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'', which (in Lévi-Strauss' words) argued:

{{quote|that exchange in primitive societies consists not so much in economic transactions as in reciprocal gifts, that these reciprocal gifts have a far more important function than in our own, and that this primitive form of exchange is not merely nor essentially of an economic nature but is what he aptly calls "a total social fact", that is, an event which has a significance that is at once social and religious, magic and economic, utilitarian and sentimental, jural and moral.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is also based on Lévi-Strauss's analysis of data on different kinship systems and marriage practices documented by anthropologists and historians. Lévi-Strauss called attention specifically to data collected by [[Margaret Mead]] during her research among the [[Arapesh]]. When she asked if a man ever sleeps with his sister, Arapesh replied: "No we don't sleep with our sisters. We give our sisters to other men, and other men give us their sisters." Mead pressed the question repeatedly, asking what would happen if a brother and sister did have sex with one another. Lévi-Strauss quotes the Arapesh response:

{{quote|What, you would like to marry your sister? What is the matter with you anyway? Don't you want a brother-in-law? Don't you realize that if you marry another man's sister and another man marries your sister, you will have at least two brothers-in-law, while if you marry your own sister you will have none? With whom will you hunt, with whom will you garden, who will you visit?&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969  ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 485&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By applying Mauss's theory to data such as Mead's, Lévi-Strauss proposed what he called [[alliance theory]]. He argued that, in "primitive" societies, marriage is not fundamentally a relationship between a man and a woman, but a transaction involving a woman that forges a relationship—an alliance—between two men.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, 1969 ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship'' revised edition, translated from the French by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer. Boston: Beacon Press. 492-496&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' takes this as a starting point and uses it to analyze kinship systems of increasing complexity found in so-called primitive societies (that is, those not based on agriculture, class inequalities, and centralized government).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This theory was debated intensely by anthropologists in the 1950s. It appealed to many because it used the study of incest taboos and marriage to answer more fundamental research interests of anthropologists at the time: how can an anthropologist map out the social relationships within a given community, and how do these relationships promote or endanger social solidarity?&lt;ref&gt;H. Befu "Social Exchange" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Volume 6, Page 255–281, Oct 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.G. Peletz "Kinship Studies in Late Twentieth-Century Anthropology" in ''Annual Review of Anthropology.'' Volume 24, Page 343–372, Oct 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, anthropologists never reached a consensus, and with the [[Vietnam War]] and the process of [[decolonization]] in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, anthropological interests shifted away from mapping local social relationships.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Some anthropologists argue that nuclear family incest avoidance can be explained in terms of the ecological, demographic, and economic benefits of exogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leavitt | first1 = Gregory | year = 1989 | title = Disappearance of the Incest Taboo | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 116–131 | doi=10.1525/aa.1989.91.1.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Lévi-Strauss generally discounted the relevance of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense than in any other sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing Lévi-Strauss's argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a dire shortage of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Paul. 1988. ''The Maasai of Matapato: a Study of Rituals of Rebellion'', Manchester University Press, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endogamy====
Exogamy between households or descent groups is typically prescribed in [[Classless society|classless societies]]. Societies that are stratified—that is, divided into unequal classes—often prescribe different degrees of endogamy. Endogamy is the opposite of exogamy; it refers to the practice of marriage between members of the same social group. A classic example is [[India]]'s [[caste system]], in which unequal castes are endogamous.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 250, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality between [[ethnic group]]s and [[Race (classification of humans)|races]] also correlates with endogamy.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1997 ''Culture, People and Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology'' 7th edition Longman pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt; Class, caste, ethnic, and racial endogamy typically coexists with family exogamy and prohibitions against incest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

An extreme example of this principle, and an exception to the incest taboo, is found among members of the ruling class in certain ancient states, such as the Inca, Egypt, China, and Hawaii; brother–sister marriage (usually between half-siblings) was a means of maintaining wealth and political power within one family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bixler | first1 = Ray | year = 1982 | title = Comment on the Incidence and Purpose of Royal Sibling Incest | url = | journal = American Ethnologist | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 580–582 | doi=10.1525/ae.1982.9.3.02a00100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that in Roman-governed Egypt this practice was also found among commoners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Ashley | last = Jones | title = Incest in Ancient Egypt | url = http://cnersundergraduatejournal.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/incest_in_ancient_egypt_revised_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Strong | first = Anise | title = Incest Laws and Absent Taboos in Roman Egypt | journal = Ancient History Bulletin | volume = 20 | year = 2006 | url = https://www.academia.edu/205164/Incest_Laws_and_Absent_Taboos_in_Roman_Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = N. | title = Life in Egypt under Roman Rule | isbn = 0-19-814848-8 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] | year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

The '''International Institute of Tropical Agriculture''' ('''IITA''') works with partners to enhance crop quality and productivity, reduce producer and consumer risks, and generate wealth from agriculture, with the ultimate goals of reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. IITA's research-for-development (R4D) focuses on addressing the development needs of tropical countries. The institute was established in 1967 and is headquartered in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]], with several research stations across [[Africa]]. IITA is a nonprofit organization governed by a Board of Trustees, supported by several countries and the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR).

==History==
IITA was established in 1967 in Ibadan, the idea of the institute came from [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] foundations desire to establish a centre for the improvement in quality of tropical foods.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, R. D. R., International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Symposium on Sustainable Food Production in Sub-Saharian Africa, &amp; Symposium on "Sustainable Food Production in Sub-Saharian Africa".

Ibadan: International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. P. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The institute came to existence with the enactment of decree 32. of 1967. Part of the institute's initial goals were to develop a better productive farming system, the selection and breeding of high yielding crop varieties that are resistant to diseases and pest and strengthening agricultulral research in the humid and tropic regions. The institute was initially situated on a 1000 hectare land. The institute focused on a cereal improvement program, grain and legumes improvement program, farming systems and root and tuber improvement program. The grain and [[legume]] improvement system consisted of [[soybean]], [[cowpea]] and tuber program composed of [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] and [[cassava]].&lt;ref&gt;Coker Onita. (1987).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9186">'''Ioliomics''' is a research discipline dealing with the studies of [[ion]]s in liquids (or liquid phases) and stipulated with fundamental differences of [[ionic interaction]]s.&lt;ref name=ChemRev2017/&gt;  The name is a combination of IOns, LIquids and -OMICS. Ioliomics covers a broad research area concerning structure, properties and applications of ions involved in various biological and chemical systems. The concept of this research discipline is related to other comprehensive research fields, such as [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[glycomics]], [[petroleomics]], etc., where the suffix ''-omics'' is used for describing the comprehensiveness of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kandpal|first1=RP|last2=Saviola|first2=B|last3=Felton|first3=J|title=The era of ’omics unlimited.|journal=BioTechniques|date=April 2009|volume=46|issue=5|pages=351−355|doi=10.2144/000113137|pmid=19480630|url=http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/specialissues/2009/April/The-era-of-omics-unlimited/biotechniques-132593.html|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamental nature ==
The nature of [[chemical interactions]] and their description is one of the most fundamental problems in [[chemistry]]. The concepts of [[Covalent bond|covalent]] and [[Ionic bond|ionic]] bonds which emerged in the beginning of the 20th century specify the profound differences between their [[electronic structure]]s. These differences, in turn, lead to dramatically different behavior of [[Covalent compound|covalent]] and [[ionic compound]]s both in the [[solution]] and [[Phase (matter)|solid phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=GN|title=The atom and the molecule|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=April 1916|volume=38|issue=4|pages=762–785|doi=10.1021/ja02261a002|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja02261a002|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the solid phase, ionic compounds, e.g. [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], are prone to formation of [[crystal lattice]]s; in polar [[solvent]]s, they dissociate into ions surrounded by solvate shells, thus rendering the solution highly ionic [[conductive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=P|last2=de Paula|first2=J|title=Atkins’ Physical Chemistry|date=2006|publisher=WH Freman|location=New York|isbn=9780198700722|edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to [[covalent bond]]s, [[Ionic bonding|ionic interactions]] demonstrate flexible, dynamic behavior, which allows tuning ionic compounds to obtain desired properties.

== Importance ==
[[Ionic compound]]s interact strongly with the solvent medium; therefore, their impact on chemical and biochemical processes involving [[ion]]s can be significant. Even in the case of simplest [[ion]]s and [[solvent]]s, the presence of the former can lead to rearrangement and restructuring of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mancinelli|first1=R|last2=Botti|first2=A|last3=Bruni|first3=F|last4=Ricci|first4=MA|last5=Soper|first5=AK|title=Perturbation of water structure due to monovalent ions in solution|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|date=June 2007|volume=9|issue=23|pages=2959–2967|doi=10.1039/b701855j|pmid=17551619|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2007/CP/b701855j|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is established that ionic reactions are involved in numerous phenomena at the scales of whole [[Galaxy|galaxies]] or single living [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name=ChemRev2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geppert|first1=WD|last2=Larsson|first2=M|title=Experimental investigations into astrophysically relevant ionic reactions|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=December 2013|volume=113|issue=12|pages=8872–8905|doi=10.1021/cr400258m|pmid=24219419|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr400258m}}&lt;/ref&gt; To name a few, in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]], metal ions bind to [[Metalloprotein|metalloenzymes]] and other [[protein]]s therefore modulating their activity;&lt;ref name=ChemRev2006/&gt; [[ion]]s are involved in the control of neuronal functioning during [[Sleep-wake cycle|sleep – wakefulness cycles]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=F|last2=O'Donnell|first2=J|last3=Xu|first3=Q|last4=Kang|first4=N|last5=Goldman|first5=N|last6=Nedergaard|first6=M|title=Changes in the composition of brain interstitial ions control the sleep-wake cycle|journal=Science|date=April 2016|volume=352|issue=6285|pages=550–555|doi=10.1126/science.aad4821|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6285/550|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  anomalous activity of [[ion channel]]s results in the development of various disorders, such as [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]] and [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]] diseases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaydman|first1=MA|last2=Silva|first2=JR|last3=Cui|first3=J|title=Ion channel associated diseases: overview of molecular mechanisms|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=November 2012|volume=112|issue=12|pages=6319–6333|doi=10.1021/cr300360k|pmid=23151230|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr300360k|accessdate=3 February 2017|pmc=3586387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  etc. Thus, despite the problems associated with the studies on properties and activities of ions in various chemical and biological systems,&lt;ref name=ChemRev2017/&gt; this research field is among the most urgent ones.

== Ion-abundant liquid media ==
Of special interest are ion-abundant liquid media (such as [[ionic liquid]]s, [[molten salt]]s, liquid [[electrolyte]]s, etc.), which represent “liquid ions” with excellent tunable properties for different applications. The systems are famous for their ability to solvent-solute self-organization phenomena and are often employed in [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and pharmaceutical research.&lt;ref name=ChemRev2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=R|last2=Warr|first2=GG|last3=Atkin|first3=R|title=Structure and nanostructure in ionic liquids|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=July 2015|volume=115|issue=13|pages=6357–6426|doi=10.1021/cr500411q|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr500411q|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most important features of ion-abundant liquid media is their huge potential to be fine-tuned. Thus, one can design an [[ionic liquid]] with virtually any combination of physicochemical or biochemical properties.&lt;ref name=Clean1999/&gt;

'''Irradiation''' is the process by which an object is exposed to [[radiation]]. The exposure can originate from various sources, including natural sources. Most frequently the term refers to [[ionizing radiation]], and to a level of radiation that will serve a specific purpose, rather than radiation [[exposure (radiation)|exposure]] to normal levels of [[background radiation]]. The term irradiation usually excludes the exposure to non-ionizing radiation, such as [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[microwave]]s from [[cellular phone]]s or [[electromagnetic wave]]s emitted by radio and TV receivers and power supplies.

==Applications==

===Sterilization===

If administered at appropriate levels, all forms of [[ionizing radiation]] can [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] objects, including medical instruments, disposables such as [[syringe]]s, and [[Food irradiation|sterilize food]].  Ionizing radiation ([[electron beam processing|electron beams]], [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/rad_in_food/irradfoodqa/ |title=Food Standards Agency - Irradiated food |accessdate=2008-01-26 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be used to kill bacteria in food or other organic material, including blood.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Food irradiation]], while effective, is seldom used due to problems with public acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html "Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation"] article by [[Andrew Marin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''  February 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===

Irradiation is used in [[diagnostic imaging]], [[radiation therapy|cancer therapy]] and [[blood transfusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hospital.blood.co.uk/media/28302/160509-27091-irradiated-blood-blc6082p-final.pdf "Information for patients needing irradiated blood"] by [[National Blood Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 researchers found that irradiation was successful in the novel [[theranostic]] technique involving co-treatment with [[heptamethine dyes]] to elucidate tumor cells and attenuate their growth with minimal side effects.&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;Tan X, Luo S, Wang D, et al.  A NIR heptamethine Dye with intrinsic cancer targeting, imaging and photosynthesizing properties. Journal of Biomaterials China. 33-7 (2011), pp. 2230-2239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fpene&gt;F. Pene, E. Courtine, A. Cariou, J.P. Mira.  Toward theranostics.  Crit Care Med, 37 (2009), pp. S50–S58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ion implantation===
{{Main|Ion implantation}}

Ion irradiation is routinely used to implant impurities [[atom]]s into materials, especially
[[semiconductor]]s, to modify their properties. This process, usually known
as [[ion implantation]], is an important step in the manufacture of silicon [[integrated circuit]]s.

===Ion irradiation===

Ion irradiation means in general using particle [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]]s to shoot energetic ions on a material.
[[Ion implantation]] is a variety of ion irradiation, as is [[swift heavy ions]] irradiation from [[particle accelerators]] induces [[ion tracks]] that can be used for [[nanotechnology]].

===Industrial chemistry===

Irradiation can be used to [[cross-link]] [[plastics]] or to improve material qualities of [[semi-precious stones]]. Due to its efficiency, [[electron beam processing]] is often used in the irradiation treatment of polymer-based products to improve their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties, and often to add unique properties. [[Cross-linked polyethylene]] pipe (PEX), high-temperature products such as tubing and gaskets, wire and cable jacket curing, curing of composite materials, and crosslinking of tires are a few examples.

===Security===

During the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], the [[US Postal Service]] [[irradiated mail]] to protect members of the US government and other possible targets.  This was of some concern to people who send digital media through the mail, including artists. According to the ART in Embassies program, "incoming mail is irradiated, and the process destroys slides, transparencies and disks."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Agriculture===

{{main|Mutation breeding}}

After its discovery by Lewis Stadler at the [[University of Missouri]], irradiation of [[seed]] and plant [[germplasm]] has resulted in creating many widely-grown [[cultivars]] of [[food crop]]s worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahloowalia |first=B.S. |last2=Maluszynski |first2=M. |last3=Nichterlein |first3=K. |date=2004 |title=Global impact of mutation-derived varieties |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:EUPH.0000014914.85465.4f |journal=Euphytica |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=187–204 |doi=10.1023/B:EUPH.0000014914.85465.4f |access-date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process, which consists of striking plant seeds or germplasm with radiation in the form of [[X-ray]]s, [[UV radiation|UV waves]], [[ion beam|heavy-ion beams]], or [[gamma ray]]s, essentially "mixes" the genes already existing in the [[genome]].  The UN has been an active participant through the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].  Irradiation is also employed to prevent the sprouting of certain [[cereal]]s, [[onion]]s, [[potato]]es and [[garlic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bly, J.H. "Electron Beam Processing", Yardley, PA: International Information Associates, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  Appropriate irradiation doses are also used to produce insects for use in the [[sterile insect technique]] of pest control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-ididas.iaea.org/IDIDAS/default.htm International Database on Insect Disinfestation and Sterilization], Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture website, [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], plus the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Food irradiation}}

The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) recognizes irradiation as an important technology to [[food safety|protect consumers]]. Fresh [[meat]] and [[poultry]] including whole or cut up birds, skinless poultry, [[pork chop]]s, [[roast]]s, [[stew meat]], liver, [[hamburger]]s, [[ground meat]], and ground poultry are approved for irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130105210704/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Irradiation_and_Food_Safety/index.asp Irradiation and Food Safety], U.S. Drug and Food Administration. Retrieved Jan. 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination===

Some claim that [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who died of lung cancer in Bucharest on March 19, 1965, was intentionally irradiated during a visit to Moscow, due to his political stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefinalphaseforum.invisionzone.com/lofiversion/index.php/t1487-50.html|title=TFP &gt; Alexander Litvinenko Assassination|accessdate=2009-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701081808/http://thefinalphaseforum.invisionzone.com/lofiversion/index.php/t1487-50.html|archivedate=2011-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, an article in [[Der Spiegel]] alleged that the East German [[Stasi|MfS]] intentionally irradiated political prisoners with high-dose radiation, possibly to provoke cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13395385.html ''STASI: In Kopfhöhe ausgerichtet.''] Article by Peter Wensierski in [[Der Spiegel]] 20/1999, May 17, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv00/160yy47.htm ''Tödliche Strahlung. Die Staatssicherheit der DDR steht im Verdacht, Regimegegner radioaktiv verseucht zu haben.''] Article by Paul Leonhard in ''Junge Freiheit'' April 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Litvinenko]], a secret serviceman who was tackling organized crime in Russia, was intentionally poisoned with Po-210; the very large internal doses of radiation he received caused his death.

==History==
The effort to start Landmark Columbus began in 2013 when the Columbus Redevelopment Commission began looking at new ways to research and examine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Columbus taps conservator to preserve architecture|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/22423226/columbus-taps-conservator-to-preserve-architecture|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=www.wdrb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current state for the design heritage in the Columbus Arts and Entertainment District.&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=The Columbus Challenge|journal=Objects Speciality Group Postprints|date=2014|volume=21|pages=363-377|url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/osg-postprints/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/03/osg021-17.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The start of this project came at a time when some of the modern works of [[architecture]] had begun to age and show signs of transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes on Columbus, Indiana {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://www.docomomo-us.org/news/notes_columbus_indiana|website=www.docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
The effort officially launched as "Landmark Columbus" in 2015 as a program of Heritage Fund, and began producing events in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=MONUMENTAL TASK|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/11/06/monumental_task|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus Update: Civic Inspiration at the Right Scale {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://docomomo-us.org/news/columbus_update_civic_inspiration_right_scale|website=docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karaim|first1=Reed|title=Is Columbus's Modernist Legacy at Risk?|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/is-columbuss-modernist-legacy-at-risk_o|accessdate=23 July 2016|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort has been seen as a way to preserve the design legacy of the town without relying on traditional historic preservation ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Michael Franklin|title=Saving the Columbus Occupational Health Association|url=http://archpaper.com/2016/08/columbus-occupational-health-association/#gallery-0-slide-1|accessdate=20 August 2016|work=Archpaper.com|date=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landmark Columbus produces a number of ongoing programs and projects in an effort to care for the design heritage, most of which are created by an Advocacy and Education Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=MONUMENTAL TASK|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/11/06/monumental_task|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is active in the community in various ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winter Magic, Spring Phoenix, and Columbus All Year|url=http://www.wfyi.org/programs/the-art-of-the-matter/radio/winter-magic-spring-phoenix-and-columbus-all-year|accessdate=30 July 2016|work=WFYI Public Media|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including nominating the [[Irwin Conference Center]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Modern landmark finds a new use|url=http://www.hiddengemsindiana.org/2015/01/irwin-conference-center-columbus.html|website=Hidden Gems Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a Docomomo US National Citation of Merit in 2014 for the [[National Historic Landmark]] building designed by [[Eero Saarinen]], which was restored through an adaptive reuse project by [[Cummins]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citation of Merit - Cummins Irwin Conference Center &amp; Office Buildings {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://docomomo-us.org/citation_merit_cummins_irwin_conference_center_office_buildings|website=docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus historians David Sechrest and Ricky Berkey have been involved with the organization from the beginning, helping to create projects around both the early and modern history of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=MONUMENTAL TASK|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/11/06/monumental_task|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friends of First Christian Church Architecture===
Friends of First Christian Church Architecture (FFCCA) is a collaborative effort with a mission to "is to preserve the architecture and design elements of FCC, a National Historic Landmark designed by Eliel &amp; Eero Saarinen in 1942."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose|url=http://www.fccoc.org/building.php|website=www.fccoc.org|publisher=Friends of First Christian Church|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was launched in January 2017 as a partnership with First Christian Church, Heritage Fund, Landmark Columbus, and Indiana Landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisson|first1=Patrick|title=Saving the country’s first modern church, and a Columbus architecture landmark|url=http://www.curbed.com/2017/2/2/14485452/eero-eliel-saarinen-first-christian-church-columbus-indiana|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=Curbed|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first project for FFCCA was to help save the sanctuary skylight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=First (Christian) things first: New group forms to protect city’s original Modernist building|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2017/01/24/first_christian_things_first/|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=The Republic|date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leaked for years and caused damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=John|title=First Christian Church in need of help maintaining landmark {{!}} 1010 WCSI|url=http://1010wcsi.com/first-christian-church-in-need-of-help-maintaining-landmark/|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=1010wcsi.com|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August of 2018 FFCCA had raised enough resources from the congregation and throughout the community to have the skylight fully restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McClure |first1=Julie |title=Architectural integrity: First Christian Church skylight repair retains defining characteristic |url=http://www.therepublic.com/2018/08/08/architectural_integrity_first_christian_church_skylight_repair_retains_defining_characteristic/ |accessdate=8 August 2018 |work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundraising for the restoration of the skylight was a collaborative effort, and included contributions from the Church congregation, Kenny Glass, Inc., and the Columbus Area Visitors Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reports |first1=Staff |title=Church’s skylight project highlights successful collaboration |url=http://www.therepublic.com/2018/08/24/churchs_skylight_project_highlights_successful_collaboration/ |accessdate=28 August 2018 |work=The Republic |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columbus Conversations===
Columbus Conversation is an annual symposium held to address a pressing need in the community related to Columbus' design heritage.  The series began in 2014 and featured Theodore Prudon's keynote presentation "Modern Architecture as Heritage,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Columbus Conversation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWArV-gUd2c|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included lectures by Marsh Davis, from [[Indiana Landmarks]]; Louis Joyner, a Columbus-based architect; Richard McCoy; and a conversation moderated by Harry McCawley. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elig|first1=Jenny|title=Preserving architecture taking center stage|work=The Republic|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Columbus Conversation featured a panel discussion by Jeff Baker, the last president of Preserve to Enjoy, Inc.; Tricia Gilson from the Columbus Indiana Architectural Archives; Flora Chou, board member of Docomomo US; and Theodore Prudon, board president of Docomomo US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Columbus Conversation by Landmark Columbus|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2yt26zsCOc|website=YouTube|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This moderated discussion defined ways that Landmark Columbus could raise awareness about caring for the areas design heritage and begin growing a constituency that actively helps in the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClure|first1=Julie|title=Landmark group invites residents for a chat about historic preservation|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/10/23/landmark_group_invites_residents_for_a_chat_about_historic_preservation/|website=The Republic|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaotic Tuesdays===
[[File:2015 Chaotic Tuesday.jpg|thumb|left|A "Chaotic Tuesday" inside the Commons]]
In celebration of [[Jean Tinguely]]'s masterwork, ''[[Chaos 1]]'', located inside the Commons, Landmark Columbus started "Chaotic Tuesdays" as a free community event during which everyone could see the [[kinetic art]]work operate during the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=Returning to a state of ‘Chaos’|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/02/22/returning_to_a_state_of_chaos/|accessdate=14 May 2016|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea for the event came from the director of [[Museum Tinguely]], Roland Wetzel, when he visited in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking Chaos with Roland Wetzel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T16pS4n3_Fs|website=YouTube|publisher=Landmark Columbus|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event happens on the fourth Tuesday of every month and has grown to be a partnership between many in the community and led by the Columbus Area Arts Council. Professors from Ivy Tech bring drawing materials for the community and provide lessons on how to draw the artwork, which Tinguely himself did many times; his drawings of ''Chaos 1'' are in collections around the world.    

===Landscape architecture cleanups===
[[File:2015 North Christian Church Clean Up.jpg|thumb|2015 North Christian Church Landscape Clean Up]]
Landmark Columbus has organized a number of community efforts to help clean and maintain the landscape at [[North Christian Church]], which was designed by [[Dan Kiley]] and is one of seven National Historic Landmarks in the city. Cleanups have addressed issues caused by storms and ongoing maintenance, including the dormant pruning of the many [[magnolia]]s that surround the church. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=Helping ‘a beacon’ shine on|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2016/01/16/helping_a_beacon_shine_on/|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yearly bicycle rides===
Landmark Columbus started a yearly bicycle tour in May that coincides with National Preservation Month and [[National Bike Month]].  
* The 2015 "Olde Tyme Architectural Bicycle Ride" featured a tour of late 19th and early 20th century architecture and landscapes near downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=John|title=Health advocates plan local bike month activities|url=http://1010wcsi.com/health-advocates-plan-local-bike-month-activities/|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=1010 WCSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landmark Lego Challenge===
In May 2016 Landmark Columbus held a first-of-its-kind competition that invited participants to build one of the seven National Historic Landmarks out of [[Lego]] bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blair|first1=Brian|title=Get a leg up on LEGO building competition during opening event today|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2016/05/13/get_a_leg_up_on_lego_building_competition_during_opening_event_today/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This project was launched in partnership with the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], kids commons, the Columbus Indiana Architectural Archives, and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reports|first1=Staff|title=Lego challenge builds on city’s architectural foundations|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2016/05/26/lego_challenge_builds_on_citys_architectural_foundations/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Docomomo US Tour Day===
Various partners began participating in "Tour Day" starting in 2013 to draw regional interest in visiting Columbus and seeing the modern architecture.
* In 2013, a tour was given of the Columbus Arts District and the Miller House and Gardens. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TOUR DAY 2013: INDIANA {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://www.docomomo-us.org/tour_day_2013/indiana|website=www.docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014, Indiana Landmarks created the "Landmarks Experience: Columbus," a day-long immersion with lectures and tours that included the Miller House.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tour Day 2014: INDIANA {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://www.docomomo-us.org/tour_day_2014_indiana|website=www.docomomo-us.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015, Landmark Columbus created the "Saarinen, Pei, and the Plaza that Connected Them" tour, which looked at the relationship between the [[Cleo Rogers Memorial Library]] Henry Moore's [[Large Arch]], and First Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saarinen, Pei, and the Plaza that Connected Them {{!}} docomomo united states|url=http://docomomo-us.org/saarinen_pei_and_plaza_connected_them|website=docomomo-us.org|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation and surveys===
In 2013 and 14, all of the [[public art]] in [[Bartholomew County]] was surveyed, photographed, and placed in the database of the Public Art Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus in the Public Art Archive|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/search/apachesolr_search/?filters=im_work_coll_nid%3A69452|website=www.publicartarchive.org|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[list of public art in Bartholomew County, Indiana]] includes more than 100 artworks in a diverse group of places.  Also at this time, all of the resources in the Columbus Arts District and all of the modern buildings were surveyed, photographed, and published in the database of CultureNOW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus in CultureNOW - MuseumWithoutWalls|url=http://www.culturenow.org/map&amp;zoom=14&amp;latLng=39.202241,-85.922328|website=www.culturenow.org|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CultureNOW - Newsletters|url=http://www.culturenow.org/newsletter&amp;date=2014-03|website=www.culturenow.org|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research projects have included investigations for public artworks that are now missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elig|first1=Jenny|title=In search of city’s lost art|url=http://www.therepublic.com/2015/03/01/in_search_of_citys_lost_art|work=The Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal realism'''  is a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] approach to [[law]] and is the view that [[jurisprudence]] should emulate the methods of [[natural science]], i.e., rely on [[empirical evidence]]. [[Hypotheses]] have to be tested against observations of the world. 

Legal realists believe that the legal science should investigate law exclusively with the value-free methods of natural sciences, also called 'sciences of the real' in some [[Continental Europe|Continental]] languages (e.g., 'Realwissenschaften', in [[German language|German]]). Some legal realists (e.g., [[Leon Petrażycki]] and [[Max Weber]]) also hold that there should exist, too, a legal dogmatics, which is independent of legal science proper but, this notwithstanding, can be regarded as a science in its own right (and so, despite its being a non-real, or formal, science). However, the focus of all legal realists is on legal science proper.

==Overview==
Due to their value-free approach, legal realists are opposed to [[natural law]] traditions. Legal realists regard these traditions as historical and/or social phenomena to be explained by making use of a variety of psychological and sociological hypotheses. They are also opposed to any form of [[linguistic turn]] in jurisprudence. When applied to law, they regard the linguistic turn as a sort of 'emasculation' (Enrico Pattaro) of legal phenomena. This is so because legal realists conceive legal phenomena as psychical phenomena, and, notably, as a form of ''moral motivation'' of human behavior (to be investigated with the methods of psychology and/or neurosciences). All this implies that legal realists are opposed to most versions of contemporary [[legal positivism]].

A further difference from all sorts of legal positivism is that legal realists refuse to confine their investigations to state law and/or positive law. Moreover, legal realists have a conception of law that stretches far beyond legal pluralism—so popular in many versions of classical and contemporary [[sociology of law]]. This is one of the reasons why legal realism cannot be regarded as a sort of sociology of law (other reasons being: legal realists' psychologism and their refusal of the linguistic turn—a turn that affected, too, sociology of law). Apart from Max Weber (who, owing to a variety of reasons, is mostly conceptualized as sociologist rather than as a legal realist), there are two strands of legal realism in this sense: Scandinavian legal realism, founded by [[Axel Hägerström]] (1868&amp;ndash;1939), and Polish-Russian legal realism, founded by [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867&amp;ndash;1931). Both realisms, owing to their similarities (and despite their founders' ignoring one another), are sometimes referred to as 'continental legal realism' (in the singular).

In English-speaking countries the phrase 'legal realism' has often a somewhat different and more restricted meaning. It is used to refer to a conception of adjudication rather than of law in general. However, some legal realists in this other sense, including the founder of this movement, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], reduced law to the activity of courts and other state officials, thus proposing a kind of naturalistic and value-free reduction of law (a conception, though, that all Continental legal realists would reject, ''[[inter alia]]'', as excessively narrow). It is to this other kind of legal realism—also called 'American legal realism'—that this entry is devoted.

American legal realists (henceforth: realists) believe that there is more to adjudication than the mechanical application of known legal principles to uncontroversial fact-finding as [[legal formalism]] believes. Some realists believe that one can never be sure that the facts and [[law]] identified in the judge's reasons were the actual reasons for the judgment, whereas other realists accept that a judge's reasons can often be relied upon, but not all of the time. Realists believe that the legal principles that [[legal formalism]] treat as uncontroversial actually hide contentious political and moral choices.

Realism was treated as a conceptual claim for much of the late 20th century due to [[H. L. A. Hart]]'s misunderstanding of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, H. L. A. (1961). The Concept of Law (2nd ed. / with a postscript edited by Penelope A. Bulloch and Joseph Raz.). Oxford: Clarendon Press. Ch.VII&lt;/ref&gt; Hart was an analytical legal philosopher who was interested in conceptual analysis of concepts such as the concept of 'law'. This entailed identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. When realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out that individuals embroiled in the legal system generally wanted to know what was going to happen, Hart assumed that they were offering the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of the concept 'law'. Nowadays, legal theorists tend to recognise that the realists and the conceptual lawyers were interested in different questions. Realists are interested in methods of predicting judges with more accuracy, whereas conceptual lawyers are interested in the correct use of legal concepts.

Legal realism was primarily a reaction to the [[legal formalism]] of the late 19th century and early 20th century, and was the dominant approach for much of the early 20th century. It succeeded in its negative aspiration of casting doubt upon formalist assumptions that judges always did what they said so that it is often said that 'we are all realists now.' However, realism failed in its positive aspiration of discovering a better way of predicting how judges would behave than relying on the reasons given by judges.

A theory of law and legal reasoning that arose in the early decades of the twentieth century broadly characterized by the claim that law can be best understood by focusing on what judges actually ''do'' in deciding cases, rather than on what they say they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Shiner, "Legal Realism," in Robert Audi, ed., ''The Cambridge Dictionary of'' ''Philosophy''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The central target of legal realism was legal formalism: the classical view that judges don't make law, but mechanically apply it by logically deducing uniquely correct legal conclusions from a set of clear, consistent, and comprehensive legal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, "American Legal Realism," in Martin P. Golding and William A. Edmundson, eds., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Law and Legal Theory''. Oxford: Blackwell, 2005, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; American legal realism has aptly been described as "the most important indigenous jurisprudential movement in the United States during the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 50. There was also a Scandinavian school of legal realism that arose about the same time as its American cousin. This entry focuses on American legal realism.&lt;/ref&gt; Though most legal scholars today would agree that some aspects of legal realism were misguided or over-stated, its enduring influence on legal thought and legal education has been profound.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Forerunners==
Although the American legal realist movement first emerged as a cohesive intellectual force in the 1920s, it drew heavily upon a number of prior thinkers and was influenced by broader cultural forces. In the early years of the twentieth century, formalist approaches to the law had been forcefully criticized by thinkers such as [[Roscoe Pound]], [[John Chipman Gray]], and [[Benjamin Cardozo]]. Philosophers such as [[John Dewey]] had held up empirical science as a model of all intelligent inquiry, and argued that law should be seen as a practical instrument for advancing human welfare. Outside the realm of law, in fields such as economics and history, there was a general "revolt against formalism," a reaction in favor of more empirical ways of doing philosophy and the human sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Neil Duxbury, ''Patterns of American Jurisprudence''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; But by far the most important intellectual influence on the legal realists was the thought of the American jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

===[[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]]===
Holmes is a towering figure in American legal thought for many reasons, but what the realists drew most from Holmes was his famous [[prediction theory of law]], his utilitarian approach to legal reasoning, and his "realist" insistence that judges, in deciding cases, are not simply deducing legal conclusions with inexorable, machine-like logic, but are influenced by ideas of fairness, public policy, and other personal and conventional values.

All these themes can be found in Holmes's famous 1897 essay, "The Path of the Law." There Holmes attacks formalist approaches to judicial decision making and states a pragmatic definition of "law": "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr."&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., "The Path of the Law," 10 ''Harvard Law Review'' 457 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; If law is prophecy, Holmes continues, we must reject the view of "text writers" who tell you that law "is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason that is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr." /&gt;

Holmes next introduces his most important and influential argument, the "bad-man" theory of law: "[I]f we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws" about either the morality or the logic of the law. For the bad man, "legal duty" signifies only "a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment".&lt;ref name="Holmes, Jr." /&gt; The bad man cares nothing for legal theorizing and concerns himself only with practical consequences. In the spirit of [[pragmatism]], Holmes suggests that this is useful way of laying bare the true meaning of legal concepts.

The utilitarian or instrumentalist flavor of "The Path of the Law" also found favor with the realists. The purpose of the law, Holmes insisted, was the deterrence of undesirable social consequences: "I think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;William W. Fisher III, Morton J. Horwitz, Thomas A. Reed, eds., ''American Legal Realism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Civil War, this conception of adjudication as a form of social engineering had been widely shared by American judges, but in the late nineteenth century it had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Morton J. Horwitz, ''The Transformation of American'' ''Law, 1870–1960: The Crisis of Legal Orthodoxy''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aspirations of both Holmes and the realists was to revive it.

==Key themes==
Drawing upon Holmes and other critics of legal formalism, a number of iconoclastic legal scholars launched the legal realist movement in the 1920s and 30s. Among the leading legal realists were [[Karl Llewellyn]], [[Jerome Frank]], [[Herman Oliphant]], [[Underhill Moore]], Walter Wheeler Cook, [[Leon Green]], and [[Felix Cohen]]. Two American law schools, Yale and Columbia, were hotbeds of realist thought. Realism was a mood more than it was a cohesive movement, but it is possible to identify a number of common themes. These include:

* ''A distrust of the judicial technique of seeming to deduce legal conclusions from so-called rules of law''. The realists believed that judges neither do nor should decide cases formalistically.  Law is not, as the formalists claimed, a system of rules that is clear, consistent, and complete. Rather, the law is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, gaps, vague terms, and conflicting rules of interpretation. As a result, there is often (perhaps always) no uniquely correct answer to any hard case that appellate judges decide. Law is incurably "indeterminate."
* ''A belief in the instrumental nature of the law''. Like Dewey and Pound, the realists believed that law does and should serve social ends. Judges unavoidably take account of considerations of fairness and public policy, and they are right to do so.&lt;ref&gt;According to legal scholar Brian Leiter, the "core claim" of legal realism is that judges do not decide cases on purely legal grounds; other factors play a significant and in fact predominant role. Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A desire to separate legal from moral elements in the law''. The realists were legal positivists who believed that law should be treated scientifically. A clear distinction should be drawn between what the law is and what it should be. Law can only be viewed as an empirical science, as it ought to be, if moralistic notions are either excluded or are translated into empirically verifiable terms.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Christie, ''Jurisprudence: Text and Readings on the Philosophy of Law''. St. Paul, MN: West Publishing Co., 1973, pp. 642–644.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that legal talk of "duty," "right," etc. is really just talk about how judges are likely to decide cases, is a clear example of how many realists tried to purge law of moralistic language and translate everything into "realistic" talk of actual consequences and testable predictions.

==Criticisms==

Legal realism had its heyday from the 1920s to the 1940s. In the 1950s, legal realism was largely supplanted by the legal process movement, which viewed law as a process of "reasoned elaboration" and claimed that appeals to "legislative purpose" and other well-established legal norms could provide objectively correct answers to most legal questions. In his 1961 book ''The'' ''Concept of Law'', British legal theorist H. L. A. Hart dealt what many scholars saw as a "decisive blow"&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 61. Leiter argues that Hart's criticism was off the mark, and that it was ''wrongly'' assumed to have refuted legal realism.&lt;/ref&gt; to legal realism, by attacking the predictive theory of law that many realists had taken over from Holmes. Hart pointed out that if a law is just a prediction of what courts will do, a judge pondering the legal merits of a case before him is really asking, "How will I decide this case?" As Hart notes, this completely misses the fact that judges use legal rules to ''guide'' their decisions, not as data to predict their eventual holdings.

Many critics have claimed that the realists exaggerated the extent to which law is "riddled" with gaps, contradictions, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Frederick Schauer, "Easy Cases," ''Southern California Law Review'', Vol. 38 (1985), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that most legal questions have simple, clear-cut answers that no lawyer or judge would dispute is difficult to square with the realists' strong claims of pervasive legal "indeterminacy." Other critics, such as [[Ronald Dworkin]] and [[Lon Fuller]], have faulted legal realists for their attempt sharply to separate law and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Taking Rights'' ''Seriously''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1978, pp. 22-28; Lon L. Fuller, ''The Morality of Law'', rev. ed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, pp. 33-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and continuing relevance==
Though many aspects of legal realism are now seen as exaggerated or outdated, most legal theorists would agree that the realists were successful in their central ambition: to refute "formalist" or "mechanical" notions of law and legal reasoning. It is widely accepted today that law is not, and cannot be, an exact science, and that it is important to examine what judges are actually doing in deciding cases, not merely what they say they are doing. As ongoing debates about [[judicial activism]] and judicial restraint attest, legal scholars continue to disagree about when, if ever, it is legitimate for judges to "make law," as opposed to merely "following" or "applying" existing law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lief H. Carter and Thomas F. Burke, ''Reason in Law'', 8th ed. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2015 (contending that law is frequently indeterminate and that judges often do, and should, make law by employing a variety of legal methods and sources, especially "purposive" interpretation); and Antonin Scalia and Bryan A. Garner, ''Reading'' ''Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts''. Minneapolis: West, 2012 (arguing that law is not highly indeterminate and that there is little legitimate leeway for judicial policymaking).&lt;/ref&gt; But few would disagree with the realists' core claim that judges (for good or ill) are often strongly influenced by their political beliefs, their personal values, their individual personalities, and other extra-legal factors.&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, "American Legal Realism," p. 60 (noting that "[t]he paradigm of scholarship established by the Realists--contrasting what courts say they're doing with what they ''actually'' do--is one that has become so much the norm that distinguished scholars practice it without even feeling the need, any longer, to self-identify as Realists").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal realism and the European Court of Human Rights==
A statistical natural language processing method has been applied to automatically predict the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights (violation or no violation of a specific article) based on their textual contents, reaching a prediction accuracy of 79%.&lt;ref name="ecthr2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N. Aletras |author2=D. Tsarapatsanis |author3=D. Preotiuc-Pietro |author4=V. Lampos | title=Predicting judicial decisions of the European Court of Human Rights: a Natural Language Processing perspective | journal=PeerJ Computer Science | year=2016 | url=https://peerj.com/articles/cs-93/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent qualitative analysis of these results provided some support towards the theory of legal realism. The authors write: "In general, and notwithstanding the simplified snapshot of a very complex debate that we just presented, our results could be understood as lending some support to the basic legal realist intuition according to which judges are primarily responsive to non-legal, rather than to legal, reasons when they decide hard cases."

{{refimprove|date = August 2011}}
The '''mechanical philosophy''' is a [[natural philosophy]] describing the universe as similar to a large-scale mechanism. Mechanical philosophy is associated with the [[scientific revolution]] of [[Early Modern]] Europe. One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] published in 1651.

Some [[Intellectual history |intellectual historians]] and [[Critical theory|critical theorists]] argue that early mechanical philosophy was tied to [[disenchantment]] and the rejection of the idea of nature as living or animated by spirits or [[angels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Merchant |first= Carolyn|date= 1990 |title= The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o_l2uMk2KjsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= Harper Collins |chapter= Chapters 4, 9, 10 |isbn= 0062505955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, have noted that early mechanical philosophers nevertheless believed in [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[Christianity]] and [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | chapter = Chapter 2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism and determinism ==
Some ancient philosophies held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. This view was closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the scientific revolution of the 17th century had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of "mechanical laws": natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that imply a [[determinism]].  If all phenomena can be explained entirely through the motion of matter under physical laws, as the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, all phenomena must be completely determined, past, present or future.

==Development of the mechanical philosophy==
{{details|corpuscularianism}}
The natural philosophers directly concerned with developing the mechanical philosophy were largely a French group, together with some of their personal connections. They included [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[René Descartes]]. Also involved were the English thinkers [[Sir Kenelm Digby]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Walter Charleton]]; and the Dutch natural philosopher [[Isaac Beeckman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret J. Osler|title=Divine Will and the Mechanical Philosophy: Gassendi and Descartes on Contingency and Necessity in the Created World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtPISpxGacAC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=7 June 2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-52492-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Boyle]] used "mechanical philosophers" to refer both to those with a theory of "corpuscles" or [[atom]]s of matter, such as Gassendi and Descartes, and those who did without such a theory. One common factor was the [[clockwork universe]] view. His meaning would be problematic in the cases of Hobbes and [[Galileo Galilei]]; it would include [[Nicolas Lemery]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]], as well as himself. Newton would be a transitional figure. Contemporary usage of "mechanical philosophy" dates back to 1952 and [[Marie Boas Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Fisher|title=Pierre Gassendi's Philosophy And Science: Atomism for Empiricists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fLSO6y6DhUC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11996-3|pages=205 with note 1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the mechanical philosophy spread mostly through private academies and salons; in England in the [[Royal Society]]. In England it did not have a large initial impact in universities, which were somewhat more receptive in France, the Netherlands and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy Porter|author2=Katharine Park|author3=Lorraine Daston|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kvjAp92zcYC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=3 July 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57244-6|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobbes and the mechanical philosophy===
One of the first expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) by Hobbes (1651); the book's second chapter invokes the [[principle of inertia]], foundational for the mechanical philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Patricia Springborg |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hobbes's Leviathan |date= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-54521-1 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle did not mention him as one of the group; but at the time they were on opposite sides of a controversy. [[Richard Westfall]] deems him a mechanical philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sophie. Roux|author2=Daniel Garber|title=The Mechanization of Natural Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USOoK5tRabAC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-4345-8|page=11 note 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes's major statement of his natural philosophy is in ''[[De Corpore]]'' (1655).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Garber|title=The Cambridge history of seventeenth-century philosophy: Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC&amp;pg=PA581|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53720-9|page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part II and III of this work he goes a long way towards identifying fundamental [[physics]] with [[geometry]]; and he freely mixes concepts from the two areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Janiak|author2=Eric Schliesser|title=Interpreting Newton: Critical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5IskjtmGJoC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76618-0|page=34 with note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes and the mechanical philosophy===
Descartes was also a mechanist. A [[substance dualist]], he argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

===Beeckman and the mechanical philosophy===
Isaac Beeckman's theory of mechanical philosophy described in his books ''Centuria'' and ''Journal'' is grounded in two components: matter and motion.  To explain matter, Beeckman relied on  atomism philosophy which explains that matter is composed of tiny inseparable particles that interact to create the objects seen in life.  To explain motion, he supported the idea of inertia, a theory generated by Isaac Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkel|first=Klaas|date=2013|title=Isaac Beeckman on Matter and Motion : Mechanical Philosophy in the Making|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/lib/umr-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3318707.|journal=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=|pages=76-77|via=ProQuest Ebook Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton and the mechanical philosophy===
[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a weaker notion of mechanism that tolerated the [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. Interpretations of Newton's scientific work in light of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies|his occult research]] have suggested that he did not properly view the universe as mechanistic, but instead populated by mysterious forces and spirits and constantly sustained by God and angels.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of philosophers who were influenced by Newton example were nonetheless often mechanists. Among them were [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]].

==The mechanist thesis==
The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated some implications of the mechanist thesis, writing:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

The '''Network Test Automation Forum (NTAF)''', founded in 2010, is a nonprofit international industry alliance, dedicated to promoting interoperability of commercial network testing tools and testing infrastructure, by defining and facilitating adoption of technical specifications.

The forum is composed of leading service providers, network equipment vendors, and other networking companies that share an interest in test automation and interoperability. As of November 2012, it has 14 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/members/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2009, 11 founding members (BreakingPoint, [[BT Group|BT]], [[Cisco]], [[Fanfare]], [[Empirix]], [[Ericsson]], [[EXFO]], [[Ixia]], [[JDSU]], [[Spirent]] and [[Verizon]]) met in Chicago and expressed an interest in forming an industry alliance to bring together commercial testing vendors, test equipment vendors, and other industry experts to create interoperable testing solutions for service providers, network equipment manufacturers (NEMs), and other enterprise organizations with large network deployments. The result was the Network Test Automation Forum entity, which was set up in 2010 following the first face-to-face meeting in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fanfaresoftware.com/news-and-events/press-releases/global-companies-demand-testing-interoperability&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercetelecom.com/story/network-test-automation-forum-addresses-time-market-pressures/2010-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2010/03/network-test-automation-forum-launches-advocates-collaboration-and-interoperability-of-vendor-test-tools--87980227.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==
To facilitate and promote the interoperability of commercial testing tools and test infrastructure for the data communications and telecommunications industry.

NTAF will bring together commercial testing vendors, test equipment vendors, and other industry experts to create interoperable testing solutions for service providers, network equipment manufacturers (NEMs), and other enterprise organizations with large network deployments.

==Objectives==
The objectives of NTAF are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/about/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Build consensus and unite service providers, network equipment manufacturers, and test equipment vendors on network test automation technical specifications and interoperability.
* Create, facilitate and enable the implementation of network test automation specifications.
* Enhance market awareness of the benefits of interoperable network test automation.

==Members==
As of July 2013, NTAF has the following members:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntaforum.org/members/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
In June 2011, NTAF ratified two sets of specifications dealing with registration, discovery and activation of tools and defining tool harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetimes.com/design/industrial-control/4218488/Network-test-specs-promote-multi-vendor-interoperability-in-the-lab?Ecosystem=industrial-control&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4216721/NTAF-releases-specification-for-network-test-automation?Ecosystem=test-and-measurement&lt;/ref&gt;

===TS-001: Tool Registration, Discovery and Activation===
This specification describes an XMPP extension that allows an application or tool to register itself in a way that other interested entities can discover its existence. It also describes the mechanism by which a tool can be activated so that its automation harnesses are available for use.

===TS-002: Tool Automation Harness===
This specification describes an XMPP extension that allows an application or tool, with or without its own specialized man-machine user interface to expose an "automation harness" that allows that tool to be controlled and/or monitored by another tool via XMPP packet exchanges.

==Future Direction==
The NTAF Technical Committee is currently working on draft specifications for resource and inventory management:

===WT-003: Tool Resource===
This working document describes an NTAF extension that allows tools to communicate resource data. It is based on the TS-001 and TS-002 specifications and its primary focus is to support automated inventory management.

===WT-004: Inventory===
This working document describes an NTAF extension that supports the automatic population of inventory records with key equipment/resource parameters within a test lab environment. It is based on the TS-001 and TS002 specifications and the WT-003 proposal.

The '''Opal Storage Specification''' is a set of specifications for features of data storage devices (such as disk drives) that enhance their security.  For example, it defines a way of encrypting the stored data so that an unauthorized person who gains possession of the device cannot see the data.  That is, it is a specification for [[Hardware-based full disk encryption|self-encrypting drives]] (SED).

The specification is published by the [[Trusted Computing Group]] Storage Workgroup.

== SSC Overview==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
The Opal SSC (Security Subsystem Class) is an implementation profile for Storage Devices built to:
* Protect the confidentiality of stored user data against unauthorized access once it leaves the owner's control (involving a power cycle and subsequent deauthentication).
* Enable interoperability between multiple SD vendors.

== Functions ==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
The Opal SSC encompasses these functions:
* Security provider support
* Interface communication protocol
* Cryptographic features
* Authentication
* Table management
* Access control and personalization
* Issuance
* SSC discovery

== Features ==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
* Security Protocol 1 support
* Security Protocol 2 support
* Communications
* Protocol stack reset commands

== Security ==

Most of OPAL hardware securities weakness relies in firmware implementation. Radboud university researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Meijer |first1=Carlo |last2=van Gastel |first2=Bernard |title=Self-encrypting deception: weaknesses in the encryption of solid state drives (SSDs) |url=https://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/909282/draft-paper.pdf |website=Radboud University |publisher=Radboud University |accessdate=November 5, 2018 |ref=draft}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved in november 2018, how it was easy to hack some SSD devices (Samsung EVO 840 &amp; 850, Crucial MX100 MX200 &amp; MX300) with US$100 of computer &amp; electronics parts.

The '''Remote Sensing Center''' (RSC) at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] was established to bring together a range of capabilities and expertise to address problems of military and intelligence importance, as well as environmental and civil concerns.  It is specialized in a variety of [[remote sensing]] technologies designed to enable people to look beyond the range of human vision in range or in spectral perception.

== Mission ==

Members of the RSC come from the [[physics]], electrical and computer engineering, computer science, [[meteorology]], and [[oceanography]] departments.  They are collaborating to develop new remote sensing systems, as well as use and exploit current systems in air and space.  It is part of a larger activity in the [[Monterey Bay]] area that provides expertise in topical areas outside the technical disciplines available at NPS.

The Naval Postgraduate School, and specifically the Remote Sensing Center, has the ability to handle classified data, as well as access to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) that is fully equipped with comms, storage, and processing capabilities.  The RSC has pre-established cooperative research with government, academia, and industry in the remote sensing sector ranging from local to international partners.  Highly experienced military officers, intelligence analysts, and faculty are a critical part of the NPS research staff.

==Projects==

=== Lidar ===
''[[Lidar]]'' (LIght raDAR) works as an optical analog to [[radar]] in the visible spectrum of light with advantages related to the smaller wavelengths of the laser pulse.  Lidar ranges in wavelength from ultra-violet (0.3-0.45&amp;nbsp;µm) to visible (0.45-0.70&amp;nbsp;µm) to the infrared (1-15&amp;nbsp;µm).  Lidar can detect much smaller particles than radar in the atmosphere (which cannot detect things smaller than cloud particles), and thus can be used for aerosol detection.

The raw form of data is a set of x,y,z coordinate points.  With recent advances, resolution has improved dramatically.  Raw data can be processed to remove unwanted areas or features.  Outputs such as topographic maps with contour lines can also be derived from lidar.  Programs to manipulate lidar data include ENVI, [[ERDAS IMAGINE]], [[ArcInfo]], and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] ArcView (with 3D analyst ext.)  One useful derivation of lidar data is the DEM ([[Digital Elevation Model]]). DEMs are displayed in a raster format with a matrix.  The DEM has a specified cell size that corresponds to the earth’s surfaces.  The cell contains the average elevation of the points within it. 

The Remote Sensing Center is planning research projects that undertake the modeling and testing of analytical processing and using more fieldwork to obtain ground-truth measurements.  Projects have been completed and are currently underway in terrain classification including [[Elkhorn Slough]] and hidden trail identification.  Other future projects include a collaboration with the MOdeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation (MOVES) institute on lidar standards for data structure and visualization tools and modeling new lidar analysis tools.

=== Spectral Imagery Analysis ===

Spectral imagery measures the spectral character of materials within the visible range and beyond.  Two objects may appear visually identical but may be distinguished through examination of their spectral properties.  Computer software can use a color scheme to make them visible.

A subset of spectral imagery, [[hyperspectral imaging]] data, is produced when "solar electromagnetic energy reflected from the earth's surface is dispersed into many contiguous narrow spectral bands by an airborne spectrometer" (Stefanou, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;2). Our current research and projects include environmental mapping, target detection, and change detection.

The Remote Sensing Center works with airborne and satellite systems including [[IKONOS]]/[[Quickbird]] [[multispectral imagery]] (MSI), and airborne hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems including [[AVIRIS]], HYDICE, CASI, and HYMAP.  Classification and analysis, including atmospheric compensation is performed using standard industry research tools; notably ENVI and ERDAS Imagine.  The RSC has acquired a [[polarimetry|polarimetric]] camera for expanding experimentation in the visible spectrum.

==Intelligence==
The Remote Sensing Center benefits from the secure facilities at NPS.  Having the ability to process classified data with an on-site, fully equipped Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) allows students and faculty to pursue lines of research and work with technologies unavailable to the public.

The sustained efforts of fully funded graduate students, both military and civilian with an average of eight to ten years of field experience, have conducted research in an array of topics related to remote sensing.

*Current projects include:
:Helicopter Brownout (terrain classification) using National Technical Means (NTM)
:Maritime Domain Awareness (ASW)
:Snow/Ice study with UCSB using NTM

==Degree Programs==
The Remote Sensing Research and Education Program (RS-REP) is an interdisciplinary program to promote Remote Sensing technical education and research advancement to ensure that the Intelligence Community is fully supported for technology evolution.  The curriculum is in hiatus as of 2017.

'''Renewable energy commercialization''' involves the [[Diffusion of innovations|deployment]] of three generations of [[renewable energy]] technologies dating back more than 100 years. First-generation technologies, which are already mature and economically competitive, include [[biomass]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[geothermal power]] and heat. Second-generation technologies are market-ready and are being deployed at the present time; they include [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[wind power]], [[List of solar thermal power stations|solar thermal power stations]], and modern forms of [[bioenergy]]. Third-generation technologies require continued [[R&amp;D]] efforts in order to make large contributions on a global scale and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]].&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;[[International Energy Agency]] (2007).

=== Rationale for renewables ===
[[Climate change]], pollution, and energy insecurity are significant problems, and addressing them requires major changes to energy infrastructures.&lt;ref name=WWS2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf
|title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy]] technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to [[energy security|world energy security]], reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, and provide opportunities for mitigating [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt; Climate-disrupting [[fossil fuels]] are being replaced by clean, climate-stabilizing, non-depletable sources of energy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}
...the transition from coal, oil, and gas to wind, solar, and geothermal energy is well under way. In the old economy, energy was produced by burning something — oil, coal, or natural gas — leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy. The new energy economy harnesses the energy in wind, the energy coming from the sun, and heat from within the earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lester R. Brown]]. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization'', [[Earth Policy Institute]], 2009, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for a variety of methods for addressing the problem of energy supply. These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies. It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/public_opinion |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517214450/http://www.cfr.org/public_opinion |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 May 2016 |title=Public Opinion on Global Issues: Chapter 5b: World Opinion on Energy Security |author=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=18 January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU member countries have shown support for ambitious renewable energy goals. In 2010, [[Eurobarometer]] polled the twenty-seven EU member states about the target "to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20 percent by 2020". Most people in all twenty-seven countries either approved of the target or called for it to go further. Across the EU, 57 percent thought the proposed goal was "about right" and 16 percent thought it was "too modest." In comparison, 19 percent said it was "too ambitious".&lt;ref name="worldpublicopinion.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |title=Large Majorities in US and Europe Endorse Focus on Renewable Energy |date=18 January 2012 |work=World Public Opinion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315003300/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages. Events at the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear plant]] have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term. Further, cost estimates for "next generation" nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/pdfs/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Future%2011-16-11.pdf |title=Toward a Sustainable Future for the U.S. Power Sector: Beyond Business as Usual 2011 |author=Synapse Energy Economics |date=16 November 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2014 [[REN21]] Global Status Report says that renewable energies are no longer just energy sources, but ways to address pressing social, political, economic and environmental problems:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today, renewables are seen not only as sources of energy, but also as tools to address many other pressing needs, including: improving energy security; reducing the health and environmental impacts associated with fossil and nuclear energy; mitigating greenhouse gas emissions; improving educational opportunities; creating jobs; reducing poverty; and increasing gender equality... Renewables have entered the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf  |title= Renewables 2014 Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |date=2014 |work=(Paris: REN21 Secretariat) |isbn=978-3-9815934-2-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Growth of renewables===
[[File:Bp world energy consumption 2016.gif|thumb|Comparing trends in worldwide energy use, the growth of renewable energy to 2015 is the green line&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview Statistical Review of World Energy], Workbook (xlsx), London, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2008 for the first time, more renewable energy than conventional power capacity was added in both the European Union and United States, demonstrating a "fundamental transition" of the world's energy markets towards renewables, according to a report released by [[REN21]], a global renewable energy policy network based in Paris.&lt;ref name=Mart/&gt; In 2010, renewable power consisted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities.&lt;ref name="UNEP_GT_2011_Fig24"&gt;[http://www.fs-unep-centre.org/publications/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2011 UNEP, Bloomberg, Frankfurt School, Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101180801/http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2011 |date=1 November 2011 }}、Figure 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2011, total renewable power capacity worldwide exceeded 1,360 GW, up 8%. Renewables producing electricity accounted for almost half of the 208 GW of capacity added globally during 2011. Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) accounted for almost 40% and 30% .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf  Renewables 2012 Global status report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215215616/http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf |date=15 December 2012 }} Executive summary REN21&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title=Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate=4 September 2014 |year=2014 |pages=13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the five-years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall.&lt;ref&gt;http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/media/sefi2011finallowres.pdf pg25graph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;[[REN21]] (2010).

The combination of government target-setting, policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach." He added: "Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".&lt;ref name=invest2011/&gt;

According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power plants may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years, significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment. The IEA has said: "Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind, hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation". "Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity".&lt;ref name="ieaiea2011"/&gt;

In 2013, China led the world in [[renewable energy]] production, with a total capacity of 378 [[Gigawatt|GW]], mainly from [[hydroelectric]] and [[wind power]]. As of 2014, China leads the world in the production and use of wind power, [[solar power|solar photovoltaic power]] and [[smart grid]] technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and [[solar energy]] as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power]] capacity. Since 2005, production of [[solar cells]] in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.&lt;ref name=chinaen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/economics-manufacture-renewables-to-build-energy-security-1.15847 |title=Economics: Manufacture renewables to build energy security |author1=John A.

===Economic trends===
[[File:US projected cost of wind power.png|thumb|The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] projects that the levelized cost of wind power will decline about 25% from 2012 to 2030.&lt;ref name=review&gt;E. Lantz, M. Hand, and R. Wiser ( 13–17 May 2012) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54526.pdf "The Past and Future Cost of Wind Energy,"] National Renewable Energy Laboratory conference paper no. 6A20-54526, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2011 IEA report said: "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=23 November 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there have been substantial reductions in the cost of solar and wind technologies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}
The price of PV modules per MW has fallen by 60 percent since the summer of 2008, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries. Wind turbine prices have also fallen – by 18 percent per MW in the last two years – reflecting, as with solar, fierce competition in the supply chain. Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.&lt;ref name=invest2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/renewables-investment-breaks-records |title=Renewables Investment Breaks Records |date=29 August 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP) and some biomass technologies.&lt;ref name=irena111&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today".&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt; As of 2012, renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally. In 2011, additions included 41 [[gigawatt]] (GW) of new wind power capacity, 30 GW of PV, 25 GW of hydro-electricity, 6 GW of biomass, 0.5 GW of CSP, and 0.1 GW of geothermal power.&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt;

=== Three generations of technologies ===
Renewable energy includes a number of sources and technologies at different stages of commercialization. The [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) has defined three generations of renewable energy technologies, reaching back over 100&amp;nbsp;years:

*"''First-generation technologies'' emerged from the [[industrial revolution]] at the end of the 19th century and include [[hydropower]], [[biomass]] [[combustion]], [[geothermal power]] and heat. These technologies are quite widely used.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Second-generation technologies'' include [[solar heating]] and cooling, [[wind power]], modern forms of [[bioenergy]], and [[solar photovoltaics]]. These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by [[energy security]] concerns linked to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crises]] of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Third-generation technologies'' are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, concentrating [[solar thermal]] power, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. Advances in [[nanotechnology]] may also play a major role".&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt; First-generation technologies are well established, second-generation technologies are entering markets, and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long-term research and development commitments, where the public sector has a role to play.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;

== First-generation technologies ==
[[File:Biomasseheizwerk Spillern Nordansicht.jpg|thumb|rechts|Biomass heating plant in Austria. The total heat power is about 1000 kW.]]

First-generation technologies are widely used in locations with abundant resources. Their future use depends on the exploration of the remaining resource potential, particularly in developing countries, and on overcoming challenges related to the environment and social acceptance.

=== Biomass ===

[[Biomass]] for heat and power is a fully [[mature technology]] which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One of the problems of biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb| The 22,500 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[Three Gorges Dam]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], the largest hydroelectric power station in the world.]]
[[Hydroelectricity]] is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. [[Hydroelectric]] plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt;

=== Geothermal power and heat ===
[[File:West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|right|West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|One of many power plants at [[The Geysers]], a geothermal power field in northern California, with a total output of over 750&amp;nbsp;MW]]

[[Geothermal power]] plants can operate 24&amp;nbsp;hours per day, providing [[baseload]] capacity. Estimates for the world potential capacity for geothermal power generation vary widely, ranging from 40 GW by 2020 to as much as 6,000 GW.&lt;ref&gt;

In: O. Hohmeyer and T. Trittin (Eds.), IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources, Proceedings, Luebeck, Germany, 20–25 January 2008, p. 59-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geothermal power capacity grew from around 1 GW in 1975 to almost 10 GW in 2008.&lt;ref name="IPCC Geothermal 2008"/&gt; The United States is the world leader in terms of installed capacity, representing 3.1 GW. Other countries with significant installed capacity include the Philippines (1.9 GW), Indonesia (1.2 GW), Mexico (1.0 GW), Italy (0.8 GW), Iceland (0.6 GW), Japan (0.5 GW), and New Zealand (0.5 GW).&lt;ref name="IPCC Geothermal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, geothermal power accounts for a significant share of the total electricity supply, such as in the Philippines, where geothermal represented 17 percent of the total power mix at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

Leonora Walet. [https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5A43HC20091105 Philippines targets $2.5 billion geothermal development], ''Reuters'', 5 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geothermal (ground source) heat pumps represented an estimated 30 GWth of installed capacity at the end of 2008, with other direct uses of geothermal heat (i.e., for space heating, agricultural drying and other uses) reaching an estimated 15 GWth. {{As of|2008}}, at least 76 countries use direct geothermal energy in some form.&lt;ref name=renewables/&gt;

== Second-generation technologies ==

Second-generation technologies have gone from being a passion for the dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Japan. Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNEP2 /&gt;

=== Solar heating ===
[[File:Solar heater dsc00632.jpg|thumb|Solar energy technologies, such as [[solar water heater]]s, located on or near the buildings which they supply with energy, are a prime example of a [[soft energy technology]].]]
{{See also|Solar hot water}}

[[Solar heating]] systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of [[solar thermal collector]]s, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189–207, ISSN (Online) 1869–8778&lt;/ref&gt; The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency. [http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html Solar assisted air-conditioning of buildings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091415/http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |date=5 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many warmer climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (50 to 75%) of domestic hot water energy. {{As of|2009}}, China has 27 million rooftop solar water heaters.&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Brown. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization'', Earth Policy Institute, 2009, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photovoltaics ===

{{Main article|Photovoltaics|List of photovoltaic power stations}}
[[File:Solar-crop.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] speaks at the [[DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center]].]]

Photovoltaic (PV) cells, also called [[solar cell]]s, convert light into electricity. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules were used to provide [[remote-area power supply]], but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing [[building integrated photovoltaics]] and [[photovoltaic power station]]s for grid connected applications.

Many solar [[photovoltaic power station]]s have been built, mainly in Europe.&lt;ref name="PV"&gt;Denis Lenardic. [http://www.pvresources.com/en/top50pv.php Large-scale photovoltaic power plants ranking 1 – 50] ''PVresources.com'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2012, the largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world are the [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]] (USA, 247 MW)&lt;!--possibly AC--&gt;, [[Charanka Solar Park]] (India, 214 MW), [[Golmud Solar Park]] (China, 200 MW), [[Perovo Solar Park]] (Russia 100 MW), [[Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant]] (Canada, 97 MW), [[Brandenburg-Briest Solarpark]] (Germany 91 MW), [[Solarpark Finow Tower]] (Germany 84.7 MW), [[Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station]] (Italy, 84.2 MW), [[Eggebek Solar Park]] (Germany 83.6 MW), [[Senftenberg Solarpark]] (Germany 82 MW), [[Finsterwalde Solar Park]] (Germany, 80.7 MW), [[Okhotnykovo Solar Park]] (Russia, 80&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Lopburi Solar Farm]] (Thailand 73.16 MW), [[Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant]] (Italy, 72 MW), and the [[Lieberose Photovoltaic Park]] (Germany, 71.8&amp;nbsp;MW).&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt;

There are also many large plants under construction. The [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]] under construction in [[Riverside County, California]] and [[Topaz Solar Farm]] being built in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]] are both 550 [[megawatt|MW]] [[solar park]]s that will use thin-film solar [[photovoltaic]] modules made by [[First Solar]].&lt;ref name=rew11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects  |date= 30 September 2011 |work= Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blythe Solar Power Project]] is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in [[Riverside County, California]].

As of 2014, the wind industry in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/energy-environment/wind-industrys-new-technologies-are-helping-it-compete-on-price.html?_r=0 |title=Wind Industry's New Technologies Are Helping It Compete on Price |author=Diane Cardwell |date=20 March 2014 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar thermal power]] stations include the 354&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MW) [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] power plant in the USA, [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (Spain, 150&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Andasol solar power station]] (Spain, 100&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Nevada Solar One]] (USA, 64&amp;nbsp;MW), [[PS20 solar power tower]] (Spain, 20&amp;nbsp;MW), and the [[PS10 solar power tower]] (Spain, 11&amp;nbsp;MW). The 370 MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], located in California's [[Mojave Desert]], is the world's largest solar-thermal power plant project currently under construction.&lt;ref name=woody&gt;

=== Modern forms of bioenergy ===
{{See also|Biofuels|Sustainable biofuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left (A), gasoline on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in Brazil.]]

Global [[ethanol]] production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17&amp;nbsp;billion to more than 52&amp;nbsp;billion litres, while [[biodiesel]] expanded more than tenfold from less than 1&amp;nbsp;billion to almost 11&amp;nbsp;billion litres. Biofuels provide 1.8% of the world's transport fuel and recent estimates indicate a continued high growth. The main producing countries for transport biofuels are the USA, Brazil, and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme (2009). ''[http://www.unep.fr/scp/rpanel/pdf/Assessing_Biofuels_Full_Report.pdf Assessing Biofuels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122133933/http://www.unep.fr/scp/rpanel/pdf/Assessing_Biofuels_Full_Report.pdf |date=22 November 2009 }}'', p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brazil]] has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of [[ethanol fuel]] from [[sugar cane]], and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in liquid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:EthanolPetrol.jpg|right|thumb|Information on pump, California]]

Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10 percent ethanol, a mix known as E10,&lt;ref&gt;

Erica Gies. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/business/energy-environment/25iht-rbogeth.html?src=busln As Ethanol Booms, Critics Warn of Environmental Effect] ''The New York Times'', 24 June 2010.

&lt;/ref&gt; and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[DaimlerChrysler]], and [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] are among the automobile companies that sell [[flexible-fuel]] cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], which calls for {{convert|7.5|e9USgal|m3}} of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;Worldwatch Institute and Center for American Progress (2006). [http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/americanenergynow/AmericanEnergy.pdf ''American energy: The renewable path to energy security'' (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, "the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7&amp;nbsp;billion. It also contributed about $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels".&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

== Third-generation technologies ==

Third-generation renewable energy technologies are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. Third-generation technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research and development funding.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency, [[cellulosic ethanol]] biorefineries could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than organizations such as the IEA previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;

International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/weo2006.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' (PDF)].

&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as [[Corn stover|corn stalks]], wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and [[municipal solid waste]] are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as [[Panicum virgatum|switchgrass]], are also promising cellulose sources that can be [[Sustainable biofuel|sustainably produced]] in many regions.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007).

=== Ocean energy ===

[[Ocean energy]] is all forms of renewable energy derived from the sea including wave energy, tidal energy, river current, ocean current energy, offshore wind, salinity gradient energy and ocean thermal gradient energy.&lt;ref name=OE1&gt;[http://oceanenergy.epri.com/ ''Ocean energy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031162616/http://oceanenergy.epri.com/ |date=31 October 2012 }} EPRI Ocean Energy Web Page&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rance Tidal Power Station]] (240 MW) is the world's first [[tidal power|tidal]] power station. The facility is located on the estuary of the [[Rance River]], in [[Brittany]], France. Opened on 26 November 1966, it is currently operated by [[Électricité de France]], and is the largest tidal power station in the world, in terms of installed capacity.

First proposed more than thirty years ago, systems to harvest utility-scale electrical power from ocean waves have recently been gaining momentum as a viable technology. The potential for this technology is considered promising, especially on west-facing coasts with latitudes between 40 and 60 degrees:&lt;ref name=je&gt;Jeff Scruggs and Paul Jacob. Harvesting Ocean Wave Energy, ''Science'', Vol. 323, 27 February 2009, p. 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the United Kingdom, for example, the Carbon Trust recently estimated the extent of the economically viable offshore resource at 55 TWh per year, about 14% of current national demand. Across Europe, the technologically achievable resource has been estimated to be at least 280 TWh per year. In 2003, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated the viable resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year (6% of demand).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are currently nine projects, completed or in-development, off the coasts of the United Kingdom, United States, Spain and Australia to harness the rise and fall of waves by [[Ocean Power Technologies]]. The current maximum power output is 1.5 MW ([[Reedsport, Oregon]]), with development underway for 100 MW ([[Coos Bay, Oregon]]).&lt;ref name=OPT&gt;[http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/projects.html ''Projects''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401203800/http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/projects.html |date=1 April 2012 }} Ocean Power Technologies Projects&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhanced geothermal systems ===

{{As of|2008}}, geothermal power development was under way in more than 40 countries, partially attributable to the development of new technologies, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems.&lt;ref name=renewables&gt;[[REN21]] (2009). [http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report: 2009 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612132038/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf |date=12 June 2009 }} pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[binary cycle power plant]]s and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable [[enhanced geothermal systems]] over a much greater geographical range than "traditional" Geothermal systems. Demonstration EGS projects are operational in the USA, Australia, Germany, France, and The United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Advanced solar concepts ===
Beyond the already established [[solar photovoltaics]] and solar thermal power technologies are such advanced solar concepts as the solar updraft tower or space-based solar power. These concepts have yet to (if ever) be commercialized.  
{{See also|Solar updraft tower}}
The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a [[Renewable energy|renewable-energy]] [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]]. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.

A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the [[Vortex engine]] (AVE) which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.
{{See also|Space-based solar power}}
'''Space-based solar power''' ('''SBSP''') is the concept of collecting [[solar power]] in [[Outer space|space]] (using an "SPS", that is, a "solar-power satellite" or a "satellite power system") for use on [[Earth]]. It has been in research since the early 1970s. SBSP would differ from current [[Sun|solar]] collection methods in that the means used to collect [[energy]] would reside on an [[orbit]]ing [[satellite]] instead of on Earth's surface. Some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing [[atmosphere]] and night [[time]] in [[space]].

The PV industry has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of [[grid parity]] for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.&lt;ref name=reconsidering&gt;{{cite web |url= http://az2112.com/assets/energy-bnef_re_considering_the_economics_of_photovoltaic_power_a_co_authored_white.pdf |title= Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power |author1=M Bazilian |author2=I Onyeji |author3=M Liebreich |author4=I MacGill |author5=J Chase |author6=J Shah |author7=D Gielen... |date=  2013 |work=Renewable Energy (53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-technical barriers to acceptance ==
Many energy markets, institutions, and policies have been developed to support the production and use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=jacob2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part II: Reliability, System and Transmission Costs, and Policies |author=Delucchi, Mark A. and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]]  |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits, but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big, conventional power plants.&lt;ref name=epsov/&gt; Consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption. Intentional market distortions (such as subsidies), and unintentional market distortions (such as split incentives) may work against renewables.&lt;ref name=epsov&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. "Rejecting Renewables: The Socio-technical Impediments to Renewable Electricity in the United States," ''Energy Policy'', 37(11) (November 2009), p. 4500.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] has argued that "some of the most surreptitious, yet powerful, impediments facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States are more about ''culture'' and ''institutions'' than engineering and science".&lt;ref&gt;
Benjamin K. Sovacool. "The Cultural Barriers to Renewable Energy in the United States," ''Technology in Society'', 31(4) (November 2009), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstacles to the widespread commercialization of renewable energy technologies are primarily political, not technical,&lt;ref&gt;
Mark Z. Jacobson and Mark A. Delucchi. A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030, ''Scientific American'', November 2009, p. 45.
&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been many studies which have identified a range of "non-technical barriers" to renewable energy use.&lt;ref name=ieapress/&gt;&lt;ref name="NREL"&gt;[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (2006). ''Nontechnical Barriers to Solar Energy Use: Review of Recent Literature'', Technical Report, NREL/TP-520-40116, September, 30 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GREMS&gt;
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, (2005). [http://www.ppre.uni-oldenburg.de/download/Downloads/Global_RE-Report-2005.pdf Increasing Global Renewable Energy Market Share: Recent Trends and Perspectives] Final Report.&lt;/ref&gt; These barriers are impediments which put renewable energy at a marketing, institutional, or policy disadvantage relative to other forms of energy. Key barriers include:&lt;ref name="NREL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GREMS /&gt;

* Difficulty overcoming established energy systems, which includes difficulty introducing innovative energy systems, particularly for [[distributed generation]] such as photovoltaics, because of technological lock-in, electricity markets designed for centralized power plants, and market control by established operators. As the [[Stern Review|Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]] points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"National grids are usually tailored towards the operation of centralised power plants and thus favour their performance. Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market, even if the technology itself is commercially viable. This applies to distributed generation as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from many small sources. Large-scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids."&lt;ref name=Stern2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Lack of government policy support, which includes the lack of policies and regulations supporting deployment of renewable energy technologies and the presence of policies and regulations hindering renewable energy development and supporting conventional energy development. Examples include [[fossil fuel subsidies|subsidies for fossil-fuels]], insufficient consumer-based [[renewable energy incentives]], government underwriting for nuclear plant accidents, and complex zoning and permitting processes for renewable energy.
* Lack of information dissemination and consumer awareness.
* Higher capital cost of renewable energy technologies compared with conventional energy technologies.
* Inadequate financing options for renewable energy projects, including insufficient access to affordable financing for project developers, entrepreneurs and consumers.
* Imperfect capital markets, which includes failure to internalize all costs of conventional energy (e.g., effects of air pollution, risk of supply disruption)&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald.
[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/science/earth/20fossil.html Fossil Fuels’ Hidden Cost Is in Billions, Study Says] ''The New York Times'', 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and failure to internalize all benefits of renewable energy (e.g., cleaner air, energy security).
* Inadequate workforce skills and training, which includes lack of adequate scientific, technical, and manufacturing skills required for renewable energy production; lack of reliable installation, maintenance, and inspection services; and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies.
* Lack of adequate codes, standards, utility interconnection, and net-metering guidelines.
* Poor public perception of renewable energy system aesthetics.
* Lack of stakeholder/community participation and co-operation in energy choices and renewable energy projects.

With such a wide range of non-technical barriers, there is no "silver bullet" solution to drive the transition to renewable energy. So ideally there is a need for several different types of policy instruments to complement each other and overcome different types of barriers.&lt;ref name=GREMS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy framework must be created that will level the playing field and redress the imbalance of traditional approaches associated with fossil fuels. The policy landscape must keep pace with broad trends within the energy sector, as well as reflecting specific social, economic and environmental priorities.&lt;ref&gt;IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some resource-rich countries struggle to move away from fossil fuels and have failed thus far to adopt regulatory frameworks necessary for developing renewable energy (e.g. Russia).&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland, ‘The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?’, Sibirica Journal of Siberian Studies, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 1-20. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public policy landscape ==
Public policy has a role to play in renewable energy commercialization because the free market system has some fundamental limitations. As the [[Stern Review]] points out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a liberalised energy market, investors, operators and consumers should face the full cost of their decisions. But this is not the case in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.&lt;ref name=Stern2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[International Solar Energy Society]] has stated that "historical incentives for the conventional energy resources continue even today to bias markets by burying many of the real societal costs of their use".&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil-fuel energy systems have different production, transmission, and end-use costs and characteristics than do renewable energy systems, and new promotional policies are needed to ensure that renewable systems develop as quickly and broadly as is socially desirable.&lt;ref name=jacob2010/&gt;

[[Lester Brown]] states that the market "does not incorporate the indirect costs of providing goods or services into prices, it does not value nature's services adequately, and it does not respect the sustainable-yield thresholds of natural systems".&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt; It also favors the near term over the long term, thereby showing limited concern for future generations.&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;

=== Shifting taxes ===
Tax shifting has been widely discussed and endorsed by economists. It involves lowering income taxes while raising levies on environmentally destructive activities, in order to create a more responsive market. For example, a tax on coal that included the increased health care costs associated with breathing polluted air, the costs of acid rain damage, and the costs of climate disruption would encourage investment in renewable technologies. Several Western European countries are already shifting taxes in a process known there as environmental tax reform.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In 2001, Sweden launched a new 10-year environmental tax shift designed to convert 30&amp;nbsp;billion kroner ($3.9&amp;nbsp;billion) of income taxes to taxes on environmentally destructive activities. Other European countries with significant tax reform efforts are France, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Asia's two leading economies, Japan and China, are considering carbon taxes.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

=== Shifting subsidies ===
{{See also|Energy subsidies}}
Just as there is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an inherently bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30&amp;nbsp;years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded.&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Lester Brown has argued that "a world facing the prospect of economically disruptive climate change can no longer justify subsidies to expand the burning of coal and oil. Shifting these subsidies to the development of climate-benign energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power is the key to stabilizing the earth's climate."&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The International Solar Energy Society advocates "leveling the playing field" by redressing the continuing inequities in public subsidies of energy technologies and R&amp;D, in which the fossil fuel and nuclear power receive the largest share of financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries are eliminating or reducing climate-disrupting subsidies and Belgium, France, and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany is reducing its coal subsidy. The subsidy dropped from $5.4&amp;nbsp;billion in 1989 to $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion in 2002, and in the process Germany lowered its coal use by 46&amp;nbsp;percent. China cut its coal subsidy from $750&amp;nbsp;million in 1993 to $240&amp;nbsp;million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax.&lt;ref name="Brown"  /&gt; However, the United States has been increasing its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries.&lt;ref name="Brown"  /&gt;

In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''[[Deploying Renewables 2011]]'' said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt;

A fair and efficient imposition of subsidies for renewable energies and aiming at sustainable development, however, require coordination and regulation at a global level, as subsidies granted in one country can easily disrupt industries and policies of others, thus underlining the relevance of this issue at the World Trade Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|accessdate=}} and {{cite journal|title=WTO and Renewable Energy: Lessons from the Case Law|journal=49 JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE 6, Kluwer Law International|ssrn=2704453|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable energy targets ===
Setting national renewable energy targets can be an important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined as a percentage of the primary energy and/or electricity generation mix. For example, the [[European Union]] has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of 12 per cent of the total EU [[energy mix]] and 22 per cent of electricity consumption by 2010. National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target. Other developed countries with defined national or regional targets include Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, and some US States.&lt;ref name=UNEP3&gt;United Nations Environment Program (2006).  [http://www.ren21.net/pdf/REN21CC%20rapport.pdf ''Changing climates: The Role of Renewable Energy in a Carbon-constrained World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055332/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/REN21CC%20rapport.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }} pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

National targets are also an important component of renewable energy strategies in some [[developing countries]]. Developing countries with renewable energy targets include China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, Egypt, Mali, and South Africa. The targets set by many developing countries are quite modest when compared with those in some industrialized countries.&lt;ref name=UNEP3 /&gt;

Renewable energy targets in most countries are indicative and nonbinding but they have assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks. The United Nations Environment Program has suggested that making renewable energy targets legally binding could be an important policy tool to achieve higher renewable energy market penetration.&lt;ref name=UNEP3 /&gt;

===Levelling the playing field===
The IEA has identified three actions which will allow renewable energy and other clean energy technologies to "more effectively compete for private sector capital".
*"First, energy prices must appropriately reflect the "true cost" of energy (e.g. through carbon pricing) so that the positive and negative impacts of energy production and consumption are fully taken into account". Example: [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station|New UK nuclear plants]] cost £92.50/MWh,&lt;ref name=bbcstrike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24604218|title=UK nuclear power plant gets go-ahead|date=21 October 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telestrike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10392510/Hinkley-Point-good-for-Britain-says-Ed-Davey.html|title=Hinkley Point nuclear power plant to create 25,000 jobs, says Cameron|date=21 October 2013|author1=Roland Gribben  |author2=Denise Roland |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher= Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas offshore wind farms in the UK are supported with €74.2/MWh&lt;ref&gt;Erin Gill.

Accessed: 22 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Second, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies must be removed, while ensuring that all citizens have access to affordable energy".
*"Third, governments must develop policy frameworks that encourage private sector investment in lower-carbon energy options".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/IEA%20Tracking%20Clean%20Energy%20Progress%20report%202012.pdf |title=Tracking Clean Energy Progress |author=IEA |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green stimulus programs ===
In response to the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global financial crisis in the late 2000s]], the world's major governments made "green stimulus" programs one of their main policy instruments for supporting economic recovery. Some {{US$|188 billion}} in green stimulus funding had been allocated to renewable energy and energy efficiency, to be spent mainly in 2010 and in 2011.&lt;ref name=ren27&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=20 August 2010 }} p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy sector regulation===
Public policy determines the extent to which renewable energy (RE) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country's generation mix. Energy sector regulators implement that policy—thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid. Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects. Such functions include issuing licenses, setting performance standards, monitoring the performance of regulated firms, determining the price level and structure of tariffs, establishing uniform systems of accounts, arbitrating stakeholder disputes (like interconnection cost allocations), performing management audits, developing agency human resources (expertise), reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities, and coordinating decisions with other government agencies. Thus, regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments. In addition, the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies. Since policies are not self-implementing, energy sector regulators become a key facilitator (or blocker) of renewable energy investments.&lt;ref name="PURC"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation, [http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has made significant progress on its GHG emissions reduction target, achieving a 27% decrease between 1990 and 2014.

These initiatives go well beyond [[European Union]] legislation and the national policies of other European states. The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germany's share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 22.9% in 2012, surpassing the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"&gt;

Producers have been guaranteed a fixed [[feed-in tariff]] for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits. The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market. However, in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low [[Return on investment|returns]], and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality.&lt;ref name="latsch-etal-2014"&gt;

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"/&gt; The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills.

== Voluntary market mechanisms for renewable electricity ==
Voluntary markets, also referred to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/markets.htm |title= Voluntary and mandatory markets |date= 25 March 2013|work= |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving factors behind voluntary green electricity within the EU are the liberalized electricity markets and the RES Directive. According to the directive, the EU Member States must ensure that the origin of electricity produced from renewables can be guaranteed and therefore a "guarantee of origin" must be issued (article 15). Environmental organisations are using the voluntary market to create new renewables and improving sustainability of the existing power production. In the US the main tool to track and stimulate voluntary actions is Green-e program managed by [[Center for Resource Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.green-e.org/about.shtml |title= About Green-e |year= 2013|work= |publisher= Center for Resource Solutions |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the main voluntary tool used by the NGOs to promote sustainable electricity production is [[EKOenergy]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ekoenergy.org/where-can-i-buy-it/questions-and-answers |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130704002836/http://www.ekoenergy.org/where-can-i-buy-it/questions-and-answers |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2013-07-04 |title= Frequently asked questions |date= March 2013 |work=  |publisher= EKOenergy Network |accessdate= 18 April 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of events in 2006 pushed renewable energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed [[clean energy]] as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt; made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme and New Energy Finance Ltd.

In his 24 January 2012, [[State of the Union]] address, President Barack Obama restated his commitment to renewable energy. Obama said that he "will not walk away from the promise of clean energy." Obama called for a commitment by the Defense Department to purchase 1,000 MW of renewable energy. He also mentioned the long-standing Interior Department commitment to permit 10,000 MW of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012.&lt;ref name="Lindsay Morris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2012/01/obama-sticking-to-promise-of-clean-energy |title=Obama: Sticking to "Promise of Clean Energy" |author=Lindsay Morris |date=25 January 2012 |work=Renewable Energy World }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, renewable energy plays a major role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for renewable energy technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.&lt;ref&gt;REN21. (2013).

The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella, the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, and Charles Holliday, chairman of Bank of America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy |title=UN calls for universal access to renewable energy |author=Mark Tran |date=2 November 2011 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide use of solar power and wind power continued to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh).

==100% renewable energy==
{{Main article|100% renewable energy}}

The incentive to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by [[global warming]] and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of the total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111081913/http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere and Energy Program says producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]], and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name=enpol2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A.

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments  |author=National Research Council| year=2010|pages=4|publisher=National Academies of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |title=Post Carbon Pathways |author=John Wiseman |date=April 2013 |work=University of Melbourne |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620031627/http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
{{Main article|Efficient energy use}}

Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;

InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074454/http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency. Renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] are said to be the "twin pillars" of [[sustainable energy]] policy. [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:&lt;ref name=am&gt;

American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007).
[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429195906/http://www.aceee.org/store/proddetail.cfm?CFID=785209&amp;CFTOKEN=22090724&amp;ItemID=432&amp;CategoryID=7 ''The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy''] Report E074.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Revisionist school of Islamic studies''', (also '''Historical-Critical school of Islamic studies''') is a movement within Islamic studies which started in the 1970s and initiated a [[paradigm shift]] in Islamic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, edited by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main thesis and the concept of Revisionism ==

The core concern of the Revisionist School is to finally show consequence concerning the knowledge, practically available since [[Ignác Goldziher]]'s time, that the traditional Islamic accounts about [[Islam]]'s early times - written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad - are highly questionable as historical sources. This relates to [[Muhammad]]'s biography, the formation history of the [[Quran]], and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed by applying the [[historical criticism|historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation ''Revisionism'' was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a dismissive undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010. Judith Herrin, [https://www.opendemocracy.net/judith-herrin/patricia-crone-brief-memoir Patricia Crone: memoir of a superb Islamic Scholar], openDemocracy 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Today, also the adherents of the new movement use ''Revisionism'' to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Patricia Crone: [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/42023/among-the-believers Among the Believers], Tablet Magazine 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The major representatives ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The new movement originated at the [[SOAS, University of London]] by two publications of [[John Wansbrough]]: ''Quranic Studies'' (1977) and ''The Sectarian Milieu'' (1978). Among the students of Wansbrough are: [[Andrew Rippin]], [[Norman Calder]], [[G. R. Hawting]], [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]. With their work ''Hagarism'' (1977) Patricia Crone and Michael Cook set a milestone in Islamic Studies, since by provocative theses they provided maximal attention in the academic community. Later, both distanced themselves from their too far reaching theses in ''[[Hagarism]]''. Yet they adhered to the basically new academic approach. [[Martin Hinds]], too, studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. [[Robert G. Hoyland]] is a student of Patricia Crone.

A second local focus of the new movement is at the [[Saarland University]] in [[Saarbrücken]], Germany ({{ill|Saarbrücker Schule|de}}). Since the 1970s there is a focus on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran, by [[Günter Lüling]] und [[Gerd R. Puin|Gerd-Rüdiger Puin]]. Also in Saarbrücken, [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]] developed in the 2000s together with [[Volker Popp]], [[Christoph Luxenberg]] and [[Markus Groß]] a theory of Islam's earliest times which has no need for Muhammad as a historical person.

Further representatives are: [[Hans Jansen]] from the Netherlands who in 2005/7 published a work showing in detail why the known accounts of Muhammad's life are legends only. [[Yehuda D. Nevo]] published in 2003 his work ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' in which he denies the historicity of Muhammad. [[James A. Bellamy]] is known for his textual criticism of the Quran and for his proposals of emendations, i.e. proposals to correct the traditional text of the Quran. [[Fred Donner]] published in 2010 the first well-founded hypothesis on the early time of Islam without excessive exaggerations which found public attention.

[[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] studied history and became a renowned author of popular science publications on ancient history. With his work ''[[In the Shadow of the Sword (book)|In the Shadow of the Sword]]'' (2012) Tom Holland contributed heavily to the popularization of the new research results. Tom Holland depicts a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches, thus having like Fred Donner provided a well-founded hypothesis of Islam's early times which avoids exaggerations.

[[Sven Kalisch]] is a German Islamic theologian who rejected teaching Islamic theology without considering the new results of historical-critical research. Thereupon the German Islamic associations withdrew his allowance to teach future Islamic theologians and teachers. Later Kalisch left Islam. Today he is teaching the history of ideas in the Near East in Late Antiquity in [[Münster]].

== The thesis of the incredibility of the traditional Islamic accounts ==
The arguments against the credibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. [[Hans Jansen]] in his work ''De Historische Mohammed''. Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by [[Ibn Ishaq]] resp. [[Ibn Hisham]] which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.

Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jansen, ''De Historische Mohammed'', 2005/7&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although there were [[leap month]]s at the time of Muhammad which had to be intercalated frequently into the moon calendar and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq is in a leap month.
* The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later is not very credible.
* The depiction of a strong relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha is motivated politically resp. theologically: [[Aisha]] was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, [[Ali]]. In order to legitimate this succession against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that the prophet consummated marriage with Aisha allegedly at an astonishingly early age. 
* The depiction of slaughtering the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qurayza]] is motivated politically resp. theologically: As the "[[Constitution of Medina|treaty of Medina]]" shows, the Jews were initially part of the [[Umma]] and were addressed as "believers"; cf. the research of Prof. [[Fred Donner]]. When Islam later separated from Judaism, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished but not each single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the "treaty of Medina". Finally, such an mass slaughtering would not have gone unnoticed, even not in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews: Jews used to live in international trading networks, and Jews are known to write down their history. Most likely, the slaughtering of the Banu Quraiza never happened.
* The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to boldly exaggerate the capacities of the prophet. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad always kills more enemies than according to other traditions. Even the depiction of he prophet's male potency (who allegedly could satisfy all his wives in one night) is exaggerated in a questionable way. Of the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as an illiterate person. The [[revelation]] of the [[Quran]]ic text is all the more miraculous and the capacity of the prophet is all the more astonishing if Muhammad was an illiterate person.
* The account of [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State]] including the emperor of Byzantium, that they should convert to Islam, retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion.

Jansen points out that the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation of the Quran. The Quran mostly does not reveal the situation for which a revelation was made. The historical context is merely indicated, at best. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.

In her work ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' Patricia Crone gave a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This examination is much cited in literature yet discusses only a few aspects of Muhammad's biography meant to be exemplary for the nature of all the Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: ''""These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there ''was'' an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities."''&lt;ref name="crone-encounter"&gt;Patricia Crone: Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, 1987, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

== The new theses about the true beginnings of Islam ==
Starting point for all researchers is the awareness that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:

* The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later resp. were reworked later. In addition to that many small deviations came into the text as usual with ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.&lt;ref&gt;John Wansbrough: ''Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation'' (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd-Rüdiger Puin: ''Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San’a’'', in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur’an as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence and meaning of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially with the question whether any and how many parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or, whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time. The researchers' opinions differ in this question.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003); Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Donner suggests an early date for the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'' (1998), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Quran is not written in a "pure" Arabic yet the syriac Aramaic language seems to have a certain influence on the language of the Quran which was forgotten later. This could be a possible explanation why a fifth of the Quranic text is difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 377 ff.; Christoph Luxenberg: ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran – A Contribution to the Decoding of the Koran'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Islam did not rise among polytheistic pagans in the desert, yet in a milieu where Jewish and Christian texts were well-known. The "infidels" were no pagan polytheists yet monotheists who were considered to deviate slightly from monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Hawting: ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Rise of Islam: From Polemic to History'' (1999); Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* The geographical descriptions in the Quran and later traditions do not fit to Mecca. They rather point to  a place somewhere in north-western Arabia, e.g. to Petra in Jordania.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) pp. 22-24; Patricia Crone: ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' (1987); and the private researcher Dan Gibson: ''Quranic Geography'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The connection of Muslims and Jews was very close in the early times of Islam. Also Jews were called "believers" and were part of the umma. Antisemitic texts as e.g. the slaughtering of the Jewish tribe of the Banu Qurayza came into being long after Muhammad when Islam separated from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) pp. 68 ff.; cf. also Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7) pp. 311-317 (German edition 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the beginning, secular and spiritual power were united in the person of the caliph. There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: ''God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Islamic expansion probably was no Islamic, religiously motivated expansion, yet a secular, Arabic expansion. The expansion did not yet result in an oppression of the non-Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Hoyland: ''In God's Path. The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Muhammad there were at least two phases which were of major importance for the formation of Islam in its later shape:
** Under the Umayyad caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was built. There the word "Islam" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply "believers", and coins ware minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003) pp. 410-413; Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 336 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
** During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest to legitimize their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone: ''Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity'' (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: ''Mohammed'' (2005/7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Revisionism ==

The consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book ''Hagarism'' (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.
&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism is expressed by researchers like [[Tilman Nagel]], who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/islamwissenschaft-befreit-den-propheten-aus-seiner-religioesen-umklammerung-1464313.html Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religiösen Umklammerung!] in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
A certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to "revisionism" alone but to "extreme revisionism" or "ultra-revisionism".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: [https://books.google.de/books?id=xI_7uosa4FMC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=EMLqEHO3nI&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity] (2012), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregor Schoeler]] discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: "To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schoeler, ''Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen Überlieferung über das Leben Mohammeds'', de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: "dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance comes partly from older academics who still live in their thoughts in the world of the Islamic legends.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/rezensionen/rezension-tilman-nagel-eine-sackgasse-ohlig/ Review of: Mohammed. Leben und Legende, by Tilman Nagel], in:  imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] in his famous work [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962) described, a new paradigm prevails in academia often not by convincing current academics but by convincing the next generation of academics.

Continuous resistance against the new paradigm comes from researchers who fundamentally reject the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. They argue that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too. Adherents of Revisionism doubt whether this still is a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam ==
{{POV check|section|date=October 2016}}
The [[relationship between religion and science]] had always been shaped by conflicts...{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} It is always a hurting process for every religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself;{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious [[reform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion (2010) pp. 292 f. - Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;

By nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/wissenschaftliches-arbeiten-in-der-islamwissenschaft/ Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft], in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):
* As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[Patricia Crone]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], [[Fred Donner]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[Günter Lüling]].
* As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question.

Besides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:&lt;ref&gt;Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44.

* Traditional texts which had shaped Islam for centuries - yet ''not'' from the beginning - are not true.
* The Quranic text has not been handed down to our times unchanged.
* Even in the Quran, God's word is in many respects clothed in human words.
* Muhammad did not live in Mecca.
* The relationship between Muhammad and Jews and Christians was different than always thought it had been.

==Revisionism by non-specialists==
[[Ibn Warraq]], an author known for his criticism of Islam, has complied several revisionist essays in his book, ''[[The Quest for the Historical Muhammad (Ibn Warraq)|The Quest for the Historical Muhammad]].'' [[Fred Donner]], reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough school of revisionism, the author presents a "one-sided selection" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The results is "a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader."&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-middle-east-studies/article/the-quest-for-the-historical-muhammad-edited-and-translated-by-warraqibn-554-pages-glossary-list-of-tribes-and-individuals-chronology-amherst-ny-prometheus-books-2000-3495-cloth-isbn-1-57392-787-2/4C3D7FD138EF645D933ADDB0BCB33D6B Review of: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, by Ibn Warraq],  Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, 35(1), pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], in this book ''Did Muhammad Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam's Obscure Origins,'' advances the thesis that Islam was a state-religion created by the [[Abbasids]] to justify the empire.

'''Sports science''' (also '''sports and exercise science''', '''sports medicine''') is a discipline that studies how the healthy human body works during exercise, and how sport and physical activity promote health and performance from cellular to whole body perspectives. The study of sports science traditionally incorporates areas of [[physiology]] ([[exercise physiology]]), [[psychology]] ([[sport psychology]]), [[anatomy]], [[biomechanics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[kinesiology|biokinetics]]. Sports scientists and performance consultants are growing in demand and employment numbers, with the ever-increasing focus within the sporting world on achieving the best results possible. Through the study of science and sport, researchers have developed a greater understanding on how the human body reacts to exercise, training, different environments and many other stimuli.

== Origins of exercise physiology ==
{{main article|Exercise physiology}}
{{references|section|date=July 2018}}

Sports science can trace its origins to ancient Greece. The noted ancient Greek physician [[Galen]] (131–201) wrote 87 detailed essays about improving health (proper nutrition), aerobic fitness, and strengthening muscles.

New ideas upon the working and functioning of the human body emerged during the renaissance as anatomists and physicians challenged the previously known theories. These spread with the implementation of the printed word, the result of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s printing press in the 15th century. Allied with this was a large increase in academia in general, universities were forming all around the world. Importantly these new scholars went beyond the simplistic notions of the early Greek physicians, and shed light upon the complexities of the circulatory, and digestive systems. Furthermore, by the middle of the 19th century early medical schools (such as the [[Harvard Medical School]], formed 1782) began appearing in the United States, whose graduates went on to assume positions of importance in academia and allied medical research.

Medical journal publications increased significantly in number during this period. In 1898, three articles on physical activity appeared in the first volume of the '' American Journal of Physiology''. Other articles and reviews subsequently appeared in prestigious journals. The German applied physiology publication, '' Internationale Zeitschrift fur Physiologie einschliesslich Arbeitphysiologie '' (1929–1940; now known as the European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology), became a significant journal in the field of research.

A number of key figures have made significant contributions to the di
* [[Austin Flint, 2nd|Austin Flint, Jr]]., (1836–1915) One of the first American pioneer physicians, studied physiological responses to exercise in his influential medical textbooks.
* [[Edward Hitchcock, Jr.]], (1828–1911) Amherst College Professor of Hygiene and Physical Education, devoted his academic career to the scientific study of physical exercise, training and the body. Coauthored 1860 text on exercise physiology.
* George Wells Fitz, M.D. (1860–1934) Created the first departmental major in Anatomy, Physiology, and Physical Training at Harvard University in 1891.
* [[August Krogh]] (1874–1949) Won the 1920 Nobel prize in physiology for discovering the mechanism that controlled capillary blood flow in resting or active muscle.
* [[Per-Olof Åstrand]] (1922–2015) Professor at the Department of Physiology, [[Karolinska Institute]], Stockholm. Wrote a seminal paper which evaluated the physical working capacity of men and women aged 4–33 years.

== Study of sports science ==
Higher-education degrees in Sports Science or Human Physiology are also becoming increasingly popular with many universities now offering both undergraduate, postgraduate and distance learning degrees in the discipline. Opportunities for graduates in these fields employment as a [[Physical Education|Physical Education teacher]], [[Dietician]] or [[Nutritionist]], Performance Analyst, Sports coach, Sports therapist, Fitness centre manager, Sports administrator, Strength and Conditioning specialist or retail manager of a Sports store. Graduates may also be well positioned to undertake further training to become an accredited Physiotherapist, Exercise Physiologist, Research Scientist and Sports Medical Doctor.

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
{{other uses2|Steady state}}

A '''steady-state economy''' is an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size. In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time. The term usually refers to the [[economy|national economy]] of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the [[world economy|entire world]]. Early in the [[history of economic thought]], [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] of the 18th century developed the concept of a ''stationary state'' of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of [[wikt:stationarity|stationarity]].

Since the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]].&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xi-xvi}} As Daly's concept of a ''steady-state'' includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a ''stationary state''. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|135f}}&lt;ref name=hd04/&gt;{{rp|55f}}

The world's [[Ecological footprint|mounting ecological problems]] have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that [[Sustainability#Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth|resource decoupling]], [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development]], and the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|unrestrained operation of market mechanisms]] are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or population overshoot. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken — and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|148–155}}

A steady-state economy is not to be confused with [[economic stagnation]]: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a [[Economic growth|growth economy]].

An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a [[post-scarcity economy]].

== Definition and vision ==
Herman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of [[natural resource]]s through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the ''stationary state'', originally used in [[classical economics]]; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new [[Ecology|ecological feature]], presently also used in the academic discipline of [[ecological economics]]. The ''durability'' of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy — something desirable by itself — maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}

Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady-state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream neoclassical economics]], where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

In the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|549}} &lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|84}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|83}}

== Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth ==
{{See also |Planetary boundaries |Anthropocene |List of environmental issues |Societal collapse }}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright| Like any other planet, earth is finite]]

The world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Since the 1990s, most metrics have provided evidence that the volume of the [[world economy]] far exceeds critical global limits to [[economic growth]] already.&lt;ref name=dm01/&gt; According to the [[Ecological footprint#Footprint measurements|ecological footprint measure]], earth's [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] — that is, earth's long-term capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — was exceeded by some 30 percent in 1995. By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent.&lt;ref name=gfn01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jw01/&gt; In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse]] in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] be named the ''[[anthropocene]]''.&lt;ref name=welanth/&gt; The following issues have raised much concern worldwide:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Overpopulation
World population is [[Human overpopulation #Overview|expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050]], and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing [[World population #Environmental impacts|natural environments]] and [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested [[shanty town]]s, and large cities swell to become [[Megacity|megacities]] with [[Megacity#Crime|high crime]] [[Megacity#Slums|slum areas]]. Overpopulation may even lead to [[War#Youth bulge|social conflict and violence]], when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economies]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Pollution and global warming
Air pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is [[Pollution#Human health|damaging public health]] and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere is the apparent source of [[global warming]] and climate changes. [[Regional effects of global warming|Extreme regional weather patterns]] and [[Sea level rise#Effects|rising sea levels]] caused by warming degrade living conditions in many — if not all — parts of the world. The warming already poses a [[Climate security#General|security threat]] to many nations and works as a so-called [[Effects of global warming on humans#Security|'threat multiplier']] to geo-political stability. Even worse, the [[Arctic methane emissions#Loss of permafrost|loss of Arctic permafrost]] may be triggering a [[Permafrost #Predicted rate of change in the Arctic|massive release of methane and other greenhouse gases from thawing soils]] in the region, thereby overwhelming political action to counter climate change. If critical temperature thresholds are crossed, a so-called [[Climate state #Hothouse|'Hothouse climate state']] may be the end result in the future.

;Depletion of non-renewable minerals
Non-renewable [[Mineral resource classification|mineral reserves]] are currently extracted at high and [[Sustainable development#Insubstantial stretching of the term|unsustainable rates]] from [[Structure of the Earth#Crust|earth's crust]]. Remaining reserves are likely to [[Peak minerals#Future production|become ever more costly to extract in the near future]], and will reach depletion at some point. The era of relatively peaceful economic expansion that has prevailed globally since World War II may be interrupted by unexpected [[supply shock]]s or simply be succeeded by the [[Hubbert peak theory#Hubbert peaks|peaking depletion paths]] of [[Peak oil|oil]] and [[Critical mineral raw materials|other valuable minerals]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Net depletion of renewable resources
Use of [[Natural resource#Classification|renewable]] resources in excess of their replenishment rates is undermining [[ecological stability]] worldwide. Between 2000 and 2012, [[deforestation]] resulted in some 14 percent of the equivalent of earth's original forest cover to be cut down. Tropical rainforests have been subject to [[Rainforest#Deforestation|deforestation]] at a rapid pace for decades — especially in [[Deforestation by region#Africa|west and central Africa]] and in [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|Brazil]] — mostly due to [[Deforestation#Causes|subsistence farming, population pressure, and urbanization]]. Population pressures also strain the [[Soil retrogression and degradation#Consequences of soil regression and degradation|world's soil systems]], leading to land degradation, mostly in developing countries. Global erosion rates on conventional cropland are estimated to [[Human impact on the environment#Agricultural land loss and soil erosion|exceed soil creation rates]] by more than ten times. Widespread overuse of [[groundwater]] results in [[Water scarcity#Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts|water deficits]] in many countries. By 2025, [[Water security#Fresh water|water scarcity]] could impact the living conditions of two-thirds of the world's population.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Loss of biodiversity
The destructive impact of human activity on [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] worldwide is accelerating the [[Anthropocene#Biodiversity|extinction of rare species]], thereby substantially reducing [[Biodiversity#Species loss rates|earth's biodiversity]]. The [[Nitrogen cycle|natural nitrogen cycle]] is heavily overloaded by [[Nitrogen fixation#Industrial nitrogen fixation|industrial nitrogen fixation and use]], thereby [[Human impact on the nitrogen cycle#Impacts of anthropogenic inputs on the nitrogen cycle|disrupting most known types of ecosystems]]. The [[Marine pollution#Plastic debris|accumulating plastic debris]] in the oceans decimates aquatic life.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These mounting concerns have prompted an increasing number of academics and other writers to point to limits to [[economic growth]], and to question — and even oppose — the prevailing ideology of infinite economic growth.&lt;ref name=dm01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jd02/&gt;&lt;ref name=rh01/&gt;&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg03/&gt;&lt;ref name=pe01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bm01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pg01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rf01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ub02/&gt;&lt;ref name=nk01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ek01/&gt;&lt;ref name=hs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=av01/&gt;&lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pr01/&gt;&lt;ref name=wr01/&gt;&lt;ref name=do03/&gt;

== Historical background ==
For centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early [[Classical economics|classical economists]] in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an independent academic subdiscipline in [[economics]].

=== Concept of the stationary state in classical economics ===
{{Main|Classical economics}}
{{See also|Tendency of the rate of profit to fall}}
From [[Adam Smith]] and onwards, economists in the [[classical economics|classical period of economic theorising]] described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil]]. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|3}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|295}}

==== Adam Smith's concept ====
{{Main|Adam Smith}}
{{See also|Invisible hand}}
{{Further|The Wealth of Nations}}
[[File:Adam Smith The Muir portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, laid the foundation of [[classical economics]] in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in [[economics]] throughout most of the world: In a [[capitalism|liberal capitalist society]], provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an '[[invisible hand]]' will ensure that the enlightened self-interest of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|349f, 533f}}

Smith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|59–68}}

Smith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' ([[#LtG|see below]]), Smith described the state as follows:

{{cquote|In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible."&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78}}}}

According to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78f}} Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, "... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence."&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78}}

==== David Ricardo's concept ====
{{Main|David Ricardo}}
{{See also|Ricardian economics|Corn Laws}}
{{Further||On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation}}
[[File:David ricardo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class]]
In the early 19th century, [[David Ricardo]] was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British [[Classical liberalism|''laissez-faire'' liberalism]]. He is known today for his [[Free trade #Economic models|free trade principle]] of [[comparative advantage]], and for his formulation of the controversial [[labor theory of value]]. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's [[Empirical research|empirical reasoning]] with [[Deductive reasoning|abstract principles and deductive argument]]. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|135f}}

In Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that had raged since 1803. The [[Continental System]] brought into effect a large-scale [[embargo]] against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with [[Battle of Waterloo#French disintegration|Napoleon's final defeat]] in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing [[Corn Laws]] in order to retain their [[Monopoly|monopoly status]] on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a [[protectionist]] two-sided measure of [[subsidies]] on corn exports and [[tariff]]s on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in 1817.&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|6–10}}

According to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial [[Economic rent#Land rent|land rent theory]]. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of [[international trade]]: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the [[industrialisation]] and the [[internationalization]] of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers – Ricardo himself died in 1823 – directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda.&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|202f}}

The Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain;&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|223}} but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the [[history of economic thought]].&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|88f}}

Ricardo's preoccupation with [[class conflict]] anticipated the work of [[Karl Marx]] ([[#Karl Marx|see below]]).

==== John Stuart Mill's concept ====
{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}
{{See also|Liberalism #Classical and modern|Utilitarianism #Classical utilitarianism}}
{{Further|Principles of Political Economy|On Liberty|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|upright|Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable]]
John Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|179}}

A champion of [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberalism]], Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government.&lt;ref name=jsm02/&gt; Also a [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]], Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society:

{{cquote|As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness ... of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; ...&lt;ref name=jsm03/&gt;{{rp|19}}}}

Mill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|16}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|213}} Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future:

{{cquote|It must always have been seen, more or less distinctly, by political economists, that the increase of wealth is not boundless; that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state, that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this, and that each step in advance is an approach to it. We have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view; that we are always on the verge of it, and that, if we have not reached it long ago, it is because the goal itself flies before us.&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|592}}}}

Contrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not "... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school."&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|593}} Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about "... a very considerable improvement on our present condition."&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|593}} According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was ''inevitable'', because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also ''necessary'', because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was ''desirable'', as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by — instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|592–596}}

Hence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|14f}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|213}} It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.&lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|79}}

=== Main developments in economics since Mill ===
{{See also|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}
When the influence of John Stuart Mill and his ''Principles'' declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[neoclassical economics]] had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis:

[[File:Marx6.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody]]
{{anchor|Karl Marx}}
* Although a classical economist in his own right, [[Karl Marx]] abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of [[historical materialism]], according to which human societies pass through several [[Mode of production|'modes of production']], eventually leading to [[communism]]. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the '[[productive forces]]' of society develop to a point where the [[class conflict]] bursts into [[revolution]]s, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of "from each according to ability, to each according to need" — that is, communism. The assumption, based on [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimism]], was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered.&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|292}} For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day.&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|57–65}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|218–225}} &lt;ref name=pb01/&gt;{{rp|5f}} However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]] was able to make the rather sweeping observation that "Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] has turned [[Green politics|green]], and Marxists have become [[Ecology|ecologists]]."&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|52}}
* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of [[general equilibrium theory]] within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|295–299}} &lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|55–57}} For this reason, modern [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a [[pseudoscience]] of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of future generations;&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|156–160}} that the very [[terminology]] of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|121–123}} and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant [[Neoliberalism|free market ideology]] legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] of [[economic growth]] at intolerable environmental and human costs.&lt;ref name=jb01/&gt;{{rp|145–148}}

Taken together, it has been argued that "... if Judeo-Christian [[monotheism]] took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics."&lt;ref name=hd04/&gt;{{rp|xx}} Almost one century later, Herman Daly has 
reintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy ([[#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|see below]]).

=== John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation ===
{{Main|John Maynard Keynes}}
{{See also|Great Depression|Keynesian economics|Macroeconomics}}
{{Further|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}

[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi-stationary community]]
[[John Maynard Keynes]] was the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of modern [[macroeconomics]], and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that [[Keynesian economics#Keynes and the classics|free markets would lead to full employment by themselves]]. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future.

In his essay from 1930 on ''The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren'', Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], Keynes rejected the prevailing "bad attack of economic pessimism" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' — avarice, exaction of interest, love of money — that had characterized [[Capitalism|capitalistic societies]] so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live "wisely and agreeably and well." Mankind would finally have solved "the economic problem," that is, the struggle for existence.&lt;ref name=jmk01/&gt;&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|2, 11}}

The similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state ([[#John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|see above]]) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted.&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|15}} It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true.&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|3–6}}

In his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and — if population was not increasing rapidly — society would finally "... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ..."&lt;ref name=jmk02/&gt;{{rp|138f}} Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. "I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work."&lt;ref name=jmk02/&gt;{{rp|237}}

=== Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns ===
The economic expansion following [[World War II]] took place while [[mainstream economics]] largely neglected the importance of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environmental constraints]] in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an academic subdiscipline in economics.

==== Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics ====
{{See also|Environmentalism #Post-war expansion}}
After the ravages of [[World War II]], the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion — known today as the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]] — was brought about by international financial stability, low [[Price of oil|oil prices]] and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded — or later joined — [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|the OECD]] enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulting in the [[1973–75 recession]] and the [[Bretton Woods system#Paralysis of international monetary management|collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system]].

Throughout this era, [[mainstream economics]] — dominated by both [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] — developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected.&lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|46f}} &lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|3f}} [[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation issues]] related specifically to [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of [[environmental economics]] at the margins of the mainstream. As the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics — namely [[general equilibrium theory]] — was uncritically adopted and maintained by even environmental economics, this subdiscipline was rendered largely unable to consider important issues of concern to environmental policy.&lt;ref name=cs01/&gt;{{rp|416–422}}

In the years around 1970, the widening discrepancy between an ever-growing world economy on the one hand, and a mainstream economics discipline not taking into account the importance of natural resources and environmental constraints on the other hand, was finally addressed — indeed, ''challenged'' — in academia by a few unorthodox economists and researchers.&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|296–298}}

==== Emerging ecological concerns ====
During the short period of time from 1966 to 1972, four works were published addressing the importance of natural resources and the environment to human society:

* In his 1966 philosophical-minded essay on ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'', economist and systems scientist [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principle]] of the [[First law of thermodynamics|conservation of matter and energy]], Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the [[Gross national product]] (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution — like a [[Astronaut|spaceman]] on board a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]. Boulding was not the first to make use of the '[[Spaceship Earth]]' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy.&lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|104}}
* In his 1971 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] integrated the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic concept]] of [[entropy]] with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution).&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; In the [[history of economic thought]], Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's [[Mineral|mineral resources]] will eventually be exhausted at some point ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ag01/&gt;{{rp|13}} &lt;ref name=kb02/&gt;{{rp|164f}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|160–171}}
* Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst [[Howard T. Odum]] published his book on ''Environment, Power and Society'', where he described human society in terms of [[ecology]]. He formulated the [[maximum power principle]], according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of [[Energy development#Types of energy|energy sources]] enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolutionary struggle]]. Odum later co-developed the concept of [[emergy]] (i.e., [[embodied energy]]) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis. His work provided the biological term 'ecology' with its broader societal meaning used today.&lt;ref name=ho01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|68–71}} &lt;ref name=cc01/&gt;{{rp|14f}}

{{anchor|LtG}}
* In 1972, scientist and systems analyst [[Dennis Meadows]] and his team of researchers had their study on ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' published by the [[Club of Rome]]. The Meadows team modelled aggregate trends in the [[world economy]] and made the projection — ''not'' prediction — that by the mid to latter part of the 21st century, industrial production per capita, food supply per capita and [[world population]] would all reach a peak, and then rapidly decline in a vicious [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]].&lt;ref name=dm02/&gt; Due to its dire pessimism, the study was scorned and dismissed by most mainstream economists at the time of its publication.&lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|244f}} &lt;ref name=jn01/&gt;{{rp|60f}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|50–62}} However, well into the 21st century, several independent researchers have confirmed that world economic trends so far do indeed match up to the original 'standard run' projections made by the Meadows team, indicating that a global collapse may still loom large in the not too distant future.&lt;ref name=ch01/&gt;{{rp|230}} &lt;ref name=aj01/&gt;{{rp|8f}} &lt;ref name=hs01/&gt;{{rp|152–155}} &lt;ref name=gt01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tj02/&gt;{{rp|8}}
Taken together, these four works were seminal in bringing about the formation of ecological economics later on.&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|301–305}}

==== Formation of ecological economics as an academic subdiscipline ====
{{Main article| Ecological economics}}
Although most of the theoretical and foundational work behind ecological economics was in place by the early 1970s, a long gestation period elapsed before this new academic subdiscipline in economics was properly named and institutionalized. Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were [[Herman Daly]] and [[Robert Costanza]] from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martínez-Alier]] from Spain (Catalonia).&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|308–310}} Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] that publishes the journal of [[Ecological Economics (journal)|''Ecological Economics'']].

When the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision.&lt;ref name=ir02/&gt;{{rp|266}} However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting [[Neoliberalism|free market orthodoxy]]. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.&lt;ref name=ba01/&gt;&lt;ref name=cs02/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp01/&gt;

Since the 1970s, [[Herman Daly]] has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|81f}} Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd03/&gt;{{rp|117–124}} &lt;ref name=hd05/&gt; He has also helped founding a center for the advancement of the steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=casse/&gt; He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work.&lt;ref name=cr01/&gt;

According to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of [[degrowth]] from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] — or even [[Technocracy|technocratic]] — top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical [[grassroots]] appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist [[Serge Latouche]] ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|146–148}}

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment]]
The premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter-energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. [[Recycling]] of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as [[waste heat]]. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

Daly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]] and a flow of [[solar energy]]. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may — within some practical limits — extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the [[Sun]] will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock — and not the Sun — that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|21f}}

[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere]]
Daly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the [[Industrial Revolution]] that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The [[Palaeolithic]] tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the [[Neolithic]] and onwards subsisted primarily — though not exclusively — on earth's [[biosphere]], powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution.

Daly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species:

{{cquote|The entire evolution of the biosphere has occurred around a fixed point — the constant solar-energy budget. Modern man is the only species to have broken the solar-income budget constraint, and this has thrown him out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere. Natural cycles have become overloaded, and new materials have been produced for which no natural cycles exist. Not only is geological capital being depleted, but the basic life-support services of nature are impaired in their functioning by too large a throughput from the human sector.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|23}}}}

Following the work of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly argues that the laws of [[thermodynamics]] restrict all [[technology|human technologies]] and apply to all economic systems:

{{cquote|[[Entropy]] is the basic physical coordinate of scarcity. Were it not for entropy, we could burn the same gallon of gasoline over and over, and our capital stock would never wear out. Technology is unable to rise above the basic laws of physics, so there is no question of ever 'inventing' a way to recycle energy.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|36}}}}

This view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']] ([[#Role of technology|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}}

In Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|price mechanism]] and [[Technology|technological development]] (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that "... there ''is'' such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there ''is'' such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants".&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|41}} Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes.

{{anchor|Daly's institutions}}
[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy]]
Consequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end ([[#The stationary state in classical economics|see above]]), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:

* The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.
* The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.
* The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).

The purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls "a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity" and providing "the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability."&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|69}}

Among the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] as the two economists he has learned the most from.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the [[world economy]], earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} 
&lt;ref name=kb02/&gt;{{rp|165–167}}

{{Anchor|Daly's credo}}
Responding specifically to the [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising Daly.27s steady-state economics|criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: "A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy".&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}} A frank and committed [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Daly further argues that...

{{cquote|... the steady-state economy is based on the assumption that [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] will have an end — that it is finite temporally as well as spatially. ... Only [[God]] can raise any part of his creation out of time and into [[eternity]]. As mere stewards of creation, all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|370}}}}

Later, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.&lt;ref name=mr01/&gt;{{rp|90f}} &lt;ref name=mf01/&gt;{{rp|105–107}} &lt;ref name=mb03/&gt;{{rp|270}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=av01/&gt;{{rp|37}}

== Conceptual and ideological disagreements ==
{{See also| Economic growth #Environmental and physical constraints}}
Several conceptual and ideological disagreements presently exist concerning the steady-state economy in particular and the dilemma of growth in general. The following issues are considered below: The role of technology; resource decoupling and the rebound effect; a declining-state economy; the possibility of having capitalism without growth; and the possibility of pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space. Herman Daly's approach to these issues are presented throughout the text.

=== Role of technology ===
{{See also | Productivity improving technologies | Production function | Pessimism #Entropy pessimism }}
[[Technology]] is usually defined as the application of scientific method in the production of goods or in other social achievements. Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to [[Productivity improving technologies|improve labour productivity]] and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding 
the role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources:

* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another [[Factors of production#Neoclassical economics|factor of production]] contributing to [[economic growth]], like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical [[production function]]s, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard [[mainstream economics]] textbooks on the subject.&lt;ref name=cm01/&gt;{{rp|508f}} &lt;ref name=rc02/&gt;{{rp|813–816}} &lt;ref name=tt02/&gt;{{rp|409f}}

[[File:2012 09 03 Brückenfahrstand Voraus DSCI73357.JPG|thumb|Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation]]
* In [[ecological economics]], on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|121f}} Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An [[internal combustion engine]] runs on [[fuel]]s; [[Electric machine|machinery]] and electric devices run on [[electricity]]; all [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology — useful though it is — works largely as a medium for transforming valuable [[natural resource]]s into material goods that eventually end up as valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]], thereby increasing the [[entropy]] — or disorder — of the [[Heat death of the universe|world as a whole]].&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|18–25}} This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}}

From the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary [[physics]] to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimists]].&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|15–19}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|80f}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|116–118}} From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Robert Solow]] has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.&lt;ref name=hd06/&gt;{{rp|134f}}

=== Resource decoupling and the rebound effect ===
{{See also| Sustainability #Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth| Jevons paradox| Rebound effect (conservation)}}

Resource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural resource consumption to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). ''Relative'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' assumption — that is, all other things being equal. ''Absolute'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|67f}}

[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|upright|Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency]]
In the [[history of economic thought]], [[William Stanley Jevons]] was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on ''[[The Coal Question]]'', Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to ''more'', not less, consumption of energy: Due to the [[Income–consumption curve|income effect]] of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]] or the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|160–163}} &lt;ref name=rs01/&gt;{{rp|40f}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|64f}}

In 2009, two separate studies were published that — among other things — addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]] published [[Factor 5 (book)|''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'']], co-authored with a team of researchers from [[The Natural Edge Project]].&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt; British ecological economist [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] published ''[[Prosperity Without Growth]]'', drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt; Consider each in turn:
* Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment — based on increasing resource productivity, [[renewable energy]], [[industrial ecology]] and other green technology — will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|11–18}} This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizsäcker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizsäcker notes that "... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption."&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|306}} As remedies, von Weizsäcker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies.&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|309f}}
* Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some ''relative'' resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' — that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP—decreased by 33 percent;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|68f}} but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|71}} Hence, no ''absolute'' energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even ''relative'' resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that "resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction," mostly due to [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] — notably China — building up their [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|74f}} Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|130}} Jackson further cautions that "simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt."&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|188}}

Herman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade system of quotas]], managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage:&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|61–64}}

* Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution standards and control]] which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce.
* More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs).
* No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in [[inflation]] or [[shortage]]s, or both — and ''not'' in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis.

For all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|77–80}} The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become [[angel]]s ourselves.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|118}}

=== Declining-state economy ===
{{Distinguish|Recession}}
{{See also|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |Anarcho-primitivism}}
{{Further|Degrowth}}

A declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a [[recession]]: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy.

Proponents of a declining-state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far-reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern [[civilization]] as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of [[anarcho-primitivism]], on [[Doomer|radical ecological doomsaying]] or on [[Survivalism#Outline of scenarios and outlooks|some variants of survivalism]].

[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly and is presently considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]] that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s. In his 
paradigmatic [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of earth — that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still!&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly [[#Daly's institutions|(see above)]].&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|374–379}} &lt;ref name=jg02/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

American political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]], French champion of the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]] [[Serge Latouche]] and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner — who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work — have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn:

* In his book on ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable [[solar power]]. Due to the [[Sunlight#Summary|diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation]], this source of energy is uncapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] future solar economy — or what he terms an 'entropic society' — based on [[anti-consumerism]], [[deindustrialization]], [[counterurbanization]], [[organic farming]] and [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|prudential restraints on childbirths]].&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|205–224}} Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}}
* In his manifesto on ''Farewell to Growth'', Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes [[overconsumption]] in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less.&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|9}} Latouche further cautions that "the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life."&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|103}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|134–138}} 
* In his article on ''Economic de-growth vs. steady-state economy'', Christian Kerschner has integrated the strategy of declining-state, or degrowth, with Herman Daly's concept of the steady-state economy to the effect that degrowth should be considered a path taken by the rich industrialized countries leading towards a globally equitable steady-state economy. This ultra-[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] path will then make ecological room for poorer countries to catch up and combine into a final world steady-state, maintained at some internationally agreed upon intermediate and 'optimum' level of activity for some period of time — although not forever. Kerschner admits that this goal of a world steady-state may remain unattainable in the foreseeable future, but such seemingly unattainable goals could stimulate visions about how to better approach them.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=do02/&gt;{{rp|229}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

Herman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one:

{{cquote|[T]he first issue remains to stop the momentum of growth and to learn to run a stable economy at historically given initial conditions. ... But we cannot go into reverse without first coming to a stop. Step one is to achieve a steady-state economy at existing or nearby levels. Step two is to decide whether the optimum level is greater or less than present levels. ... My own judgment on these issues lead me to think we have overshot the optimum."&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|52}}}}

Daly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels;&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|52}} even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever ([[#Daly's credo|see above]]).&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}}

=== Capitalism without growth ===
{{See also|Capitalism #Criticism|Criticism of capitalism #Sustainability |Market failure #Ecological}}
Several [[Political radicalism|radical]] critics of [[capitalism]] have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism.&lt;ref name=rs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jf01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tt01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rf01/&gt;{{rp|97–100}} &lt;ref name=mm01/&gt;{{rp|45–51}} &lt;ref name=bb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pa01/&gt; Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism:

[[File:Wall Street Bull - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Could capitalism ever stop growing?]]
* In capitalism, economic activity is generally guided by the [[profit motive]], a competitive work [[Ethos#Current usage|ethos]] and the drive to [[Capital accumulation|accumulate capital and wealth]] for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige — or simply to [[Greed|get rich in a hurry]]. Psychologically, these [[Drive theory|drives]] in the work sphere [[Psychological repression|repress]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distort]] biological and social [[Homeostasis#History|homeostasis]] in most people.
* In capitalism, [[employment]]s and [[income]]s depend directly on [[sales]] revenues, that is, on people spending money on the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and services for sale on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This dependency creates a [[Money|pecuniary incentive]] to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning [[advertising]] is devised to manipulate [[Want|human wants]] and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful [[consumerism]].
* In capitalism, the [[financial system]] is based on [[fractional-reserve banking]], enabling commercial banks to hold [[Bank reserves|reserves]] in amounts that are less than their [[Liability (financial accounting)|deposit liabilities]]. This credit creation is multiplying the [[monetary base]] supplied by the [[central bank]] in order to assist private [[corporation]]s expanding their activities.
* In capitalism, [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias]], creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology.
* In capitalism, private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment opportunities]]. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone.
* In capitalism, governments need [[tax revenue]]s to service their [[Government debt|debt obligations]], run their institutions and finance their [[Welfare|welfare programmes]] for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity.
* In the capitalist [[world economy]], [[Economic globalization|globalisation]] intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.
— In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert.

Fully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady-state economy is essentially capitalistic or [[Socialism|socialistic]]. He provides the following answer (written in 1980):

{{cquote|The growth versus steady-state debate really cuts across the old [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] rift, and we should resist any attempt to identify either growth or steady-state with either left or right, for two reasons. First, it will impose a logical distortion on the issue. Second, it will obscure the emergence of a third way, which might form a future synthesis of socialism and capitalism into a steady-state economy and eventually into a fully just and sustainable society.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|367}}}}

Daly concludes by inviting all (most) people — both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism — to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|367}}

=== Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space ===

{{Further|Space advocacy}}

Ever since the beginning of the modern [[Space Age]] in the 1950s, [[Space advocacy|space advocates]] have developed plans for [[Space colonization|colonising space]] in order to counter [[human overpopulation]] and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons).

[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill wanted colonists to settle in [[O'Neill cylinder|specially designed cylinders]] in outer space]]
In the 1970s, physicist and space activist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] developed a large plan to [[Gerard K. O'Neill#Space colonization|build human settlements in outer space]] to solve the problems of overpopulation and limits to growth on earth without recourse to political repression. According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could — and indeed ''should'' — expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth — and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline — than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: "The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies."&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}}

By the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation has long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be [[Asteroid mining|mined from asteroids in space]] and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting [[Space exploration|exploration]] and [[Space colonization|colonisation]] of space. The building up of [[Space manufacturing|industrial infrastructure in space]] would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete [[supply chain]] up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate [[return on investment]] for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's [[Cosmos|cosmic]] ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical [[Kardashev scale]], in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished.&lt;ref name=wc01/&gt; &lt;ref name=as02/&gt; &lt;ref name=pm01/&gt;

[[File:Pioneer 10 images the sun.jpg|thumb|right| Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space]]
However, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's [[Peak minerals|dwindling mineral reserves]]. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to-orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote ''[[in situ]]'' ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the [[Astronomy|astronomically]] long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space — and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.&lt;ref name=hd07/&gt;{{rp|24}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|81–83}} &lt;ref name=te01/&gt; &lt;ref name=ws01/&gt; &lt;ref name=kz01/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6862">In a [[vascular plant]], the '''stele''' is the central part of the [[root]] or [[Plant stem|stem]]{{sfnp|Foster|Gifford|1974|p=58}} containing the tissues derived from the procambium. These include [[vascular tissue]], in some cases ground tissue ([[pith]]) and a [[pericycle]], which, if present, defines the outermost boundary of the stele. Outside the stele lies the [[endodermis]], which is the innermost cell layer of the cortex.

The concept of the stele was developed in the late 19th century by [[France|French]] [[botanists]] [[Phillippe Édouard Léon van Tieghem|P. E. L. van Tieghem]] and [[H. Doultion]] as a model for understanding the relationship between the [[shoot]] and [[root]], and for discussing the evolution of vascular [[plant morphology]].{{sfnp|Gifford|Foster|1988|p=42}} Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, plant molecular biologists are coming to understand the genetics and developmental pathways that govern tissue patterns in the stele.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Moreover, physiologists are examining how the anatomy (sizes and shapes) of different steles affect the function of organs.

==Protostele==
[[File:protostele.jpg|right|Three basic types of protostele]]

The earliest [[vascular plant]]s had stems with a central core of vascular tissue.{{sfnp|Bold|Alexopoulos|Delevoryas|1987|p=320}}{{sfnp|Stewart|Rothwell|1993|pp=85–89}} This consisted of a cylindrical strand of [[xylem]], surrounded by a region of [[phloem]]. Around the vascular tissue there might have been an [[endodermis]] that regulated the flow of water into and out of the vascular system.  Such an arrangement is termed a protostele.{{sfnp|Gifford|Foster|1988|p=44}}

There are usually three basic types of protostele:
* '''haplostele''' – consisting of a cylindrical core of xylem surrounded by a ring of phloem. An endodermis generally surrounds the stele. A [[Xylem development|centrarch]] (protoxylem in the center of a metaxylem cylinder) haplostele is prevalent in members of the rhyniophyte grade, such as ''[[Rhynia]]''.{{sfnp|Arnold|1947|pp=66–68}}
* '''actinostele''' – a variation of the protostele in which the core is lobed or fluted. This stele is found in many species of club moss (''[[Lycopodium]]'' and related genera). Actinosteles are typically [[Xylem development|exarch]] (protoxylem external to the metaxylem) and consist of several to many patches of protoxylem at the tips of the lobes of the metaxylem. Exarch protosteles are a defining characteristic of the lycophyte lineage.
* '''plectostele''' – a protostele in which plate-like regions of xylem appear in transverse section surrounded by phloem tissue. In fact, these discrete plates are interconnected in longitudinal section. Some modern club mosses have plectosteles in their stems. The plectostele may be derived from the actinostele.

==Siphonostele==
[[File:siphonostele.jpg|right|Three basic types of siphonostele]]

Siphonosteles have a region of ground tissue called the [[pith]] internal to xylem. The vascular strand comprises a cylinder surrounding the [[pith]]. Siphonosteles often have interruptions in the vascular strand where leaves (typically megaphylls) originate (called leaf gaps).

Siphonosteles can be ectophloic (phloem present only external to the xylem) or they can be amphiphloic (with phloem both external and internal to the xylem). Among living plants, many ferns and some [[Asterid]] flowering plants have an amphiphloic stele.

An amphiphloic siphonostele can be called a:

* '''solenostele''' – if the cylinder of vascular tissue contains no more than one leaf gap in any transverse section (i.e. has non-overlapping leaf gaps). This type of stele is primarily found in [[fern]] stems today.
* '''dictyostele''' – if multiple gaps in the vascular cylinder exist in any one transverse section. The numerous leaf gaps and leaf traces give a dictyostele the appearance of many isolated islands of xylem surrounded by phloem. Each of the apparently isolated units of a dictyostele can be called a meristele. Among living plants, this type of stele is found only in the stems of ferns.

Most seed plant stems possess a vascular arrangement which has been interpreted as a derived siphonostele, and is called a

* '''eustele''' – in this arrangement, the primary vascular tissue consists of [[vascular tissue|vascular bundles]], usually in one or two rings around the [[pith]].{{sfnp|Bold|Alexopoulos|Delevoryas|1987|p=322}} In addition to being found in stems, the eustele appears in the [[root]]s of [[monocot]] flowering plants. The vascular bundles in a eustele can be collateral (with the phloem on only one side of the xylem) or bicollateral (with phloem on both sides of the xylem, as in some Solanaceae).

There is also a variant of the '''eustele''' found in monocots like [[maize]] and [[rye]]. The variation has numerous scattered bundles in the stem and is called an '''atactostele''' (characterestic of monocot stem). However, it is really just a variant of the eustele.{{sfnp|Bold|Alexopoulos|Delevoryas|1987|p=322}}{{sfnp|Gifford|Foster|1988|p=45}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39445">{{short description|Set of policies, procedures, and provision to equip teachers to perform their tasks effectively}}
'''Teacher education (TE)''' or '''teacher training''' refers to the policies, procedures, and provision designed to equip (prospective) [[teacher]]s with the [[knowledge]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, [[behavior]]s, and [[skill]]s they require to perform their tasks effectively in the [[classroom]], [[school]], and wider community.
The professionals who engage in this activity are called [[#teacher education|teacher educators]] (or, in some contexts, teacher trainers).

There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the most appropriate term to describe these activities. The term 'teacher training'  (which may give the impression that the activity involves training staff to undertake relatively routine tasks) seems to be losing ground, at least in the U.S., to 'teacher education' (with its connotation of preparing staff for a professional role as a reflective practitioner).&lt;ref name="tda.gov.uk"&gt;see for example Cecil H. Allen, In-Service Training of Teachers in ''[[Review of Educational Research]]''. 1940; 10: 210–215. In the UK, however, the term 'teacher training' is still in general use: [http://www.tda.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/teacher-training-options.aspx see for instance the UK government's information on tda.gov.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404015753/http://www.tda.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/teacher-training-options.aspx |date=2011-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy and related issues ==

The process by which teachers are educated is the subject of political discussion in many countries, reflecting both the value attached by societies and cultures to the preparation of young people for life, and the fact that education systems consume significant financial resources.

However, the degree of political control over Teacher Education varies. Where TE is entirely in the hands of universities, the state may have no direct control whatever over what or how new teachers are taught; this can lead to anomalies, such as teachers being taught using teaching methods that would be deemed inappropriate if they used the same methods in schools, or teachers being taught by persons with little or no hands-on experience of teaching in real classrooms. In other systems, TE may be the subject of detailed prescription (e.g. the state may specify the skills that all teachers must possess, or it may specify the content of TE courses).

Policy cooperation in the European Union (EU) has led to a broad description of the kinds of attributes that teachers in EU Member States should possess: the Common European Principle for Teacher Competences and Qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/doc/principles_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708042400/http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/doc/principles_en.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuum==
Although ideally it should be conceived of, and organised as, a seamless continuum, teacher education is often divided into these stages

*''initial teacher training / education'' (a pre-service course before entering the classroom as a fully responsible teacher);
*''induction'' (the process of providing training and support during the first few years of teaching or the first year in a particular school);
*''teacher development'' or ''continuing professional development (CPD)'' (an in-service process for practicing teachers).
There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the most appropriate term to describe these activities. The term 'teacher training'  (which may give the impression that the activity involves training staff to undertake relatively routine tasks) seems to be losing ground, at least in the U.S., to 'teacher education' (with its connotation of preparing staff for a professional role as a reflective practitioner).&lt;ref name="tda.gov.uk"/&gt;

=== Initial ===

==== Organization ====
In many countries, Initial Teacher Education (also known as preservice teacher training) takes place largely or exclusively in institutions of [[Higher Education]]. It may be organized according to two basic models.

In the 'consecutive' model, a teacher first obtains a qualification in one or more subjects (often an undergraduate bachelor's degree), and then studies for a further period to gain an additional qualification in teaching (this may take the form of a post-baccalaureate credential or master's degree).

In the alternative 'concurrent' model, a student simultaneously studies both one or more academic subjects, and the ways of teaching that subject, leading to a combined bachelor's degree and teaching credential to qualify as a teacher of that subject.

Other pathways are also available. In some countries, it is possible for a person to receive training as a teacher by working in a school under the responsibility of an accredited experienced practitioner. In the United Kingdom there is a long tradition of partnerships between universities and schools in providing state supported teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Research and the Teaching Profession. Building the capacity for a self-improving education system|last=BERA/RSA|first=|publisher=BERA|year=2014|isbn=978-0-946671-37-3|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is not without tensions and controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Oancea |first=Alis |year=2014 |title=Teachers' professional knowledge and state-funded teacher education: a (hi)story of critiques and silences |doi=10.1080/03054985.2014.939413 |journal=Oxford Review of Education |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=497–519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, approximately one-third of new teachers come through alternative routes to teacher certification, according to testimony given by Emily Feistritzer, the President of National Center for Alternative Certification and the National Center for Education Information, to a congressional subcommittee on May 17, 2007. However, many alternative pathways are affiliated with schools of education, where candidates still enroll in university-based coursework. A supplemental component of university-based coursework is community-based teacher education, where teacher candidates immerse themselves in communities that will allow them to apply teaching theory to practice. Community-based teacher education also challenges teacher candidates' assumptions about the issues of gender, race, and multicultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/imo/media/doc/051707EmilyFeistritzerTestimony.pdf |title=Preparing Teachers for the Classroom: The Role of the Higher Education Act and No Child Left Behind |date=May 17, 2007 |work=U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor |access-date=December 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Curriculum ====
The question of what knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and skills teachers should possess is the subject of much debate in many cultures. This is understandable, as teachers are entrusted with the transmission to learners of society's beliefs, attitudes and deontology, as well as of information, advice and wisdom, and with facilitating learners' acquisition of the key knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that they will need to be active in society and the economy.

Generally, Teacher Education curricula can be broken down into four major areas:
*[[foundational knowledge]] in education-related aspects of [[philosophy of education]], [[history of education]], [[educational psychology]], and [[sociology of education]].
*skills in assessing student learning, supporting English Language learners,{{dubious|date=November 2015}} using technology to improve teaching and learning, and supporting students with special needs.
*content-area and methods knowledge and skills—often also including ways of teaching and assessing a specific subject, in which case this area may overlap with the first ("foundational") area. There is increasing debate about this aspect; because it is no longer possible to know in advance what kinds of knowledge and skill pupils will need when they enter adult life, it becomes harder to know what kinds of knowledge and skill teachers should have. Increasingly, emphasis is placed upon 'transversal' or 'horizontal' skills (such as 'learning to learn' or 'social competences'), which cut across traditional subject boundaries, and therefore call into question traditional ways of designing the Teacher Education curriculum (and traditional school curricula and ways of working in the classroom).
*practice at classroom teaching or at some other form of educational practice—usually supervised and supported in some way, though not always. Practice can take the form of field observations, student teaching, or (U.S.) internship (See Supervised Field Experiences below).

==== Rural ====
Those training to teach in rural and remote areas face different challenges from those who teach in urban centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eaton |first=S. E. |last2=Dressler |first2=R. |last3=Gereluk |first3=D. |last4=Becker |first4=S. |year=2015 |title=A review of the literature on rural and remote pre-service teacher preparation with a focus on blended and e-learning models |work=Werklund School of Education Research &amp; Publications |doi=10.5072/PRISM/31625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=I. W. |year=1994 |title=Policy, practice and need in the professional preparation of teachers for rural teaching |journal=Journal of Research in Rural Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=68–77 |doi= |url=https://sites.psu.edu/jrre/wp-content/uploads/sites/6347/2014/02/10-1_5.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Alberta Advanced Education |date=2005 |title=A Learning Alberta: Advanced Education in Rural Alberta: Challenges And Opportunities: A Discussion Document |location=Edmonton |url=http://advancededucation.alberta.ca/media/134955/rural.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a different approach to teacher education is needed for those who aspire to each in rural and remote areas. It has been proposed that rural and remote communities may have more success recruiting teachers who already live in these communities, rather than trying to recruit urbanites to move to rural communities once they have completed their teacher training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Northern Alberta Development Council |date=2010 |title=Rural and Remote Education Report |url=http://www.nadc.gov.ab.ca/Docs/rural-remote-education.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online and blended teacher education programs are becoming more prevalent to help meet the needs of teacher shortages in rural and remote areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eaton |first=S.

==== Supervised field experiences ====
*field observations—include observation and limited participation within a classroom under the supervision of the classroom teacher
*student teaching—includes a number of weeks teaching in an assigned classroom under the supervision of the classroom teacher and a supervisor (e.g. from the university)
*internship—teaching candidate is supervised within his or her own classroom

These three areas reflect the organization of most teacher education programs in North America (though not necessarily elsewhere in the world)—courses, modules, and other activities are often organized to belong to one of the three major areas of teacher education. The organization makes the programs more rational or logical in structure. The conventional organization has sometimes also been criticized, however, as artificial and unrepresentative of how teachers actually experience their work. Problems of practice frequently (perhaps usually) concern foundational issues, curriculum, and practical knowledge simultaneously, and separating them during teacher education may therefore not be helpful.
However, the question of necessary training components is highly debated as continuing increases in attrition rates by new teachers and struggling learners is evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosser-Cox|first=Michelle|title=CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS AND MOTIVATION IN PREPARING TEACHERS: PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS: DOES CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS AFFECT ANTICIPATED SELF-DETERMINATION TO TEACH IN SPECIFIC SETTINGS?|year=2011|publisher=LAMBERT Academic Publishing|isbn=3844384693|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, with the increasing demands of the "teacher" research is beginning to suggest that teachers must not only be trained to increase learning experiences for their students, but how to also be a leader in an increasingly challenging field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosser and Massey|title=Educational Leadership: The Power of Oneself|year=2013|publisher=Peter Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate of how best to prepare teachers for teaching in today's demanding environments will continue to be an important focus of the United States, where the education of all children successfully is priority.

=== Induction of beginning teachers ===

Teaching involves the use of a wide body of knowledge about the subject being taught, and another set of knowledge about the most effective ways to teach that subject to different kinds of learner; it, therefore, requires teachers to undertake a complex set of tasks every minute. Many teachers experience their first years in the profession as stressful. The proportion of teachers who either do not enter the profession after completing initial training, or who leave the profession after their first teaching post, is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/gse_pubs/134/|title=Do Teacher Induction and Mentoring Matter?|first1=Ingersoll,|last1=Richard|first2=Smith, Thomas|last2=M|date=1 January 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is sometimes made between inducting a teacher into a new school (explaining the school's vision, procedures etc.), and inducting a new teacher into the teaching profession (providing the support necessary to help the beginning teacher develop a professional identity, and to further develop the basic competences that were acquired in college).

A number of countries and states have put in place comprehensive systems of support to help beginning teachers during their first years in the profession. Elements of such a programme can include:
* mentoring: the allocation to each beginning teacher of an experienced teacher, specifically trained as a mentor; the mentor may provide emotional and professional support and guidance; in many U.S. states, induction is limited to the provision of a mentor, but research suggests that, in itself, it is not enough.&lt;ref&gt;Wong H; Induction programs that keep new teachers teaching and improving; NASSP Bulletin � Vol. 88 No. 638 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* a peer network: for mutual support but also for peer learning.
* input from educational experts (e.g. to help the beginning teacher relate what she learned in college with classroom reality).
* support for the process of self-reflection that all teachers engage in (e.g. through the keeping of a journal).

Some research&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, P., Hobson, A., Tracey, L., Malderez, A., Tomlinson, P., Roper, T., Chambers, G. and Healy, J. (2008). Beginner teachers' experiences of initial teacher preparation, induction and early professional development: a review of literature. London: DCSF&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that such programmes can: increase the [[Employee retention|retention]] of beginning teachers in the profession; improve teaching performance; promote the teachers' personal and professional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Huling-Austin, J. A synthesis of research on teacher induction programs and practices; paper presented to the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, New Orleans LA, April 5–9, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

However, numerous authors &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villegas | first1 = A. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = T. | year = 2002 | title = Preparing culturally responsive teachers rethinking the curriculum | url = | journal = Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 20–32 | doi = 10.1177/0022487102053001003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jabbar, Abdul and Hardaker, Glenn (2013) The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools. ''Teaching in Higher Education'' , 18 (3). pp. 272-284.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that current teacher education is highly flawed and primarily geared towards a western dominated curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = Y | year = 2006 | title = Chinese Students in a UK Business School: Hearing the Student Voice in Reflective Teaching and Learning Practice | url = | journal = Higher Education Quarterly | volume = 60 | issue = 1| pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2273.2006.00306.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, they suggest that teacher education should be inclusive and take into account multiple backgrounds and variables to allow teachers to be responsive to the requirements of their students.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This falls into the area of culturally responsive teaching and requires teaching education and teachers to address issues of diversity education and disadvantage as a part of a teacher education curriculum. Jabbar &amp; Hardaker (2013) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jabbar | first1 = Abdul | last2 = Hardaker | first2 = Glenn | year = 2013 | title = The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools | url = http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/15029/ | journal = Teaching in Higher Education | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 272–284 | doi=10.1080/13562517.2012.725221}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that this is an essential process in helping students of ethnicity, colour and diversity achieve and attain.

=== Continuous professional development ===

Because the world that teachers are preparing young people to enter is changing so rapidly, and because the teaching skills required are evolving likewise, no initial course of teacher education can be sufficient to prepare a teacher for a career of 30 or 40 years. In addition, as the student body continues to change due to demographic issues there is a continuous pressure on academics to have mastery of their subjects but also to understand their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howard | first1 = T. C. | year = 2003 | title = Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: Ingredients for Critical Teacher Reflection | url = | journal = Theory into Practice | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 195–202 | doi = 10.1207/s15430421tip4203_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jabbar | first1 = Abdul | last2 = Hardaker | first2 = Glenn | year = 2013 | title = The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools | url = | journal = Teaching in Higher Education | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 272–284 | doi=10.1080/13562517.2012.725221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous Professional Development (CPD) is the process by which teachers (like other professionals) reflect upon their competencies, keep them up to date, and develop them further.

The extent to which education authorities support this process varies, as does the effectiveness of the different approaches. A growing research base suggests that to be most effective, CPD activities should:
*be spread over time,
*be collaborative,
*use active learning,

There are several educations around the world which have been working to improve CPD for teachers. One such organisation is Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) which has designed teaching standards for different stages in a teacher's career. Further, it conducts a Certification for teachers to engage with them on these standards and recognise those who are outstanding, thereby providing an incentive for CPp

== Quality assurance in teacher education==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}

The concept of 'Quality' in education is contested and understood in numerous different ways.

It is sometimes taken to relate to the quality of the work undertaken by a teacher, which has significant effects upon his or her pupils or students. Further, those who pay teachers' salaries, whether through taxes or through school fees, wish to be assured that they are receiving value for money. Ways to measure the quality of work of individual teachers, of schools, or of education systems as a whole, are therefore often sought.

In most countries, teacher salary is not related to the perceived quality of his or her work. Some, however, have systems to identify the 'best-performing' teachers, and increase their remuneration accordingly. Elsewhere, assessments of teacher performance may be undertaken with a view to identifying teachers' needs for additional training or development, or, in extreme cases, to identify those teachers that should be required to leave the profession. In some countries, teachers are required to re-apply periodically for their license to teach, and in so doing, to prove that they still have the requisite skills.

Feedback on the performance of teachers is integral to many state and private education procedures, but takes many different forms. The 'no fault' approach is believed by some to be satisfactory, as weaknesses are carefully identified, assessed and then addressed through the provision of in house or school based training. These can, however, be seen as benefiting the institution and not necessarily fully meeting the CPD needs of the individual as they lack educational gravitas.

A teacher educator (also called a teacher trainer) is a person who helps other people to acquire the knowledge, competences and attitudes they require to be effective teachers.
Several individual teacher educators are usually involved in the initial or ongoing education of each teacher; often each specialises in teaching about a different aspect of teaching (e.g. educational [[ethics]], [[philosophy of education]], [[sociology of education]], [[curriculum]], [[pedagogy]], subject-specific teaching methods etc.).

Not every culture has a concept that precisely matches the English term 'teacher educator'...&lt;ref name="Caena"&gt;Francesca Caena: Perspectives on Teacher Educator policies in European countries: an overview. Retrieved January 2017 at  http://www.lerarenopleider.nl/velon/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/summary_national_situations_teacher_educator_policies_europe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Even where the concept exists, the range of roles that is covered by the term varies significantly from country to country.&lt;ref name="European Commission"&gt;see, for example, the analysis of how this term is used within Europe in: European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; 
In some traditions, the term '[[teacher trainer]]' may be used instead of 'teacher educator'.

A teacher educator may be narrowly defined as a higher education professional whose principle activity is the preparation of beginning teachers in universities and other institutions of teacher education, such as teacher colleges. A broader definition might include any professional whose work contributes in some way to the initial education or the continuing professional development of school and other teachers.&lt;ref name="Caena"/&gt;

Even within a single educational system, teacher educators may be employed in different roles by different kinds of organisation. In the European context, for example, people who could be considered to be teacher educators include: 
:-[[Higher Education]] academics with a responsibility 
::--for [[Teacher Education]] as such, 
::--for teaching a subject (such as chemistry or mathematics) to students who will later become teachers;
::--for [[research]] into teaching, 
::--for subject studies or 
::--for [[didactics]]; 
:-teachers in schools who supervise student teachers during periods of [[teaching practice]];
:-school teachers or school managers responsible for inducting new teachers during their first year of teaching; or
:-those in charge of school teaching staff’s [[continuous professional development]].&lt;ref name="EC2"&gt;these examples are taken from the European Commission's text 'Supporting teacher educators' retrieved January 2017 from [http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/policy/school/doc/support-teacher-educators_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Teacher educators may therefore work in many different contexts including ([[universities]], [[schools]], private sector training organisations or [[trade unions]])&lt;ref name="EC2" /&gt; and their working time may be fully, or only partly, dedicated to the preparation of teachers.

===Professional knowledge and competences of teacher educators===
Being able to educate teachers requires different knowledge and skills than those required to teach pupils or students.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, J., Male, T. (2005) ‘Becoming a teacher educator: evidence from the field’ Teaching and Teacher Education 21 125–142[000]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teacher educators' fields of knowledge====
Some recent research has highlighted the many fields of knowledge that are required by teacher educators; these include knowledge about: the pedagogy of teacher education; learning and learners; teaching and coaching; and the profession of teacher educator itself. In addition, teacher educators need to know about the specific contexts their students will work and working in (e.g. for primary, or secondary education) and the subjects they will teach. More experienced teacher educators need expertise in: curriculum development and assessment; the wider context of teacher education, the way it is organised, and in research.&lt;ref name="Dengerinck"&gt;These are taken from: Dengerink J, Lunenberg M and Kools Q (2015) ‘What and how teacher educators prefer to learn’, Journal of Education for Teaching, 41:1, 78-96; but see also a similar list of required competences in European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiple identities====
The complexity of the tasks of the teacher educator arises in part because, as research has shown, they have multiple professional identities. (This is linked to the issues of definition of the term, highlighted above). While some of those who carry responsibility for the education of teachers do self-identify as 'teacher educator', others may self-identify rather as '[[researcher]]' or '[[academic]]'; others may relate primarily to their academic discipline, such as '[[chemist]]' or '[[geographer]].'&lt;ref name="Swen"&gt;see, for example: Swennen A., Jones K, Volman M (2010). ‘Teacher Educators: their identities, sub-identities and implications for professional development’, Professional Development in Education, 36 (1-2), March- June 2010, 131-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the key duality of identity that lies at the core of the teacher educator profession is that of first-order and second order teaching. A teacher educator must be a highly competent ‘first-order educator’ (i.e. a good teacher) but also a skilled ‘second-order educator’ (i.e. capable of teaching effectively about the skill of teaching and facilitating others to acquire teaching skills). As first-order educators, they need to be proficient teachers (of 'adult' students). As second-order educators, they require, in addition, specific competences and dispositions, such as modelling and meta-reflection, that enable them to teach about teaching.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

The acquisition or improvement of teacher competences requires training, through which it will be improved educational planning and assessment. This results in a better learning of students, as evidences show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferretti &amp; Lovece|first=|date=2015|title=LA VALUTAZIONE FORMATIVA PER LA DIDATTICA DELLA MATEMATICA NELL’AMBITO DEL PROGETTO FAMT&amp;L.

Reaching this goal supposes to design training programs for teachers of mathematics, starting from identificating their needs, believes, expectations and the use of formative assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00413|title=Improvement of teachers’ competences. [Social Impact]. FAMT&amp;L. Formative Assessment for Mathematics' Teaching and Learning (2013-2016).|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Modelling=====
The way in which teacher educators teach has a greater impact on student teachers’ thinking about practice than what teacher educators teach.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, 1997 cited in Loughran J. and Berry A.: ‘Modelling by teacher educators’, Teaching and Teacher Education 21 (2005) 193–203&lt;/ref&gt; So, teacher educators need to be able to model the competences and attributes they wish their students to adopt.&lt;ref name="Loughran"&gt;Loughran and Berry 2005; Lunenberg M., Korthagen F. and Swennen A. (2007): ‘The teacher educator as a role model’, Teaching and Teacher Education 23 586–601; Davey, R. and Ham, V. (2011), ‘ ‘It’s all about paying attention!’ … but to what?’ in Bates et al.: ‘The Professional Development of teacher educators’, Routledge, London, 2011; pp 232-247
&lt;/ref&gt; Swennen et al. (2008).&lt;ref name="Swennen"&gt;Swennen, A., Lunenberg, M. and Korthagen, F. (2008): ‘Preach what you teach! Teacher educators and congruent teaching’, Teachers and Teaching: theory and practice, 14(5), 531–542&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that, in order to ‘model’ what they teach, teacher educators need to develop the ability to link their own (tacit) theories and practice of teaching to public theory, i.e., in Korthagen’s &lt;ref name="Korthagen"&gt;Korthagen FAJ, (2001), ‘Linking practice and theory: The pedagogy of realistic teacher education’. Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; words, to translate Theory with a capital ‘T’ to theory with a small ‘t’.

=====Meta-reflection=====
Just as teaching is no longer seen as simply transferring factual information, so educating teachers also requires a more sophisticated approach, based upon professional awareness&lt;ref name="Yaffe"&gt;see, for example: Yaffe E. and Maskit D, ‘Discussing pedagogical dilemmas with teacher educators …’ In Bates et al 'The Professional Development of teacher educators', Routledge, London, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; that comes from [[reflective practice]].&lt;ref name="Zachner"&gt;see for example Ken Zeichner 'Becoming a teacher educator: a personal perspective;'Teaching and Teacher Education 21 (2005) 117–124&lt;/ref&gt; For Loughran,&lt;ref name="Loughran2"&gt;Loughran J (2014) ‘Professionally Developing as a Teacher Educator’; Journal of Teacher Education 2014, Vol. 65(4) 271–283(2014)&lt;/ref&gt; being a professional teacher educator requires “genuinely reflecting on, and responding to, the needs, demands, and expectations of teaching about teaching within the academy”.

===Professional standards for teacher educators===
In some parts of the world (notably the United States, [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]]) specific standards of professional practice have been developed for, or by, teacher educators. These set out the range of competences that a member of the teacher educator profession is expected to be able to deploy, as well as the attitudes, values and behaviours that are deemed to be acceptable for membership of the profession).&lt;ref name="prof"&gt;See examples from United States: http://www.ate1.org/pubs/uploads/tchredstds0308.pdf and the Netherlands: http://www.lerarenopleider.nl/velon/beroepsstandaard/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy and legislation on the teacher educator profession===
While schools and school teachers are often in the news and in political debate, research shows that the teacher educator profession is largely absent from such public discussions and from policy discourse in Education &lt;ref name="Snoek et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Snoek, Swennen, vanderKlink |date=2009 |title=The teacher educator: A Neglected Factor in the Contemporary Debate on Teacher Education, |url= |journal=Advancing quality cultures for teacher education in Europe: tensions and opportunities. Umea University. |volume= |issue= |pages=288–299 |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which often focuses exclusively on teachers and school leaders.

Some research suggests that, while most countries have policies, and legislation, in place concerning the teaching profession, few countries have a clear policy or strategy on the teacher educator profession. Caena (2012) &lt;ref name="Caena2"&gt;Caena F (2012) ‘Perspectives on Teacher Educator policies in European countries: an overview’ paper prepared for the European Commission conference ‘Education²: Policy support for Teacher Educators’; downloaded August 2013 at http://ec.europa.eu/education/school-education/teacher-educator_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; found that some of the consequences of this situation can include a teacher educator profession that is poorly organised, has low status or low formal recognition, has few regulations, professional standards - or even minimum qualifications, and no coherent approach to the selection, induction, or continuing professional development of Teacher Educators.

In India, the [[National_Council_for_Teacher_Education|National Council of Teacher Education]] (NCTE) released the '[[National_Curriculum_Framework_for_Teacher_Education|National Curricular Framework for Teacher Education]], 2010 (NCFTE), which aims to remedy many of the ills of teacher training in India. It calls for preparing a 'humane and reflective practitioner' and for fostering the agency and autonomy of the teacher, who can interpret the curriculum meaningfully to the contextual needs of the learners, than merely focus on 'teaching the text book'.

===Research into the teacher educator profession===

The teacher educator profession has also been seen as under-researched;&lt;ref name="Murray3"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murray J, Male T |date=2005 |title=Becoming a teacher educator: evidence from the field |url= |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=21 |issue= |pages=125–142 |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; empirical research on professional practice is also scarce.&lt;ref name="Willemse"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Willemse M, Lunenberg M, Korthagen F |date=2005 |title=‘Values in education: a challenge for teacher educators’ |url= |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=21 |issue= |pages=205–217 |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the importance of the quality of this profession for the quality of teaching and learning has been underlined by international bodies including the OECD and the European Commission. &lt;ref name="European Commission3"&gt;see, for example: European Commission (2012), 'Supporting the Teaching Professions for Better Learning Outcomes' retrieved January 2017 at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0374:FIN:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have therefore identified a need for more research into “what teachers of teachers themselves need to know”, and what institutional supports are needed to “meet the complex demands of preparing teachers for the 21st century.”&lt;ref name="Cochran"&gt;Cochran-Smith M (2003): ‘Learning and unlearning: the education of teacher educators’, Teaching and Teacher Education 19 (2003) 5–28)&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this perceived need, more research projects are now focussing on the teacher educator profession.&lt;ref name="infoted"&gt;For one example, see the InfoTED project at https://www.ntnu.edu/info-ted&lt;/ref&gt; Several academic journals cover this field.

'''''The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood''''' is a [[book]] by science history writer [[James Gleick]] published in March 2011 which covers the genesis of our current [[information age]]. It was on the [[New York Times]] [[New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]] for three weeks following its debut.&lt;ref name="bestseller"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-03-27/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|title=Best Sellers|date=27 May 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''The Information'' has also been published in [[ebook]] formats by [[HarperCollins|Fourth Estate]] and [[Random House]], and as an [[audiobook]] by [[Random House Audio]]. 

==Synopsis==

Gleick begins with the tale of colonial European explorers and their fascination with African [[talking drums]] and their observed use to send [[Complexity|complex]] and widely understood messages back and forth between villages far apart, and over even longer distances by relay. Gleick transitions from the information implications of such drum signaling to the impact of the arrival of long distance [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] and then [[telephone]] communication to the commercial and social prospects of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial age]] west. Research to improve these technologies ultimately led to our understanding the essentially [[Digital data|digital]] nature of [[information]], quantized down to the unit of the [[bit]] (or [[qubit]]).

Starting with the development of symbolic written language (and the eventual perceived need for a [[dictionary]]), Gleick examines the history of intellectual insights central to [[information theory]], detailing the key figures responsible such as [[Claude Shannon]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[Ada Byron]], [[Samuel Morse]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]]. The author also delves into how digital information is now being understood in relation to [[Digital physics|physics]] and [[genetics]]. Following the circulation of [[Claude Shannon]]'s ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]'' and [[Norbert Wiener]]'s ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine|Cybernetics]]'' many disciplines attempted to jump on the information theory bandwagon to varying success. Information theory concepts of [[data compression]] and [[error correction]] became especially important to the computer and electronics industries.

Gleick finally discusses [[Wikipedia]] as an emerging internet based [[Library of Babel]], investigating the implications of its expansive user generated content, including the ongoing [[Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|struggle]] between inclusionists, deletionists, and [[Vandalism on Wikipedia|vandals]]. Gleick uses the [[Jimmy Wales]] created article for the Cape Town butchery restaurant [[Mzoli's]] as a case study of this struggle. The flood of information humanity is now exposed to presents new challenges Gleick says, as we retain more of our information now than at any previous point in human history, it takes much more effort to delete or remove unwanted information than to accumulate it. This is the ultimate [[entropy]] cost of generating additional information and the answer to slay [[Maxwell's Demon]].

==Reception==

In addition to winning major awards for science writing and history, ''The Information'' received mostly positive reviews. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] said it is "so ambitious, illuminating and sexily theoretical that it will amount to aspirational reading for many of those who have the mettle to tackle it." Other admirers were [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] for ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=Nicholas|title=Drowning in Beeps|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-03-01/the-information-by-james-gleick-review-by-nicholas-carr/|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]] for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=How We Know|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/how-we-know/|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction author [[Cory Doctorow]] in his [[BoingBoing]] review called Gleick "one of the great science writers of all time", "Not a biographer of scientists... but a biographer of the ''idea'' itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|title=James Gleick's tour-de-force: The Information, a natural history of information theory|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2011/03/24/james-gleicks-tour-d.html|accessdate=15 June 2011|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Wu]] for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] praised "a mind-bending explanation of theory" but wished Gleick had examined the economic importance of information more deeply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wu|first=Tim|title=Bit by Bit: James Gleick on the fascinating quest to understand and wield information.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/03/bit_by_bit.html|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Pindar writing for ''[[The Guardian]]''  complained that ''The Information'' does not fully address the relationship between social control of information ([[censorship]], [[propaganda]]) and access to [[political power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pindar|first=Ian|title=How a costly toy came to transform our world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/30/information-history-james-gleick-review|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Timbral listening''' is the process of actively listening to the [[timbre|timbral]] characteristics of sound.

==Concept==
In timbral listening, 'pitch is subordinate to timbre'.  Instead, the specific quality of a musical tone is determined by considering 'the presence, distribution and relative [[amplitude]] of [[overtones]].'&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this listening technique/ method of perception / interpretation there is 'a relation between timbre and [[Harmonic series (music)|spectral]] content which is analogous to that between pitch and [[frequency]] in that one is the prevalent cultural construct of the other'&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p133-134&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of timbral listening is listening to [[speech]]. This is demonstrated by listening to, for example, the vowels /a/ and /i/ spoken at the same [[pitch accent|pitch]] and intensity. The difference between the two sounds is entirely one of spectrum, or as the term is used in this article, [[timbre]].

==Nature==

It has been suggested that "timbral listening is an ideal sonic mirror of the natural world".&lt;ref&gt;Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p58&lt;/ref&gt; It is often (but not always) used in association with musics that are based in [[mimicry]] of sounds in the natural environment. [[Valentina Suzukei]] suggests that 'it was the [[nomadic]] way of life and its focus on the timbral qualities of natural sounds that created this kind of musicality'.&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p51.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in Canada where composers such as [[Hildegard Westerkamp]] apply the thinking of [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s World [[Soundscape]] Project to their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, L., 'The Something to Hold on to Factor in Timbral Composition', "Contemporary Music Review" 10:2 (1994): 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive language and notation==

As timbre has 'no domain-specific adjectives' it 'must be described in metaphor or by analogy to other senses',&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; This method also has limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p131, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

*Traditional music in [[Tuva]] and other Turkic cultures of inner Asia
The composition of timbre-centered music in the nomadic communities of Tuva involves mimicry of sounds heard in the environment. Timbral listening is a fundamental component of listening to, understanding and being able to correctly perform this music using vocal techniques such as [[Overtone singing|throat singing]] "khoomei" and harmonic producing instruments such as the [[jaw harp]], bzaanchy, shoor, qyl qiyak, qyl-gobyz, ku-rai and [[igil]].

*[[Burundi|Barundi]] whispered [[Inanga (instrument)|Inanga]] or ''Inanga Chucotée'' in Africa
This music employs a fundamental [[Drone (music)|drone]] and overtone harmonics. It consists of "a whispered text, accompanied by the ''inanga'', a trough [[zither]] of eight strings. To listen correctly (using timbral listening), one must consider "the effect of the combined timbres of the noisy whisper and the inanga" as a whole sound.&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 56&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some forms of contemporary electronic music
More recently, computers and [[synthesizers]] are being used by contemporary composers to produce timbral-centered music. Contemporary composers state timbral listening as the correct technique to adopt in listening to and analysing their timbre (as opposed to pitch) based compositions. 'Pure timbres' are explored using methods such as [[granular synthesis]] in works such as ''Dragon of the Nebula'' by [[Mara Helmuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth, M., "Timbral Composition and Gesture" Columbia University Music Department, available at {{cite web |url=http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020121195155/http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |archivedate=2002-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Shakuhachi]] music in Japan
The music produced by the Shakuhachi end blown flute such as [[honkyoku]], contains timbral variations that are of equal importance to pitch variations. These timbral variations are indicated in [[Shakuhachi musical notation]].&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Donald Paul (Autumn, 1969). "The Shakuhachi and the Kinko Ryu Notation". Asian Music 1 (2): 32–72. Springer. {{doi|10.2307/833910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

The technique of timbral listening is used by sound engineers to evaluate timbre difference.&lt;ref&gt;Quesnel, R., "Timbral Ear Trainer: Adaptive, Interactive Training of Listening Skills for Evaluation of Timbre Differences", paper presented at the 100th Audio Engineering Society Convention, Copenhagen, May 11th–14th, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''William Ramsay Smith''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]}} (27 November 1859 – 28 September 1937)&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; was a Scottish physician, educator, naturalist, [[anthropologist]] and civil servant, who was active in [[Australia]] later in his career.
It was during his time in Australia that Smith misappropriated the text of 'Legendary Tales of the Australian Abotigines' from the original indigenous author David Unaipon (b.28thSeptember 1872).ref. Legendary Tales ofthe Australian Aborigines, David Unaipon, Ed.  Stephen Muecke and Adam Shoemaker: The Miegunyah Press:2006.© The David Unaipon Estate 2001.

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[King Edward, Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]], the son of William Smith (a farm servant, and later stationmaster) and his wife Mary ''née'' MacDonald (domestic servant). They lived on the estate of Cairnbanno House near [[New Deer]]. He attended the nearby Cairnbanno Public School (which taught using the [[Madras School]] system - all pupils also teaching). Winning a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] scholarship, from 1877 he studied arts at [[Edinburgh University]] and then attended [[Moray House Training College]] to train as a teacher for two years.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At 20 years of age Smith was appointed headmaster of [[Invergordon]] Public School, in [[Easter Ross]], but, due to an interest in [[physiology]], he returned to Edinburgh University to study arts and science. He then won an entrance scholarship for Medicine of £100 a year for three years. On completing his medical course in 1885 Smith was appointed assistant-professor of natural history, senior demonstrator of zoology at Edinburgh University. He graduated [[BSc]] (natural sciences) in 1888.

In 1889 'Illustrations of Zoology' was published which he had prepared in collaboration with J. S. Norwell. He graduated [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB]] [[ChM]] in 1892. For two years Smith was demonstrator of anatomy at Edinburgh, and served as examiner at the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]]. During this period he lived at 4 Grange Loan in the south of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In 1896 he travelled to Australia at the request of the [[Government of South Australia]] to fill a [[pathology]] position at the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]]. Smith was expelled from the [[British Medical Association]] and banned from the association for life in 1897 after internal conflict with Hospital staff, but having been exonerated by a Tribunal, in 1899 he was appointed city [[Coroner]] and permanent head of the department of health at [[Adelaide]].

In 1901 during the [[South African War]] Smith was surgeon captain, [[Imperial Bushmen's Corps]] and officer in charge of plague administration at [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Smith was suspended from coronial duties in 1903 after 18 charges were laid against him of the misuse of human remains, specifically the removal of heads and the collection of skeletons for medical research.&lt;ref&gt;James R and James H. 2001. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: RETENTION OF HUMAN ORGANS AND THE DISMISSAL OF RAMSAY SMITH.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
found that Smith's actions had been "indiscreet" and he was dismissed from his position as coroner. However, he was later reinstated and continued his practice of illicitly collecting human remains.

In 1904 Smith graduated [[DSc]] from the [[University of Adelaide]], and published ''A Manual for Coroners''. In his spare time made a special study of the [[Australian aborigine]]s. Smith was the author of ''The Aborigines of Australia'', which was printed in volume three of the Official 'Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia' (1910).

In 1906 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Turner (anatomist)|Sir William Turner]], [[Daniel John Cunningham]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]] and [[Cargill Gilston Knott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 he published 'Medical Jurisprudence from the Judicial Standpoint', for which he received the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from Edinburgh University.

In 1915 was in charge of the Australian General Hospital, Australian Imperial Force, [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis, Egypt]].  There, he clashed with principal matron Bell over which of them should manage the nursing staff. An Inquiry resulted in both being recalled to Australia.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

On his return to Adelaide, Smith resumed his duties at the board of health and contributed to the 'Australian Encyclopaedia', including a large part of the article on Aborigines. Following a trip to the [[Southern Ocean|South Seas]] Smith published ''In Southern Seas'' (1924); the second half of this book mostly relates to the Australian aborigines.

Smith retired in 1929 and published a book ''Myths of the Australian Aboriginals'' (1930), a collection of narratives as told by aboriginal people. It has subsequently emerged that the volume was plagiarised, and was almost entirely written by the Aboriginal polymath and scientist [[David Unaipon]], who had sold the text to finance his own work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/messageclub/duknow/stories/s888637.htm Who is David Unaipon?] Didj "u" Know at abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt; Authorship of the book has now been restored to Uniapon and it has been republished under his name.&lt;ref&gt;David Unaipon. 2006. ''Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines''. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press. {{ISBN|0-522-85246-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has also been accused of sales of Aboriginal artefacts for profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/awaye/stories/2009/2489556.htm On the shore of a strange land: David Unaipon], 7 March 2009 at abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropological collection===
Ramsay Smith was responsible for the bulk of [[Edinburgh University]]'s physical anthropology collection, some 500 to 600 individuals.

From Ramsay Smith's writings, it is clear that he was aware of indigenous funerary customs.&lt;blockquote&gt;"After death no reference is made to the deceased, nor is his name mentioned. Relations by the same name find a substitute. A mother would not give [me] a lock of her child’s hair because she has been taught that if the child dies, its spirit will find no rest if that lock of hair survives."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
As desecration of human remains was illegal, he used his position as Adelaide’s coroner to illicitly dissect and collect human remains, many being individuals of unusual pathologies or disease, most of which he presented to Edinburgh University. His writings indicate that he also robbed graves and it is believed he had once destroyed five graves to obtain one good specimen. Witnesses also record that he practiced his marksmanship with a [[Lee-Enfield|.303 rifle]] on corpses at the mortuary of Adelaide hospital. While he did not receive payment for the remains, he was rewarded for his "donations" with Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (upon the proposal of [[Sir William Turner]], [[Daniel John Cunningham]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]] and [[Cargill Gilston Knott]])&lt;ref name="Waterston2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and an Honorary Fellowship of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]]. He was an honorary member of the [[Association of Military Surgeons of the United States]].

At his death in 1937, 182 skulls were found in his Adelaide home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meanjin.com.au/editions/volume-68-number-4-2009/article/the-return-of-the-bones/ The Return of the Bones] Meanjin quarterly Volume 68, Number 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to numerous books, Ramsay Smith also published pamphlets and contributed largely to scientific journals and ''[[Chambers Encyclopaedia]]''. He was interested in literature, philosophy and music, was an excellent public servant, and earned a reputation as an authority on the Australian aborigine.

==Death==
Smith spent his final years quietly among his books at [[Belair, South Australia]], where he died on 28 September 1937. Smith had married Margaret, daughter of James Mackenzie, on 1 June 1889, who predeceased him. Four daughters and a son survived him.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

[[File:AGOModra Leonids98.jpg|thumb|All-sky view of the 1998 [[Leonids]] shower. 156 meteors were captured in this 4-hour image.]]

In [[astronomy]], the '''zenithal hourly rate''' ('''ZHR''') of a [[meteor shower]] is the number of meteors a single observer would see in an hour of peak activity, assumed the conditions are excellent (stars visible up to [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 6,5). The rate that can effectively be seen is nearly always lower and decreases the closer the radiant is to the [[horizon]].

The formula to calculate the ZHR is:

&lt;math&gt; ZHR = \cfrac{\overline{HR} \cdot F \cdot r^{6.5-lm}}{\sin(hR)} &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\overline{HR} = \cfrac{N}{T_{eff}} &lt;/math&gt;

represents the hourly rate of the observer.  N is the number of meteors observed, and T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective observation time of the observer.

Example: If the observer detected 12 meteors in 15 minutes, their hourly rate was 48. (12 divided by 0.25 hours).

&lt;math&gt; F = \cfrac{1}{1-k}&lt;/math&gt;

This represents the field of view correction factor, where k is the percentage of the observer's field of view which is obstructed (by clouds, for example).

Example: If 20% of the observer's field of view were covered by clouds, k would be 0.2 and F would be 1.25. The observer should have seen 25% more meteors, therefore multiply by F = 1.25.

&lt;math&gt; r^{6.5-lm} &lt;/math&gt;

This represents the limiting magnitude correction factor ([[Population index]]). For every change of 1 magnitude in the limiting magnitude of the observer, the number of meteors observed changes by a factor of r. Therefore, this must be taken into account.

Example: If r is 2, and the observer's limiting magnitude is 5.5, the hourly rate is multiplied by 2 (2 to the power 6.5–5.5), to know how many meteors they would have seen if their limiting magnitude was 6.5.

&lt;math&gt; \sin(hR) &lt;/math&gt;

This represents the correction factor for the altitude of the radiant above the horizon (hR). The number of meteors seen by an observer changes as the sine of the radiant height in radians. {{Dubious |Talk section sin(hR) dependence|reason=Using this definition, no meteors would be seen by an observer at sea level if radiant is on the horizon. Clearly rubbish, as the meteors radiate in multiple directions, and some would go above the horizon date=August 2018|date=August 2018}}

Example: If the radiant was at an average altitude of 30&amp;deg; during the observation period, the observer's hourly rate will need to be divided by 0.5 (sin 30&amp;deg;) to know how many meteors they would have seen if the radiant was at the zenith.
