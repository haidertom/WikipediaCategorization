      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16259">'''[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]]''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

No specific right of access to information was enshrined in the [[Constitution of Turkey|1982 Turkish Constitution]] that in Article 26 instead refers to the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]], including the "right to receive information". In the 2001 amended Constitution, Article 74 specifically refers to the right to information establishing that everyone has the right to obtain information. Following the 2010 Constitutional amendments, the right to appeal to the [[Ombudsman|Ombudsperson]] is also provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf|title=Constitution of the Republic of Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=global.tbmm.gov.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBRD"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 2012 |title=Commercial laws of Turkey.

The Review Board of Access to Information |access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Access to public information is regulated by the Law on the Right to Information, Law No: 4982 of 2004. The law was introduced in the framework of the negotiations for accession to the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Turchia/Turchia-l-accesso-alle-informazioni-ai-tempi-di-Erdogan-178001#26 |title=Turchia: l'accesso alle informazioni ai tempi di Erdoğan |last=Gülseren |first=Adaklı |date=21 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa / Bianet |access-date=21 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP) Steering Committee designated the inactive status of Turkey with regard to the OGP action plan which included, among other objectives, an improvement of the possibility to access public information for Turkish citizens.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/turkey|title=Turkey's Action Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partnership Initiative|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steering Committee found that the Turkish government acted contrary to OGP process for two consecutive action plan cycles.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/open-government-partnership/2016/09/21/turkey-made-inactive-open-government-partnership|title=Turkey made inactive in the Open Government Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partneship Initiative|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal Framework ==
In addition to Law No: 4982, in 2004 a circular by the Prime Minister on “The exercise of the right of petition and access to information” was also enacted (Circular No. 25356). It identifies the basis of this policy in the principle called “citizen oriented approach in public services”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bilgiedinmehakki.org/doc/Prime%20Ministry%20Circular%20on%20Right%20to%20Information.pdf|title=The exercise of the right of petition and access to information, Circular 2004/12|last=|first=|date=|website=bilgiedinmehakki.org|series=|location=|orig-year=|publication-place=Official Gazette|publication-date=January 24, 2004|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Law No: 4982, the law applies to any natural and legal person who are entitled to apply to the institutions by way of exercising the right to information. Foreign residents can exercise the right “on the condition that the information that they require is related to them or the field of their activities and on the basis of the [[Reciprocity (international relations)|principle of reciprocity]]”.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilgiedinmehakki.org/doc/Turkey_FOI_2008_Report.pdf|title=Freedom of Information in Turkey: A Critical Assessment of the Implementation and Application of the Turkish Right to Information Act 2003|last=Akdeniz|first=Yaman|date=|website=bilgiedinmehakki.org|publisher=bilgiedinmehakki.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law applies to “any written, printed or copied file, document, book, journal, brochure, etude, letter, software, instruction, sketch, plan, film, photograph, tape and video cassette, map of the institutions and the information, news and other data that are recorded and saved in electronic format that are within the scope of (the) law”.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Government bodies are required to respond in 15 working days. They must provide either a certified copy of the document or when it is not possible to make a copy, applicants can examine them at the institution.

Initially, the Right to Information Assessment (Review) Council (''[[Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu]]''- BEDK) provided very poor information about its activities and decisions. It started to publish all information on its decision only in 2008 with the launch of its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedk.gov.tr/default.aspx|title=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu (BEDK)|last=|first=|date=|website=bedk.gov.tr|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBRD" /&gt; The BEDK jurisdiction on appeals for denials to requests of information was originally limited to cases relating to national security and state economic interests. In November 2005, the Law was amended in order to allow any kind of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beb.aku.edu.tr/bilgi-edinme-birimi/5432-sayili-bilgi-edinme-hakki-kanununda-degisiklik-yapilmasina-dair-kanun/|title=5432 sayılı Bilgi Edinme Hakkı Kanununda Değişiklik Yapılmasına Dair Kanun|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2005|website=beb.aku.edu.tr|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the 2016 EC progress report, the Board of Review of Access to Information was effective in its role of reviewing applicants' appeals and in publishing related decisions online. The report also notes that, however, there is no quality assurance in the responses given to applicants.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite journal|date=9 November 2016|title=Turkey 2016 Report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_turkey.pdf|publisher=European Commission|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Decision No. 2016/1 of August 4, 2016 on “Applications for Information on Measures and Transactions within the Context of Emergency State Decentralization Laws”, the applicants who ask for information and documents relating with (i) persons who are removed from the public service and (ii) institutions and organizations which are closed down under the Decree Laws in the State of Emergency Law,  are excluded from the scope of the right to obtain information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedk.gov.tr/kurul-ilke-kararlari.aspx|title=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kuruluna itirazda bulunma süresi hakkında 01/09/2016 tarih ve 2016/2 sayılı İlke Kararı|last=|first=|date=|website=bedk.gov.tr|publisher=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] (EC) Progress Report on Turkey, the Law on access to public information is not fully aligned with international standards. Another problem highlighted by the EC is the failure to adopt pending legislation on state and trade secrets, which prevents to balance between confidentiality and transparency when assessing freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

=== Exceptions ===
Under Articles No. 20- 28 of Law No. 4982,  the right to information can be restricted if such information refers to:
* Information and Documents Pertaining the State Secrets, which would clearly cause harm to the security of the state or foreign affairs or national defense and national security;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the Economical Interests of the State, which would harm the economic interests of the state or cause unfair competition or enrichment;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the State Intelligence, regarding the duties and activities of the civil and military intelligence units;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the Administrative Investigation, violating the right of privacy, endangering the security or the life of an individual, jeopardising the security of the investigation, disclosing the source of the information which needs to be kept secret,;
* Information or Documents Pertaining the Judicial Investigation and Prosecution;
* Privacy of the Individuals, which would interfere with the health records, private and family life, honour and dignity, and the economical and professional interests of an individual;
* Privacy of Communication;
* Trade Secrets and Intellectual Property;
* Institutions’ Internal Regulations, Opinions, Information Notes and Recommendations.

In practice, protection of state secrets, commercial secrets and privacy were among the most common grounds for rejecting a request.&lt;ref name="EC2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=10 November 2015|title=Turkey 2015 Report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2015/20151110_report_turkey.pdf|publisher=European Commission|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an expert, all these conditions largely nullify the legal provisions which are intended to protect the right to public information in Turkey.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

== Access to Public Information in Practice ==
The exercise of the right of access to public information is particularly problematic in the Turkish context, where the management of public affairs is characterized by a secretive approach to power and politics, and several problems affect the exercise of the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]] and [[media freedom in Turkey|media freedom]].&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt; The situation has been deteriorating with the [[State of emergency|state of exception]] following the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|attempted coupt of July 15, 2016]], entailing severe limitations to media freedom and to dissemination of information, press freedom limitations, sanctions against newspapers and journalists, censorship and self-censorship.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

A right to information request can be made using the BIMER website (''[[Başbakanlık İletişim Merkezi]]''), active since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bimer.gov.tr/|title=Başbakanlık İletişim Merkezi (BİMER)|last=|first=|date=|website=bimer.gov.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, only 2,7% of requests for access to information were rejected, against 3,4% in 2013.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt; The share of appeals refused by the Board of Review of the Access to Information fell from 50,6% in 2013 to 36,3% in 2014.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt; According to the European Commission, more than 2 million applications a year for access to information were submitted both in 2015 and 2016. The percentage of requests refused remained small, approximately 3.7% up to June 2016 compared with 3% in 2015.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

Regarding the right to access information for lawyers, especially when they are assisting defendants accused with terrorism charges, they face serious problems. Their access to documents pertaining to the case can be restricted before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undocs.org/A/HRC/20/19/Add.3|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Mission to Turkey|last=Knaul|first=Gabriela|date=May 4, 2012|editor-last=|website=undocs.org|id=A/HRC/20/19/Add.3|publisher=United Nations, Human Rights Council|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the Steering Committee of the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP) designated the inactive status of Turkey, for acting contrary to OGP process for two consecutive action plan cycles. The OGP action plan included, among other objectives, an improvement of the possibility to access public information for Turkish citizens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The decision follows a resolution approved unanimously by the OGP Steering Committee during their May 4, 2016 ministerial level meeting in Cape Town, South Africa. That resolution called for the government of Turkey to take steps to re-engage in OGP, including the development of a National Action with broad civil society participation by September 1, 2016.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

The '''Allard Prize for International Integrity''' is one of the world's largest prizes dedicated to the fight against corruption and the protection of human rights.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/09/29/news/oscars-anti-corruption-badass-women-lead-way|title=At the Oscars of anti-corruption, badass women lead the way|last=Uechi|first=Jenny|date=29 September 2017|work=National Observer|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is awarded biennially to an individual, movement or organization that has "demonstrated exceptional courage and leadership in combating corruption, especially through promoting transparency, accountability and the [[Rule of Law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/prize-criteria|title=Prize Criteria|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner receives the Allard Prize Award, a uniquely crafted brass artwork,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diatom.cc/allard-prize|title=Allard Prize Award Design|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Diatom Studio|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/award-design|title=Award Design|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CAD$100,000. Honourable mention recipients are awarded a unique nickel-plated artwork, and may also receive a cash award.

The Allard Prize winner and any honourable mention recipients are chosen through a comprehensive nomination and selection process involving the Allard Prize Committee, sub-committees and an Advisory Board.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/process-nomination-and-selection|title=Process of Nomination and Selection|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2015 Allard Prize, over 140 people were nominated from 50 countries. In 2017, the number of nominations grew to 244 from 70 countries, with 42 nominations (17 percent) from North America.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Nomination===
There are no restrictions as to who may submit a nominee for consideration. Nominations may come from anywhere including from members of the Allard Prize Committee. Self-nominations are allowed for both individuals and organizations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/frequently-asked-questions|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominees range from neighbourhood activists to prominent world leaders, academics, social movements, political organizations and charitable groups.

Nominations are accepted on a rolling basis, with a new nomination cycle beginning with the announcement of finalists in the Prize year. Previously nominated candidates can be re-nominated, but new nomination forms must be submitted. There are no minimum or maximum age limits or any other limiting characteristics as to eligibility, with the exception that members of the Allard Prize Committee, Advisory Board and members of their immediate families may not be awarded the Allard Prize during their respective terms and for one year following the end of their terms.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Selection===
The Allard Prize Committee reviews all nominations and is responsible for selecting the Prize winner and any honourable mention recipients. The selection process involves research, subcommittees and due diligence, two levels of short-listing, and a requirement to submit short-listed of nominees to the Allard Prize Advisory Board for review and comment prior to the selection of the winner and honourable mention recipients.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Protest against selection of finalist Operação Lava Jato (Brazil - Car Wash Task Force) - 2017 ===
The selection of Brazil's Car Wash Task Force (Operação Lava Jato) as a 2017 Allard Prize finalist triggered objections in Brazil and Canada. A group of Brazilian lawyers wrote to the Allard Prize Committee demanding the Committee rescind their finalist status and alleging "numerous abuses, arbitrariness and legal violations" by the Task Force. A group of University of British Columbia faculty and students supported the Brazilian lawyer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/news/973391/barristers-object-nomination-controversial-brazil-anti-corruption-squad-ubc-prize|title=Barristers object to nomination of controversial Brazil anti-corruption squad for UBC prize|last=Pablo|first=Carlito|date=28 September 2017|work=The Georgia Straight|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During the September 28, 2017 Prize Ceremony, several audience members made vocal outbursts against the Car Wash Task Force.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In response, 2017 Allard Prize keynote speaker Glenn Greenwald said in his keynote address that while the Operation Car Wash Task Force had made some mistakes, powerful investigative work often creates controversy and enemies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In a post-award open discussion at the Allard School of Law, opponents confronted the Task Force's lead prosecutor [[Deltan Dallagnol]] with their criticisms, who responded during a recorded video session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekjLkNuND_Y|title=2017 Allard Prize Finalist Q&amp;A Session|last=|first=|date=14 October 2017|website=Allard Prize YouTube channel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegation of Third World Bias ===
Shortly after the 2017 Allard Prize finalists were announced, journalist Russell Mokhiber noted in an article published in Corporate Crime Reporter that the Allard Prize has "a bias in favour of anti-corruption fighters in the Third World" rather than selecting nominees from Western developed countries. Mokhiber speculated that the bias might be due to a heavy representation of corporate lawyers, World Bank and Asian Development Bank personnel on the selection and advisory committees. In an interview with Mokhiber, Allard Prize Executive Director Nicole Barrett acknowledged that none of the previous finalists have been from North America. Noting that the majority of nominees are from the developing world, she said that the Allard Prize may consider developing a formal requirement of geographical balance to address this concern.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''bench-clearing brawl''', sometimes known as a '''basebrawl''' or a '''rhubarb''', is a form of ritualistic fighting that occurs in sports, most notably [[baseball]] and [[ice hockey]], in which every player on both teams leave their [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]]s, [[bullpen]]s or benches, and charge the playing area in order to fight one another or try to break up a fight.

==Baseball==
[[File:Massive fenway brawl.jpg|thumb|Bench-clearing brawl at [[Fenway Park]] because of [[Coco Crisp]] getting hit by a pitch by [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]].]]
In [[baseball]], brawls are usually the result of escalating infractions, often stemming from a player being [[Hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]], or an altercation between a [[baserunner]] and [[infielder]] stemming from excessive contact in an attempted [[tag out]] (such as a runner crashing into the [[catcher (baseball)|catcher]] at home plate in an attempt to dislodge the ball, which is an [[interference (baseball)|offensive interference]] violation that may result in ejection). They are also known to occur when a batter [[charging the mound|charges the mound]]. However, few bench-clearing brawls result in serious injury, as in most cases, no punches are thrown, and the action is limited to pushing and shoving.

Unlike most other team sports, in which teams usually have an equivalent number of players on the field at any given time, in baseball the hitting team is at a numerical disadvantage, with a maximum of five players (batter, up to three runners, and on-deck batter) and two base coaches on the field at any time, compared to the fielding team's nine players. For this reason, leaving the dugout to join a fight is generally considered acceptable in that it results in numerical equivalence on the field, a fairer fight, and a generally neutral outcome, as in most cases, managers and/or umpires will intervene to restore order and resume the game. In at least one case (the infamous [[Ten Cent Beer Night]] promotion), one team (the Cleveland Indians, who were the home team) left its dugout to defend the other (the Texas Rangers, the visiting team) from its own fans (who had [[pitch invasion|stormed the field]]). 

===Penalty===
Depending on the severity of the [[unsportsmanlike conduct]], an [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] may or may not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] a brawl's participants. Since a bench-clearing brawl by definition involves ''everyone'' on both teams, it is exceedingly unlikely that all participants will be ejected, but the player or players responsible for the precipitating event are often ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2011/Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf|work=Major League Baseball|title=The Official Baseball Rules|accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fines and suspensions generally result and are issued at a later date.

==Ice hockey==
[[File:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|[[Shawn Thornton]] fighting [[Wade Brookbank]].]]

[[Fighting in ice hockey]] by [[enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]] is an established, if unofficial, part of the sport (especially in [[North America]], where the penalty rules are more permissive); the general procedure in a one-on-one fight is to let it pan out and then send both players to the [[penalty box]] with five-minute [[Major penalty|major penalties]]. Escalations beyond isolated fights, such as line brawls between groups of players on the ice, are [[violence in ice hockey|prohibited]], meaning bench-clearing brawls will result in serious consequences. General brawls can result in players being assessed [[game misconduct]] penalties and [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] from the game. This is especially the case if a player leaves the bench or [[penalty box]] to join a fight.

As in baseball, hockey brawls usually result from escalating infractions; in this case, dangerous hits, excessive post-whistle roughness, taking shots after the whistle, attacking the [[goaltender]], and hatred from competition in a game with a significant amount of inter-player violence, all contribute to bench-clearing brawls.

In the [[National Hockey League]] the penalties include, in addition to in-game penalties, an automatic 10-game suspension and a fine of $10,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26481 ''Rule 70.10&amp;nbsp;– Leaving the Players' or Penalty Bench''] in the NHL Rulebook&lt;/ref&gt; for the first player to leave his bench or the penalty box to participate in a brawl; for the second player to leave his bench or the penalty box, the penalties include, in addition to in-game penalties, an automatic five-game suspension and a fine of $5,000.

The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] rules prescribe a double minor penalty plus a game misconduct penalty for the first player to leave the bench during an altercation and a misconduct penalty for other such players;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 564&amp;nbsp;– Players Leaving the Benches During an Altercation, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; a player who leaves the penalty box during an altercation is assessed a minor penalty plus a game misconduct penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 563&amp;nbsp;– Players Leaving the Penalty Bench, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these penalties for leaving the bench, all players engaging in a fight may be penalized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/sport/iihf-rule-book.html IIHF Rule Book 2006–2010], Rule 528&amp;nbsp;– Fisticuffs or Roughing, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more notable incidents was the [[Punch-up in Piestany]], a game between Canada and the Soviet Union during the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]]. The game was rougher and more dangerous than is generally accepted, and with 6:07 left in the second period, a wild fight broke out between Pavel Kostichkin and [[Theoren Fleury]], causing both teams to leave the benches for 20 minutes. The officials ordered that the arena lights be turned out, but to no avail, and the [[IIHF]] eventually declared the game void. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada a potential gold medal, and the Canadian team, disgusted at what they perceived to be a conspiracy against them, chose to leave rather than stay for the end-of-tournament festivities, from which the Soviet team were banned.

A notable [[KHL]] bench-clearing brawl saw all the players of [[Avangard Omsk]] and [[Vityaz Chekhov]], except for the goaltenders, fighting at 3 minutes and 34 seconds. The referees penalized all the players who were involved in the brawl, and called the game due to lack of players; the teams were fined 5.7 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] and had the game counted as a double loss.

==Other sports==
Bench-clearing brawls have also been known to occur in other sports, and officials in those sports have been cracking down on such brawls; in 1995, the [[National Basketball Association]] changed the penalty for leaving the bench to participate in a brawl from a $500 fine to an automatic one-game suspension.

In 2010, the [[Northern Territory Football League]] in Australia ruled that any player found to have left the interchange bench to participate in a melee would be ejected from that match; they would also have their melee fine increased by 25% and receive an automatic one-game suspension.

Bench-clearing brawls do not occur very often in [[gridiron football]]. All levels of the game penalize any "substitute who leaves the team box during a fight" (as it is worded in the high school rule books) with automatic ejection and possible further sanctions depending on the league, and the amount of equipment a football player wears increases the risk for injury in a brawl greatly. In addition, on-field umpires and referees move in immediately to break up fights, and any contact by a team member against an official will draw the immediate penalty of ejection from the game, with further sanctions by league officials virtually certain, along with [[Penalty (gridiron football)#List of penalties|on-field penalties]] that move the ball closer or farther from the goal line depending on the team sanctioned, hurting the team's winning chances far more than in other sports. One notable brawl at the college level was [[FIU–Miami football brawl|between Florida International University and the University of Miami]], where tough talk between two [[crosstown rivalry|crosstown rivals]] escalated into a brawl with severe consequences for FIU.

At least two bench-clearing brawls have taken place in the Lingerie Football League, since renamed the [[Legends Football League]]. The first came in 2009 between the [[Miami Caliente]] and the [[New York Majesty]]; that brawl eventually led to the Majesty suspending operations. Another occurred during the December 9, 2011 LFL game between the [[Toronto Triumph]] and the [[Philadelphia Passion]]. It was unclear what punishment either team would face as Toronto was already using [[replacement player]]s due to a mass walkout of the original team earlier in the year.

===High school and scholastic sports===
Bench-clearing brawls are prohibited in scholastic competition with the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] specifying the penalty for leaving the bench area to participate in a fight in any sanctioned sport as an automatic [[ejection (sports)|ejection]] and, if actively involved in a fight, an automatic [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]]. In addition, school administrators may implement more severe penalties such as disqualification from activities, academic suspension or [[Expulsion (education)|expulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.nfhs.org/vango/custom/resourcelibrary/|title=NFHS Resource Library|work=National Federation of State High School Associations|accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more severe instances, entire schools can face sanctions from their state's athletic association, ranging from letters of reprimand, forfeiture of contests, withholding of travel expenses and extended suspensions of players and coaches to, in the most severe cases, cancellation of a team's entire season or suspension of a school's entire athletic program.

{{redirect|Scylla and Charybdis}}
[[Image:Johann Heinrich Füssli 054.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Fuseli]]'s painting of Odysseus facing the choice between Scylla and Charybdis, 1794/6]]
Being '''between Scylla and Charybdis''' is an idiom deriving from Greek mythology, meaning "having to choose between two evils". Several other idioms, such as "on the horns of a dilemma", "[[between the devil and the deep blue sea]]", and "[[between a rock and a hard place]]" express similar  meanings.

==The myth and the proverb==
[[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]] were mythical [[sea monsters]] noted by [[Homer]]; Greek mythology sited them on opposite sides of the [[Strait of Messina]] between [[Sicily]] and the Italian mainland. Scylla was rationalized as a rock [[shoal]] (described as a six-headed sea monster) on the Italian side of the strait and Charybdis was a [[whirlpool]] off the coast of Sicily. They were regarded as maritime hazards located close enough to each other that they posed an inescapable threat to passing sailors; avoiding Charybdis meant passing too close to Scylla and vice versa. According to Homer, [[Odysseus]] was forced to choose which monster to confront while passing through the strait; he opted to pass by Scylla and lose only a few sailors, rather than risk the loss of his entire ship in the whirlpool.

Because of such stories, having to navigate between the two hazards eventually entered idiomatic use.  Another equivalent English seafaring phrase is, "Between a rock and a hard place".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from the ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English'' [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/Scylla-and-Charybdis available online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin line ''incidit in scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim'' (he runs into Scylla, wishing to avoid Charybdis) had earlier become proverbial, with a meaning much the same as [[jumping from the frying pan into the fire]]. [[Erasmus]] recorded it as an ancient proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', although the earliest known instance is in the ''[[Alexandreis]]'', a 12th-century Latin [[epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Walter of Châtillon]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[Edward Charles Harington]] in [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ''Notes and Queries'' 5th Series, '''8''' (7 July 1877:14)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and popular references==
The myth was given an allegorical interpretation by the French poet [[Barthélemy Aneau]] in his [[emblem book]] ''Picta Poesis'' (1552). There one is advised to choose the risk of being envied for wealth or reputation rather than swallowed by the Charybdis of poverty. "Choose the lesser of these evils. A wise man would rather be envied than miserable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FANa072 French Emblems at Glasgow]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:GillrayBritannia.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[James Gillray]], ''Britannia between Scylla and Charybdis'' (1793)]]
The story was often applied to political situations at a later date. In [[James Gillray]]'s cartoon, ''Britannia between Scylla and Charybdis'' (3 June 1793),&lt;ref&gt;Published by H. Humphrey, London 8 April 1793&lt;/ref&gt; '[[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] helms the ship ''Constitution'', containing an alarmed Britannia, between the rock of democracy (with the liberty cap on its summit) and the whirlpool of arbitrary power (in the shape of an inverted crown), to the distant haven of liberty'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Iain |last=Hampsher-Monk |title=The Impact of the French Revolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qWwQqPeqBQC&amp;dq=%22%27William+Pitt+helms+the+ship+Constitution%2C+containing+an+alarmed+Britannia%2C+between+the+rock+of+democracy+%28with+the+liberty+cap+on+its+summit%29+and+the+whirlpool+of+arbitrary+power+%28in+the+shape+of+an+inverted+crown%29%2C+to+the+distant+haven+of+liberty%22&amp;q=Scylla#v=snippet&amp;q=Scylla&amp;f=false |isbn=0-521-57005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the context of the effect of the [[French Revolution]] on politics in Britain. That the dilemma had still to be resolved in the aftermath of the revolution is suggested by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s returning to the idiom in his 1820 essay ''[[A Defence of Poetry]]'': "The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the vessel of the state is driven between the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and despotism."&lt;ref&gt;The Harvard Classics, section 33; [http://www.bartleby.com/27/23.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A later ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' caricature by [[John Tenniel]], dated 10 October 1863, pictures the [[Prime Minister]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] carefully steering the British ship of state between the perils of Scylla, a craggy rock in the form of a grim-visaged [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Charybdis, a whirlpool which foams and froths into a likeness of [[Jefferson Davis]]. A shield emblazoned "Neutrality" hangs on the ship's thwarts, referring to how Palmerston tried to maintain a strict impartiality towards both combatants in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrahamlincolncartoons.info/SubPages/Cartoon.php?UniqueID=415 View online]&lt;/ref&gt; American satirical magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' also used the myth in a caricature by F. Graetz, dated November 26, 1884, in which the unmarried President-elect [[Grover Cleveland]] rows desperately between snarling monsters captioned "Mother-in-law" and "Office Seekers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1865-1897/3-gilded/4-cleveland1 Scroll down on History on the Net]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]] uses the equivalent French idiom (''tomber de Charybde en Scylla'') in his novel ''[[Les Miserables]]'' (1862), again in a political context, as a metaphor for the staging of two rebel barricades during the climactic uprising in Paris, around which the final events of the book culminate. The first chapter of the final volume is entitled "The Charybdis of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and the Scylla of the Faubourg du Temple".

By the time of [[Nicholas Monsarrat]]'s 1951 war novel, ''[[The Cruel Sea (novel)|The Cruel Sea]]'', however, the upper-class junior officer, Morell, is teased by his middle-class peer, Lockhart, for using such an old-fashioned phrase. Nevertheless, the idiom has since taken on new life in pop lyrics. In [[The Police]]'s 1983 single "[[Wrapped Around Your Finger]]", the second line uses it as a metaphor for being in a dangerous relationship; this is reinforced by a later mention of the similar idiom of "the devil and the deep blue sea".&lt;ref&gt;The words are [http://www.elyrics.net/read/p/police-lyrics/wrapped-around-your-finger-lyrics.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Gondjza0sUs}}&lt;/ref&gt; American heavy metal band [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] also referenced the idiom in "Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis", a track from their 2008 album ''Shogun'', in which the lyrics are about having to choose "between death and doom".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=9BZByugVukA|title=The song with lyrics}} (words also available online.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[Graham Waterhouse]] composed a [[piano quartet]], ''[[Skylla and Charybdis (Waterhouse)|Skylla and Charybdis]]'', premiered at the [[Gasteig]] in [[Munich]]. According to his programme note, though its four movements "do not refer specifically to the protagonists or to events connected with the famous legend", their dynamic is linked subjectively to  images connected with it "conjoured up in the composer's mind during the writing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arbc.de/Waterhouse/werke.htm#skylla Composer's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civil courage''' is a type of courage, related closely to heroism, in which a person acts [[bravery|bravely]] to intervene in a social situation.

==Overview==
Italian journalist and writer {{ill|Franca Magnani|de}} (1925-1996) wrote, "Je mehr Bürger mit Zivilcourage ein Land hat, desto weniger Helden wird es einmal brauchen" ("The more citizens with civil courage which a country has, the fewer heroes it needs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/de/bereiche/sob/motivation/zivilcourage/zivilcourage.html |title=Über Zivilcourage |language=German |website=[[University of Zurich]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil Courage today ==

Civil courage has been referred to by [[psychologist]] Tobias Greitemeyer as constituting acts of [[bravery]], carried out with the objective of enforcing a societal or ethical standard, without concern for the effect these acts might have on one’s own position. In this way it is distinguished from [[alturism|altruistic]] behavior and other forms of courage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greitemeyer|first1=Tobias|title=Civil courage: Implicit theories, related concepts, and measurement|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=115–119|doi=10.1080/17439760701228789|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of altruistic, helping behavior, an individual might expect to be praised or receive positive social consequences from the result of their having helped, despite possible financial or material loss. In actions where civil courage is demonstrated, the person carrying out the action may experience negative social consequences such as alienation, verbal abuse or violence. Civil courage is displayed when a person, in spite of the perceived threat of negative consequences acts to intervene in a social context. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osswald|first1=Silvia|title=What Is Moral Courage?

[[File:Perilsofpauline.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1914 ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|Perils of Pauline]]'', which popularized the term '''cliffhanger''' in the medium of film.]]

A '''cliffhanger''', or '''cliffhanger ending''', is a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma, or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode&lt;ref&gt;Some are placed before commercial breaks&lt;/ref&gt; of serialized fiction. A cliffhanger is hoped to ensure the audience will return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma.

Some serials end with the caveat "To Be Continued…" or "The End?"  In [[movie serials]] and [[television series]], the following episode sometimes begins with a [[recap sequence]].

==History==
The cliffhanger plot device dates back to the famous medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary]] work, the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The [[framing device]] has [[Scheherazade]] narrating a [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|series of stories]] to King [[Shahryār]] for 1,001 nights, with each night ending on a cliffhanger, in order to save herself from execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire.|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=1438119062|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&amp;pg=PT292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444351729|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8tPlht9lyAC&amp;pg=PT86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers later appeared as an element of the Victorian [[serial (literature)|serial novel]] that emerged in the 1840s, with many associating the form with [[Charles Dickens]], a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction.&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite news|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|publisher=The New Yorker|date=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040341/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;Grossman, Jonathan H. (2012). Charles Dickens's Networks: Public Transport and the Novel. p. 54. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s it had become a staple part of the sensation serials, while the term itself originated with [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1873 when a protagonist from one of his serials, Henry Knight, was left hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Hardy"/&gt;

===Victorian serials and term origin===

Cliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction, pioneered by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"/&gt; Printed episodically in magazines, Dickens’s cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers. Writing in the ''New Yorker'', Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'';

{{quote|In 1841, Dickens fanboys rioted on the dock of New York Harbor, as they waited for a British ship carrying the next installment, screaming, “Is little Nell dead?.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;}} 

The impact of Dickens' serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rob (2014). "Serialization in Popular Culture". p. 41. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cliffhanger" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left hanging off a [[cliff]].&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diniejko,|first1=Andrzej|title=Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes As a Cliffhanger with a Post-Darwinian Message|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=27 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032925/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial media==
Cliffhangers were especially popular in 1920s and 1930s [[Serial film|serials]] when [[movie theater]]s filled the cultural [[niche market|niche]] later primarily occupied by [[television]]. Cliffhangers are often used in [[television series]], especially [[soap opera]]s that end each episode on a cliffhanger. Prior to the early 1980s, season-ending cliffhangers were rare on U.S. television. The first such season-ender on U.S. TV was in the [[comedy]] send-up of soap operas ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' in 1978. Several [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]]s, which went off air over summer, such as ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Restless Years]]'', and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', ended each year with major and much publicized catastrophe, such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year's closing episode.

Cliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In contrast to American [[superhero comics]], Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers, often with each volume or issue. This is particularly the case with [[shōnen manga]], especially those published by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', and ''[[One Piece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mylonas|first1=Eric|title=Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors|date=2004|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0761546758|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHxLR1C8JBEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brandweek, Volume 47|journal=[[Brandweek]]|date=January 2006|volume=47|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bplaAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Adweek L.P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original run, [[Doctor Who]] was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger. In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. [[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire Part One]] is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] literally hanging from a cliff. This has been frequently criticised by fans for being a pointless cliffhanger, but script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] gave an explanation for the reasoning of it in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|title=A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Dragonfire|author=|date=|website=www.shannonsullivan.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200758/http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|archivedate=2015-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers were rare on American television before 1980, as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order. The phenomenal success of the 1980 "[[Who shot J.R.?]]" third season-ending cliffhanger of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and the "[[Who Done It (Dallas)|Who Done It]]" fourth-season episode that finally solved the mystery, contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on television.&lt;ref name="meisler19950507"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/arts/television-when-j-r-was-shot-the-cliffhanger-was-born.html?pagewanted=all | title=TELEVISION; When J.

The two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers/viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful, possibly life-threatening situation, or to feature a sudden shocking revelation. Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role.

Cliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned, in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved. Such was the case with the second season of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist, but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled, resulting in the unresolved ending.

The cliffhanger has become a genre staple (especially in comics, due to the multi-part storylines becoming the norm instead of self-contained stories). To such a degree, in fact, that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved, or even referenced, when the next episode is shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |title=The IT Crowd: Tramps Like Us |publisher=Noise to Signal |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311215959/http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; variously because the writer didn't feel it was "a strong enough opener,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |title=…and we like tramps! « Why, That\’s Delightful! |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324010610/http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "couldn't be bothered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Falk |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1014/1014434_one_of_the_it_crowd.html |title=One of the IT Crowd &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News - menmedia.co.uk |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavily serialized television drama ''[[True Blood]]'' has become notorious for cliffhangers. Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers, but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |title='True Blood' Finale Sets Up More Cliffhangers |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020081054/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commercial break]]s can be a nuisance to [[screenwriter|script writer]]s because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break. Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory [[dénouement]], but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out.

Sometimes a movie, book, or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second, evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance (becoming the villain of the next film). Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel.

A '''cobalt bomb''' is a type of "[[salted bomb]]": a [[nuclear weapon]] designed to produce enhanced amounts of [[radioactive fallout]], intended to contaminate a large area with [[radioactive material]]. The concept of a [[Cobalt-60|cobalt]] bomb was originally described in a radio program by physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] on February 26, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Armageddon Science: The Science of Mass Destruction|publisher=St. Martins Griffin|isbn=978-1-250-01649-2|author=Brian Clegg|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intent was not to propose that such a weapon be built, but to show that nuclear weapon technology would soon reach the point where it could end human life on Earth, a [[Doomsday device]].&lt;ref name="Bushan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhushan | first = K. | authorlink =  |author2=G.

This section was removed from later editions, but, according to Glasstone in 1978, not because it was inaccurate or because the weapons had changed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Federation]] has allegedly developed cobalt warheads for use with their [[Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System]] [[nuclear torpedo]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/russias-new-super-torpedo-carries-the-threat-nuclear-14537|title=Russia's New Super-Torpedo Carries the Threat of Nuclear Contamination|first=Michael|last=Peck|publisher=[[The National Interest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/12/kremlin-controlled-tv-airs-secret-plans-for-new-submarine-launched-nuclear.html|title='Secret' Russian nuclear torpedo blueprint leaked|date=November 12, 2015|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/321640-leaked-russian-nuclear-torpedo/|title=‘Assured unacceptable damage’: Russian TV accidentally leaks secret ‘nuclear torpedo’ design|publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However many commentators doubt that this is a real project, and see it as more likely to be a staged leak to intimidate the United States. Amongst other comments on it, Edward Moore Geist wrote a paper in which he says that "Russian decision makers would have little confidence that these areas would be in the intended locations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2016.1195199|title=Would Russia’s undersea “doomsday drone” carry a cobalt bomb?|first=Edward Moore|last=Geist|date=July 3, 2016|publisher=|volume=72|issue=4|pages=238–242|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/00963402.2016.1195199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian military experts are cited as saying that "robotic torpedos could have other purposes, such as delivering deep-sea equipment or installing surveillance devices."&lt;ref name=BBC-Russia&gt;{{Cite news |title=Russia reveals giant nuclear torpedo in state TV 'leak' |date=November 12, 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34797252 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga#Operation Antler|Operation Antler]]/Round 1 test by the British at the Tadje site in the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Maralinga range]] in Australia on September 14, 1957, tested a bomb using cobalt pellets as a radiochemical tracer for estimating yield. This was considered a failure and the experiment was not repeated.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web|title=1.6 Cobalt Bombs and other Salted Bombs |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html#nfaq1.6|publisher=Nuclearweaponarchive.org |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, the triple "[[Nuclear weapon design#Clean bombs|taiga]]" nuclear salvo test, as part of the preliminary March 1971 [[Pechora–Kama Canal]] project, produced relatively high amounts of Co-60 from the steel that surrounded the Taiga devices, with this [[neutron activation|fusion generated neutron activation]] product being responsible for about half of the gamma dose now (2011) at the test site. This high percentage contribution is largely because the devices did not rely much at all on fission reactions and thus the quantity of gamma emitting [[caesium-137]] fallout, is therefore comparatively low. [[photosynthesis|Photosynthesizing]] vegetation exists all around the lake that was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X11000750|title=Radiological investigations at the 'Taiga' nuclear explosion site: Site description and in situ measurements| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.04.003 |volume=102|pages=672–680|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X11003043|title=Radiological investigations at the 'Taiga' nuclear explosion site, part II: man-made γ-ray emitting radionuclides in the ground and the resultant kerma rate in air| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.12.009|volume=109|pages=1–12|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
A cobalt bomb could be made by placing a quantity of ordinary [[cobalt]] metal (&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co) around a [[thermonuclear bomb]].  When the bomb explodes, the [[neutron]]s produced by the fusion reaction in the secondary stage of the thermonuclear bomb's explosion would [[nuclear transmutation|transmute]] the cobalt to the radioactive [[cobalt-60]] (&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co), which would be vaporized by the explosion.  The cobalt would then condense and fall back to Earth with the dust and debris from the explosion, contaminating the ground.

The deposited cobalt-60 would have a [[half-life]] of 5.27 years, decaying into  [[Nickel-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Ni]] and emitting two [[gamma ray]]s with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 [[megaelectronvolt|MeV]], hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is:

{{nuclide|cobalt|59}} + n → {{nuclide|cobalt|60}} → {{nuclide|nickel|60}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + gamma rays.

Nickel-60 is a stable isotope and undergoes no further decays after emitting the gamma rays.

The 5.27 year half life of the &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co is long enough to allow it to settle out before significant decay has occurred, and to render it impractical to wait in [[bomb shelter|shelters]] for it to decay, yet short enough that intense radiation is produced.&lt;ref name=arch /&gt; Many isotopes are more radioactive ([[gold-198]], [[tantalum-182]], [[zinc-65]], [[sodium-24]], and many more), but they would decay faster, possibly allowing some population to survive in shelters.

==Fallout from cobalt bombs vs. other nuclear weapons==
[[Fission products]] are more deadly than neutron-activated cobalt in the first few weeks following detonation. After one to six months, the fission products from even a large-yield thermonuclear weapon decay to levels tolerable by humans. The large-yield three-stage (fission–fusion–fission) thermonuclear weapon is thus automatically a weapon of radiological warfare, but its fallout decays much more rapidly than that of a cobalt bomb. A cobalt bomb's fallout on the other hand would render affected areas effectively stuck in this interim state for decades: habitable, but not safe for constant habitation.

Initially, gamma radiation from the fission products of an equivalent size fission-fusion-fission bomb are much more intense than [[cobalt-60|Co-60]]: 15,000 times more intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week; 5 times more intense at 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission product fallout radiation levels drop off rapidly, so that Co-60 fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 times more intense at 5 years. The very long-lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co again after about 75 years.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Weapons FAQ: 1.6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html#nfaq1.6|title=Section 1.0 Types of Nuclear Weapons|work=nuclearweaponarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, a device containing 510 [[metric ton]]s of Co-59 can spread 1 g of the material to each square km of the Earth's surface (510,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). If one assumes that all of the material is converted to Co-60 at 100 percent efficiency and if it is spread evenly across the Earth's surface, it is possible for a single bomb to kill every person on Earth. However, in fact, complete 100% conversion into Co-60 is unlikely; a 1957 British experiment at Maralinga showed that Co-59's neutron absorption ability was much lower than predicted, resulting in a very limited formation of Co-60 isotope in practice.

In addition, another important point in considering the effects of cobalt bombs is that deposition of fallout is not even throughout the path downwind from a detonation, so that there are going to be areas relatively unaffected by fallout and places where there is unusually intense fallout, so that the Earth would not be universally rendered lifeless by a cobalt bomb.&lt;ref name="gandd"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Effects of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United States Department of Defense and Department of Energy |date=1977 |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.alternatewars.com/WW3/WW3_Documents/Weapon_Effects/Effects_1977_09.pdf |editor1=Samuel Glasstone |editor2=Philip J. Dolan |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fallout and devastation following a nuclear detonation does not scale upwards linearly with the explosive yield (equivalent to tons of TNT). As a result, the concept of "overkill"—the idea that one can simply estimate the destruction and fallout created by a thermonuclear weapon of the size postulated by Leo Szilard's "cobalt bomb" thought experiment by extrapolating from the effects of thermonuclear weapons of smaller yields—is fallacious.&lt;ref name="bmart"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Martin |title=The global health effects of nuclear war |journal=Current Affairs Bulletin |volume=59 |number=7 |date=December 1982 |pages=14–26 |url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82cab/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2017}}

==Example of radiation levels vs. time==
Assume a cobalt bomb deposits intense fallout causing a dose rate of 10 [[sievert]]s (Sv) per hour. At this dose rate, any unsheltered person exposed to the fallout would receive a lethal dose in about 30 minutes (assuming a [[LD50|median lethal dose]] of 5 Sv). People in well-built shelters would be safe due to [[radiation protection|radiation shielding]].

After one half-life of 5.27 years, only half of the cobalt-60 will have decayed, and the dose rate in the affected area would be 5 Sv/hour. At this dose rate, a person exposed to the radiation would receive a lethal dose in 1 hour.

After 10 half-lives (about 53 years), the dose rate would have decayed to around 10 mSv/hour. At this point, a healthy person could spend 1 to 4 days exposed to the fallout with no immediate effects.

After 20 half-lives (about 105 years), the dose rate would have decayed to around 10 μSv/hour. At this stage, humans could remain unsheltered full-time since their yearly radiation dose would be about 80 mSv. However, this yearly dose rate is on the order of 30 times greater than the peacetime exposure rate of 2.5 mSv/year. As a result, the rate of cancer incidence in the survivor population would likely increase.

After 25 half-lives (about 130 years), the dose rate from cobalt-60 would have decayed to less than 0.4 μSv/hour (natural background radiation) and could be considered negligible.

==Decontamination==
{{See also|Cactus Dome|Radioactive contamination#Decontamination}}
In practice it is unlikely that people would simply sit and wait for nuclear decay to go to completion, as in all historical fallout cases, decontamination of valuable land has occurred. This is most commonly done with the use of simple equipment such as [[lead glass]] covered [[excavators]] and [[bulldozers]], similar to those employed in the [[Lake Chagan]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEqYroQEtA8|title=Born of Nuclear Blast: Russia's Lakes of Mystery|date=November 28, 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; By skimming off the thin layer of fallout on the [[topsoil]] surface and burying it in the likes of a deep trench along with isolating it from [[ground water]] sources, the gamma air dose is cut by orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-naweb.iaea.org/nafa/faqs-food-agriculture.html|title=Joint Division Questions &amp; Answers - Nuclear Emergency Response for Food and Agriculture, NAFA|author=Joint FAO/IAEA Programme|work=iaea.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency

==Russian "Status-6"==
In 2015, a page from an apparent Russian nuclear-armed torpedo design was accidentally or deliberately leaked. The design was titled "Oceanic Multipurpose System Status-6". The document stated the torpedo would create "wide areas of radioactive contamination, rendering them unusable for military, economic or other activity for a long time". Its payload would be "many tens of megatons in yield". Russian government newspaper [[Rossiiskaya Gazeta]] speculated that the warhead would be a cobalt bomb. It is not known whether the Status-6 is a real project, or whether it is Russian disinformation.&lt;ref name=BBC-Russia/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news|title=Buried In Trump's Nuclear Report: A Russian Doomsday Weapon|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/02/02/582087310/buried-in-trumps-nuclear-report-a-russian-doomsday-weapon|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=NPR.org|date=2 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the Pentagon's annual [[Nuclear Posture Review]] stated Russia is developing a system called the "Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System". If Status-6 does exist, it is not publicly known whether the leaked 2015 design is accurate, nor whether the 2015 claim that the torpedo might be a cobalt bomb is genuine.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. calls for new nuclear weapons as Russia develops nuclear-armed torpedo|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/02/u-s-reverse-obama-decisions-catch-up-russia-china-rapidly-expanding-nuclear-capabilities-reverse-oba/302746002/|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=USA TODAY|date=2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status-6 was officially disclosed and confirmed by Vladimir Putin in 2018 during his display of new Russian offensive weapons, including the Satan-2, Air Launched Iskander, Nuclear cruise-missile, and hypersonic glider.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesaker.is/putins-stunning-revelations-about-new-russian-weapons-systems/&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In the 4th act of the classic [[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]] episode "[[Obsession (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Obsession]]", Ensign Garrovick refers to 10,000 Cobalt Bombs not equaling the power of less than one ounce of Antimatter.  

In ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1970) the main character, upon seeing that the underground people worship a giant bomb that can wipe out the world, comments "They finally made one, cased in cobalt" in reference to a cobalt bomb that could wipe out the world. Similarly, in the bestselling ''[[On the Beach (novel)|On the Beach]]'' (1957) the cobalt bomb was a symbol of man's hubris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=P. D.|title=Doomsday Men: The Real Dr Strangelove and the Dream of the Superweapon|publisher=Penguin UK|date=25 September 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the black comedy ''[[Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), a type of cobalt-salted bomb is employed, with a [[Dead Hand (nuclear war)|Dead Hand]] mechanism, by the Soviet Union as a nuclear deterrent: if the system detects any nuclear attack, the doomsday device will be automatically unleashed. With unfortunate timing, a mentally ill American officer orders an attack on the USSR. One American bomber piloted by a hapless and unknowing crew gets through to their target; the Dead Hand mechanism works as designed and initiates a worldwide nuclear holocaust. The Russian Ambassador says "If you take, say, fifty H-bombs in the hundred megaton range and jacket them with Cobalt Thorium G, when they are exploded they will produce a doomsday shroud. A lethal cloud of radioactivity which will encircle the earth for ninety-three years!"

In the ''[[Spectreman]]'' episodes "Smash Alien Igorl!!" and "Enigma of the Cobalt Monster", the villainous Dr. Gori and race of Igorl aliens create a cobalt bomb from a heavy amount of cobalt found beneath a small village and place it within a monster, planning for it to destroy the world due to it reacting strongly to Earth's polluted atmosphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6298">A '''compulsion loop''' or a  '''core loop''' is a [[habitual]], designed chain of activities that will be repeated to gain a [[neurochemical]] reward such as the release of [[dopamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kim: [http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JosephKim/20140323/213728/The_Compulsion_Loop_Explained.php The Compulsion Loop Explained], [[Gamasutra]], 03/23/14&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsion loops are deliberately used in [[video game design]] as an [[extrinsic motivation]] for players, but may also result from other activities that unintentionally create such loops.

==In game design==
Compulsion loops can be used as a replacement for game content, especially in [[Grinding (video gaming)|grinding]] and [[freemium]] game experience models. The opposite of rewarding predictable, tedious and repetitive tasks are reward action contingency based systems, where players overcome game challenges with clear signals of progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming Gaming and Computer Simulation Technologies across Industries|last=Brock|first=Dubbels|date=2016-11-23|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=9781522518181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players perform an action, are rewarded, another possibility opens and the cycle repeats.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Stuart: [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/21/candy-crush-angry-birds-psychology-compulsive-casual-games-mobile-flappy-birds My favourite waste of time: why Candy Crush and Angry Birds are so compulsive], [[The Guardian]], 21 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The [[positive reinforcement]] effect can be strengthened by adding a [[variable ratio]] schedule, where each response has a chance of producing a reward. Another strategy is an avoidance schedule, where the players work to postpone a negative consequence.&lt;ref&gt;John Hopson: [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131494/behavioral_game_design.php Behavioral Game Design], [[Gamasutra]], April 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example of a compulsion loop in video games is the ''[[Monster Hunter]]'' series by [[Capcom]]. Players take the role of a monster hunter, using a variety of weapons and armor to slay or trap the creatures. By doing so, they gain monster parts and other loot that can be used to craft new weapons and equipment. The loop presents itself that players use their current equipment to hunt monsters with a given difficulty level that provide parts that can be used to craft improved equipment. This then lets them face more difficult monsters that provide parts for even better gear. This is aided by the random nature of the drops, sometimes requiring players to repeat quests several times to get the right parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2016/12/02/the-first-monster-hunters | title = The First Monster Hunters | first = James | last = Busby | date = December 2, 2016 | access-date = June 20, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/monster-hunter-generations-review-nintendo-capcom | title = Monster Hunter Generations review – fantastic beast hunt hits new heights | first = Rich | last = Stranton | date = July 15, 2016 | access-date = June 20, 2017 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of compulsion loop are offered through many games in the form of a [[loot box]] or similar term, depending on the game. Loot boxes are earned progressively by continuing to play the game; this may be as a reward for winning a match, purchasable through in-game currency that one earns in game, or through [[microtransaction]]s with real-world funds. Loot boxes contain a fixed number of randomly chosen in-game items, with at least one guaranteed to be of a higher rarity than the others. For many games, these items are simply customization options for the player's avatar that has no direct impact on gameplay, but they may also include gameplay-related items, or additional in-game currency. Loot boxes work under the psychology principle of variable rate reinforcement, which causes [[dopamine]] production at higher rates due to the unpredictable nature of the reward in contrast to fixed rewards.&lt;ref name="pcgamer loot"/&gt; In many games, opening a loot box is accompanied by visuals and audios to heighten the excitement and further this response. Overall, a loot box system can encourage the player to continue to play the game, and potentially spend real-world funds to gain loot boxes immediately.&lt;ref name="pcgamer loot"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/behind-the-addictive-psychology-and-seductive-art-of-loot-boxes/ | title = Behind the addictive psychology and seductive art of loot boxes | first = Alex | last = Wiltshire | date = September 28, 2017 | access-date = September 28, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
It is hypothesized that [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] symptoms arise from a compulsion loop and an obsession loop.&lt;ref name="ZhangZhang2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Zhong-Ming|last2=Zhang|first2=Zhong-Liang|last3=Li|first3=Hong|title=Double conflicts model and anxiety ratification therapy hypotheses of obsessive–compulsive disorder|journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|volume=75|issue=6|year=2010|pages=586–589|issn=0306-9877|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2010.07.039|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hong_Li29/publication/45707428_Double_conflicts_model_and_anxiety_ratification_therapy_hypotheses_of_obsessive-compulsive_disorder/links/552e30230cf2acd38cb9018a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Encouraging players to return to the game world can lead to [[video game addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Mez Breeze: [https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/01/12/what-makes-games-so-addictive/ A quiet killer: Why video games are so addictive], TNW, Jan 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=April 2018}} [[Internet addiction disorder]] can also result from a compulsion loop created by users in checking email, websites, and social media to see the results of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/opinion/sunday/addicted-to-distraction.html?_r=0 | title = Addicted to Distraction | first = Tony | last = Schwartz | date =November 29, 2015 | accessdate = March 20, 2017 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5270">'''Duration neglect''' is the [[psychology|psychological]] observation that people's judgments of the unpleasantness of painful experiences depend very little on the duration of those experiences. Multiple experiments have found that these judgments tend to be affected by two factors: the ''peak'' (when the experience was the most painful) and how quickly the pain diminishes. If it diminishes more slowly, the experience is judged to be more painful. Hence, the term "[[peak–end rule]]" describes this process of evaluation.&lt;ref name="WatsonMartin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald Ross Watson|author2=Colin R. Martin|title=Handbook of Behavior, Food and Nutrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuAEPOPbW6MC&amp;pg=PA669|accessdate=6 September 2013|date=15 April 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-92271-3|page=669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HolyoakMorrison2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith J.

Duration neglect is a specific form of the more general [[extension neglect]].

== Boundaries ==
Duration neglect appears to be limited to unfamiliar experiences. When research participants evaluate experiences with which they are or made familiar, such as a telephone ringing or their regular commute, they appear to be sensitive to the duration of experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Duration sensitivity depends on stimulus familiarity.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0015219|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|pages = 177–186|volume = 138|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0015219|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Karim S.|last2 = Kassam|first3 = Christopher K.|last3 = Hsee|first4 = Eugene M.|last4 = Caruso}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, providing participants with a modulus (i.e., a standard of comparison) by which to evaluate the duration of events, also makes them sensitive to duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When does duration matter in judgment and decision making?|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0096-3445.129.4.508|journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|pages = 508–523|volume = 129|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/0096-3445.129.4.508|first = Dan|last = Ariely|first2 = George|last2 = Loewenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
In one study, [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Barbara Fredrickson]] showed subjects pleasant or aversive film clips. When reviewing the clips mentally at a later time, subjects did not appear to take the length of the stimuli into account, instead judging them as if they were only a series of affective "snapshots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fredrickson|first=Barbara L.|author2=Daniel Kahneman|title=Duration neglect in retrospective evaluations of affective episodes|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|year=1993|volume=65|issue=1|pages=45–55|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.1.45|pmid=8355141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another demonstration, Kahneman and Fredrickson with other collaborators had subjects place their hands in painfully cold water. Under one set of instructions, they had to keep their hand in the water for an additional 30 seconds as the water was slowly heated to a warmer but still uncomfortably cold level, and under another set of instructions they were to remove their hand immediately. Otherwise, both experiences were the same. Most subjects chose to repeat the longer experience. Subjects apparently judged the experience according to the peak–end rule (in other words, according to its worst and final moments only), paying little attention to duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel |author2=Barbara L. Fredrickson |author3=Charles A. Schreiber |author4=Donald A. Redelmeier|title=When More Pain Is Preferred to Less: Adding a Better End|journal=[[Psychological Science]]|year=1993|volume=4|issue=6|pages=401–405|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00589.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duration neglect can be observed in medicine, as it may lead patients to be inaccurate when judging whether their symptoms are improving with treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redelmeier|first=Donald A.|title=Determining Whether a Patient is Feeling Better: Pitfalls from the Science of Human Perception|journal=[[Journal of General Internal Medicine]]|year=2011|volume=26|issue=8|pages=900–906|doi=10.1007/s11606-011-1655-3|pmc=3138972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of duration neglect may be reduced or eliminated by having participants answer in graphical format, or give a rating for every five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liersch|first=M. J.|author2=C. R. M. Mackenzie|title=Duration neglect by numbers -- and its elimination by graphs|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=2009|volume=108|pages=303–314|url=http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/Liersch&amp;McKenzie2009OBHDP.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2008.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duration neglect is a subtype of [[extension neglect]] and a component of [[affective forecasting]].

'''Dyschronometria''' is a condition of [[cerebellum|cerebellar]] dysfunction in which an individual cannot accurately estimate the amount of time that has passed (i.e., distorted [[time perception]]). It is associated with [[cerebellar ataxia]],&lt;ref name="Neuropsychological disorders induced by cerebellar damage"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lagarde, J. |author2=Hajjioui, A. |author3=Yelnik, A.  |title=Neuropsychological disorders induced by cerebellar damage |journal=Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine |volume=52 |year=2009 |pages=360–370 |pmid=19874739 |doi=10.1016/j.rehab.2009.02.002 |url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877065709000335/1-s2.0-S1877065709000335-main.pdf?_tid=5111e03cff881f73bcdf4407926728e4&amp;acdnat=1332173274_02816b6e12c719ffef2534fa625f496b |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferrarin, M, Gironi, M, Mendozzi, L, Nemni, R, Mazzoleni, P, &amp; Rabuffetti, M"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrarin|first=M|author2=Gironi, M |author3=Mendozzi, L |author4=Nemni, R |author5=Mazzoleni, P |author6=Rabuffetti, M |title=Procedure for the quantitative evaluation of motor disturbances in cerebellar ataxic patients|journal=Med.

Lesions to the cerebellum can cause [[dyssynergia]], [[dysmetria]], [[dysdiadochokinesia]], [[dysarthria]], and ataxia of stance and gait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diener|first=HC|author2=Dichgans, J|title=Pathophysiology of Cerebellar Ataxia|journal=Movement Disorders|year=1992|volume=7|issue=2|pages=95–109|pmid=1584245|doi=10.1002/mds.870070202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyschronometria can result from [[autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia]] (ADCA).&lt;ref name="Autosomal Dominant Cerebellar Ataxia"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whaley, N.R. |author2=Fujioka, S. |author3=Wszolek, Z.K.  |title=Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I: A review of the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics |journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases |volume=6 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-33 |year=2011 |pages=33 |pmid=21619691 |pmc=3123548 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Common signs of dyschronometria are often generic to cerebellar ataxia, including a lack of spatial awareness, poor [[short term memory]], and inability to keep track of time.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The defining symptoms, while not completely understood, involve time perception. For example, when asked to wait for thirty seconds, or tap every second that has gone by, those affected will be able to perform the task for a short time and then become derailed. This can result from a loss of focus, however, more often than not the individual affected can no longer tell what they are doing and they become disoriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/4055425.stm |title=Cerebellar ataxia |accessdate=2007-07-29 |format= |work= BBC News| date=2004-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes form in forgetting basic time keeping unless a timer is set, such as when cooking for example. Dyschronometria does not affect the 24-hour [[circadian rhythm]], which is sustained by a different biological process.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Gray707.png|thumbnail|right|Cross-section of human cerebellum, showing the [[dentate nucleus]], as well as the [[pons]] and [[inferior olivary nucleus]]]]

==Causes==
The most common cause of cerebellar ataxia, and by extension dyschronometria, is cerebellar damage. This can be by form of a trauma, or by disease and genetics.{{mcn|date=June 2015}} Examples of trauma include a car accident, stroke, [[epilepsy]], and head trauma.&lt;ref name="Behavioral Effects"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tobe, E.H. |title=Behavioral Effects of Incomplete Temporal Lobe Necrosis and Cerebellar Damage |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=71 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.01.005 |year=2012 |issue=9 |pages=e41–2 |pmid=22305977}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traumas are especially detrimental to elderly and children due to the decrease in brain matter, thus making these events if taken place have an increased risk of damaging the cerebellum. This also explains why dyschronometria is seen more commonly in the elderly due to the deterioration of physical brain matter. Other probable causes for the deterioration of brain matter in the elderly include increased [[supranational activation]], decreased [[cerebellar activation]] (which is consistent with [[Fronto-Cerebellar Dissociation|fronto-cerebellar dissociation]]).&lt;ref name="Transient achromatopsia in vertebrobasilar insufficiency"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lapresle, J. |author2=Metreau, R. |author3=Annabi, A. |title=Transient achromatopsia in Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency |journal=Journal of Neurology |volume=215 |year=1977 |pages=155–158 |doi=10.1007/bf00313063 |url=http://&lt;Go |issue=2 |pmid=68108 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyslexia===
An interesting case of dyschronometria has to do with [[dyslexia]]. When dyslexia was studied within children, it was found that dyslexic children were often [[Stress (biology)|stressed]] as well as mentally exhausted. These children would place little to no importance on their present state, a behavior that would continue into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Dyslexic Children"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bruno, J.E. |author2=Maguire, S.R. |title=Perception and Allocation of time by dyslexic children |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=77 |doi=10.2466/pms.1993.77.2.419 |year=1993 |issue=2 |pages=419–32 |pmid=8247661 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear as to whether dyslexia is a symptom of dyschronometria, a cause, or both.

===Dementia===
[[Dementia]] has a huge effect on dyschronometria and was one of the main sources of how dyschronometria was discovered. Through studies, dementia is both a cause and an effect of dyschronometria. This has to do completely with the fact that with dementia the brain is constantly rewiring itself and thus information becomes lost causing the person who had dementia to become confused as well as disoriented, and in most cases completely unaware of the passage of time.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} As a cause, dyschronometria causes the person to become disoriented and completely unaware of time, thus making bits and pieces of their brain involving a memory to become lost, ultimately leading to dementia in the long term. This is how dyschronometria is a precursor to dementia.&lt;ref name="Cerebellar Ataxic Gait"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mochizuki, H. |author2=Ugawa, Y. |title=Cerebellar Ataxic Gait |journal=Brain and Nerve (Tokyo) |volume=62 |year=2010 |pages=1203–1210 |url=&lt;Go to ISI&gt;://BIOSIS:PREV201100010038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Errors and Inaccuracies==

===Diagnosing===
Despite dyschronometria's easily recognizable symptoms, the fact that they may also be present in other cerebellar ataxias can make diagnosis difficult.{{mcn|date=June 2015}} Other ataxias may also have symptoms that affect gait, speech, thought process, spatial awareness, and time orientation used in their diagnoses, covering up the fact that most of these patients also have dyschronometria. The most common ataxias dyschronometria has been seen to be evident in are [[dyssynergia]], [[dysmetria]], [[dysdiadochokinesia]], [[dysarthria]] as well as ataxias effecting stance and gait. Dyslexia can be another problem in those individuals affected by dyschronometria, however it is uncertain whether dyslexia is developed or worsened by having it, or if it is the opposite in that having dyslexia increases the chance of developing dyschronometria.{{mcn|date=June 2015}} Another problem that dyschronometria faces in detection is that it is a relatively new term for this side effect and precursor to dementia, compared with other cerebellar ataxias such as those mentioned above. Even when dyschronometria is detected, it has usually progressed to the point where it cannot be reversed, and there is no benefit in taking the testing medication to either slow down the dyschronometria or the process of dementia setting in, which is what dyschronometria is a signal for.

However the greatest error in diagnosing dyschronometria is that this cerebellar ataxia hides itself in its symptoms and signs. The signs seen in those diagnosed with dyschronometria are not obvious, and are often mistaken for other cerebellar ataxias or dementia by medical professionals. In addition,  medical professionals usually expect to see circadian rhythm being disrupted by noting sleeping cycles and patterns that have no logical sense to them, which has nothing to do with dyschronometria. Other errors in diagnosing dyschronometria include the idea that those who have dyschronometria have a speech impediment, suffer from delusions bordering psychosis, impairment of long term memory, or the complete loss of conscious understanding of time. These misconceptions mostly stem from the fact that this cerebellar ataxia is rarely diagnosed without being seen in dementia or with another ataxia.&lt;ref name="Neuropsychological disorders induced by cerebellar damage" /&gt;

===Clinical testing===
Testing and diagnosing for dyschronometria also been shown to be ineffective. Dementia is caught so late despite the signals seeming obvious because psychological tests that try to catch signs of dementia, such as dyschronometria, are not very helpful. With these tests, the bell curves formed after statistical analysis and a wide range among normal test takers ensure that only patients that have extreme abnormal tests, test positive, and these cases are often already obvious to diagnose.&lt;ref name="Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the cerebellum"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shibusawa, N. |author2=Hashimoto, K. |author3=Yamada, M.  |title=Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the cerebellum |journal=Cerebellum |volume=7 |year=2008 |pages=84–95 |doi=10.1007/s12311-008-0033-0 |url=&lt;Go to ISI&gt;://WOS:000257960400010 |pmid=18418668 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosing of dyschronometria is also difficult due to the lack of research as well as professionals concentrating in this cerebellar ataxia. Neuroscientists are only just starting to do more research into this lack of awareness and keeping time. When the science and the tests are more specialized and this topic has been looked into at a greater depth, the sensitivity of the tests that have been and will be conducted will be able to give more answer to the questions that are continuing to arise.

==Treatments==
It has not been determined what role drugs may play in the treatment of cerebellar ataxia.{{mcn|date=June 2015}} In the research done by Trouillas in Lyon, France, the pharmacology of cerebellar ataxia was examined by manipulating key components found at the nerve level within the cerebellum or the inferior Olive. This was done mostly through the modification of the [[GABA]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]] receptors which did seem to show positive results in the primary stages of the experimentation. The clinical benefits presented in this study justifying the prescription of d-l-5-HTP or better with the l-5-HTP with benserazide to patients with certain cerebellar ataxias including that of Dyschronometria. At the present as stated, this is the best indication for treatment of the cerebellar cortical atrophies. Even still it is important to stress that the response to this treatment may be slow and irregular.&lt;ref name=TROUILLAS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trouillas |first=P |title=Regression of Cerebellar syndrome with long-term administration of 5-HTP or the combination 5-HTP-Benserazide |journal=Italian Journal of Neurological Sciences |year=1984 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=253–266 |doi=10.1007/BF02043955 |url=http://&lt;Go |pmid=6334064 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{npsn|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroplastic rehabilitation===
Previously, [[neuroplasticity]] used as a rehabilitation method were looked into as a potential treatment for dyschronometria. However these studies were not further developed since the 1980s. With current techniques and research from the neuroscience community, this is still a viable option not to eliminate the cerebellar ataxia, but to slow its progress of development.&lt;ref name="Disability and Rehabilitation"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morgan, M.

'''Equality of sacrifice''' is a term used in [[political theory]] and [[political philosophy]] to refer to the perceived fairness of a coercive policy.

[[John Stuart Mill]] noticed that citizens often view [[tax]]ation laws as being fair, as long as taxation is also applied equally to everyone else in society.&lt;ref&gt;"As a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it, whatever sacrifices it requires from them should be made to bear as nearly as possible with the same pressure upon all [...] Equality of taxation, therefore, as a maxim of politics, means equality of sacrifice." [[John Stuart Mill]]. 1848. ''[[Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy]]'', p. 804 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2006747]&lt;/ref&gt; Political theorist [[Margaret Levi]] applied the term to the perceived fairness of [[conscription]] in democracies, to which citizens may consent as long as conscription is enforced as a universal duty &amp;ndash; as opposed to elitist and exceptionalist policies, as it will sometimes occur in partial [[mobilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Margaret. 1997. ''Consent, Dissent and Patriotism''. Cambridge University Press ({{ISBN|052159961X}}) p. 26 &lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also adopted by [[Lee Iacocca]]&lt;ref&gt;Iacocca and Novak. 1984. ''[[Iacocca: An Autobiography]]''. New York: Bantam Books. Chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; who, as the president of [[Chrysler]], lowered his salary to less than a dollar a year before asking union members for radical wage cuts in order to deal with the company's financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Yeon and Mai-Dalton, Renate R. 1999. "The Model of Follower's Responses To Self-Sacrificial Leadership: An Empirical Test". ''The Leadership Quarterly'', Volume 10, Issue 3 (November 18) p. 398 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W5N-3XX6KF9-F&amp;_user=789722&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000043357&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=789722&amp;md5=634ac86977034115cf258410ce309fd1]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], Iacocca's example has often been mentioned in opposition to "unconditional" government bail-out of failing companies. In a letter to the leaders of the big three U.S. automakers, Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] said that before receiving a government bailout executives should follow the example of former Chrysler head Lee Iacocca and cut their own pay:

{{cquote|Lee Iacocca essentially worked for pennies to demonstrate leadership and forcefully prove to his colleagues that he was ready to make sacrifices to reinvigorate Chrysler [...] Today’s executives could learn a lot from this example. They should take every step possible, including cutting executive salaries and bonuses, and exhaust all alternatives before coming to the taxpayers for tens of billions of dollars in help.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Jason. Nov. 14, 2008. "Grassley calls on automakers to cut executive salaries". ''The Iowa Independent'' [http://iowaindependent.com/8496/grassley-calls-on-automakers-to-cut-executive-salaries] (Retrieved May 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some economists believe that the minimum wage laws in the United States lead to less equality because young black males are less likely to be able to get a job when the minimum wage is increased; this inequality exists primarily because young black workers typically live in urban areas where the food and drink industry, who mainly pay their workers minimum wage, are prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Even |first=William |title=Unequal Harm: Racial Disparities in the Employment Consequences of Minimum Wage Increases |url=http://epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=137 |publisher=Employment Policies Institute |accessdate=30 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184058/http://epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=137 |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Event correlation''' is a technique for making sense of a large number of events and pinpointing the few events that are really important in that mass of information. This is accomplished by looking for and analyzing relationships between events.

==History==

Event correlation has been used in various fields for many years:

:* since the 1970s, [[telecommunications]] and [[Industrial process|industrial process control]];
:* since the 1980s, [[network management]] and [[systems management]];
:* since the 1990s, [[IT service management]], [[Publish–subscribe pattern|publish-subscribe systems]] (pub/sub), [[Complex Event Processing]] (CEP) and [[Security Information and Event Management]] (SIEM);
:* since the early 2000s, [[Distributed Event-Based Systems]] and [[Business Activity Monitoring]] (BAM).

==Examples and application domains==

Integrated management is traditionally subdivided into various fields:

:* layer by layer: [[network management]], [[system management]], [[Service Level Management|service management]], etc.
:* by management function: [[performance management]], [[security management]], etc.

Event correlation takes place in different components depending on the field of study:

:* Within the field of [[network management]], event correlation is performed in a management platform typically known as a [[Network management station|Network Management Station]] or [[Network management system|Network Management System]] (NMS). For example, events may notify that a device has just rebooted or that a network link is currently down.

:* Within the field of [[systems management]], an event may for instance report that the CPU utilization of an e-business server has been at 100% for over 15 minutes.

:* Within the field of [[Service Level Management|service management]], an event may notify that a [[Service level objective|Service-Level Objective]] is not met for a given customer, for example.

:* Within the field of [[security management]], the management platform is usually known as the [[Security Information and Event Management]] (SIEM), and event correlation is often performed in a separate correlation engine. That engine may directly receive events in real time, or it may read them from SIEM storage. In this case, examples of monitored events include activity such as authentication, access to services and data, and output from point security tools such as an [[Intrusion detection system|Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) or [[antivirus software]].

In this article, we focus on event correlation in integrated management and provide links to other fields.

==Event correlation in integrated management==

The goal of ''integrated management'' is to integrate the management of networks (data, telephone and multimedia), systems (servers, databases and applications) and IT services in a coherent manner. The scope of this discipline notably includes [[network management]], [[systems management]] and [[Service level management|Service-Level Management]].

===Events and event correlator===

Event correlation usually takes place inside one or several management platforms. It is implemented by a piece of software known as the '''event correlator'''. This component is automatically fed with events originating from managed elements (applications, devices), monitoring tools, the [[Trouble ticket system|Trouble Ticket System]], etc. Each event captures something special (from the event source standpoint) that happened in the domain of interest to the event correlator, which will vary depending upon the type of analysis the correlator is attempting to perform.

The event correlator plays a key role in integrated management, for only within it do events from many disparate sources come together and allow for comparison across sources. For instance, this is where the failure of a service can be ascribed to a specific failure in the underlying [[IT infrastructure]], or where the root cause of a potential security attack can be identified.

Most event correlators can receive events from [[trouble ticket system]]s. However, only some of them are able to notify trouble ticket systems when a problem is solved, which partly explains the difficulty for [[Service Desk (ITSM)|Service Desk]]s to keep updated with the latest news. In theory, the integration of management in organizations requires the communication between the event correlator and the trouble ticket system to work both ways.

An event may convey an alarm or report an incident (which explains why event correlation used to be called '''alarm correlation'''), but not necessarily. It may also report that a situation goes back to normal, or simply send some information that it deems relevant (e.g., policy P has been updated on device D). The '''severity''' of the event is an indication given by the event source to the event destination of the priority that this event should be given while being processed.

===Step-by-step decomposition===

Event correlation can be decomposed into four steps: event filtering, event aggregation, event masking and root cause analysis. A fifth step (action triggering) is often associated with event correlation and therefore briefly mentioned here.

====Event filtering====

'''Event filtering''' consists in discarding events that are deemed to be irrelevant by the event correlator. For instance, a number of bottom-of-the-range devices are difficult to configure and occasionally send events of no interest to the management platform (e.g., printer P needs A4 paper in tray 1). Another example is the filtering of informational or debugging events by an event correlator that is only interested in availability and faults.

====Event aggregation====

'''Event aggregation''' is a technique where multiple events that are very similar (but not necessarily identical) are combined into an aggregate that represents the underlying event data. Its main objective is to summarize a collection of input events into a smaller collection that can be processed using various [[analytics]] methods. For example, the aggregate may provide statistical summaries of the underlying events and the resources that are affected by those events. Another example is temporal aggregation, when the same problem is reported over and over again by the event source, until the problem is finally solved.

'''Event de-duplication''' is a special type of event aggregation that consists in merging exact duplicates of the same event. Such duplicates may be caused by network instability (e.g., the same event is sent twice by the event source because the first instance was not acknowledged sufficiently quickly, but both instances eventually reach the event destination).

====Event masking====

'''Event masking''' (also known as ''topological masking'' in [[network management]]) consists of ignoring events pertaining to systems that are downstream of a failed system.  For example, servers that are downstream of a crashed router will fail availability polling.

====Root cause analysis====

'''[[Root cause analysis]]''' is the last and most complex step of event correlation. It consists of analyzing dependencies between events, based for instance on a model of the environment and dependency graphs, to detect whether some events can be explained by others. For example, if database D runs on server S and this server gets durably overloaded (CPU used at 100% for a long time), the event “the SLA for database D is no longer fulfilled” can be explained by the event “Server S is durably overloaded”.

====Action triggering====

At this stage, the event correlator is left with at most a handful of events that need to be acted upon. Strictly speaking, event correlation ends here. However, by language abuse, the event correlators found on the market (e.g., in [[network management]]) sometimes also include problem-solving capabilities. For instance, they may trigger corrective actions or further investigations automatically.

==Event correlation in other fields==

===Event correlation in ITIL===

The scope of [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]] (the ''Information Technology Infrastructure Library'') is larger than that of integrated management. However, event correlation in ITIL is quite similar to event correlation in integrated management.

In the ITIL version 2 framework, event correlation spans three processes: Incident Management, Problem Management and Service Level Management.

In the ITIL version 3 framework, event correlation takes place in the Event Management process. The event correlator is called a ''correlation engine''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">The '''extended mind thesis''' ('''EMT''') says that an agent's mind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor even body-bound, but extend into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonR&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/ |date=July 25, 2011}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Andy Clark|Clark]] and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] put it:

{{quote|Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?...We propose to pursue... an ''active externalism'', based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.|Andy Clark and David Chalmers: "[[The Extended Mind]]"&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3328150?sid=21105405194441&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739824&amp;uid=4 |title=The Extended Mind |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=1 |date=January 1998 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}; reprinted as: 
{{cite book |title= The Extended Mind |chapter=Chapter 2: The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |editor=Richard Menary  |pages=27–42 |isbn= 9780262014038 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010}}; and available on line as: {{cite web |title=The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=http://cogprints.org/320/1/extended.html |publisher=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question is raised as to the division point between the mind and the environment. The EMT proposes that some objects in the external environment are utilized by the [[mind]] in such a way that the objects can be seen as extensions of the mind itself. Specifically, the mind is seen to encompass every level of the cognitive process, which will often include the use of environmental aids.

==Criticism==

Philosophical arguments against the extended mind thesis include the following.&lt;ref name="Adams Aizawa"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ADADTB | title=Defending the bounds of cognition, in The Extended Mind (Eds, Richard Menary) |author1=Adams, Fred. |author2=Aizawa, Ken | year=2010 | pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# When focusing on cognition, the thesis confuses claims about what is constitutive about the concept of cognition with claims about causal influences on cognition (the "causal-constitutional fallacy"). For example, Adams and Aizawa (2010) write, "Question: Why did the pencil think that 2 + 2 = 4?, Clark’s Answer: Because it was coupled to the mathematician." 
# It stretches the limits of our ordinary concept of cognition too far ("cognitive bloating"), potentially implying that everything on the Internet is part of individual cognitive systems.
# It uses a coarse-grained functionalism about the mind that ignores plausible differences between internal and external processes, such as differences between beliefs and external props and devices; or for creating a notion of cognition too heterogeneous to make up a scientific natural kind.

Each of these arguments is addressed in Clark (2008), in which he notes:&lt;ref name="Supersizing"&gt;{{cite book | title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Clark, Andy | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# While coupling is important for cognition, that is not to say that it is sufficient – the coupling must play a functional role in cognition. Many couplings do not do so and thus would not be 'extensions' (and this is consistent with a strong extended mind thesis).
# Any putative part of a system – internal or external – is unlikely to yield "cognition" on its own. Thus, examples such as calculators, pencils, should be considered in parallel with neural regions. Simply looking at the part is not enough for cognition.
# One can imagine circumstances under which a biological being might retain information in non-neural ways (a hypothetical Martian with a bitmap-based memory, or humans with prosthetics to support memory). Thus, being neural cannot be a necessary condition for being cognitive.

While in ''Supersizing the Mind'' Clark defends a strong version of the hypothesis of [[extended cognition]] (contrasted with a hypothesis of embedded cognition) in other work, some of these objections have inspired more moderate reformulations of the extended mind thesis. Thus, the extended mind thesis may no longer depend on the parity considerations of Clark and Chalmers' original argument but, instead, emphasize the "complementarity" of internal and external elements of cognitive systems or processes. This version might be understood as emphasizing the explanatory value of the extended mind thesis for cognitive science rather than maintaining it as an ontological claim about the nature of mind or cognition.&lt;ref name="Supersizing" /&gt;

'''Female genital mutilation''' ('''FGM'''), also known as '''female genital cutting''' and '''female circumcision''',{{efn|[[Martha Nussbaum]] (''Sex and Social Justice'', 1999): "Although discussions sometimes use the terms 'female circumcision' and 'clitoridectomy', 'female genital mutilation' (FGM) is the standard generic term for all these procedures in the medical literature&amp;nbsp;... The term 'female circumcision' has been rejected by international medical practitioners because it suggests the fallacious analogy to male circumcision&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=119}}}} is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the [[external female genitalia]]. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. [[UNICEF]] estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt;

Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;For the circumcisers and blade: [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 2, 44–46; for the ages: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures differ according to the country or [[ethnic group]]. They include removal of the [[clitoral hood]] and [[clitoral glans]]; removal of the [[Labia minora|inner labia]]; and removal of the inner and [[Labia majora|outer labia]] and closure of the [[vulva]]. In this last procedure, known as [[#Type III|infibulation]], a small hole is left for the passage of urine and [[Menstruation|menstrual fluid]]; the [[vagina]] is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}

The practice is rooted in [[gender inequality]], attempts to control [[human female sexuality|women's sexuality]], and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who see it as a source of honour and fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 15; {{harvnb|Toubia|Sharief|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse health effects depend on the type of procedure; they can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, [[chronic pain]], the development of [[cyst]]s, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} There are no known health benefits.&lt;ref name=WHO2018health&gt;[[#WHO2018|WHO 2018]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been international efforts since the 1970s to persuade practitioners to abandon FGM, and it has been outlawed or restricted in most of the countries in which it occurs, although the laws are poorly enforced. Since 2010 the [[United Nations]] has called upon healthcare providers to stop performing all forms of the procedure, including [[#reinfibulation|reinfibulation]] after childbirth and symbolic "nicking" of the clitoral hood.&lt;ref name=UN2010Askew&gt;[[#UN2010|UN 2010]]; {{harvnb|Askew|Chaiban|Kalasa|Sen|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition to the practice is not without its critics, particularly among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], who have raised difficult questions about [[cultural relativism]] and the universality of [[human rights]].{{sfn|Shell-Duncan|2008}}

Until the 1980s FGM was widely known in English as female circumcision, implying an equivalence in severity with [[male circumcision]].{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=119}} From 1929 the [[National Council of Churches of Kenya|Kenya Missionary Council]] referred to it as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of [[Marion Stevenson|Marion Scott Stevenson]], a [[Church of Scotland]] missionary.{{sfn|Karanja|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&amp;pg=PA93 93], n.&amp;nbsp;631}} References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term ''female genital mutilation'' in the title of a paper in ''American Ethnologist'',{{sfn|Hayes|1975}} and four years later [[Fran Hosken]], an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females''.{{sfn|Hosken|1994}} The [[Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children]] began referring to it as female genital mutilation in 1990, and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) followed suit in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other English terms include ''female genital cutting'' (FGC) and ''female genital mutilation/cutting'' (FGM/C), preferred by those who work with practitioners.&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22/&gt;

In countries where FGM is common, the practice's many variants are reflected in dozens of terms, often alluding to purification.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bambara language]], spoken mostly in Mali, it is known as ''bolokoli'' ("washing your hands"){{sfn|Zabus|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZmWF3qxHo4C&amp;pg=PA47 47]}} and in the [[Igbo language]] in eastern Nigeria as ''isa aru'' or ''iwu aru'' ("having your bath").{{efn|For example, "a young woman must 'have her bath' before she has a baby".{{sfn|Zabus|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NCJiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40 40]}}}} A common [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for purification has the root ''t-h-r'', used for male and female circumcision (''tahur'' and ''tahara'').{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA30 30]}} It is also known in Arabic as ''khafḍ'' or ''khifaḍ''.{{sfn|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=3–5}} Communities may refer to FGM as "pharaonic" for [[infibulation]] and ''[[Sunnah|sunna]]'' circumcision for everything else.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=2–3}} ''Sunna'' means "path or way" in Arabic and refers to the tradition of [[Muhammad]], although none of the procedures are required within Islam.{{sfn|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=3–5}} The term ''infibulation'' derives from [[Fibula (brooch)|''fibula'']], Latin for clasp; the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] reportedly fastened clasps through the foreskins or labia of slaves to prevent sexual intercourse. The surgical infibulation of women came to be known as pharaonic circumcision in Sudan, and as Sudanese circumcision in Egypt.{{sfn|Kouba|Muasher|1985|loc=96–97}} In Somalia it is known simply as ''qodob'' ("to sew up").{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA190 190]}}

The procedures are generally performed by a traditional circumciser (cutter or ''exciseuse'') in the girls' homes, with or without anaesthesia. The cutter is usually an older woman, but in communities where the male [[Barber#History|barber]] has assumed the role of health worker he will perform FGM too.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 42–44 and table 5, 181 (for cutters), 46 (for home and anaesthesia).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|UNICEF 2005: "The large majority of girls and women are cut by a traditional practitioner, a category which includes local specialists (cutters or ''exciseuses''), traditional birth attendants and, generally, older members of the community, usually women. This is true for over 80 percent of the girls who undergo the practice in Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Yemen. In most countries, medical personnel, including doctors, nurses and certified midwives, are not widely involved in the practice."&lt;ref name=UNICEF2005&gt;[[#UNICEF2005|UNICEF 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;}} When traditional cutters are involved, non-sterile devices are likely to be used, including knives, razors, scissors, glass, sharpened rocks and fingernails.{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491}} According to a nurse in Uganda, quoted in 2007 in ''The Lancet'', a cutter would use one knife on up to 30 girls at a time.{{sfn|Wakabi|2007}} Health professionals are often involved in Egypt, Kenya, Indonesia and Sudan; in Egypt 77 percent of FGM procedures, and in Indonesia over 50 percent, were performed by medical professionals as of 2008 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt; Women in Egypt reported in 1995 that a [[local anaesthetic]] had been used on their daughters in 60 percent of cases, a [[general anaesthetic]] in 13 percent, and neither in 25 percent (two percent were missing/don't know).&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification{{anchor|classification}}==
===Variation===
The WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA issued a joint statement in 1997 defining FGM as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons".&lt;ref name=WHO2008pp4,22/&gt; The procedures vary considerably according to ethnicity and individual practitioners. During a 1998 survey in Niger, women responded with over 50 different terms when asked what was done to them.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt; Translation problems are compounded by the women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=190}} Several studies have suggested that survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction.{{sfn|Jackson|Akweongo|Sakeah|Hodgson|2003}} In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it.{{sfn|Klouman|Manongi|Klepp|2005}} In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.{{sfn|Elmusharaf|Elhadi|Almroth|2006}}

===Types===
[[#Household surveys|Standard questionnaires]] from United Nations bodies ask women whether they or their daughters have undergone the following: (1) cut, no flesh removed (symbolic nicking); (2) cut, some flesh removed; (3) sewn closed; or (4) type not determined/unsure/doesn't know.{{efn|UNICEF 2013: "These categories do not fully match the WHO typology. ''Cut, no flesh removed'' describes a practice known as nicking or pricking, which currently is categorized as Type IV. ''Cut, some flesh removed'' corresponds to Type I (clitoridectomy) and Type II (excision) combined. And ''sewn closed'' corresponds to Type III, infibulation."&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt;}} The most common procedures fall within the "cut, some flesh removed" category and involve complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=189}}; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization (a UN agency) created a more detailed typology: Types I–III vary in how much tissue is removed; Type III is equivalent to the UNICEF category "sewn closed"; and Type IV describes miscellaneous procedures, including symbolic nicking.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4, 23–28; {{harvnb|Abdulcadir|Catania|Hindin|Say|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FGC Types.svg|right|250px|alt=diagram]]
{{anchor|Type I}}'''Type I''' is "partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce". Type Ia{{efn|One WHO report refers to Type 1a as ''circumcision''.&lt;ref name=WHO2016types&gt;[[#WHO2016|WHO 2016]], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368486/box/ch1.box1 Box 1.1 "Types of FGM"].&lt;/ref&gt;}} involves removal of the [[clitoral hood]] only. This is rarely performed alone.{{efn|WHO (2018): Type 1&amp;nbsp;... the partial or total removal of the clitoris&amp;nbsp;... and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris)."&lt;ref name=WHO2018health/&gt;{{pb}}
WHO (2008): "[There is a] common tendency to describe Type I as removal of the prepuce, whereas this has not been documented as a traditional form of female genital mutilation. However, in some countries, medicalized female genital mutilation can include removal of the prepuce only (Type Ia) (Thabet and Thabet, 2003), but this form appears to be relatively rare (Satti et al., 2006). Almost all known forms of female genital mutilation that remove tissue from the clitoris also cut all or part of the clitoral glans itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 25. Also see {{harvnb|Toubia|1994}} and {{harvnb|Horowitz|Jackson|Teklemariam|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The more common procedure is Type Ib ([[clitoridectomy]]), the complete or partial removal of the [[clitoral glans]] (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with her thumb and index finger and cuts it off.{{efn|Susan Izett and [[Nahid Toubia]] (WHO, 1998): "[T]he clitoris is held between the thumb and index finger, pulled out and amputated with one stroke of a sharp object."&lt;ref name=WHO1998&gt;[[#WHO1998|WHO 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{anchor|Type II}}'''Type II''' (excision) is the complete or partial removal of the [[Labia minora|inner labia]], with or without removal of the clitoral glans and [[Labia majora|outer labia]]. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral glans and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral glans, inner and outer labia. ''Excision'' in French can refer to any form of FGM.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

{{anchor|Type III}}'''Type III''' ([[infibulation]] or pharaonic circumcision), the "sewn closed" category, involves the removal of the external genitalia and fusion of the wound. The inner and/or outer labia are cut away, with or without removal of the clitoral glans.{{efn|WHO 2014: "Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation).{{pb}}"Type IIIa, removal and apposition of the labia minora; Type IIIb, removal and apposition of the labia majora."&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;}} Type III is found largely in northeast Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan (although not in South Sudan). According to one 2008 estimate, over eight million women in Africa are living with Type III FGM.{{efn|USAID 2008: "Infibulation is practiced largely in countries located in northeastern Africa: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.&amp;nbsp;... Sudan alone accounts for about 3.5 million of the women.&amp;nbsp;... [T]he estimate of the total number of women infibulated in [Djibouti, Somalia, Eritrea, northern Sudan, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Tanzania, for women 15–49 years old] comes to 8,245,449, or just over eight million women."{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=13–14}}}} According to UNFPA in 2010, 20 percent of women with FGM have been infibulated.&lt;ref name=UNFPATypeIIIestimate&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/resources/promoting-gender-equality "Frequently Asked Questions on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting"], United Nations Population Fund, April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In Somalia "[t]he child is made to squat on a stool or mat facing the circumciser at a height that offers her a good view of the parts to be handled.&amp;nbsp;... adult helpers grab and pull apart the legs of the girl.&amp;nbsp;... If available, this is the stage at which a local anaesthetic would be used":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The element of speed and surprise is vital and the circumciser immediately grabs the clitoris by pinching it between her nails aiming to amputate it with a slash. The organ is then shown to the senior female relatives of the child who will decide whether the amount that has been removed is satisfactory or whether more is to be cut off.

After the clitoris has been satisfactorily amputated&amp;nbsp;... the circumciser can proceed with the total removal of the labia minora and the paring of the inner walls of the labia majora. Since the entire skin on the inner walls of the labia majora has to be removed all the way down to the perineum, this becomes a messy business. By now, the child is screaming, struggling, and bleeding profusely, which makes it difficult for the circumciser to hold with bare fingers and nails the slippery skin and parts that are to be cut or sutured together.&amp;nbsp;...

Having ensured that sufficient tissue has been removed to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the opposite sides of the labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.&lt;ref name=Ismail2016p12&gt;{{harvnb|Ismail|2016|loc=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reinfibulation can involve cutting the vagina again to restore the pinhole size of the first infibulation. This might be performed before marriage, and after childbirth, divorce and widowhood.{{efn|Elizabeth Kelly, Paula J. Adams Hillard (''Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology'', 2005): "Women commonly undergo reinfibulation after a vaginal delivery. In addition to reinfibulation, many women in Sudan undergo a second type of re-suturing called El-Adel, which is performed to recreate the size of the vaginal orifice to be similar to the size created at the time of primary infibulation. Two small cuts are made around the vaginal orifice to expose new tissues to suture, and then sutures are placed to tighten the vaginal orifice and perineum. This procedure, also called re-circumcision, is primarily performed after vaginal delivery, but can also be performed before marriage, after cesarean section, after divorce, and sometimes even in elderly women as a preparation before death."{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491}}}}{{sfn|El Dareer|1982|loc=56–64}} Hanny Lightfoot-Klein interviewed hundreds of women and men in Sudan in the 1980s about sexual intercourse with Type III:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The penetration of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.&amp;nbsp;... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, with the help of the "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{{harvnb|Lightfoot-Klein|1989|loc=380}}; also see {{harvnb|El Dareer|1982|loc=42–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the age of eight, girls are encouraged to stretch their inner labia using sticks and massage. Girls in Uganda are told they may have difficulty giving birth without stretched labia.{{efn|WHO 2005: "In some areas (e.g. parts of Congo and mainland Tanzania), FGM entails the pulling of the labia minora and/or clitoris over a period of about 2 to 3 weeks. The procedure is initiated by an old woman designated for this task, who puts sticks of a special type in place to hold the stretched genital parts so that they do not revert back to their original size. The girl is instructed to pull her genitalia every day, to stretch them further, and to put additional sticks in to hold the stretched parts from time to time. This pulling procedure is repeated daily for a period of about two weeks, and usually no more than four sticks are used to hold the stretched parts, as further pulling and stretching would make the genital parts unacceptably long."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2005|WHO 2005]], 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;For the countries in which labia stretching is found (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe), see {{harvnb|Nzegwu|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA262 262]}}; for the rest, {{harvnb|Bagnol|Mariano|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA272 272–276] (272 for Uganda)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A definition of FGM from the WHO in 1995 included [[gishiri cutting]] and angurya cutting, found in Nigeria and Niger. These were removed from the WHO's 2008 definition because of insufficient information about prevalence and consequences.&lt;ref name="WHO 2008, 27"/&gt; Angurya cutting is excision of the [[hymen]], usually performed seven days after birth. Gishiri cutting involves cutting the vagina's front or back wall with a blade or penknife, performed in response to infertility, obstructed labour and other conditions. In a study by Nigerian physician Mairo Usman Mandara, over 30 percent of women with gishiri cuts were found to have [[vesicovaginal fistula]]e (holes that allow urine to seep into the vagina).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandara|2000|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA98 98], 100; for fistulae, 102}}; also see {{harvnb|Mandara|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Type III, other factors include how small a hole was left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, whether surgical thread was used instead of agave or acacia thorns, and whether the procedure was performed more than once (for example, to close an opening regarded as too wide or re-open one too small).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}

Common short-term complications include swelling, excessive bleeding, pain, [[Urinary retention|urine retention]], and healing problems/[[wound infection]]. A 2014 systematic review of 56 studies suggested that over one in ten girls and women undergoing any form of FGM, including symbolic nicking of the clitoris (Type IV), experience immediate complications, although the risks increased with Type III. The review also suggested that there was under-reporting.{{efn|Berg and Underland (Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, 2014): "There was evidence of under-reporting of complications. However, the findings show that the FGM/C procedure unequivocally causes immediate, and typically several, health complications during the FGM/C procedure and the short-term period. Each of the most common complications occurred in more than one of every ten girls and women who undergo FGM/C. The participants in these studies had FGM/C types I through IV, thus immediate complications such as bleeding and swelling occur in setting with all forms of FGM/C. Even FGM/C type I and type IV 'nick', the forms of FGM/C with least anatomical extent, presented immediate complications. The results document that multiple immediate and quite serious complications can result from FGM/C. These results should be viewed in light of long-term complications, such as obstetric and gynecological problems, and protection of human rights."{{sfn|Berg|Underland|2014|loc=2}}}} Other short-term complications include fatal bleeding, [[anaemia]], [[urinary infection]], [[septicaemia]], [[tetanus]], [[gangrene]], [[necrotizing fasciitis]] (flesh-eating disease), and [[endometritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=49}}; {{harvnb|Iavazzo|Sardi|Gkegkes|2013}}; {{harvnb|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many girls and women die as a result of the practice, because complications may not be recognized or reported. The practitioners' use of shared instruments is thought to aid the transmission of [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]], although no epidemiological studies have shown this.{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}}

Late complications vary depending on the type of FGM.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} They include the formation of scars and [[keloid]]s that lead to [[Stenosis|strictures]] and obstruction, [[epidermoid cyst]]s that may become infected, and [[neuroma]] formation (growth of nerve tissue) involving nerves that supplied the clitoris.{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}}{{sfn|Dave|Sethi|Morrone|2011}} An infibulated girl may be left with an opening as small as 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm, which can cause prolonged, drop-by-drop [[urination]], [[dysuria|pain while urinating]], and a feeling of needing to urinate all the time. Urine may collect underneath the scar, leaving the area under the skin constantly wet, which can lead to infection and the formation of small stones. The opening is larger in women who are sexually active or have given birth by vaginal delivery, but the [[urethra]] opening may still be obstructed by scar tissue. [[Vesicovaginal fistula|Vesicovaginal]] or [[rectovaginal fistula]]e can develop (holes that allow urine or faeces to seep into the vagina).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}{{sfn|Rushwan|2013}} This and other damage to the urethra and bladder can lead to infections and incontinence, [[dyspareunia|pain during sexual intercourse]] and [[infertility]].{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}} [[Dysmenorrhea|Painful periods]] are common because of the obstruction to the [[Menstruation|menstrual flow]], and blood can stagnate in the vagina and uterus. Complete obstruction of the vagina can result in [[hematocolpos]] and [[hematometra]] (where the vagina and uterus fill with menstrual blood).{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} The swelling of the abdomen that results from the collection of fluid, together with the lack of menstruation, can lead to suspicion of pregnancy; Asma El Dareer, a Sudanese physician, reported in 1979 that a girl in Sudan with this condition was killed by her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|El Dareer|1982|loc=37}}. Also see Asma El Dareer, "Preliminary report on a study on prevalence and epidemiology of female circumcision in Sudan today", WHO seminar, Khartoum, 10–15 February 1979; and Asma el Dareer, "Female circumcision and its consequences for mother and child", Yaounde, 12–15 December 1979, cited in {{harvnb|Rushwan|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy, childbirth===
[[File:Teaching_communities_about_FGM-C_(12345176104).jpg|thumb|Materials used to teach communities in [[Burkina Faso]] about FGM]]
FGM may place women at higher risk of problems during pregnancy and childbirth, which are more common with the more extensive FGM procedures.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} Infibulated women may try to make childbirth easier by eating less during pregnancy to reduce the baby's size.&lt;ref name=RashidRashid2007/&gt;{{rp|99}} In women with vesicovaginal or rectovaginal fistulae, it is difficult to obtain clear urine samples as part of prenatal care, making the diagnosis of conditions such as [[pre-eclampsia]] harder.{{sfn|Kelly|Hillard|2005|loc=491–492}} Cervical evaluation during labour may be impeded and labour prolonged or obstructed. Third-degree [[laceration]] (tears), [[Human anus|anal-sphincter]] damage and emergency [[caesarean section]] are more common in infibulated women.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}&lt;ref name=RashidRashid2007&gt;{{harvnb|Rashid|Rashid|2007|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Perinatal mortality#Neonatal mortality|Neonatal mortality]] is increased. The WHO estimated in 2006 that an additional 10–20 babies die per 1,000 deliveries as a result of FGM. The estimate was based on a study conducted on 28,393 women attending delivery wards at 28 obstetric centres in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan. In those settings all types of FGM were found to pose an increased risk of death to the baby: 15 percent higher for Type I, 32 percent for Type II, and 55 percent for Type III. The reasons for this were unclear, but may be connected to genital and [[urinary tract infection]]s and the presence of scar tissue. According to the study, FGM was associated with an increased risk to the mother of damage to the [[perineum]] and [[postpartum bleeding|excessive blood loss]], as well as a need to [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|resuscitate]] the baby, and [[stillbirth]], perhaps because of a long [[Childbirth#Second stage: fetal expulsion|second stage of labour]].{{sfn|Banks|Meirik|Farley|Akande|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr30/en/index.html "New study shows female genital mutilation exposes women and babies to significant risk at childbirth"], World Health Organization, 2 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological effects, sexual function===
According to a 2015 [[systematic review]] there is little high-quality information available on the psychological effects of FGM. Several small studies have concluded that women with FGM suffer from anxiety, depression and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}} Feelings of shame and betrayal can develop when women leave the culture that practises FGM and learn that their condition is not the norm, but within the practising culture they may view their FGM with pride, because for them it signifies beauty, respect for tradition, chastity and hygiene.{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}} Studies on sexual function have also been small.{{sfn|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=50}} A 2013 [[meta-analysis]] of 15 studies involving 12,671 women from seven countries concluded that women with FGM were twice as likely to report no sexual desire and 52 percent more likely to report [[dyspareunia]] (painful sexual intercourse). One third reported reduced sexual feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berg|Denison|2013}}; {{harvnb|Reisel|Creighton|2015|loc=51}}; {{harvnb|Sibiani|Rouzi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
===Household surveys===
[[File:Composite FGM world map.svg|thumb|A composite data map showing the % of women and girls aged 15-49 years (unless otherwise stated) who have undergone FGM/C. Source: UNICEF (2016) and a number of additional studies for countries outside Africa not surveyed by UNICEF. Grey countries' data are not covered.]]

Aid agencies define the prevalence of FGM as the percentage of the 15–49 age group that has experienced it.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=193}} These figures are based on nationally representative household surveys known as [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS), developed by [[ICF International|Macro International]] and funded mainly by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID); and [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys]] (MICS) conducted with financial and technical help from UNICEF.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=190}} These surveys have been carried out in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere roughly every five years, since 1984 and 1995 respectively.&lt;ref name=DHS&gt;[http://www.dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/Survey-Types/DHS.cfm "DHS overview"], Demographic and Health Surveys; [http://www.childinfo.org/mics5_questionnaire.html "Questionnaires and Indicator List"], Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt; The first to ask about FGM was the 1989–1990 DHS in northern Sudan. The first publication to estimate FGM prevalence based on DHS data (in seven countries) was written by Dara Carr of Macro International in 1997.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013}}

===Type of FGM===
Questions the women are asked during the surveys include: "Was the genital area just nicked/cut without removing any flesh? Was any flesh (or something) removed from the genital area? Was your genital area sewn?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Most women report "cut, some flesh removed" (Types I and II).&lt;ref name=Yoder2013p189TypeI&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47, table 5.2; {{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Type I is the most common form in Egypt,{{sfn|Rasheed|Abd-Ellah|Yousef|2011}} and in the southern parts of Nigeria.{{sfn|Okeke|Anyaehie|Ezenyeaku|2012|loc=70–73}} Type III (infibulation) is concentrated in northeastern Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan.{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=13–14}} In surveys in 2002–2006, 30 percent of cut girls in Djibouti, 38 percent in Eritrea, and 63 percent in Somalia had experienced Type III.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47. For the years and country profiles: [[#UNICEFDjibouti|Djibouti]], UNICEF, December 2013; [[#UNICEFEritrea|Eritrea]], UNICEF, July 2013; [[#UNICEFSomalia|Somalia]], UNICEF, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a high prevalence of infibulation among girls in Niger and Senegal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 it was estimated that in Nigeria three percent of the 0–14 age group had been infibulated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEFNigeria|Nigeria]], UNICEF, July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of procedure is often linked to ethnicity. In Eritrea, for example, a survey in 2002 found that all [[Hedareb people|Hedareb]] girls had been infibulated, compared with two percent of the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrinya]], most of whom fell into the "cut, no flesh removed" category.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p48/&gt;

FGM is mostly found in what [[Gerry Mackie]] called an "intriguingly contiguous" zone in Africa—east to west from Somalia to Senegal, and north to south from Egypt to Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MackieLeJeune2008|Mackie and LeJeune (UNICEF) 2008]], 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally representative figures are available for 27 countries in Africa, as well as Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen.

The highest concentrations among the 15–49 age group are in Somalia (98 percent), Guinea (97 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent) and Sierra Leone (90 percent).&lt;ref name=UNICEF2014pp89-90&gt;[[#UNICEF2014|UNICEF 2014]], 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, 27.2 million women had undergone FGM in Egypt, 23.8 million in Ethiopia, and 19.9 million in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high concentration in Indonesia, where according to UNICEF Type I (clitoridectomy) and Type IV (symbolic nicking) are practised; the [[Ministry of Health (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Health]] and [[Indonesian Ulema Council]] both say the clitoris should not be cut.

Prevalence figures for the 15–19 age group and younger show a downward trend.{{efn|UNICEF 2013: "The percentage of girls and women of reproductive age (15 to 49) who have experienced any form of FGM/C is the first indicator used to show how widespread the practice is in a particular country&amp;nbsp;... A second indicator of national prevalence measures the extent of cutting among daughters aged 0 to 14, as reported by their mothers. Prevalence data for girls reflect their current&amp;nbsp;– not final&amp;nbsp;– FGM/C status, since many of them may not have reached the customary age for cutting at the time of the survey. They are reported as being uncut but are still at risk of undergoing the procedure. Statistics for girls under age 15 therefore need to be interpreted with a high degree of caution&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2013, 23"&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{pb}} An additional complication in judging prevalence among girls is that, in countries running campaigns against FGM, women might not report that their daughters have been cut.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 25, 100; {{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} For example, Burkina Faso fell from 89 percent (1980) to 58 percent (2010); Egypt from 97 percent (1985) to 70 percent (2015); and Kenya from 41 percent (1984) to 11 percent (2014).&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2016|UNICEF 2016]], 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2010, household surveys asked women about the FGM status of all their living daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=194}}; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest concentrations among girls aged 0–14 were in Gambia (56 percent), Mauritania (54 percent), Indonesia (49 percent for 0–11) and Guinea (46 percent).&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt; The figures suggest that a girl was one third less likely in 2014 to undergo FGM than she was 30 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2014|UNICEF 2014]], 2.&lt;/ref&gt; If the rate of decline continues, the number of girls cut will nevertheless rise, because of population growth, from 3.6 million a year in 2013 to 4.1 million in 2050.{{efn|UNICEF 2014: "If there is no reduction in the practice between now and 2050, the number of girls cut each year will grow from 3.6 million in 2013 to 6.6 million in 2050.

If nothing is done, the number of girls and women affected will grow from 133 million today to 325 million in 2050.

According to a 2018 study published in the British Medical Journal there has been a large decline in number of FGM cases among the 0-14 year old in Africa in the 1990-2017 period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/07/fgm-rates-in-east-africa-drop-20-years-study-shows FGM rates in east Africa drop from 71% to 8% in 20 years, study shows] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/5/e000549 Secular trends in the prevalence of female genital mutilation/cutting among girls: a systematic analysis] British Medical Journal, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural areas, wealth, education===
Surveys have found FGM to be more common in rural areas, less common in most countries among girls from the wealthiest homes, and (except in Sudan and Somalia) less common in girls whose mothers had access to primary or secondary/higher education. In Somalia and Sudan the situation was reversed: in Somalia the mothers' access to secondary/higher education was accompanied by a rise in prevalence of FGM in their daughters, and in Sudan access to any education was accompanied by a rise.&lt;ref&gt;For rural areas, [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 28; for wealth, 40; for education, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age, ethnicity===
FGM is not invariably a [[rite of passage]] between childhood and adulthood, but is often performed on much younger children.{{sfn|Mackie|2000|loc=275}} Girls are most commonly cut shortly after birth to age 15. In half the countries for which national figures were available in 2000–2010, most girls had been cut by age five.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p50&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 80 percent (of those cut) are cut before the age of five in Nigeria, Mali, Eritrea, Ghana and Mauritania.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013pp47,183&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 47, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 Demographic and Health Survey in Yemen found that 76 percent of girls had been cut within two weeks of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf UNICEF 2005], 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage is reversed in Somalia, Egypt, Chad and the Central African Republic, where over 80 percent (of those cut) are cut between five and 14.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013pp47,183/&gt; Just as the type of FGM is often linked to ethnicity, so is the mean age. In Kenya, for example, the [[Kisi people|Kisi]] cut around age 10 and the [[Kamba people|Kamba]] at 16.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

A country's national prevalence often reflects a high sub-national prevalence among certain ethnicities, rather than a widespread practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 28–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Iraq, for example, FGM is found mostly among the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] in [[Erbil]] (58 percent prevalence within age group 15–49, as of 2011), [[Sulaymaniyah]] (54 percent) and [[Kirkuk]] (20 percent), giving the country a national prevalence of eight percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013]. For eight percent in Iraq, 27, box&amp;nbsp;4.4, group&amp;nbsp;5; for the regions in Iraq, 31, map&amp;nbsp;4.6). Also see {{harvnb|Yasin|Al-Tawil|Shabila|Al-Hadithi|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is sometimes an ethnic marker, but it may differ along national lines. For example, in the northeastern regions of Ethiopia and Kenya, which share a border with Somalia, the [[Somali people]] practise FGM at around the same rate as they do in Somalia.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=196, 198}} But in Guinea all [[Fula people|Fulani]] women responding to a survey in 2012 said they had experienced FGM,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220043131/http://data.unicef.org/corecode/uploads/document6/uploaded_country_profiles/corecode/30/Countries/FGMC_GIN.pdf "Guinea"] (2012), UNICEF statistical profile, July 2014, 2/4.&lt;/ref&gt; against 12 percent of the Fulani in Chad, while in Nigeria the Fulani are the only large ethnic group in the country not to practise it.&lt;ref&gt;Chad: [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 35–36; Nigeria: {{harvnb|Okeke|Anyaehie|Ezenyeaku|2012|loc=70–73}}. FGM is practised in Nigeria by the Yoruba, Hausa, Ibo, Ijaw and Kanuri people.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahabo Musa, a Somali woman, described infibulation in a 1988 poem as the "three feminine sorrows": the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman is cut open, then childbirth when she is cut again.{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA187 187]}} Despite the evident suffering, it is women who organize all forms of FGM.{{sfn|Khazan|2015}}{{sfn|Shell-Duncan|2008}} Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes wrote in 1975 that educated Sudanese men who did not want their daughters to be infibulated (preferring clitoridectomy) would find the girls had been sewn up after the grandmothers arranged a visit to relatives.{{sfn|Hayes|1975|loc=620, 624}} [[Gerry Mackie]] has compared the practice to [[footbinding]]. Like FGM, footbinding was carried out on young girls, nearly universal where practised, tied to ideas about honour, chastity and appropriate marriage, and "supported and transmitted" by women.{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "Footbinding and infibulation correspond as follows. Both customs are nearly universal where practised; they are persistent and are practised even by those who oppose them. Both control sexual access to females and ensure female chastity and fidelity. Both are necessary for proper marriage and family honor. Both are believed to be sanctioned by tradition. Both are said to be ethnic markers, and distinct ethnic minorities may lack the practices. Both seem to have a past of contagious diffusion. Both are exaggerated over time and both increase with status. Both are supported and transmitted by women, are performed on girls about six to eight years old, and are generally not initiation rites. Both are believed to promote health and fertility. Both are defined as aesthetically pleasing compared with the natural alternative. Both are said to properly exaggerate the complementarity of the sexes, and both are claimed to make intercourse more pleasurable for the male."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=999–1000}}}}

FGM practitioners see the procedures as marking not only ethnic boundaries but also gender difference. According to this view, male circumcision defeminizes men while FGM demasculinizes women.&lt;ref&gt;Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf, "Introduction: The Custom in Question", in Abusharaf 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA8 8].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA36 36–37]}} [[Fuambai Ahmadu]], an anthropologist and member of the [[Kono people]] of Sierra Leone, who in 1992 underwent clitoridectomy as an adult during a [[Sande society]] initiation, argued in 2000 that it is a male-centred assumption that the clitoris is important to female sexuality. African female symbolism revolves instead around the concept of the womb.&lt;ref name=Ahmadu2000&gt;[[Fuambai Ahmadu]], "Rites and Wrongs: An Insider/Outsider Reflects on Power and Excision," in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA284 284–285].&lt;/ref&gt; Infibulation draws on that idea of enclosure and fertility. "[G]enital cutting completes the social definition of a child's sex by eliminating external traces of androgyny," [[Janice Boddy]] wrote in 2007. "The female body is then covered, closed, and its productive blood bound within; the male body is unveiled, opened and exposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boddy|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}}; also see {{harvnb|Boddy|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TK6NIp5uVwsC&amp;pg=PA52 52–61]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In communities where infibulation is common, there is a preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and without odour, and both women and men may find the natural vulva repulsive.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=435–436}} Some men seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=437}}; {{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The local preference for [[dry sex]] causes women to introduce substances into the vagina to reduce lubrication, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and [[Vicks VapoRub|Vicks menthol rub]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnol and Mariano 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA277 277–281].&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that infibulation increases hygiene.{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=437}}

Common reasons for FGM cited by women in surveys are social acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation of virginity, marriageability and enhancement of male sexual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in northern Sudan, published in 1983, only 17.4 percent of women opposed FGM (558 out of 3,210), and most preferred excision and infibulation over clitoridectomy.{{sfn|El Dareer|1983|loc=140}} Attitudes are changing slowly. In Sudan in 2010, 42 percent of women who had heard of FGM said the practice should continue.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 178.&lt;/ref&gt; In several surveys since 2006, over 50 percent of women in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt supported FGM's continuance, while elsewhere in Africa, Iraq and Yemen most said it should end, although in several countries only by a narrow margin.{{efn|"The highest levels of support can be found in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt, where more than half the female population think the practice should continue."&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 52. Also see figure 6.1, 54, and figures 8.1A&amp;nbsp;– 8.1D, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Social obligation, poor access to information===
[[File:Keur Simbara, Senegal (8592417042), cropped.jpg|thumb|upright-1.2|alt=photograph|Keur Simbara, Senegal, abandoned FGM in 1998 after a three-year program by [[Tostan]].&lt;ref&gt;Malick Gueye, [http://www.tostan.org/blog/social-norm-change-theorists-meet-again-keur-simbara-senegal "Social Norm Change Theorists meet again in Keur Simbara, Senegal"], Tostan, 4 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Against the argument that women willingly choose FGM for their daughters, UNICEF calls the practice a "self-enforcing social convention" to which families feel they must conform to avoid uncut daughters facing social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellen Gruenbaum]] reported that, in Sudan in the 1970s, cut girls from an Arab ethnic group would mock uncut [[Zarma people|Zabarma]] girls with ''Ya, Ghalfa!'' ("Hey, unclean!"). The Zabarma girls would respond ''Ya, mutmura!'' (A ''mutmara'' was a storage pit for grain that was continually opened and closed, like an infibulated woman.) But despite throwing the insult back, the Zabarma girls would ask their mothers, "What's the matter? Don't we have razor blades like the Arabs?"{{sfn|Gruenbaum|2005|loc=432–433}}

Because of poor access to information, and because circumcisers downplay the causal connection, women may not associate the health consequences with the procedure. Lala Baldé, president of a women's association in Medina Cherif, a village in Senegal, told Mackie in 1998 that when girls fell ill or died, it was attributed to evil spirits. When informed of the causal relationship between FGM and ill health, Mackie wrote, the women broke down and wept. He argued that surveys taken before and after this sharing of information would show very different levels of support for FGM.{{sfn|Mackie|2003|loc=147–148}} The American non-profit group [[Tostan]], founded by [[Molly Melching]] in 1991, introduced community-empowerment programs in several countries that focus on local democracy, literacy, and education about healthcare, giving women the tools to make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diop2008|Diop et al. (UNICEF) 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, using the Tostan program, [[Malicounda Bambara]] in Senegal became the first village to abandon FGM.{{sfn|Mackie|2000|loc=256ff}} By 2018 over 8,000 communities in eight countries had pledged to abandon FGM and [[child marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tostan.org/female-genital-cutting "Female Genital Cutting"], Tostan, accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{further|Religious views on female genital mutilation}}
Surveys have shown a widespread belief, particularly in Mali, Mauritania, Guinea and Egypt, that FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Gruenbaum has argued that practitioners may not distinguish between religion, tradition and chastity, making it difficult to interpret the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JOXmOLBd4E4C&amp;pg=PA50 50]}}; [[#MackieLeJeune2008|Mackie and LeJeune (UNICEF) 2008]], 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; FGM's origins in northeastern Africa are pre-Islamic, but the practice became associated with Islam because of that religion's focus on female chastity and seclusion.{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "FGM is pre-Islamic but was exaggerated by its intersection with the Islamic modesty code of family honor, female purity, virginity, chastity, fidelity, and seclusion."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1008}}}} There is no mention of it in the [[Quran]].{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1004–1005}} It is praised in a few [[Hadith terminology|''daʻīf'']] (weak) ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings attributed to Muhammad) as noble but not required,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roald|2003|loc=224}}; {{harvnb|Asmani|Abdi|2008|loc=6–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Gerry Mackie]], 1996: "The Koran is silent on FGM, but several ''hadith'' (sayings attributed to Mohammed) recommend attenuating the practice for the woman's sake, praise it as noble but not commanded, or advise that female converts refrain from mutilation because even if pleasing to the husband it is painful to the wife."{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1004–1005}}}} although it is regarded as obligatory by the [[Shafi'i]] version of [[Sunni Islam]].{{sfn|Roald|2003|loc=243}} In 2007 the [[Al-Azhar University#Council of Senior Scholars|Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research]] in Cairo ruled that FGM had "no basis in core Islamic law or any of its partial provisions".&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEFpress2July2007|UNICEF press release]], 2 July 2007; [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 70.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Maggie Michael, Associated Press, 2007: "[Egypt's] supreme religious authorities stressed that Islam is against female circumcision.

There is no mention of FGM in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Waje Kunhiyop, ''African Christian Ethics'', Zondervan, 2008, 297: "Nowhere in all of Scripture or in any of recorded church history is there even a hint that women were to be circumcised."&lt;/ref&gt; Christian missionaries in Africa were [[#Colonial opposition in Kenya|among the first]] to object to FGM,{{sfn|Murray|1976}} but Christian communities in Africa do practise it. A 2013 UNICEF report identified 17 African countries in which at least 10 percent of Christian women and girls aged 15 to 49 had undergone FGM; in Niger 55 percent of Christian women and girls had experienced it, compared with two percent of their Muslim counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], front page and 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The only Jewish group known to have practised it are the [[Beta Israel]] of Ethiopia.

The practice's origins are unknown. Gerry Mackie has suggested that, because FGM's east-west, north-south distribution in Africa meets in Sudan, infibulation may have begun there with the [[Meroë|Meroite civilization]] (c.&amp;nbsp;800 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;350 CE), before the rise of Islam, to increase confidence in paternity.{{sfn|Mackie|2000|loc=264, 267}}&lt;ref&gt;Shell-Duncan and Hernlund 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA13 13]{{{pb}}

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;a-m-a:X1-D53-B1&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The examination of [[Mummy|mummies]] has shown no evidence of FGM. Citing the Australian pathologist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], who examined hundreds of mummies in the early 20th century, Knight writes that the genital area may resemble Type III because during mummification the skin of the outer labia was pulled toward the anus to cover the [[pudendal cleft]], possibly to prevent sexual violation. It was similarly not possible to determine whether Types I or II had been performed, because soft tissues had deteriorated or been removed by the embalmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2001|loc=331}}, citing G. Elliot Smith, ''A Contribution to the Study of Mummification in Egypt'', Cairo: L'Institut Egyptien, 1906, 30, and [[Marc Armand Ruffer]], ''Studies in the Paleopathology of Egypt'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1921, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (c. 64 BCE&amp;nbsp;– c. 23 CE) wrote about FGM after visiting Egypt around 25 BCE: "This is one of the customs most zealously pursued by them [the Egyptians]: to raise every child that is born and to circumcise [''peritemnein''] the males and excise [''ektemnein''] the females&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;nbsp;BCE, cited in {{harvnb|Knight|2001|loc=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;nbsp;BCE: "One of the customs most zealously observed among the Aegyptians is this, that they rear every child that is born, and circumcise [περιτέμνειν, ''peritemnein''] the males, and excise [''ektemnein''] the females, as is also customary among the Jews, who are also Aegyptians in origin, as I have already stated in my account of them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17B*.html#ref273 Book VII, chapter 2], 17.2.5. (Cohen 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PmL-LogqJ-YC&amp;pg=PA59 59ff], argues that Strabo conflated the Jews with the Egyptians).&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}

Xanthus wrote, in a history of [[Lydia]]: "The Lydians arrived at such a state of delicacy that they were even the first to 'castrate' their women." Knight argues that the "castration", which is not described, may have kept women youthful, in the sense of allowing the Lydian king to have intercourse with them without pregnancy. Knight concludes that it may have been a reference to sterilization, not FGM.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=326}}}} [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] (c. 20 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 50 CE) also made reference to it: "the Egyptians by the custom of their country circumcise the marriageable youth and maid in the fourteenth (year) of their age, when the male begins to get seed, and the female to have a menstrual flow."{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=333}} It is mentioned briefly in a work attributed to the Greek physician [[Galen]] (129&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;200 CE): "When [the clitoris] sticks out to a great extent in their young women, Egyptians consider it appropriate to cut it out."{{efn|Knight adds that the attribution to Galen is suspect.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=336}}}} Another Greek physician, [[Aëtius of Amida]] (mid-5th to mid-6th century CE), offered more detail in book 16 of his ''Sixteen Books on Medicine'', citing the physician Philomenes. The procedure was performed in case the clitoris, or ''nymphê'', grew too large or triggered sexual desire when rubbing against clothing. "On this account, it seemed proper to the Egyptians to remove it before it became greatly enlarged," Aëtius wrote, "especially at that time when the girls were about to be married":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The surgery is performed in this way: Have the girl sit on a chair while a muscled young man standing behind her places his arms below the girl's thighs. Have him separate and steady her legs and whole body. Standing in front and taking hold of the clitoris with a broad-mouthed forceps in his left hand, the surgeon stretches it outward, while with the right hand, he cuts it off at the point next to the pincers of the forceps.

It is proper to let a length remain from that cut off, about the size of the membrane that's between the nostrils, so as to take away the excess material only; as I have said, the part to be removed is at that point just above the pincers of the forceps. Because the clitoris is a skinlike structure and stretches out excessively, do not cut off too much, as a urinary fistula may result from cutting such large growths too deeply.{{efn|A paragraph break has been added for ease of reading.}}{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=327–328}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The genital area was then cleaned with a sponge, [[frankincense]] powder and wine or cold water, and wrapped in linen bandages dipped in vinegar, until the seventh day when [[calamine]], rose petals, date pits or a "genital powder made from baked clay" might be applied.{{sfn|Knight|2001|loc=328}}

Whatever the practice's origins, infibulation became linked to slavery. Mackie cites the Portuguese missionary [[João dos Santos]], who in 1609 wrote of a group near Mogadishu who had a "custome to sew up their Females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their Masters put in them". Thus, Mackie argues, a "practice associated with shameful female slavery came to stand for honor".{{sfn|Mackie|1996|loc=1003, 1009}}

Protestant missionaries in [[East Africa Protectorate|British East Africa]] (present-day Kenya) began campaigning against FGM in the early 20th century, when Dr. [[John Arthur]] joined the [[Church of Scotland]] Mission (CSM) in Kikuyu. An important ethnic marker, the practice was known by the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the country's main ethnic group, as ''irua'' for both girls and boys. It involved excision (Type II) for girls and removal of the foreskin for boys. Unexcised Kikuyu women (''irugu'') were outcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn M. Thomas,{{" '}}Ngaitana (I will circumcise myself)': Lessons from Colonial Campaigns to Ban Excision in Meru, Kenya" in Shell-Duncan and Hernlund, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA132 132].{{pb}}
For ''irua'', Jomo Kenyatta, ''Facing Mount Kenya'', New York: Vintage Books, 1962 [1938], 129; for ''irugu'' being outcasts, Kenyatta, 127, and {{harvnb|Zabus|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZmWF3qxHo4C&amp;pg=PA48 48–49]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jomo Kenyatta]], general secretary of the [[Kikuyu Central Association]] and later Kenya's first prime minister, wrote in 1938 that, for the Kikuyu, the institution of FGM was the "''[[Sine qua non|conditio sine qua non]]'' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion and morality". No proper Kikuyu man or woman would marry or have sexual relations with someone who was not circumcised. A woman's responsibilities toward the tribe began with her initiation. Her age and place within tribal history was traced to that day, and the group of girls with whom she was cut was named according to current events, an [[oral tradition]] that allowed the Kikuyu to track people and events going back hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyatta 1962 [1938], 127–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hulda Stumpf, Africa Inland Mission conference.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=photograph|Missionary [[Hulda Stumpf]] ''(bottom left)'' was murdered in Kikuyu in 1930 after opposing FGM.]]

Beginning with the CSM mission in 1925, several missionary churches declared that FGM was prohibited for African Christians. The CSM announced that Africans practising it would be excommunicated, which resulted in hundreds leaving or being expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Fiedler, ''Christianity and African Culture'', Leiden: Brill, 1996, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The stand-off turned FGM into a focal point of the Kenyan independence movement; the 1929–1931 period is known in the country's historiography as the female circumcision controversy.{{sfn|Boddy|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA241 241–245]}}&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hyam, ''Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1990; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1594780 Murray 1976], 92–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council began referring to FGM as the "sexual mutilation of women", rather than circumcision, and a person's stance toward the practice became a test of loyalty, either to the Christian churches or to the Kikuyu Central Association.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2000, 132; for the "sexual mutilation of women", Karanja 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ezIgyomGIC&amp;pg=PA93 93], n.&amp;nbsp;631.{{pb}}

In 1956 the council of male elders (the ''Njuri Nchecke'') in Meru announced a ban on FGM. Over the next three years, thousands of girls cut each other's genitals with razor blades as a symbol of defiance. The movement came to be known as ''Ngaitana'' ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhhRXiJIGEcC&amp;pg=PA129 129–131] (131 for the girls as "central actors"); Lynn Thomas, ''Politics of the Womb: Women, Reproduction, and the State in Kenya'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003, 89–91.{{pb}}

===Growth of opposition===
{{FGM opposition timeline}}
The first known non-colonial campaign against FGM began in Egypt in the 1920s, when the Egyptian Doctors' Society called for a ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 10, calls the Egyptian Doctors' Society opposition the "first known campaign" against FGM.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a parallel campaign in Sudan, run by religious leaders and British women. Infibulation was banned there in 1946, but the law was unpopular and barely enforced.{{sfn|Boddy|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T77ui7IPNwkC&amp;pg=PA202 202], 299}}{{efn|FGM is still practised in Sudan. Some states banned it in 2008–2009, but {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, there was no national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 2, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Egyptian government banned infibulation in state-run hospitals in 1959, but allowed partial clitoridectomy if parents requested it.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Heger Boyle, ''Female Genital Cutting: Cultural Conflict in the Global Community'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002, 92, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; (Egypt banned FGM entirely in 2007.)

In 1959, the UN asked the WHO to investigate FGM, but the latter responded that it was not a medical matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle 2002, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists took up the issue throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Bagnol and Mariano 2011, 281"&gt;Bagnol and Mariano 2011, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian physician and feminist [[Nawal El Saadawi]] criticized FGM in her book ''Women and Sex'' (1972); the book was banned in Egypt and El Saadawi lost her job as director general of public health.&lt;ref name=Khaleeli2010&gt;{{harvnb|Gruenbaum|2001|loc=22}}; Homa Khaleeli, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/15/nawal-el-saadawi-egyptian-feminist "Nawal El Saadawi: Egypt's radical feminist"], ''The Guardian'', 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She followed up with a chapter, "The Circumcision of Girls", in her book ''The Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World'' (1980), which described her own clitoridectomy when she was six years old:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I did not know what they had cut off from my body, and I did not try to find out. I just wept, and called out to my mother for help. But the worst shock of all was when I looked around and found her standing by my side. Yes, it was her, I could not be mistaken, in flesh and blood, right in the midst of these strangers, talking to them and smiling at them, as though they had not participated in slaughtering her daughter just a few moments ago.&lt;ref&gt;Nawal El Saadawi, ''The Hidden Face of Eve'', London: Zed Books, 2007 [1980], [https://books.google.com/books?id=u5n9zUZuVI8C&amp;pg=PA14 14].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Edna Adan Ismail.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=photograph|[[Edna Adan Ismail]]]]
In 1975, Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American social scientist, became the first female academic to publish a detailed account of FGM, aided by her ability to discuss it directly with women in Sudan. Her article in ''American Ethnologist'' called it "female genital mutilation", rather than female circumcision, and brought it to wider academic attention.{{sfn|Hayes|1975|loc=21}} [[Edna Adan Ismail]], who worked at the time for the Somalia Ministry of Health, discussed the health consequences of FGM in 1977 with the [[Somali Women's Democratic Organization]].{{sfn|Abdalla|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA201 201]}}&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Topping, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/somaliland-womens-rights-gender-violence "Somaliland's leading lady for women's rights: 'It is time for men to step up'"], ''The Guardian'', 23 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later [[Fran Hosken]], an Austria-American feminist, published ''The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females'' (1979),{{sfn|Hosken|1994}} the first to offer global figures. She estimated that 110,529,000 women in 20 African countries had experienced FGM.{{sfn|Yoder|Khan|2008|loc=2}} The figures were speculative but consistent with later surveys.{{sfn|Mackie|2003|loc=139}} Describing FGM as a "training ground for male violence", Hosken accused female practitioners of "participating in the destruction of their own kind".{{sfn|Hosken|1994|loc=5}} The language caused a rift between Western and African feminists; African women boycotted a session featuring Hosken during the UN's Mid-Decade Conference on Women in Copenhagen in July 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle 2002, 47; Bagnol and Mariano 2011, 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the WHO held a seminar, "Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children", in Khartoum, Sudan, and in 1981, also in Khartoum, 150 academics and activists signed a pledge to fight FGM after a workshop held by the [[Babikir Badri|Babiker Badri Scientific Association for Women's Studies]] (BBSAWS), "Female Circumcision Mutilates and Endangers Women&amp;nbsp;– Combat it!" Another BBSAWS workshop in 1984 invited the international community to write a joint statement for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Shahira Ahmed, "Babiker Badri Scientific Association for Women's Studies", in Abusharaf 2007, 176–180.&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended that the "goal of all African women" should be the eradication of FGM and that, to sever the link between FGM and religion, clitoridectomy should no longer be referred to as ''sunna''.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed 2007, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, founded in 1984 in Dakar, Senegal, called for an end to the practice, as did the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna in 1993. The conference listed FGM as a form of [[violence against women]], marking it as a human-rights violation, rather than a medical issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anika Rahman]] and [[Nahid Toubia]], ''Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Laws and Policies Worldwide'', New York: Zed Books, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kEG6GaudxQEC&amp;pg=PA110 10–11]; for Vienna, [[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1990s and 2000s governments in Africa and the Middle East passed legislation banning or restricting FGM. In 2003 the [[African Union]] ratified the [[Maputo Protocol]] on the rights of women, which supported the elimination of FGM.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Bonino, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/opinion/15iht-edbonino_ed3_.html "A brutal custom: Join forces to banish the mutilation of women"], ''The New York Times'', 15 September 2004; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110409114818/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/Text/Protocol%20on%20the%20Rights%20of%20Women.pdf Maputo Protocol], 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 laws restricting FGM had been passed in at least 23 of the 27 African countries in which it is concentrated, although several fell short of a ban.{{efn|For example, UNICEF 2013 lists Mauritania as having passed legislation against FGM, but (as of that year) it was banned only from being conducted in government facilities or by medical personnel.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2013p8&gt;[[#UNICEF2013|UNICEF 2013]], 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}The following are countries in which FGM is common and in which restrictions are in place as of 2013.

====Europe====

According to the European Parliament, 500,000 women in Europe had undergone FGM {{as of|2009|03|lc=y}}.{{sfn|Yoder|Wang|Johansen|2013|loc=195}} France is known for its tough stance against FGM.{{sfn|Kool|Wahedi|2014|loc=3–5}} Up to 30,000 women there were thought to have experienced it as of 1995. According to Colette Gallard, a family-planning counsellor, when FGM was first encountered in France, the reaction was that Westerners ought not to intervene. It took the deaths of two girls in 1982, one of them three months old, for that attitude to change.{{sfn|Gallard|1995|loc=1592}}&lt;ref name=Rowling/&gt; In 1991 a French court ruled that the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] offered protection to FGM victims; the decision followed an asylum application from [[Aminata Diop]], who fled an FGM procedure in Mali.&lt;ref&gt;Jana Meredyth Talton, "Asylum for Genital-Mutilation Fugitives: Building a Precedent", [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]], January/February 1992, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is outlawed by several provisions of France's penal code that address bodily harm causing permanent mutilation or torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/current_situation_and_trends_of_female_genital_mutilation_in_france_en.pdf "Current situation of female genital mutilation in France"], European Institute for Gender Equality, European Union.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowling&gt;Megan Rowling [http://news.trust.org//item/?map=france-reduces-genital-cutting-with-prevention-prosecutions-lawyer/ "France reduces genital cutting with prevention, prosecutions – lawyer"], Thomson Reuters Foundation, 27 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; All children under six who were born in France undergo medical examinations that include inspection of the genitals, and doctors are obliged to report FGM.{{sfn|Kool|Wahedi|2014|loc=3–5}} The first civil suit was in 1982,{{sfn|Gallard|1995|loc=1592}} and the first criminal prosecution in 1993.&lt;ref name=Farnsworth1994/&gt; In 1999 a woman was given an eight-year sentence for having performed FGM on 48 girls.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gollaher]], ''Circumcision: A History of the World's Most Controversial Surgery'', New York: Basic Books, 2000, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 over 100 parents and two practitioners had been prosecuted in over 40 criminal cases.&lt;ref name=Rowling/&gt;{{sfn|Kool|Wahedi|2014|loc=3–5}}

==Criticism of opposition==
===Tolerance versus human rights===
[[File:Obioma Nnaemeka (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=photograph|Academic [[Obioma Nnaemeka]] criticized the renaming of female circumcision to female genital mutilation.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://webrecorder.io/Germinal/wikipedia/20180527025854/https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA34 34]}}]]
Anthropologists have accused FGM eradicationists of [[cultural imperialism|cultural colonialism]], and have been criticized in turn for their [[moral relativism]] and failure to defend the idea of universal [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Silverman|Eric K. Silverman]], "Anthropology and Circumcision," ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 33, 2004 (419–445), 420, 427. {{jstor|25064860}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics of the eradicationist position, the [[Reductionism#In science|biological reductionism]] of the opposition to FGM, and the failure to appreciate FGM's cultural context, serves to "[[Othering|other]]" practitioners and undermine their agency—in particular when parents are referred to as "mutilators".{{sfn|Kirby|2005|loc=83}}

Africans who object to the tone of FGM opposition risk appearing to defend the practice. The feminist theorist [[Obioma Nnaemeka]], herself strongly opposed to FGM, argued in 2005 that renaming the practice ''female genital mutilation'' had introduced "a subtext of barbaric African and Muslim cultures and the West's relevance (even indispensability) in purging [it]".{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} According to Ugandan law professor [[Sylvia Tamale]], the early Western opposition to FGM stemmed from a Judeo-Christian judgment that African sexual and family practices, including not only FGM but also [[dry sex]], [[polygyny]], [[bride price]] and [[levirate marriage]], required correction. African feminists "take strong exception to the imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women", she wrote in 2011.{{sfn|Tamale|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA19 19–20]}} Commentators highlight the voyeurism in the treatment of women's bodies as exhibits. Examples include images of women's vaginas after FGM or girls undergoing the procedure.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA30 30–33]}} The 1996 [[#Pulitzer|Pulitzer-prize-winning photographs]] of a 16-year-old Kenyan girl experiencing FGM were published by 12 American newspapers, without her consent either to be photographed or to have the images published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korieh|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA121 121–122]}}; for the photographs, see {{cite web |title=Stephanie Walsh.

The debate has highlighted a tension between anthropology and feminism, with the former's focus on tolerance and the latter's on equal rights for women. According to the anthropologist Christine Walley, a common position within anti-FGM literature has been to present African women as victims of [[false consciousness]] participating in their own oppression, a position promoted by feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, including Fran Hosken, [[Mary Daly]] and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein.{{sfn|Walley|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&amp;pg=PA18 18], 34, 43, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5a39rTNB8C&amp;pg=PA60 60]}} It prompted the French Association of Anthropologists to issue a statement in 1981, at the height of the early debates, that "a certain feminism resuscitates (today) the moralistic arrogance of yesterday's colonialism".&lt;ref name="Bagnol and Mariano 2011, 281"/&gt;

===Comparison with other procedures{{anchor|comparison}}===
====Cosmetic procedures====
{{See also|Labiaplasty#Criticism}}
Nnaemeka argues that the crucial question, broader than FGM, is why the female body is subjected to so much "abuse and indignity", including in the West.{{sfn|Nnaemeka|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XjctVvOzzcQC&amp;pg=PA38 38–39]}} Several authors have drawn a parallel between FGM and cosmetic procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnsdotter|Essén|2010|loc=32}}; {{harvnb|Berer|2007|loc=1335}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronán Conroy of the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] wrote in 2006 that cosmetic genital procedures were "driving the advance" of FGM by encouraging women to see natural variations as defects.{{sfn|Conroy|2006}} Anthropologist [[Fadwa El Guindi]] compared FGM to [[Breast augmentation|breast enhancement]], in which the maternal function of the breast becomes secondary to men's sexual pleasure.{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&amp;pg=PA33 33]}} [[Benoîte Groult]], the French feminist, made a similar point in 1975, citing FGM and cosmetic surgery as sexist and patriarchal.{{sfn|Wildenthal|2012|loc=148}} Against this, the medical anthropologist [[Carla Obermeyer]] argued in 1999 that FGM may be conducive to a subject's social well-being in the same way that [[rhinoplasty]] and male circumcision are.&lt;ref&gt;Obermeyer 1999, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the 2007 ban in Egypt, Egyptian women wanting FGM for their daughters seek ''amalyet tajmeel'' (cosmetic surgery) to remove what they see as excess genital tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Abdel Rahim, [http://timep.org/commentary/midwives-doctors-searching-safer-circumcisions-egypt# "From Midwives to Doctors: Searching for “Safer” Circumcisions in Egypt?"], The Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, 25 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph|[[Martha Nussbaum]]: a key moral and legal issue with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force.]]
Cosmetic procedures such as [[labiaplasty]] and [[clitoral hood reduction]] do fall within the WHO's definition of FGM, which aims to avoid loopholes, but the WHO notes that these elective practices are generally not regarded as FGM.{{efn|WHO 2008: "Some practices, such as genital cosmetic surgery and hymen repair, which are legally accepted in many countries and not generally considered to constitute female genital mutilation, actually fall under the definition used here. It has been considered important, however, to maintain a broad definition of female genital mutilation in order to avoid loopholes that might allow the practice to continue."&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO2008|WHO 2008]], 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some legislation banning FGM, such as in Canada and the US, covers minors only, but several countries, including Sweden and the UK, have banned it regardless of consent. Sweden, for example, has banned operations "on the outer female sexual organs with a view to mutilating them or bringing about some other permanent change in them, regardless of whether or not consent has been given for the operation".&lt;ref name=EigeSweden/&gt; Gynaecologist Birgitta Essén and anthropologist Sara Johnsdotter argue that the law seems to distinguish between Western and African genitals, and deems only African women (such as those seeking reinfibulation after childbirth) unfit to make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnsdotter|Essén|2010|loc=33}}; {{harvnb|Essén|Johnsdotter|2004|loc=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] argues that a key concern with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force. The distinction between social pressure and physical force is morally and legally salient, comparable to the distinction between seduction and rape. She argues further that the literacy of women in practising countries is generally poorer than in developed nations, which reduces their ability to make informed choices.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1999|loc=123–124}}&lt;ref&gt;Also see [[Yuli Tamir|Yael Tamir]], [http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.3/Tamir.html "Hands Off Clitoridectomy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051255/http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.3/Tamir.html |date=8 August 2014 }}, ''Boston Review'', Summer 1996; [[Martha Nussbaum]], [http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.5/nussbaum.html "Double Moral Standards?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051257/http://new.bostonreview.net/BR21.5/nussbaum.html |date=8 August 2014 }}, ''Boston Review'', October/November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intersex children, male circumcision====

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">In [[esoteric]] and [[occult]] teachings, '''giants''' are beings who live on [[spiritual (spiritual plane)|spiritual]], [[etheric (etheric plane)|etheric]] and [[physical (physical plane)|physical]] [[planes of existence]]. Giants were a popular theme in [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] [[literature]], [[Atlantis]], [[lost continents]] and later the [[earth mysteries]] movement of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} 

==History==
The concept of giants was discussed by the [[theosophist]] and [[occult]] author [[Blavatsky]] who wrote about the existence of giants in her book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' connecting them to her theory of [[root races]] and claiming they correspond with [[Hindu cycle of the universe]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  According to theosophists, ape-like giants were the third [[root race]] who lived on the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner, Fads and fallacies in the name of science, 1957, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophists also linked giants to the Atlantean race.

The [[Germans|German]] [[occultist]] [[Guido von List]] was influenced by Blavatsky's writings on giants and mixed together [[paganism]], [[mythology]], and theosophy, creating a basis for the belief in giants living in different realms based on the first four rounds of the root race theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology, 1993, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz]], an [[Egyptologist]] and [[tradition]]alist, believed that giants had roamed the [[earth]], and that after the fall of [[Adam]], humanity fell into a state of degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen, 2008, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewis Spence]], a writer on mythology, was critical of theosophy but accepted the existence of giants. He researched [[English folklore]] and mythology depicting such giants such as [[Gog and Magog|Magog]] and the British giant [[Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Spence, 1976, The Occult Sciences in Atlantis, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer who was opposed to occultism was the British [[journalist]] and author [[William Comyns Beaumont]]. Like Spence, he accepted the existence of giants based on folklore, mythology, and [[archeology]]. Beaumont believed that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was the location of [[Atlantis]] and that it was occupied by a giant race of [[Aryan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZNKVA1JcWwC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=comyns+beaumont+giants&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rlr3TcGTBpOctwejoeS_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Karl Shaw, Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British Eccentrics]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s many of the authors of the [[earth mysteries]] movement in Britain wrote about Giants. [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] wrote about the existence of giants in his book ''The View over Atlantis''. Anthony Roberts wrote the book ''Sowers of Thunder: Giants in Myth and History'' in 1978, in which he claimed that giants were the original inhabitants of the  [[British Isles]] and linked [[Alfred Watkins]]' [[ley lines]] to the British giants.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chippindale, Stonehenge complete, Cornell University Press, 1983, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses}}
In terms of [[nuclear explosion]]s and other large [[bomb]]s, the term "'''ground zero'''" (also known as "'''surface zero'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=5214|title=U.S. DoD Terminology: surface zero|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) describes the point on the Earth's surface closest to a detonation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nmbook/appendices/ap_B.htm Nuclear Matters: A Practical Guide, Appendix B] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201082850/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nmbook/appendices/ap_B.htm |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of an explosion above the ground, ''ground zero'' refers to the point on the ground directly below the nuclear detonation and is sometimes called the '''hypocenter''' (from [[Greek Language|Greek]] ὑπο- "under-" and [[center (disambiguation)|center]]). 

Generally, the term "ground zero" is also used in relation to [[earthquake]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and other [[disaster]]s to mark the point of the most severe damage or destruction. The term is distinguished from the term '''zero point''' in that the latter can also be located in the air, underground, or underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=5818|title=U.S. DoD Terminology: zero point|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trinity, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki==
[[File:Hiroshima Damage Map.gif|right|thumb|In mapping the effects of an atomic bomb, such as on the city of [[Hiroshima]] here, concentric circles are drawn centered on the point below the detonation and numbered at radial distances of 1,000 feet (305 meters). This point below the detonation is called "Ground Zero".]]
The origins of the term "ground zero" began with the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] in [[Jornada del Muerto desert]] near [[Socorro, New Mexico]], and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in [[Japan]]. The [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Atomic attacks)|Strategic Bombing Survey]] of the atomic attacks, released in June 1946, used the term liberally, defining it as: "For convenience, the term 'ground zero' will be used to designate the point on the ground directly beneath the point of detonation, or 'air zero.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&amp;documentid=65&amp;documentdate=1946-06-19&amp;studycollectionid=abomb&amp;groupid= U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey: The Effects of the Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]. June 19, 1946. President's Secretary's File, Truman Papers. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Laurence]], an [[embedded reporter]] with the [[Manhattan Project]], reported that "Zero" was "the code name given to the spot chosen for the [Trinity] test" in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Laurence]], ''Dawn over Zero'' (London: Museum Press, 1947), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', citing the use of the term in a 1946 ''[[New York Times]]'' report on the destroyed city of [[Hiroshima]], defines ''ground zero'' as "that part of the ground situated immediately under an exploding bomb, especially an atomic one."
The term was military slang, used at the Trinity site where the weapon tower for the first [[nuclear weapon]] was at "point zero", and moved into general use very shortly after the end of [[World War II]]. At Hiroshima, the hypocenter of the attack was [[Shima Hospital]], approximately {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} away from the intended aiming point at [[Aioi Bridge]]. 
{{wide image|NagasakiHypocentre.jpg|800px|Panoramic view of the monument marking the hypocenter, or ground zero, of the atomic bomb explosion over [[Nagasaki]].}}

==The Pentagon==
[[File:PentagonHotDogStand.jpg|thumb|left|The former hot dog stand nicknamed Cafe Ground Zero&lt;ref name="Pentagon" /&gt; in the Pentagon's center courtyard.]]
During the [[Cold War]], [[The Pentagon]], the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], was an assured target in the event of [[nuclear war]]. The open space in the center of the Pentagon became known informally as ground zero. A snack bar that used to be located at the center of this open space was nicknamed "Cafe Ground Zero".&lt;ref name="Pentagon" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=1049|title=Pentagon Hot Dog Stand, Cold War Legend, to be Torn Down|quote ='It's rumored that a portion of their (Soviet) nuclear arsenal was directed at that building, the Pentagon hot dog stand,' tour guides tell visitors as they pass the stand. 'This is where the building earned the nickname Cafe Ground Zero, the deadliest hot dog stand in the world.'|date= September 20, 2006|publisher=United States Department of Defense |accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Trade Center==
[[File:Wtc-photo.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[World Trade Center site]] in September 2001.]]
During the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], two aircraft [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by 10 [[al-Qaeda]] [[Terrorism|terrorists]] flew into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, causing massive damage and starting fires that [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|caused the weakened 110-story skyscrapers to collapse]]. The destroyed [[World Trade Center site]] soon became known as "ground zero." Rescue workers also used the phrase "The Pile", referring to the pile of rubble that was left after the buildings collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamill | first= Denis|title=Rescue Workers Keep Up Quest for Signs of Life Ruin All Over, But Not One Unkind Word|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|date=16 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the site was cleaned up and construction on the new [[One World Trade Center]] and the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] were well under way, the term was still frequently used to refer to the site, as when opponents of the [[Park51]] project that was to be located two blocks away from the site labeled it the "[[Ground Zero mosque]]." 

In advance of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] urged that the "ground zero" moniker be retired, saying, "...the time has come to call those 16 acres what they are: The World Trade Center and the National September 11th Memorial and Museum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14827694 |title=Is it time to retire 'Ground zero'? |work=[[BBC]] |author=Geoghegan, Tom |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10141">The '''group attribution error''' refers to people's tendency to believe either (1) that the characteristics of an individual group member are reflective of the group as a whole, or (2) that a group's decision outcome must reflect the preferences of individual group members, even when external information is available suggesting otherwise.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamill|first1=Ruth|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|last3=Nisbett|first3=Richard E.|date=1980|title=Insensitivity to sample bias: Generalizing from atypical cases|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92179/InsensitivityToSampleBias.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=4|pages=578–589|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.4.578|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511145714/https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92179/InsensitivityToSampleBias.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allison|first1=Scott T|last2=Messick|first2=David M|date=1985|title=The group attribution error|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=21|issue=6|pages=563–579|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(85)90025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Diane M.; Allison, Scott T. (1987). "Group attribution errors and the illusion of group attitude change". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group attribution error shares an [[attribution bias]] analogous to the [[fundamental attribution error]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather than focusing individual's behavior, it relies on group outcomes and attitudes as its main for conclusions.

== Types of Tendencies ==

===Type I===
To demonstrate the first form of group attribution error, research participants are typically given case studies about individuals who are members of defined groups (such as members of a particular occupation, nationality, or ethnicity), and then take surveys to determine their views of the groups as a whole. Often the participants may be broken up into separate test groups, some of which are given statistics about the group that directly contradict what they were presented in the case study. Others may even be told directly that the individual in the case study was atypical for the group as a whole. Researchers use the surveys to determine to what extent the participants allowed their views of the individual in the case study to influence their views of the group as a whole and also take note of how effective the statistics were in deterring this group attribution error. Ruth Hamill, Richard E. Nisbett, and Timothy DeCamp Wilson were the first to study this form of group attribution error in detail in their 1980 paper ''Insensitivity to Sample Bias: Generalizing From Atypical Cases.'' In their study, the researchers provided participants with a case study about an individual welfare recipient. Half of the participants were given statistics showing that the individual was typical for a welfare recipient and had been on the program for the typical amount of time, while the other half of participants were given statistics showing that the welfare recipient had been on the program much longer than normal. The results of the study revealed that participants did indeed draw extremely negative opinions of all welfare recipients as a result of the case study. It was also found that the differences in statistics provided to the two groups had trivial to no effect on the level of group attribution error.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

===Type II===
The second form of group attribution error was first reported by Scott T. Allison and David Messick in 1985. This form describes people's tendency to assume incorrectly that group decisions reflect group members' attitudes. In their study the researchers did multiple experiments presenting participants with group decisions made on the national, state, and local levels. Participants were presented with situations in which a matter of public policy was determined by a single leader with no popular vote, a popular vote of over 90% of the population, and a popular vote which included approximately 50% of the population. If no group attribution error were present, the participants would be expected to conclude that in the 90% vote the views of the individuals were reflective of the group decision, in the 50% vote they may or may not be, and in the leader decision there is no evidence that the individual views reflect the group outcome. Allison and Messick discovered instead, however, that the participants associated the individual views with the group outcome in all three cases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Limitations and threats ====
Follow-up research by Leila Worth and Scott T. Allison attempted to identify the limits of the effect.  These studies have shown that the error becomes stronger in perceptions of groups that are viewed as (a) more dissimilar to one's own group, (b) more monolithic, and (c) adversarial to one's own group. The error tends to disappear in perceptions of one's own group.  Group members are more likely to attribute the decisions of their own group to structural constraints placed on the group, such as its decision rules, whereas members tend to attribute the decisions of another group to its members' attitudes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackie|first=Diane M|last2=Allison|first2=Scott T|title=Group attribution errors and the illusion of group attitude change|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1031(87)90016-3|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=6|pages=460–480|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(87)90016-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Corneille et al. conducted further studies that suggest that threatening groups are viewed as being both more extreme and more homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corneille|first1=Olivier|last2=Yzerbyt|first2=Vincent Y.|last3=Rogier|first3=Anouk|last4=Buidin|first4=Genevieve|date=2001|title=Threat and the Group Attribution Error: When Threat Elicits Judgments of Extremity and Homogeneity|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=27|issue=4|pages=437–446|doi=10.1177/0146167201274005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The group attribution error has been referred as a term since 1985 by Scott T. Allison and David M. Messick after evaluating numerous researches made between 1970-1985. These researches tie different attribution biases to an individual either 1) the individual's behavior or 2) the outcomes of the group that the individual belongs to. The first one is known as the fundamental attribution error, and the consequent one is known as the group attribution error.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, L. (1977). The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process. ''Advances in experimental social psychology'', ''10'', 173-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human development perception of group attribution==
Infants develop the ability to categorize first by putting a gender label to other children. Then, the difference in color of the skin begins to play a role in their ability to distinguish different backgrounds. Consequently, group attribution biases towards members of different groups, either on race or gender, affect their ability to judge others.&lt;ref&gt;Killen, M., &amp; Rutland, A. (2011). ''Children and social exclusion: Morality, prejudice, and group identity''. Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the conception of children believing that "all girls are quiet" illustrates the influence of categorization and generalization to members of this group (girls).

==Connections to different attribution errors==
The [[fundamental attribution error]] is similar to the group attribution error in that it refers to the tendency to believe that an individual's actions are representative of the individual's preferences, even when available information suggests that the actions were caused by outside forces.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. (1975). Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases. In ''Utility, probability, and human decision making'' (pp. 141-162). Springer Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group attribution error and the [[ultimate attribution error]] share the individual's tendency to draw different prejudiced conclusions between in-groups and out-groups. The individuals involved in an in-group would attribute positive conclusions about their group outcomes, yet they would attribute negative conclusions towards the out-group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas F.|date=2016-07-02|title=The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport's Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/014616727900500407|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=461–476|doi=10.1177/014616727900500407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydropower''' or '''water power''' (from  {{lang-el|ύδωρ}}, "water") is [[power (physics)|power]] derived from the [[energy]] of falling water or fast running water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes. Since ancient times, hydropower from many kinds of [[watermill]]s has been used as a [[renewable energy]] source for [[irrigation]] and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as [[gristmill]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[textile]] mills, [[trip hammer]]s, dock [[crane (machine)|cranes]], domestic [[elevator|lifts]], and [[ore]] mills. A [[trompe]], which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower|title=History of Hydropower {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/power.html|title=Niagara Falls History of Power|website=www.niagarafrontier.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, hydropower became a source for generating [[electricity]]. [[Cragside]] in Northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cragside/|title=Cragside Visitor Information|publisher=The National Trust|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at [[Niagara Falls]] in 1879. In 1881, street lamps in the city of Niagara Falls were powered by hydropower.

Since the early 20th century, the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]].  International institutions such as the [[World Bank]] view hydropower as a means for [[economic development]] without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere,&lt;ref name=WP5813&gt;{{cite news|title=World Bank turns to hydropower to square development with climate change|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-08/business/39105348_1_jim-yong-kim-world-bank-hydropower|accessdate=9 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 May 2013|author=Howard Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of India|India]], [[water wheel]]s and [[watermill]]s were built, possibly as early as the 4th century BC, although records of that era are spotty at best.&lt;ref&gt;Terry S. Reynolds, ''Stronger than a Hundred Men: A History of the Vertical Water Wheel'', JHU Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0801872480}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire]], water-powered mills produced flour from grain, and were also used for sawing timber and stone; in China, watermills were widely used since the [[Han dynasty]].  In [[China]] and the rest of the Far East, hydraulically operated "pot wheel" pumps raised water into crop or irrigation canals.{{when|date=August 2015}}

The power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as [[hushing]]. The method was first used at the [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines]] in [[Wales]] from 75 AD onwards, but had been developed in [[Spain]] at such mines as [[Las Médulas]]. Hushing was also widely used in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and later periods to extract [[lead]] and [[tin]] ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Robert|title=British Mining: A Treatise in the History, Discovery, Practical Development, and Future Prospects of Metalliferous Mines of the United Kingdom|date=1887|publisher=Crosby Lockwood and Co|location=London|page=505|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQU55QQHRGcC&amp;pg=PA505&amp;lpg=PA505#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later evolved into [[hydraulic mining]] when used during the [[California Gold Rush]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], Islamic mechanical engineer [[Al-Jazari]] described designs for 50 devices, many of them water powered, in his book, ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'', including clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools, though three are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water. These include [[Scoop wheel|an endless belt with jugs attached]], a cow-powered [[shadoof]], and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Hassani|first1=Salim|title=800 Years Later: In Memory of Al-Jazari, A Genius Mechanical Engineer|url=http://muslimheritage.com/article/800-years-later-memory-al-jazari-genius-mechanical-engineer|website=Muslim Heritage|publisher=The Foundation for Science, Technology, and Civilisation|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better ref needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1753, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late nineteenth century, the [[electric generator]] was developed by a team led by [[project managers]] and prominent pioneers of renewable energy [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] and could now be coupled with hydraulics.&lt;ref name="doehis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydro_history.html |title=History of Hydropower |publisher=US Department of Energy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126001540/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydro_history.html |archivedate=26 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand for the [[Industrial Revolution]] would drive development as well.&lt;ref name="watenc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroelectric Power|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Ge-Hy/Hydroelectric-Power.html|publisher=Water Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, water was the main source of power for new inventions such as [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]].&lt;ref name="kreis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|last=Kreis|first=Steven|year=2001|work=The history guide|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories, it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations, such as driving the bellows in small [[blast furnace]]s (e.g. the [[Dyfi Furnace]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/history/pages/dyfifurnace.shtml|title=Dyfi Furnace|last=Gwynn|first=Osian|work=BBC Mid Wales History|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gristmill]]s, such as those built at [[Saint Anthony Falls]], which uses the 50-foot (15&amp;nbsp;m) drop in the [[Mississippi River]].

In the 1830s, at the early peak in the US [[canal]]-building, hydropower provided the energy to transport [[barge]] traffic up and down steep hills using [[Cable railway|inclined plane railroads]].  As railroads overtook canals for transportation, canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems; the [[history of Lowell, Massachusetts]] is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization, built upon the availability of water power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.uml.edu/clh/Malone/notes_01.pdf|title=Waterpower in Lowell|publisher=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances had moved the open water wheel into an enclosed [[turbine]] or [[Water engine|water motor]]. In 1848 [[James B. Francis]], while working as head engineer of Lowell's Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design. His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions.  The [[Francis turbine|Francis reaction turbine]] is still in wide use today. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry, [[Lester Allan Pelton]] developed the high efficiency [[Pelton wheel|Pelton wheel impulse turbine]], which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous California interior.

=== Hydraulic power-pipe networks ===
[[Hydraulic power network]]s used pipes to carry pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users. The power source was normally a head of water, which could also be assisted by a pump. These were extensive in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cities in the United Kingdom. A hydraulic power network was also developed in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The world-famous [[Jet d'Eau]] was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network.&lt;ref name=geneva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneve-tourisme.ch/?rubrique=0000000172|title=Things to do in Geneva, Switzerland - Geneva Tourism Official Website|website=www.geneve-tourisme.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compressed air hydro ===
{{See also|Trompe}}
Where there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate [[compressed air]] directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|pages=633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydropower types ==
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity}}
Hydropower is used primarily to generate [[electricity]]. Broad categories include:
* [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|Conventional hydroelectric]], referring to hydroelectric dams.
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]], which captures the kinetic energy in rivers or streams, without a large reservoir and sometimes without the use of dams.
* [[Small hydro]] projects are 10 megawatts or less and often have no artificial reservoirs.
* [[Micro hydro]] projects provide a few kilowatts to a few hundred kilowatts to isolated homes, villages, or small industries.
* [[Conduit hydroelectricity]] projects utilize water which has already been diverted for use elsewhere; in a municipal water system, for example.
* [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores water pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.
* [[Tidal stream generator|Off-shore Hydropower]] using energy from [[tidal power]] generated from oceans, rivers, and human-made canal systems to generating electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-hydro.org/tidal-range-off-shore/&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Pressure buffering hydropower]] use natural sources (waves for example) for water pumping to turbines while exceeding water is pumped uphill into reservoirs and releases when incoming water flow isn't enough.

== Calculating the amount of available power ==
A hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available [[Power (physics)|power]]. Power is a function of the [[hydraulic head]] and [[rate of fluid flow]]. The head is the energy per unit weight (or unit mass) of water. The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls. Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.

The power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water, the height of fall, and the local acceleration due to gravity.
In SI units, the power is:

&lt;math&gt;P=\eta\rho\,Qgh\!&lt;/math&gt;

where
* P is power in watts
* η is the dimensionless efficiency of the turbine
* ρ is the density of water in kilograms per cubic metre
* Q is the flow in cubic metres per second
* g is the acceleration due to gravity
* h is the height difference between inlet and outlet in metres

To illustrate, power is calculated for a turbine that is 85% efficient, with water at 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/cubic metre (62.5 pounds/cubic foot) and a flow rate of 80 cubic-meters/second (2800 cubic-feet/second), gravity of 9.81 metres per second squared and with a net head of 145&amp;nbsp;m (480&amp;nbsp;ft).

In SI units:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Power (W)}  = 0.85\times 1000 \times 80 \times 9.81 \times 145 &lt;/math&gt; which gives 97 MW

In English units, the density is given in pounds per cubic foot so acceleration due to gravity is inherent in the unit of weight. A conversion factor is required to change from foot lbs/second to kilowatts:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Power (W)} = 0.85\times 62.5 \times 2800 \times 480 \times 1.356 &lt;/math&gt; which gives 97 MW (130,000 [[horsepower]])

Operators of hydroelectric stations will compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency. Procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as [[ASME]] PTC 18 and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60041. Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer's guaranteed efficiency. Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine will account for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock, rise in tail water level due to flow, the location of the station and effect of varying gravity, the temperature and barometric pressure of the air, the density of the water at ambient temperature, and the altitudes above sea level of the forebay and tailbay. For precise calculations, errors due to rounding and the number of [[significant digit]]s of constants must be considered.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Some hydropower systems such as [[water wheel]]s can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the [[kinetic energy]] of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=S. K.|first1=Sahdev|title=Basic Electrical Engineering|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9789332576797|page=418|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The water flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season. Development of a hydropower site requires analysis of [[streamflow|flow records]], sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However reservoirs have significant [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|environmental impact]], as does alteration of naturally occurring stream flow. The design of dams must also account for the worst-case, "probable maximum flood" that can be expected at the site; a [[spillway]] is often included to bypass flood flows around the dam. A computer [[Hydrological modelling|model of the hydraulic basin]] and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Sustainability ==
{{see also|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
As with other forms of economic activity, hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact, because the construction of a dam and power plant, along with the impounding of a reservoir, creates certain social and physical changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Allure and Perils of Hydropower |url = https://undark.org/article/hydropower-dams-albania-vjosa/|website = www.undark.org|accessdate = 2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;These environmental and social impact are not limited to but include the removal of communities near the dam, as well as the hindrance of fish migration. Since water is being taken away, this also affects local communities access and amount of drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=envstheses&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that dams affect the soil, which then alters the ability of vegetation to grow.&lt;ref&gt;https://search-proquest-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/earthatmosphericaquatic/docview/761185281/fulltext/A0F81B52C7504484PQ/13?accountid=14784&lt;/ref&gt;
Hydropower projects can also have indirect consequences, contributing to [[global warming]]: reservoirs accumulate plant material, which then decomposes, emitting [[methane]] in uneven bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/hundreds-new-dams-could-mean-trouble-our-climate |title=Hundreds of new dams could mean trouble for our climate|work=Science |date=September 28, 2016|accessdate= 2016-10-11 |doi=10.1126/science.aah7356|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/9/766/269391|title=Reservoir Surfaces as Sources of Greenhouse Gases to the Atmosphere: A Global Estimate: Reservoirs are sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and their surface areas have increased to the point where they should be included in global inventories of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases|first1=St|last1=Louis|first2=Vincent|last2=L|first3=Carol A.|last3=Kelly|first4=Éric|last4=Duchemin|first5=John W.

There are several tools to assess the impact of hydropower projects:

*Most new hydropower project must undergo an [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental and Social Impact Assessment]]. This provides a base-line understanding of the pre-project conditions, estimates of potential impacts and puts in place management plans to avoid, mitigate, or compensate for impacts.

*The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is another tool which can be used to promote and guide more sustainable hydropower projects. It is a methodology used to audit the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental, social, technical and economic topics. A Protocol assessment provides a rapid sustainability health check. It does not replace an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA), which takes place over a much longer period of time, usually as a mandatory regulatory requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Home|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[World Commission on Dams]] final report describes a framework for planning water and energy projects that is intended to protect dam-affected people and the environment, and ensure that the benefits from dams are more equitably distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dams and Development Project|url = http://www.unep.org/dams/WCD/|website = www.unep.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151118100259/http%3A//www.unep.org/dams/WCD/|archivedate = 18 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]]'s Environmental and Social Performance Standards define IFC clients' responsibilities for managing their environmental and social risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Environmental and Social Performance Standards and Guidance Notes|url = http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/ifc+sustainability/our+approach/risk+management/performance+standards/environmental+and+social+performance+standards+and+guidance+notes|website = www.ifc.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[World Bank]]’s safeguard policies are used by the Bank to help identify, avoid, and minimize harms to people and the environment caused by investment projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Safeguard Policies|url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/EXTPOLICIES/EXTSAFEPOL/0,,menuPK:584441~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:584435,00.html|website = web.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imran Channa'''  ({{lang-ur|'''عمران''' '''چنه'''}},  is a contemporary [[visual artist]] based in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. He works in multiple media, including [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[sculpture]], [[digital art]] and [[interactive art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://imranchanna.com/bio.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He has been exhibiting nationally and internationally. He teaches at the [[National College of Arts]], [[Lahore]]. He lives and works in Lahore.

== Life ==
Imran Channa was born in [[Shikarpur, Pakistan|Shikarpur]], [[Sindh]]. After completing his initial education in [[Shikarpur District|Shikarpur]] . He moved to [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] to explore art, where he met with artist, art teacher and writer Fatah Halepoto. He worked for 3 years in Hyderabad under the influence of his teacher . He graduated  in the Department of Fine Arts at and post-graduated in MA Hons. Visual Arts programme at National College of Arts, [[Lahore]].

== Art career ==
Various critics and publications have spoken of the direction and impact of Channa's work. Asim Akhtar in ''Pause Play'' wrote, "There is a revolutionary lexicography behind Channa’s visual vocabulary that is deeply rooted in the syntax and morphology of that visual modernity, and without it one will never learn how to read his pictures. His art is the very vision of an alterity that sets the political tyranny of language off balance – and with that liberates those who have gathered around the festive occasion of his art."&lt;ref&gt;Asim Akhtar. PAUSE PLAY. Libas international Magazine, Volume 23 issue 2010. Lahore&lt;/ref&gt; 
In ''Starring: The Artist''', Quddus Mirza said, "The interplay of obvious and unusualness makes his work, interesting and intriguing."&lt;ref&gt;2009. Mirza, Quddus Starring: The Artist. IVS Publication Karachi.&lt;/ref&gt;
Reflecting on the focus of his work and its impact, Yee-Wan Koon in ''MUSE'' wrote, "Imran Channa's work is based on historical perspectives. He questions the authenticity of history, which is constructed and manipulated by the power."

The art critic Maheen Bashir Adam Jee wrote in the article "messages for The Discerning" that: "Channa’s work, ‘Making of the History,’ defies the norm with its very title. The deliberate inclusion of “the” in the title challenges more than just grammar. Channa questions the veracity of the Badshahnama – a tale of kings, commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan – and the practice of getting one’s history written under one’s own auspices. The authenticity of Badshahnama’s account, on the making of the Taj Mahal, was first called into question by historian [[P. N. Oak]], who asserted that the Taj Mahal was, in fact, an ancient Hindu temple of Lord Shiva, usurped for Queen Mumtaz Mahal."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2010/05/messages-for-the-discerning/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16727">'''Incorporeal''' or '''uncarnate''' means without a [[physical body]], [[Metaphysics of presence|presence]] or [[Shape|form]]. It is often used in reference to [[souls]], [[spirit]]s, and [[God]] in many [[religion]]s including [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. In [[ancient philosophy]], any attenuated "thin" matter such as [[air]], [[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[fire]] or [[light]] was considered incorporeal.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. [https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/212/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks believed [[air (classical element)|air]], as opposed to solid [[earth (classical element)|earth]], to be incorporeal, in so far as it is less resistant to movement; and the ancient Persians believed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] to be incorporeal in that every soul was said to be produced from it.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. [https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/232/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In modern philosophy, a distinction between the incorporeal and immaterial is not necessarily maintained: a body is described as incorporeal if it is not made out of matter.

In the [[problem of universals]], universals are separable from any particular embodiment in one sense, while in another, they seem inherent nonetheless. Aristotle offered a [[hylomorphic]] account of abstraction in contrast to Plato's world of [[Theory of Forms|Forms]]. Aristotle used the Greek terms ''[[wikt:somatic|soma]]'' (body) and ''[[hyle]]'' (matter, literally "wood").

The notion that a causally effective incorporeal body is even coherent requires the belief that something can affect what's material, without physically existing at the point of effect. A ball can directly affect another ball by coming in direct contact with it, and is visible because it reflects the light that directly reaches it. An incorporeal field of influence, or immaterial body could not perform these functions because they have no physical construction with which to perform these functions. Following Newton, it became customary to accept [[action at a distance]] as brute fact, and to overlook the philosophical problems involved in so doing.

{{quote|As early as Xenophanes (ca. 565-470 BC)... we find at least a tendency towards monotheism: "One god, greatest among gods and men, in no way similar to mortals either in body or in thought"... [He posits] a god who is the cause of all: "Always he remains in the same place, moving not at all: nor is it fitting for him to go to different places at different times... but without toil he shakes all things by the thought of his mind"...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In ''Physics'' VIII,5, [Aristotle] speaks favorably of Anaxagoras' Mind in so far as it is "impassive and unmixed [with the world]"... How can Aristotle have held both that God is immanent and also "impassive and unmixed"? Much of his argument depends on an analogy drawn from geometry. Just as the primary locus of power and influence in a rotating sphere is its central axis, which, although it moves (transitively) the other parts of the sphere, remains quite still, so also the unmoved mover remains majestically impassive even while being the very source of the activity of the universe (''Physics'' VIII,9,265b7-8)... Aristotle rejects the notion that God might think of something other than himself precisely because this would be to diminish his power (''Metaphysics'' XII,9,1074b34). The power that Aristotle is concerned about is the power whereby God has an effect in the world (''Metaphysics'' XII,6,1071b12-32). (In ''Physics'' VIII,5, Aristotle also says of Anaxagoras' Mind that "it could only cause motion the way it does being unmoved, and it can only ''rule'' being unmixed" -- 256b26-7: emphasis added.) So, we must conceive of God's thoughts about himself as bound up with his immanency (''Metaphysics'' I,2,983a8-10, III,4,1000b3-6). Aristotle offers an explanation of how this works: just as our (internal) intentions ''are'' their external objects less their matter, so God thinks himself in the things that depend on him (''Metaphysics'' XII,9,1047b38-a5: also ''De Anima'' III,5,430a-19-20). The interpretation of Thomas Aquinas would appear then to be correct, that it is precisely in thinking of himself that God knows—and controls—all other things...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Taliaferro |first2=P. |last2=Draper |first3=P.L. |last3=Quinn |year=2010 |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion |series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405163576 |lccn=2009037505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA84 |pages=84, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Kevin L.

In chapter 10 of ''De ratione animae'', Alcuin defines ''anima'' (soul) by combining Platonic attributes, including intellect and reason, ceaseless motion and immortality with the Christian tenents of free will and salvation. As a means of interaction with corporeals such as the human body and incorporeals such as God and the Forms, his definition includes traits pertaining to the soul as an incarnate entity within the natural world.&lt;ref name="Lockett2011"/&gt;
{{quote|It is one thing to assert that the soul is 'incorporeal' insofar as it is distinct from the human body, and it is quite another thing to espouse the Platonic notion that the soul is utterly incorporeal, or that it is not a body of any kind. Platonic incorporeals differ significantly from the incorporeals of classical Stoicism, which were thought to participate in a diminished form of existence, and from the ''incorporalia'' of the grammatical tradition, which were defined on the basis of their imperceptibility to one or more of the five senses... A Platonic incorporeal is necessarily imperceptible to all the senses, and it does not occupy space. Accordingly, Alcuin writes that the soul is 'invisible, incorporeal, without weight, without colour,' although for a reader who already shared Alcuin's Platonic understanding of incorporeals, the mention of invisibility, weightlessness, and colourlessness was redundant. Alcuin also carefully specifies that the soul is circumscribed but nonetheless whole in every part of the body. In other words, the soul is neither diffused throughout the universe as God is or as a world-soul would be, nor is it distributed throughout a space in such a way that it can be divided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If incorporeality makes the soul imperceptible to the senses, it is even more important that incorporeality allows the soul to apprehend other things that are imperceptible to the senses. The idea that like perceives like goes back to the Greek Presocratics, and in the medieval Latin iterations, it did not have to carry strictly Platonic connotations. Yet principally from Augustine's early dialogues and ''De Trinitate'', Alcuin and other Carolingian thinkers inherited many rational demonstrations of theological doctrines, worked out according to a method of argumentation that combined Neoplatonist metaphysics with Aristotelian logic. Within this mode of discourse, it was exceedingly useful to have recourse to the concept of true incorporeality, and to be able to attribute true incorporeality to the unitary, rational ''anima'', with all of the ontological and epistemological implications that it entails.&lt;ref name="Lockett2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Lockett |year=2011 |title=Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions |series=Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781442642171 |lccn=2011378491 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVycdqSh28C&amp;pg=PA288 |pages=287–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Leslie Lockett|"Why Must the Soul Be Incorporeal?" in ''Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions''}}

{{quote|Traditional forms of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam each conceive of God as an immaterial, nonphysical reality. If "the incorporeality of God" means the denial that God is physical, then all three monotheistic religions accept the incorporeality of God. However, if we follow the etymology of the term and define "incoporeality" as "without body" (from the Latin ''incorporale''), Christianity takes exception to a strict adherence to belief in God's incorporeality when it comes to the Incarnation. According to traditional Christianity, in the Incarnation, the second member of the Trinity... became infleshed (the Latin meaning of ''incarnatus'') and thus, in a sense, came to be "with body." While this pivotal claim about the union of God and man at the heart of Christianity marks a dramatic departure from a radical transcendent theology of God according to which any such union is metaphysically impossible, it does not commit Christians to denying God's immateriality. In traditional Christianity, God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son (apart from the Incarnation) are clearly understood as lacking material structure and composition. Because of the shared conviction that God is immaterial, Christians along with Jews and Muslims have historically opposed material conceptions of God or gods such as one finds in Stoicism, according to which God is a vast material being, a world soul or animal, and in polytheism, according to which there are hosts of material deities. God's immaterial reality has also been used to articulate an important difference between monotheism and versions of pantheism... according to which the material world either is God or a part of God.&lt;ref name="Taliaferro2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Taliaferro |first2=P. |last2=Draper |first3=P.L. |last3=Quinn |year=2010 |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion |series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405163576 |lccn=2009037505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA292 |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Charles Taliaferro]]|"Incorporeality" in ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''}}

===LDS view===

Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church, Mormons) view the mainstream Christian belief in God's incorporeality as being founded upon a post-Apostolic departure from the traditional Judeo-Christian belief in an anthropomorphic, corporeal God. This concept of a corporeal God is supported by Biblical references to his face, mouth, finger, feet, back, and right hand; as well as various references to God creating man his own image and likeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/tg/god-body-of-corporeal-nature?lang=eng |title= Topical Guide: God, Body of, Corporeal Nature |website= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208231344/http://www.lds.org/scriptures/tg/god-body-of-corporeal-nature?lang=eng |archive-date= 2014-12-08 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Robinson |first= Stephen E. |contribution= God the Father: Overview |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3732 |pages= 548–550 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H.

Mormons believe that when the Church's foundation of revelation ({{lds|Ephesians|eph|2|20}}, {{lds||eph|4|12|14}}) crumbled with the martyrdom of the Apostles, doctrine gradually began to shift as a result of the speculation and reasoning of theologians who took it upon themselves to continue the development of Christian doctrine despite not being authorized receivers of revelation for the body of the church. The writings of many of these post-Apostolic theologians show that they were influenced in varying degrees by the prevailing Greek metaphysical philosophies of that era, which strongly rejected the idea of a corporeal, material God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.fairmormon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Bickmore.GodHaveBody.pdf |title= Does God Have a Body in Human Form? |last= Bickmore |first= Barry R. |authorlink= Barry R.

Outler |origyear= c. 400 |year= 1955 |lccn= 55005021 |place= Philadelphia |publisher= Westminster Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo]] attributed his conception of God as incorporeal substance to Neoplatonism: "I no longer thought of thee, O God, by the analogy of a human body. Ever since I inclined my ear to philosophy I had avoided this error". Origen's preoccupation with the philosophers' concept of God is apparent in this quote from “Homilies on Genesis and Exodus”: "The Jews indeed, but also some of our own people, supposed that God should be understood as a man; that is, adorned with human members and human appearance. But the philosophers despise these stories as fabulous and formed in the likeness of poetic fictions".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Heine, translator; "Origen: Homilies on Genesis and Exodus", The Catholic University of America Press, Washington D.C., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

This Hellenistic rejection of anything material in the "metaphysical" world caused the resurrection to be one of the most hotly debated doctrines. This was apparent in the Greek's skeptical reaction to the doctrine of the resurrection in {{lds|Acts|acts|17}}, and is what prompted Paul's defense of the resurrection in {{lds|1 Corinthians|1-cor|15}}. In “Expositions on the Psalms” Augustine wrote, “Nothing has been attacked with the same pertinacious, contentious contradiction, in the Christian faith, as the resurrection of the flesh...many Gentile philosophers have...written that the soul is immortal: when they come to the resurrection of the flesh...they most openly deny it, declaring it to be absolutely impossible that this earthly flesh can ascend to Heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;"Exposition on Psalm 89", Translated by J.E.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note too the American spellings of '''integrated assessment modeling''' and '''integrated modeling'''.}} is a type of [[scientific modelling]] often used by the [[environmental sciences]] and [[environmental policy]] analysis. The modelling is '''integrated''' because environmental problems do not respect the borders between academic disciplines. Integrated assessment models therefore integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. Integrated modelling is referred to as '''assessment''' because the activity aims to generate useful information for policy making, rather than to advance knowledge for knowledge's sake. Integrated assessment modelling is that part of integrated assessment that relies on the use of numerical '''models'''.

Integrated assessment modelling has a long history, and scholars disagree on the first precedent. However, it became recognizable as a sub- or inter-discipline in the late 1980s with a focus on understanding and regulating [[acid rain|acidification]]. Integrated assessment modelling was further developed in the area of [[climate change]], inter alias in the context of the [[Energy Modeling Forum]].

Notable centres of integrated assessment modelling are [[IIASA]], [[MIT]], [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]], and [[International Futures]]. Notable scholars are [[Barry B. Hughes]], [[William Nordhaus|Bill Nordhaus]], [[Robert O. Mendelsohn|Robert Mendelsohn]], [[Richard G. Richels|Rich Richels]], [[Michael Schlesinger]], [[Stephen Schneider]], [[Richard Tol]], [[John Weyant]], and [[Gary Yohe]].

== Interpretation ==

While the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) relies heavily on integrated modeling, [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] lead author Thomas Bruckner cautions against overinterpreting the results from such modeling.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2016-10-26
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  With regard to future technology choice, Bruckner observes that "The ''quantitative deployment'' of [[nuclear power]] or [[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]] technologies that has been found by the IPCC authors in the different mitigation scenarios, for instance, occasionally has been (mis)interpreted as an IPCC ''recommendation for their factual usage''."&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}{{nnbsp}}{{rp|at=emphasis per original}}  Bruckner continues "The scale of deployment of low-carbon technologies shown in [IPCC] diagrams{{nbsp}}... reveals neither the ''possible contribution'' of the respective energy technology to GHG mitigation nor the ''required contribution''.{{nbsp}}... The possible contribution (without considering costs) might be higher whereas the strictly required one could be lower.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

== Criticism ==

Economist [[Robert Pindyck]] argues that IAMs are problematic and "close to useless as tools for policy analysis". He argues that "IAM-based analyses of [[Climate change policy of the United States|climate policy]] create a perception of knowledge and precision that is illusory, and can fool policy-makers into thinking that the forecasts the models generate have some kind of scientific legitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert S. |last1=Pindyck |title=The Use and Misuse of Models for Climate Policy |journal=Review of Environmental Economics and Policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=100–114 |doi=10.1093/reep/rew012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''Jónsson–Tarski algebra''' or '''Cantor algebra''' is an algebraic structure encoding a [[bijection]] from an [[infinite set]] ''X'' onto the [[Cartesian product|product]] ''X''×''X''. They were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Jónsson|first= Bjarni|last2= Tarski|first2= Alfred|author-link= Bjarni Jónsson |author2-link= Alfred Tarski|year=1961|loc=theorem 5}}.  {{harvs|txt|last=Smirnov|year=1971|authorlink=Dmitrii Matveevich Smirnov}}, named them after [[Georg Cantor]] because of Cantor's [[pairing function]] and Cantor's theorem that an infinite set ''X'' has the same number of elements as ''X''×''X''; the term "Cantor algebra" is also occasionally used to mean the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of all [[clopen subset]]s of the [[Cantor set]], or the Boolean algebra of [[Borel subset]]s of the reals modulo [[meager set]]s (sometimes called the [[Cohen algebra]]).

The group of [[Order isomorphism|order preserving automorphisms]] of the free Jónsson–Tarski algebra on one generator is the [[Thompson groups|Thompson group]] ''F''.

==Definition==

A Jónsson–Tarski algebra of type 2 is a set ''A'' with a product ''w'' from ''A''×''A'' to ''A'' and two "projection" maps ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from ''A'' to ''A'', satisfying ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''w''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''w''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''w''(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''a''),''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'')) = ''a''. The definition for type &gt;&amp;nbsp;2 is similar but with ''n'' projection operators.

==Example==

If ''w'' is any bijection from ''A''×''A'' to ''A'' then it can be extended to a unique Jónsson–Tarski algebra by letting ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'')  be the projection of ''w''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'') onto the ''i''th factor.

Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. 169. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved can include parties such as linguists, cultural or community groups, or governments. Some argue for a distinction between '''language revival''' (the resurrection of a [[dead language]] with no existing native speakers) and '''language revitalization''' (the rescue of a "dying" language). It has been pointed out that there has only been one successful instance of a complete language revival, [[Revival of the Hebrew language|that of the Hebrew language]], creating a new generation of native speakers without any pre-existing native speakers as a model.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Redish (2001), ‘Native Languages of the Americas: Endangered Language Revitalization and Revival’.  http://www.native-languages.org/revive.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}

Languages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is [[Endangered language|severely limited]]. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try to revive [[extinct language]]s. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or [[language death]].

Reasons for revitalization vary. In recent times{{when|date=January 2015}} alone, it is estimated that more than 2000 languages have already become extinct. The UN estimates that more than half of the languages spoken today have fewer than 10,000 speakers and that a quarter have fewer than 1,000 speakers and that, unless there are some efforts to maintain them, over the next hundred years most of these will become extinct.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Endangered Languages |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/ |accessdate=2014-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409141047/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/ |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures are often cited as reasons why language revitalization is necessary to preserve linguistic diversity. Culture and identity are also frequently cited reasons for language revitalization, when a language is perceived as a unique "cultural treasure."&lt;ref&gt;Grenoble, Lenore A., and Lindsay J. Whaley. Saving Languages: An Introduction to Language Revitalization. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2006. p. 20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A community often sees language as a unique part of their culture, connecting them with their ancestors or with the land, making up an essential part of their history and self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language revitalization is also closely tied to the linguistic field of [[language documentation]]. In this field, linguists attempt to create full records of a language's grammar, vocabulary, and linguistic features. This practice can often lead to more concern for the revitalization of a specific language on study. Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.&lt;ref&gt;New Perspectives on Endangered Languages. Ed. José A.F. Farfán and Fernando F. Ramallo. Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2010. pp. 1-7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
==The four degrees of language endangerment==
;Healthy/strong
:all generations use language in variety of settings
;Weakening/sick
:spoken by older people; not fully used in younger generations
;Moribund/dying
:only a few speakers (non-children) remain; no longer used as [[first language|native language]] by children
;Dead
:no longer spoken as a native language
;Extinct
:no longer spoken or potentially spoken

==Theory==
One of the most important preliminary steps in language revitalization/recovering involves establishing the degree to which a particular language has been “dislocated”. This helps involved parties find the best way to assist or revive the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsunoda|first=Tasaku|title=Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization|year=2005|publisher=Mounton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps in reversing language shift===
There are many different theories or models that attempt to lay out a plan for language revitalization. One of these is provided by celebrated linguist [[Joshua Fishman]].
Fishman's model for reviving threatened (or sleeping) languages, or for making them sustainable,&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, J. A. (1991). ''Reversing language Shift: Theory and Practice of Assistance to Threatened Languages''. Clevedon : Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, J. A. (ed.) (2001). ''Can Threatened Languages Be Saved? Reversing Language Shift, Revisited: A 21st Century Perspective''. Clevedon : Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of an eight-stage process. Efforts should be concentrated on the earlier stages of restoration until they have been consolidated before proceeding to the later stages. The eight stages are:

#Acquisition of the language by adults, who in effect act as language apprentices (recommended where most of the remaining speakers of the language are elderly and socially isolated from other speakers of the language).
#Create a socially integrated population of active speakers (or users) of the language (at this stage it is usually best to concentrate mainly on the spoken language rather than the written language).
#In localities where there are a reasonable number of people habitually using the language, encourage the informal use of the language among people of all age groups and within families and bolster its daily use through the establishment of local neighbourhood institutions in which the language is encouraged, protected and (in certain contexts at least) used exclusively.
#In areas where oral competence in the language has been achieved in all age groups, encourage literacy in the language, but in a way that does not depend upon assistance from (or goodwill of) the state education system.
#Where the state permits it, and where numbers warrant, encourage the use of the language in compulsory state education.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage the use of the language in the workplace (lower worksphere).
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage the use of the language in local government services and mass media.
#Where the above stages have been achieved and consolidated, encourage use of the language in higher education, government, etc.

This model of language revival is intended to direct efforts to where they are most effective and to avoid wasting energy trying to achieve the later stages of recovery when the earlier stages have not been achieved. For instance, it is probably wasteful to campaign for the use of a language on television or in government services if hardly any families are in the habit of using the language.

Additionally, Tasaku Tsunoda describes a range of different techniques or methods that speakers can use to try to revitalize a language, including techniques to revive extinct languages and maintain weak ones. The techniques he lists are often limited to the current vitality of the language.

He claims that the [[Language immersion|immersion]] method cannot be used to revitalize an extinct or moribund language. In contrast, the master-apprentice method of one-on-one transmission on language proficiency can be used with moribund languages. Several other methods of revitalization, including those that rely on technology such as recordings or media, can be used for languages in any state of viability.&lt;ref name=illustrate&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku.

===Factors in successful language revitalization===
[[David Crystal]], in his book ''Language Death'', proposes that language revitalization is more likely to be successful if its speakers
*increase the language's prestige within the dominant community;
*increase their wealth and income;
*increase their legitimate power in the eyes of the dominant community;
*have a strong presence in the education system;
*can write down the language;
*can use electronic technology.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2000). ''Language Death''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 130-141. {{ISBN|0-521-65321-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival linguistics===
[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] proposes "Revival Linguistics" as a new linguistic discipline and paradigm.
{{quote|Zuckermann's term 'Revival Linguistics' is modelled upon 'Contact Linguistics'. Revival linguistics inter alia explores the universal constraints and mechanisms involved in language reclamation, renewal and revitalization. It draws perspicacious comparative insights from one revival attempt to another, thus acting as an epistemological bridge between parallel discourses in various local attempts to revive sleeping tongues all over the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] and Walsh, Michael 2011.  [https://adelaide.academia.edu/Zuckermann/Papers/267186/Stop_Revive_Survive_Lessons_from_the_Hebrew_Revival_Applicable_to_the_Reclamation_Maintenance_and_Empowerment_of_Aboriginal_Languages_and_Cultures 'Stop, Revive, Survive: Lessons from the Hebrew Revival Applicable to the Reclamation, Maintenance and Empowerment of Aboriginal Languages and Cultures'], ''Australian Journal of Linguistics'' Vol. 31, No. 1, pp. 111-127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Zuckermann, "revival linguistics combines scientific studies of native language acquisition and foreign language learning. After all, language reclamation is the most extreme case of second-language learning. Revival linguistics complements the established area of [[language documentation|documentary linguistics]], which records endangered languages before they fall asleep."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Zuckermann proposes that "revival linguistics changes the field of historical linguistics by, for instance, weakening the family [[tree model]], which implies that a language has only one parent."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

There are disagreements in the field of language revitalization as to the degree that revival should concentrate on maintaining the traditional language, versus allowing simplification or widespread borrowing from the [[majority language]].
====Compromise====
Zuckermann acknowledges the presence of "local peculiarities and idiosyncrasies"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Ghil'ad Zuckermann, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian, Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but suggests that &lt;blockquote&gt;"there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would help revivalists and first nations' leaders to work more efficiently. For example, it is easier to resurrect basic vocabulary and verbal conjugations than sounds and word order. Revivalists should be realistic and abandon discouraging, counter-productive slogans such as "Give us authenticity or give us death!"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Nancy Dorian]] has pointed out that conservative attitudes toward loanwords and grammatical changes often hamper efforts to revitalize endangered languages (as with [[Tiwi language|Tiwi]] in Australia), and  that a division can exist between educated revitalizers, interested in historicity, and remaining speakers interested in locally authentic idiom (as has sometimes occurred with [[Irish language|Irish]]). Some have argued that structural compromise may, in fact, enhance the prospects of survival, as may have been the case with English in the post-Norman period.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy C. Dorian, ‘Purism v. compromise in language revitalisation and language revival’ in 
''Language in Society'' 23, pp. 479-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traditionalist====
Other linguists have argued that when language revitalization borrows heavily from the majority language, the result is a new language, perhaps a [[creole language|creole]] or [[pidgin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Mari C.|title=Language Obsolescence and Revitalization: Linguistic Change in Two Sociolinguistically Contrasting Welsh Communities|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780198237112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9u_GG41b_8C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq=neo+breton+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0jg86DeYXE&amp;sig=52c4ZvYBqk2yVOeMfd47AqIN9UU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis8Pr4mpDTAhUD4IMKHaJcChwQ6AEIVzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=neo%20breton%20language&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the existence of "Neo-Hawaiian" as a separate language from "Traditional Hawaiian" has been proposed, due to the heavy influence of English on every aspect of the revived Hawaiian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=R. Keao NeSmith|title=Tūtū’s Hawaiian and the Emergence of a Neo Hawaiian Language|journal=‘Ōiwi Journal3—A Native Hawaiian Journal|date=2005|url=http://hstrial-knesmith.homestead.com/Oiwi-Journal-_3-1-09_.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been proposed for Irish, with a sharp division between "Urban Irish" spoken by second-language speakers and traditional Irish as spoken as a first language in [[Gaeltacht]] areas. Ó Béarra stated: "...[to] follow the syntax and idiomatic conventions of English, [would be] producing what amounts to little more than English in Irish drag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feargal Ó Béarra|title=Academic paper insights: Late Modern Irish and the Dynamics of Language Change and Language Death|date=July 2008|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291382217_Late_Modern_Irish_and_the_Dynamics_of_Language_Change_and_Language_Death|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the then-moribund [[Manx language|Manx]] language, the scholar T. F. O'Rahilly stated, "When a language surrenders itself to foreign idiom, and when all its speakers become bilingual, the penalty is death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Rahilly|first1=Thomas Francis|title=Irish Dialects Past and Present: With Chapters on Scottish and Manx|date=1932|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|location=Dublin|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Irish_Dialects_Past_and_Present.html?id=lmFiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil McRae has stated that the uses of [[Scottish Gaelic]] are becoming increasingly tokenistic, and native Gaelic idiom is being lost in favor of artificial terms created by second-language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McRae|first1=Neil|title=Dìlseachd, Lughad agus Saor-thoileachas: moladh airson iomairt Gàidhlig a dh’fhaodadh obrachadh|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/3p75g1bowhtekzl/Dilseachd%2C%20Lughad%20agus%20Saor-thoileachas%20copy.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=Scottish Gaelic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific examples==
Total revival of a [[dead language]] (in the sense of having no [[native speaker]]s) into a self-sustaining community of several million [[first language]] speakers has happened only once, in the case of the [[Hebrew language]], now the [[national language]] of [[Israel]].  In this case, there was a unique set of historical and cultural characteristics that facilitated the revival (''see [[Revival of the Hebrew language]]'').

In a related development, [[literary language]]s without [[native speaker]]s enjoyed great prestige and practical utility as [[lingua franca]]s, often counting millions of fluent speakers at a time.  In many such cases, a decline in the use of the literary language, sometimes precipitous, was later accompanied by a strong renewal.  This happened, for example, in the revival of [[Classical Latin]] in the [[Renaissance]], and the revival of [[Sanskrit]] in the early centuries A.D.  An analogous phenomenon in contemporary [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking areas is the expanded use of the literary language ([[Modern Standard Arabic]], a form of the [[Classical Arabic]] of the 6th century A.D.). This is taught to all educated speakers and is used in radio broadcasts, formal discussions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, Alan S. "Arabic." Morphologies of Asia and Africa. Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2007. 560-77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, literary languages have sometimes risen to the level of becoming [[first language]]s of very large language communities.  An example is standard [[Italian language|Italian]], which originated as a literary language derived from the language of 13th-century [[Florence]], especially as used by such important Florentine writers as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]].  This language existed for several centuries primarily as a literary vehicle, with few native speakers; even as late as 1861, on the eve of [[Italian unification]], the language only counted about 500,000 speakers, many non-native, out of a total population of c. 22,000,000.  The subsequent success of the language has been through conscious development, where speakers of any of the numerous [[Italian languages]] were taught standard Italian as a [[second language]] and subsequently imparted it to their children, who learned it as a first language.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Of course this came at the expense of local Italian languages, most of which are now [[Languages_of_Italy#Conservation_status|endangered]]. Success was enjoyed in similar circumstances by [[German language|High German]], [[Czech language|standard Czech]], [[Spanish language|Castilian Spanish]] and other languages.

===Asia===
The [[Ainu language]] of the indigenous [[Ainu people]] of northern Japan is currently moribund, but efforts are underway to revive it. A 2006 survey of the [[Hokkaido]] Ainu indicated that only 4.6% of Ainu surveyed were able to converse in or "speak a little" Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TpdTRuAm8R4C&amp;pg=PA219 Cultural Diversity, Heritage and Human Rights: Intersections in Theory and ... - William Logan, Máiréad Nic Craith - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2001, Ainu was not taught in any elementary or secondary schools in Japan, but was offered at numerous language centres and universities in Hokkaido, as well as at Tokyo's [[Chiba University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oScUXmAkRXIC&amp;pg=PA340 Can Threatened Languages Be Saved?: Reversing Language Shift, Revisited : A ... - Joshua A.

In China, the [[Manchu language]] is one of the most endangered languages, with speakers only in three small areas of Manchuria remaining.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2005. 28. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some enthusiasts are trying to revive the language of [[Manchu people|their ancestors]] using available dictionaries and textbooks, and even occasional visits to [[Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County]] in [[Xinjiang]], where the related [[Xibe language]] is still spoken natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125452110732160485

In the Philippines, a variation of [[Philippine Spanish|Spanish]] that was primarily based on [[Mexican Spanish]] was the ''lingua franca'' of the country since Spanish colonization in 1565 and was an official language alongside [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (a standardized form of the [[Tagalog language]]) and [[Philippine English|English]] until 1987 following a ratification of a new Constitution where it was re-designated as a voluntary language. As a result of its loss as an official language and years of marginalization at the official level during and after American colonization, the use of the Spanish language amongst the overall populace decreased dramatically and became moribund with the remaining native speakers left being mostly elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rn4RHtiX?url=http://lgpolar.com/page/read/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/cultura/2016/04/12/actualidad/1460464651_728256.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19991009202835/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/june98/05_37_013.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is currently seeing a slow revival due to past government promotion under the administration of former President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.congress.gov.ph%2Fdownload%2Fra_12%2FRA09187.pdf&amp;date=2010-07-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070902192237/http://www.ulap.gov.ph/reso2006-28.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, Resolution No. 2006-028 reinstated Spanish as a mandatory subject in secondary schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rE2xF3Ga?url=http://www.schoolsandcourses.com/noticias_ver.asp?idNoticia=238&lt;/ref&gt; Results were immediate as the job demand for Spanish speakers had increased since 2008. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fglobalnation.inquirer.net%2Fnews%2Fbreakingnews%2Fview%2F20081119-173154%2FDemand-for-Spanish-speakers-growing&amp;date=2010-07-14&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the [[Instituto Cervantes|''Instituto Cervantes de Manila'']] reported the number of Filipino Hispanophones with native or non-native knowledge at approximately 3 million (including those who speak the native Spanish-based Creole [[Chavacano Language|Chavacano]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elcastellano.org/noticia.php?id=505&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to government efforts, Spanish has also seen a small revival of interest in media thanks to the importing of [[Telenovela|telenovelas]] and [[Music of Latin America|music from Latin America]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/5rE4Vg911?url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20071206-105314/Spanish_on_comeback_trail_in_Philippines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_en/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/spanish+language+culture/ari27-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hebrew]], once largely a liturgical language, was [[Hebrew revitalization|reestablished as a means of everyday communication]] by Jews migrating to what is now the State of Israel and the Palestinian territories, starting in the nineteenth century: it is the world's most famous and successful example of language revitalization.

In Thailand, there exists a [[Chong language]] revitalization project which is headed by Suwilai Premsrirat.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Australia and New Zealand===
The European colonization of Australia, and the consequent damage sustained by Aboriginal communities, had a catastrophic effect on indigenous languages in the southeast and south of the country, leaving them with no living traditional native speakers. A number of Aboriginal communities in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and elsewhere are now trying to revive these languages. The work is typically directed by a group of elders and other knowledgeable people, with community language workers doing most of the research and teaching. They analyze the data, develop spelling systems and vocabulary and prepare resources. Decisions are made in collaboration. Some communities employ linguists, and there are also linguists who work independently.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Christina Eira, community linguist with the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages (VACL), ‘Aboriginal Revival Languages,’ Lingua Franca, 27 June 2009, Radio National: http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/aboriginal-revival-languages/3066470. Retrieved  21 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best cases of relative success in language revitalization is the case of [[Māori language|Māori]] also known as ''te reo Māori''. It is the ancestral tongue of the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand and a vehicle for prose narrative, sung poetry, and genealogical recital.&lt;ref name=senft&gt;{{cite book|last=Senft|first=Gunter|title=Endangered Austronesian and Australian Aboriginal Languages|year=2010|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|location=Canberra|isbn=9780858836235|pages=185–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of the Māori people is taught in ''te reo Māori'' in sacred learning houses through oral transmission. Even after ''te reo Māori'' became a written language, the oral tradition was preserved.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt;

Once European colonization began, many laws were enacted in order to promote the use of English over ''te reo Māori'' among indigenous people.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; The Education Ordinance Act of 1847 mandated school instruction in English and established boarding schools to speed up assimilation of Māori youths into European culture. The Native School Act of 1858 forbade ''te reo Māori'' from being spoken in schools. The colonial masters also promoted the use of English in Māori homes, convincing many parents that their children would not get jobs unless they spoke English.

During the 1970s, a group of young Māori people, called the Nga Tamatoa, successfully campaigned for Māori to be taught in schools.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; Also, Kohanga Reo, Māori language preschools, called language nests, were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinton &amp; Hale|title=The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0-12-349353-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis was on teaching children the language at a young age, a very effective strategy for language learning. The Māori Language Commission was formed in 1987, leading to a number of national reforms aimed at revitalizing ''te reo Māori''.&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; They include media programs broadcast in ''te reo Māori'', undergraduate college programs taught in ''te reo Māori'', and an annual Māori language week. Each iwi, or tribe, created a language planning program catering to its specific circumstances. These efforts have resulted in a steady increase in children being taught in ''te reo Māori'' in schools since 1996,&lt;ref name=senft /&gt; creating a significant number of fluent speakers and making Māori prominent and useful in the people's daily lives. The program has been so successful that similar programs have been based on it. See [[Māori language revival]].

===Europe===
In [[Europe]], in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the use of both local and learned [[languages of Europe|languages]] declined as the central governments of the different states imposed their vernacular language as the standard throughout education and official use (this was the case in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and  [[Greece]], and to some extent, in [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the last few decades, local [[nationalism]] and [[human rights]] movements have made a more [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] policy standard in European states; sharp condemnation of the earlier practices of suppressing regional languages was expressed in the use of such terms as "[[language death|linguicide]]". Campaigns have raised the profiles of local languages to such an extent that in some European regions, the local languages have acquired the status of [[official language]]s, along with the national language. The [[Council of Europe]]'s action in this area (see [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]) is in contrast to the [[European Union]]'s granting of official status to a restricted number of official languages (see [[Languages of the European Union]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Presently, official attempts to revitalise languages under threat, such as the promotion of [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in their respective native regions, have seen varying degrees of success.

====Irish====
{{main|Revival of the Irish language}}
One of the best known European attempts at language revitalization concerns the [[Irish language]]. While English is dominant through most of Ireland, Irish, a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], is still spoken in certain areas called ''[[Gaeltacht]]aí'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Carnie, Andrew. "Modern Irish: Modern Irish: A Case Study in Language Revival Failure." (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; but there it is in serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;This decline was noted in 2002. {{cite web|url=http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage/Publications/Report%20of%20Coimisi%C3%BAn%20na%20Gaeltachta.pdf |title=Report of the Gaeltacht Commission |year=2002 |accessdate=20 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017090003/http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage/Publications/Report%20of%20Coimisi%C3%BAn%20na%20Gaeltachta.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges faced by the language over the last few centuries have included exclusion from important domains, social denigration, the death or emigration of many Irish speakers during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of the 1840s, and continued emigration since. Efforts to revitalise Irish were being made, however, from the mid-1800s, and were associated with a desire for Irish political independence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Contemporary Irish language revitalization has chiefly involved teaching Irish as a compulsory language in mainstream English-speaking schools. But the failure to teach it in an effective and engaging way means (as linguist Andrew Carnie notes) that students do not acquire the fluency needed for the lasting viability of the language, and this leads to boredom and resentment. Carnie also noted a lack of media in Irish (2006),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; though this is no longer the case.

The decline of the Gaeltachtaí and the failure of state-directed revitalisation have been countered by an urban revival movement. This is largely based on an independent community-based school system, known generally as [[Gaelscoil]]eanna. These schools teach entirely through Irish and their number is growing, with over thirty such schools in Dublin alone.&lt;ref&gt;Gaelscoileanna Teo – Statistics: http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/en/about/statistics/&lt;/ref&gt; They are an important element in the creation of a network of urban Irish speakers (known as Gaeilgeoirí), who tend to be young, well-educated and middle-class. It is now likely that this group has acquired critical mass, a fact reflected in the expansion of Irish-language media.&lt;ref name="gaelport"&gt;http://www.gaelport.com/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;NewsItemID=3726: ‘Schism fears for Gaeilgeoirí,’ Brian Ó Broin, 16 January 2010, ''The Irish Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish language television has enjoyed particular success.&lt;ref&gt;See the website of TG4: http://www.tg4.ie/.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that they tend to be better educated than monolingual English speakers and enjoy higher social status.&lt;ref&gt;‘Language and Occupational Status: Linguistic Elitism in the Irish Labour Market,’ The Economic and Social Review, Vol. 40, No. 4, Winter, 2009, pp. 435–460: https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html&lt;/ref&gt; They represent the transition of Irish to a modern urban world, with an accompanying rise in prestige.

====Scottish Gaelic====
There are also current attempts to revive the related language of [[Scottish Gaelic]], which was suppressed following the formation of the United Kingdom, and entered further decline due to the [[Highland clearances]]. Currently, Gaelic is only spoken widely on the Western Isles and some areas of the Highland and Islands.  The decline in fluent Gaelic speakers has slowed, however the population center has shifted to L2 speakers in urban areas, especially Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Census shows decline in Gaelic speakers 'slowed' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24281487 |accessdate=23 June 2014 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=ALISON CAMPSIE|title=Gaelic speakers map: Where in Scotland is Gaelic thriving?|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/gaelic-speakers-map-where-in-scotland-is-gaelic-thriving-1-3903467|accessdate=6 April 2017|work=www.scotsman.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manx====
{{main|Manx language revival}}
Another Celtic language, [[Manx language|Manx]], lost its last native speaker in 1974 and was declared extinct by [[UNESCO]] in 2009, but never completely fell from use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/isle_of_man/7901763.stm|title=UN declares Manx Gaelic 'extinct'|date=2009-02-20|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is now taught in primary and secondary schools including the [[Bunscoill Ghaelgagh]], used in some public events and spoken as a second language by approximately 1800 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/02/how-manx-language-came-back-from-dead-isle-of-man|title=How the Manx language came back from the dead|last=Whitehead|first=Sarah|date=2015-04-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revitalization efforts include radio shows in Manx Gaelic and social media and online resources. The Manx government has also been involved in the effort by creating organizations such as the Manx Heritage Foundation (also known as [[Culture Vannin]]) and the position of Manx Language Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Gary N.|last2=Johnson|first2=Henry|last3=Sallabank|first3=Julia|date=2015-07-03|title=‘I'm not dead yet': a comparative study of indigenous language revitalization in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14664208.2014.972535|journal=Current Issues in Language Planning|volume=16|issue=3|pages=259–278|doi=10.1080/14664208.2014.972535|issn=1466-4208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has released an official Manx Language Strategy for 2017-2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldweekly.com/reader/view/magazine/2018-01-04/lifelines-for-indigenous-languages/10437|title=Lifelines for indigenous languages {{!}} The World Weekly|website=www.theworldweekly.com|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cornish====
There have been a number of attempts to revive the [[Cornish language]], both privately and some under the [[Cornish Language Partnership]]. Some of the activities have included translation of the Christian scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evertype.com/books/testament-noweth-ucr.html Cornish New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt; a guild of bards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/welcome.htm guild of bards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706051224/http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/welcome.htm |date=2009-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of [[Cornish literature]] in modern Cornish, including novels and poetry.

===North America===
In recent years, a growing number of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes have been trying to revitalize their languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In addition, there are apps (including phrases, word lists and dictionaries) in many Native languages ranging from [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] and [[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]], to [[Lakota language|Lakota]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibway]] and [[Oneida language|Oneida]], [[Massachusett language#Revival|Massachusett]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and [[Gwich'in language|Gwych'in]].

[[Massachusett language|Wampanoag]], a language spoken by the people of the same name in Massachusetts, underwent a revitalization project led by [[Jessie Little Doe Baird]]. The project has seen children speaking the language fluently for the first time in over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessielittledoe.com/jessie_CV.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810115929/http://www.jessielittledoe.com/jessie_CV.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yankeemagazine.com/article/features/wampanoag-language&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are currently attempts at revitalizing the [[Chochenyo language]] of California, which had become extinct.

===South America===
[[Kichwa language|Kichwa]] is the variety of the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] language spoken in [[Ecuador]] and is one of the most widely spoken indigenous languages in South America. Despite this fact, Kichwa is a threatened language, mainly because of the expansion of Spanish in South America. One community of original Kichwa speakers, Lagunas, was one of the first indigenous communities to switch to the Spanish language.&lt;ref name=beginning&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|pages=71–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to King, this was because of the increase of trade and business with the large Spanish-speaking town nearby. The Lagunas people assert that it was not for cultural assimilation purposes, as they value their cultural identity highly.&lt;ref name=beginning /&gt; However, once this contact was made, language for the Lagunas people shifted through generations, to Kichwa and Spanish bilingualism and now is essentially Spanish monolingualism. The feelings of the Lagunas people present a dichotomy with language use, as most of the Lagunas members speak Spanish exclusively and only know a few words in Kichwa.

The prospects for Kichwa language revitalization are not promising, as parents depend on schooling for this purpose, which is not nearly as effective as continual language exposure in the home.&lt;ref name=end&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|pages=187–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schooling in the Lagunas community, although having a conscious focus on teaching Kichwa, consists of mainly passive interaction, reading, and writing in Kichwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Kendall|title=Language Revitalization Processes and Prospects: Quichua in the Ecuadorian Andes|year=2001|publisher=Multilingual Matters LTD|location=New York|isbn=1-85359-494-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to grassroots efforts, national language revitalization organizations, like [[CONAIE]], focus attention on non-Spanish speaking indigenous children, who represent a large minority in the country. Another national initiative, Bilingual Intercultural Education Project (PEBI), was ineffective in language revitalization because instruction was given in Kichwa and Spanish was taught as a second language to children who were almost exclusively Spanish monolinguals.
Although some techniques seem ineffective, Kendall A. King provides several suggestions:

# Exposure to and acquisition of the language at a young age.
# 
# Extreme immersion techniques.
# 
# Multiple and diverse efforts to reach adults.
# 
# Flexibility and coordination in planning and implementation
# 
# Directly addressing different varieties of the language.
# 
# Planners stressing that language revitalization is a long process
# 
# Involving as many people as possible
# 
# Parents using the language with their children
# 
# Planners and advocates approaching the problem from all directions.

Specific suggestions include imparting an elevated perception of the language in schools, focusing on grassroots efforts both in school and the home, and maintaining national and regional attention.&lt;ref name=end /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[John McWhorter]] has argued that programs to revive indigenous languages will almost never be very effective because of the practical difficulties involved. He also argues that the death of a language does not necessarily mean the death of a culture.  Indigenous expression is still possible even when the original language has disappeared, as with Native American groups and as evidenced by the vitality of black American culture in the United States, among people who speak not Yoruba but English. He argues that language death is, ironically, a sign of hitherto isolated peoples migrating and sharing space: “To maintain distinct languages across generations happens only amidst unusually tenacious self-isolation—such as that of the Amish—or brutal segregation”.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;John McWhorter, ‘The Cosmopolitan Tongue: The Universality of English’ in World Affairs Journal, Fall 2009: http://worldaffairsjournal.org/article/cosmopolitan-tongue-universality-english&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenan Malik]] has also argued that it is "irrational" to try to preserve all the world's languages, as language death is natural and in many cases inevitable, even with intervention. He proposes that language death improves communication by ensuring more people speak the same language. This may benefit the economy and reduce conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11304255 |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Are dying languages worth saving? |date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenanmalik.com/essays/die.html |title=Let Them Die |first=Kenan |last=Malik |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]] |date=November 20, 2000 &lt;!-- original publication: http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/letthemdie/ --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others{{who?|date=April 2018}} have pointed out that similarities in language and culture have not prevented brutal civil wars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">The '''marginal efficiency of capital''' (MEC) is that [[Discounting|rate of discount]] which would equate the price of a [[Fixed asset|fixed]] [[Capital (economics)|capital]] [[asset]] with its [[Discounted cash flow|present discounted value of expected income]].

The term “marginal efficiency of capital” was introduced by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in his ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money|General Theory]]'', and defined as “the rate of [[discounting|discount]] which would make the [[present value]] of the series of [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuities]] given by the returns expected from the [[capital asset]] during its life just equal its supply price”.&lt;ref name="keynesDef"&gt;Keynes, John Maynard; ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money'' (1936), p 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MEC is the net rate of return that is expected from the purchase of additional capital. It is calculated as the profit that a firm is expected to earn considering the cost of inputs and the [[depreciation]] of capital. 
It is influenced by expectations about future input costs and demand. 
The MEC and capital outlays are the elements that a firm takes into account when deciding about an investment project.

The MEC needs to be higher than the [[rate of interest]], ''r'', for investment to take place. This is because the present value PV of future returns to capital needs to be higher than the cost of capital, C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.
These variables can be expressed as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;PV =\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{R_i }{ (1 + r)^i},&lt;/math&gt; where ''n'' is the number of years during which the capital will be productive, and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the net return in year ''i'';
* &lt;math&gt;C_k =\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{ R_i }{ (1 + MEC)^i},&lt;/math&gt; where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the upfront capital outlays; this equation defines the MEC.
Hence, for investment to take place, it is necessary that PV &gt; C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;; that is, MEC &gt; r.
As a consequence, an inverse relationship between the rate of interest and investment is found (i.e.: a higher rate of interest generates less investment).

With the [[European Commission]] according to its data bank "AMECO" (Annual Macro-Economic Data) the Marginal efficiency of capital is defined as "Change in [[GDP]] at constant market prices of year T per unit of [[gross fixed capital formation]] at constant prices of year T-.5 [that is, lagged by half a year].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/ameco/user/serie/ResultSerie.cfm "Marginal Efficiency of Capital" in Ameco]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33900">In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''maximum sustainable yield''' or '''MSY''' is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period.  Fundamental to the notion of [[sustainable harvest]], the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely.  Under the assumption of [[logistic function|logistic growth]], resource limitation does not constrain individuals' reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small.  At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the [[carrying capacity]], individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate.  At this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals.  Above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity.  At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero.  The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the [[optimum sustainable yield]] and [[maximum economic yield]].

MSY is extensively used for [[fisheries management]]. Unlike the logistic ([[Milner Baily Schaefer|Schaefer]]) model,&lt;ref name="Schaefer"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSY has been refined in most modern fisheries models and occurs at around 30% &lt;ref name ="Thorpe"&gt;Thorpe 2015&lt;/ref&gt; of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.

However, the approach has been widely criticized as ignoring several key factors involved in fisheries management and has led to the devastating collapse of many fisheries. As a simple calculation, it ignores the size and age of the animal being taken, its reproductive status, and it focuses solely on the species in question, ignoring the damage to the ecosystem caused by the designated level of exploitation and the issue of bycatch. Among [[Conservation biology|conservation biologists]] it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.&lt;ref name=Epitaph&gt;Larkin PA (1977) [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0ZITmBnzlDUJ:fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~gsd/595e/docs/22.%2520Larkin_Epitaph_Max_Sust_Yield.pdf+Larkin+1977+%22An+epitaph+for+the+concept+of+maximum+sustained+yield%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nz&amp;sig=AHIEtbSBFh-w5xzWiBK7rnHSLBmolsfaWA "An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Transactions of the American Fisheries Society'', '''106''': 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lessons&gt;[[Carl Walters|Walters C]] and Maguire J (1996) "Lessons for stock assessment from the northern cod collapse", ''Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries'', '''6''':125–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of MSY as a fisheries management strategy developed in [[Belmar, New Jersey|Belmar]], [[New Jersey]], in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="Russell1931"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=E. S.|title=Some theoretical Considerations on the "Overfishing" Problem|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume=6|issue=1|year=1931|pages=3–20|issn=1054-3139|doi=10.1093/icesjms/6.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hjort et al 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham1935"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=M.|title=Modern Theory of Exploiting a Fishery, and Application to North Sea Trawling|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume=10|issue=3|year=1935|pages=264–274|issn=1054-3139|doi=10.1093/icesjms/10.3.264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It increased in popularity in the 1950s with the advent of surplus-production models with explicitly estimate MSY.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;  As an apparently simple and logical management goal, combined with the lack of other simple management goals of the time, MSY was adopted as the primary management goal by several international organizations (e.g., [[International Whaling Commission|IWC]], [[Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission|IATTC]],&lt;ref&gt;IATTC, Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas|ICCAT]], [[Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization|ICNAF]]), and individual countries.&lt;ref name="Mace"&gt;Mace 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1949 and 1955, the U.S. maneuvered to have MSY declared the goal of international fisheries management (Johnson 2007).  The international MSY treaty that was eventually adopted in 1955 gave foreign fleets the right to fish off any coast. Nations that wanted to exclude foreign boats had to first prove that its fish were overfished.&lt;ref name="Botsford"&gt;Botsford et al 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

As experience was gained with the model, it became apparent to some researchers that it lacked the capability to deal with the real world operational complexities and the influence of [[Trophic level|trophic]] and other interactions. In 1977, [[Peter Anthony Larkin|Peter Larkin]] wrote its epitaph, challenging the goal of maximum sustained yield on several grounds: It put populations at too much risk; it did not account for spatial variability in productivity; it did not account for species other than the focus of the fishery; it considered only the benefits, not the costs, of fishing; and it was sensitive to political pressure.&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larkin|first1=P. A.|title=An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield|journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society|volume=106|issue=1|year=1977|pages=1–11|issn=0002-8487|doi=10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106&lt;1:AEFTCO&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, none of these criticisms was aimed at sustainability as a goal. The first one noted that seeking the absolute MSY with uncertain parameters was risky. The rest point out that the goal of MSY was not holistic; it left out too many relevant features.&lt;ref name="Botsford"/&gt;

Some managers began to use more conservative quota recommendations, but the influence of the MSY model for [[fisheries management]] still prevailed. Even while the scientific community was beginning to question the appropriateness and effectiveness of MSY as a management goal,&lt;ref name="Larkin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sissenwine 1978&lt;/ref&gt; it was incorporated into the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea]], thus ensuring its integration into national and international fisheries acts and laws.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt; According to Walters and Maguire, an ‘‘institutional juggernaut had been set in motion’’, climaxing in the early 1990s with the [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse of northern cod]].&lt;ref&gt;Walters and Maguire, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modelling MSY ==

=== Population growth ===
{{see also|Population growth}}

The key assumption behind all [[sustainable harvest]]ing models such as MSY is that populations of organisms grow and replace themselves – that is, they are renewable resources.  Additionally it is assumed that because the growth rates, survival rates, and reproductive rates increase when harvesting reduces [[population density]],&lt;ref name="Russell1931"/&gt; they produce a surplus of biomass that can be harvested.  Otherwise, [[sustainable harvest]] would not be possible.

Another assumption of renewable resource harvesting is that populations of [[organisms]] do not continue to grow indefinitely; they reach an equilibrium population size, which occurs when the number of individuals matches the resources available to the population (i.e., assume classic [[logistic function|logistic growth]]).  At this equilibrium population size, called the [[carrying capacity]], the population remains at a stable size.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998, pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:logisticpopulationgrowth2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1]]

The logistic model (or [[logistic function]]) is a function that is used to describe bounded [[population growth]] under the previous two assumptions.  The [[logistic function]] is bounded at both extremes: when there are not individuals to reproduce, and when there is an equilibrium number of individuals (i.e., at [[carrying capacity]]).  Under the logistic model, population growth rate between these two limits is most often assumed to be [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] (Figure 1).  There is scientific evidence that some populations do grow in a logistic fashion towards a stable equilibrium – a commonly cited example is the [[logistic growth]] of [[yeast]].

The equation describing logistic growth is:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; N_{t} = \frac{K}{1 + \frac{K-N_0}{N_0} e^{-rt}}&lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.1)

The parameter values are:
:: &lt;math&gt; N_{t}&lt;/math&gt;=The population size at time t

:: &lt;math&gt; K&lt;/math&gt;=The carrying capacity of the population

:: &lt;math&gt; N_{0}&lt;/math&gt;= The population size at time zero

:: &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt;= the intrinsic rate of population increase (the rate at which the population grows when it is very small)

From the logistic function, the population size at any point can be calculated as long as &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; N_{0}&lt;/math&gt; are known.

[[Image:growthratevs.populationsize.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2]]

Differentiating equation 1.1 give an expression for how the rate of population increases as N increases.  At first, the population growth rate is fast, but it begins to slow as the population grows until it levels off to the maximum growth rate, after which it begins to decrease (figure 2).

The equation for figure 2 is the differential of equation 1.1 ([[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst's]] 1838 [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|growth model]]):&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = r N \left(1 - \frac {N}{K} \right)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.2)

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; can be understood as the change in population (N) with respect to a change in time (t).  Equation 1.2 is the usual way in which logistic growth is represented mathematically and has several important features.  First, at very low population sizes, the value of &lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{K}&lt;/math&gt; is small, so the population growth rate is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt; rN&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the population is growing exponentially at a rate r (the intrinsic rate of population increase).  Despite this, the population growth rate is very low (low values on the y-axis of figure 2) because, even though each individual is reproducing at a high rate, there are few reproducing individuals present.  Conversely, when the population is large the value of &lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{K}&lt;/math&gt; approaches 1 effectively reducing the terms inside the brackets of equation 1.2 to zero.  The effect is that the population growth rate is again very low, because either each individual is hardly reproducing or mortality rates are high.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   As a result of these two extremes, the population growth rate is maximum at an intermediate population or half the carrying capacity (&lt;math&gt;N= \frac{K}{2}&lt;/math&gt;).

=== MSY model ===

[[Image:harvestingrates.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3]]

The simplest way to model harvesting is to modify the logistic equation so that a certain number of individuals is continuously removed:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - H &lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.3)

Where H represents the number of individuals being removed from the population – that is, the harvesting rate.  When H is constant, the population will be at equilibrium when the number of individuals being removed is equal to the population growth rate (figure 3). The equilibrium population size under a particular harvesting regime can be found when the population is not growing – that is, when &lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  This occurs when the population growth rate is the same as the harvest rate:

:: &lt;math&gt; rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) = H &lt;/math&gt;

Figure 3 shows how growth rate varies with population density.  For low densities (far from carrying capacity), there is little addition (or "recruitment") to the population, simply because there are few organisms to give birth.  At high densities, though, there is intense competition for resources, and growth rate is again low because the death rate is high.  In between these two extremes, the population growth rate rises to a maximum value (&lt;math&gt; N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt;).   This maximum point represents the maximum number of individuals that can be added to a population by natural processes.  If more individuals than this are removed from the population, the population is at risk for decline to extinction.&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;Jennings et al 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum number that can be harvested in a sustainable manner, called the maximum sustainable yield, is given by this maximum point.

Figure 3 also shows several possible values for the harvesting rate, H.  At &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;, there are two possible population equilibrium points: a low population size (&lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt;) and a high one (&lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt;).  At &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, a slightly higher harvest rate, however there is only one equilibrium point (at &lt;math&gt; N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt;), which is the population size that produces the maximum growth rate.  With logistic growth, this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, is where the population size is half the carrying capacity (or &lt;math&gt; N = \frac{K}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). The maximum sustainable yield is the largest yield that can be taken from a population at equilibrium.
In figure 3, if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is higher than &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, the harvesting would exceed the population's capacity to replace itself at any population size (&lt;math&gt; H_3&lt;/math&gt; in figure 3).  Because harvesting rate is higher than the population growth rate at all values of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, this rate of harvesting is not sustainable.

An important feature of the MSY model is how harvested populations respond to environmental fluctuations or illegal offtake.  Consider a population at &lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt; harvested at a constant harvest level &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;.  If the population falls (due to a bad winter or illegal harvest) this will ease density-dependent population regulation and increase yield, moving the population back to &lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt;, a stable equilibrium.  In this case, a negative feedback loop creates stability.  The lower equilibrium point for the constant harvest level &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; is not stable however; a population crash or illegal harvesting will decrease population yield farther below the current harvest level, creating a [[positive feedback]] loop leading to extinction.  Harvesting at &lt;math&gt;N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt; is also potentially unstable.  A small decrease in the population can lead to a positive feedback loop and extinction if the harvesting regime (&lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;) is not reduced.  Thus, some consider harvesting at MSY to be unsafe on ecological and economic grounds.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"&gt;Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  The MSY model itself can be modified to harvest a certain percentage of the population or with constant effort constraints rather than an actual number, thereby avoiding some of its instabilities.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

The MSY equilibrium point is semi-stable – a small increase in population size is compensated for, a small decrease to extinction if H is not decreased.  Harvesting at MSY is therefore dangerous because it is on a knife-edge – any small population decline leads to a positive feedback, with the population declining rapidly to extinction if the number of harvested stays the same.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;

The formula for maximum sustained harvest (&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;) is one-fourth the maximum population or carrying capacity (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) times the intrinsic rate of growth (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Bolden and Robinson 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; H = \frac{Kr}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

=== For demographically structured populations ===
The principle of MSY often holds for age-structured populations as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=William J.|date=1980-01-01|title=Optimum Age-Specific Harvesting in a Nonlinear Population Model|jstor=2556112|journal=Biometrics|volume=36|issue=4|pages=579–593|doi=10.2307/2556112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculations can be more complicated, and the results often depend on whether density dependence occurs in the larval stage (often modeled as density dependent reproduction) and/or other life stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=2HjvNbzWuTMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=%22Optimal+Control+of+Age-structured+Populations+in+Economy,+Demography,+and+the+Environment&amp;ots=mCg54KPuRi&amp;sig=eWk-Pz7XeB7WxXHUVeLywWMWais#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Optimal%20Control%20of%20Age-structured%20Populations%20in%20Economy,%20Demography,%20and%20the%20Environment&amp;f=false|title=Optimal Control of Age-structured Populations in Economy, Demography, and the Environment|last=Boucekkine|first=Raouf|last2=Hritonenko|first2=Natali|last3=Yatsenko|first3=Yuri|date=2013-05-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136920935|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that if density dependence only acts on larva, then there is an optimal life stage (size or age class) to harvest, with no harvest of all other life stages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Hence the optimal strategy is to harvest this most valuable life-stage at MSY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getz|first=Wayne M.|date=1980-01-01|title=The ultimate-sustainable-yield problem in nonlinear age-structured populations|url=https://www.mysciencework.com/publication/show/157dcc9f75a6172a154d8c9da5c7e7bb|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|language=en|volume=48|issue=3-4|pages=279–292|doi=10.1016/0025-5564(80)90062-0|issn=0025-5564|access-date=2017-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203111733/https://www.mysciencework.com/publication/show/157dcc9f75a6172a154d8c9da5c7e7bb|archive-date=2017-02-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in age and stage-structured models, a constant MSY does not always exist. In such cases, cyclic harvest is optimal where the yield and resource fluctuate in size, through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Optimal Harvesting of Age-structured Fish Populations|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.5950/0738-1360-24.2.147|journal=Marine Resource Economics|language=en-US|doi=10.5950/0738-1360-24.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, environmental stochasticity interacts with demographically structured populations in fundamentally different ways than for unstructured populations when determining optimal harvest. In fact, the optimal biomass to be left in the ocean, when fished at MSY, can be either higher or lower than in analogous deterministic models, depending on the details of the density dependent recruitment function, if stage-structure is also included in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Conrad|first2=Jon M.|date=2015-11-01|title=Optimal escapement in stage-structured fisheries with environmental stochasticity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556415001753?np=y&amp;npKey=61e2ba84d62d6ab3316edbcaf02be9915419c89c51d6d0bdd1d49e9d1b8c7355|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|volume=269|pages=76–85|doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2015.08.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications of MSY model ===
Starting to harvest a previously unharvested population will always lead to a decrease in the population size.   That is, it is impossible for a harvested population to remain at its original carrying capacity.  Instead, the population will either stabilize at a new lower equilibrium size or, if the harvesting rate is too high, decline to zero.

The reason why populations can be sustainably harvested is that they exhibit a density-dependent response.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt; This means that at any population size below K, the population is producing a surplus yield that is available for harvesting without reducing population size. Density dependence is the regulator process that allows the population to return to equilibrium after a perturbation.  The logistic equation assumes that density dependence takes the form of negative feedback.&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;

If a constant number of individuals is harvested from a population at a level greater than the MSY, the population will decline to extinction.  Harvesting below the MSY level leads to a stable equilibrium population if the starting population is above the unstable equilibrium population size.

=== Uses of MSY ===
MSY has been especially influential in the management of renewable biological resources such as commercially important fish and wildlife.  In fisheries terms, '''maximum sustainable yield''' (MSY) is the largest average catch that can be captured from a stock under existing environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (NRC). 1998. Improving Fish Stock Assessments. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; MSY aims at a balance between too much and too little harvest to keep the population at some intermediate abundance with a maximum replacement rate.

Relating to MSY, the [[maximum economic yield]] (MEY) is the level of catch that provides the maximum net economic benefits or profits to society.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). 1996. OUr Living Oceans: Report on the Status of U.S. Living Marine Resources 1995. NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS0F/SPO-19. NMFS, Silver Springs, Md.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[optimum sustainable yield]], MEY is usually less than MSY.

=== Limitations of MSY approach ===
Although it is widely practiced by state and federal government agencies regulating wildlife, forests, and fishing, MSY has come under heavy criticism by ecologists and others from both theoretical and practical reasons.&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;  The concept of maximum sustainable yield is not always easy to apply in practice.  Estimation problems arise due to poor assumptions in some models and lack of reliability of the data.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;Townsend et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologists, for example, do not always have enough data to make a clear determination of the population's size and growth rate.  Calculating the point at which a population begins to slow from competition is also very difficult.  The concept of MSY also tends to treat all individuals in the population as identical, thereby ignoring all aspects of population structure such as size or age classes and their differential rates of growth, survival, and reproduction.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

As a management goal, the static interpretation of MSY (i.e., MSY as a fixed catch that can be taken year after year) is generally not appropriate because it ignores the fact that fish populations undergo natural fluctuations (i.e., MSY treats the environment as unvarying) in abundance and will usually ultimately become severely depleted under a constant-catch strategy.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;  Thus, most fisheries scientists now interpret MSY in a more dynamic sense as the [[maximum average yield]] (MAY) obtained by applying a specific harvesting strategy to a fluctuating resource.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt; Or as an optimal "escapement strategy", where escapement means the amount of fish that must remain in the ocean [rather than the amount of fish that can be harvested]. An escapement strategy is often the optimal strategy for maximizing expected yield of a harvested, stochastically fluctuating population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=William J|date=1979-12-01|title=Optimal escapement levels in stochastic and deterministic harvesting models|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0095069679900147|journal=Journal of Environmental Economics and Management|volume=6|issue=4|pages=350–363|doi=10.1016/0095-0696(79)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the limitations of MSY, does not mean it performs worse than humans using their best intuitive judgment. Experiments using students in natural resource management classes suggest that people using their past experience, intuition, and best judgement to manage a fishery generate far less long term yield compared to a computer using an MSY calculation, even when that calculation comes from incorrect population dynamic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|date=2016-07-01|title=Human judgment vs. quantitative models for the management of ecological resources|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-1295/abstract|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1553–1565|doi=10.1890/15-1295|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orange roughy ====
{{see also|Orange roughy}}
An example of errors in estimating the [[population dynamics]] of a species occurred within the New Zealand [[Orange roughy]] fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the [[orange roughy]] lived a long time and had [[k-selection|bred slowly]] (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Overfishing ==
{{see also|Overfishing}}
All around the world, from the arctic to the tropics, there is a crisis in the world's fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5800/787.short sciencemag.org Worm, Boris, ''et. a;.'' "Impacts of Biodiversity Loss on Ocean Ecosystem Services," ''Science'', 3 November 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Until fairly recently it was assumed that our marine resources were limitless.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In recent years however, an accelerating decline has been observed in the productivity of many important fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;Christy and Scott 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisheries which have been devastated in recent times include (but are not limited to) the great whale fisheries, the Grand Bank fisheries of the western Atlantic, and the Peruvian anchovy fishery.&lt;ref name="Clark 1973"&gt;Clark 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent assessments by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the state of the world's fisheries indicate a levelling off of landings in the 1990s, at about 100 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources, FAO Technical Paper 335 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the composition of global catches has changed.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  As fishers deplete larger, long-lived predatory fish species such as cod, tuna, shark, and snapper, they move down to the next level – to species that tend to be smaller, shorter-lived, and less valuable.&lt;ref name="Pauly1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pauly|first1=D.|title=Fishing Down Marine Food Webs|journal=Science|volume=279|issue=5352|year=1998|pages=860–863|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.279.5352.860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overfishing is a classic example of the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref name="Clark 1973"/&gt;

== Optimum sustainable yield ==
{{see also|Optimum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the [[Level of Effort|level of effort]] (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.
In [[environmental science]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield.

In mathematics, a '''Menger space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies a certain a basic [[selection principle]] that generalizes [[σ-compact space|σ-compactness]]. A Menger space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the space there are finite sets &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}_1 \subset \mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subset \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that the family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1 \cup  \mathcal{F}_2 \cup \cdots&lt;/math&gt; covers the space.

==History==

In 1924, [[Karl Menger]] 
&lt;ref name="Karl Menger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menger|first1=Karl|
title=Einige Überdeckungssätze der punktmengenlehre|
journal=Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie|date=1924|volume=133|
pages=421–444|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-7091-6110-4_14|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-6110-4_14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
introduced the following basis property for metric spaces: 
Every basis of the topology contains a countable family of sets with vanishing 
diameters that covers the space. Soon thereafter, 
Witold Hurewicz &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurewicz|first1=Witold|
title=Über eine verallgemeinerung des Borelschen Theorems|
journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|date=1926|volume=24.1|pages=401–421|
url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01216792|doi=10.1007/bf01216792}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
observed that Menger's basis property can be reformulated to the above form using sequences of open covers.

==Menger's conjecture==

Menger conjectured that in [[ZFC]] every Menger metric space is σ-compact. 
Fremlin and Miller 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fremlin|first1=David|last2=Miller|first2=Arnold|
title=On some properties of Hurewicz, Menger and Rothberger|
journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae|date=1988|volume=129|pages=17–33|
url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm129/fm12913.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
proved that Menger's conjecture is false, by showing that there is,
in ZFC, a set of real numbers that is Menger but not σ-compact. 
The Fremlin-Miller proof was dichotomic, and the set witnessing the failure
of the conjecture heavily depends on whether a certain (undecidable) axiom
holds or not.

Bartoszyński and [[Boaz_Tsaban|Tsaban]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartoszyński|first1=Tomek|last2=Tsaban|first2=Boaz|
title=Hereditary topological diagonalizations and the Menger–Hurewicz Conjectures|
journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date=2006|volume=134|pages=605–615|
url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/2006-134-02/S0002-9939-05-07997-9/|doi=10.1090/s0002-9939-05-07997-9|arxiv=math/0208224}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
gave a uniform ZFC example of a Menger subset of the real line that is not σ-compact.

==Combinatorial characterization==

For subsets of the real line, the Menger property can be characterized using continuous functions into the [[Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
For functions &lt;math&gt;f,g\in \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, write &lt;math&gt;f\leq^* g&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; f(n)\leq g(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all but finitely many natural numbers &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;. A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is dominating if for each function &lt;math&gt; f\in\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; there is a function &lt;math&gt;g\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f\leq^* g&lt;/math&gt;. Hurewicz proved that a subset of the real line is Menger iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is not dominating. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than the [[Cichoń's diagram|dominating number &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{d}&lt;/math&gt;]] is Menger.

The cardinality of Bartoszyński and Tsaban's counter-example to Menger's conjecture is
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{d}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

* Every compact, and even σ-compact, space is Menger.
* Every Menger space is a [[Lindelöf space]]
* Continuous image of a Menger space is Menger
* The Menger property is closed under taking &lt;math&gt;F_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; subsets
* Menger's property characterizes filters whose [[Mathias forcing]] notion does not add dominating functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chodounský|first=David|last2=Repovš|first2=Dušan|last3=Zdomskyy|first3=Lyubomyr|date=2015-12-01|title=MATHIAS FORCING AND COMBINATORIAL COVERING PROPERTIES OF FILTERS|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/div-classtitlemathias-forcing-and-combinatorial-covering-properties-of-filtersdiv/725F31CB4B307A544531F56682D06B6D|journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=80|issue=4|pages=1398–1410|doi=10.1017/jsl.2014.73|issn=0022-4812|arxiv=1401.2283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing [[family support]] to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in [[Psychotherapy|talking]] about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss.

==Psychological impact==
{{See also|Miscarriage and mental illness}}
Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a " ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies..."&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt; Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="loyd"/&gt; The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brier|first=Norman|date=2008-03-17|title=Grief Following Miscarriage: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=17|issue=3|pages=451–464|doi=10.1089/jwh.2007.0505|pmid=18345996|issn=1540-9996|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disbelief, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anger]], and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=Cara Bicking|last2=Baptiste-Roberts|first2=Kesha|last3=Zhu|first3=Junjia|last4=Kjerulff|first4=Kristen H.|date=2015-02-01|title=Effect of Previous Miscarriage on Depressive Symptoms During Subsequent Pregnancy and Postpartum in the First Baby Study|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=391–400|doi=10.1007/s10995-014-1521-0|pmid=24894728|issn=1092-7875|pmc=4256135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = beutel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beutel|first=M.|last2=Deckardt|first2=R.|last3=von Rad|first3=M.|last4=Weiner|first4=H.|date=November 1995|title=Grief and depression after miscarriage: their separation, antecedents, and course|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=57|issue=6|pages=517–526|issn=0033-3174|pmid=8600477}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief.&lt;ref name="kirs" /&gt;

Grieving can create feelings of [[loneliness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
This grieving has been called a type of  [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="loyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd Jones|first1=Sarah|year=2015|title=The Psychological Miscarriage: An Exploration of Women's Experience of Miscarriage in the Light of Winnicott's 'Primary Maternal Preoccupation', The Process of Grief According to Bowlby and Parkes, and Klein's Theory of Mourning|journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=31|issue=4|pages=433–447|doi=10.1111/bjp.12172|issn=0265-9883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Other serious consequences can develop including depression, [[anxiety disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]]. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others.

Unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women.&lt;ref name="Robinson2011dil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gail Erlick|title=Dilemmas Related to Pregnancy Loss|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=199|issue=8|year=2011|pages=571–574|issn=0022-3018|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318225f31e|pmid=21814082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidt|first=CE|date=2007|title=Trauerverarbeitung nach Prä- und Perinatalverlust ( Mourning processing after pre-and perinatal loss)|journal=Psychother Psych Med|volume=57|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1055/s-2006-951906|pmid=17357028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even depression can occur.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;

===Trauma===
Miscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt; Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated.{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}}&lt;ref name=buon/&gt; The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
The trauma of miscarriage can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
&lt;!--==Risks==--&gt; 
Bipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bilpolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;

==== Mental health ====
Women experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;  Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}}  Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develop a close bond "with her baby" experiences the loss of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Complicated grief===
Different grieving "styles" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an "obsessive" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to "reminisce about the loss of a loved one".{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}} [[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress and posttraumatic stress disorder===
Miscarriage is associated with post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=daug&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daugirdaitė|first=Viltė|last2=Akker|first2=Olga van den|last3=Purewal|first3=Satvinder|date=2015|title=Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Termination of Pregnancy and Reproductive Loss: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2015/646345/|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|language=en|volume=2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933|issn=2090-2727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Stephen V.|last2=James|first2=Larry C.|last3=Solursh|first3=Diane S.|last4=Yancey|first4=Michael K.|last5=Epperly|first5=Ted D.|last6=Folen|first6=Raymond A.|last7=Masone|first7=Maryann|date=2000-03-15|title=Acute and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder After Spontaneous Abortion|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1689.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=61|issue=6|issn=0002-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of  social support.&lt;ref name= daug/&gt; Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues.&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk.{{sfn|Christiansen|page = 92}}

==Recovery==
Physical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances f[[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] is present. [[Insomnia]] can be a problem.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aafp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it. Others may blame the father or partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=B.|date=2007-01-01|title=Culpability and blame after pregnancy loss|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/33/1/24|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–27|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.015560|issn=0306-6800|pmid=17209106|pmc=2598085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping with a miscarriage can very greatly between women and families.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Some find it difficult to talk about the miscarriage.&lt;ref name = aafp&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-11-01|title=Pregnancy Loss: What You Should Know|journal=American Family Physician|volume = 76|issue=9|pages=1347–8|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1347.html|language=en|pmid=18019879|author1=American Academy of Family Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects.&lt;ref name = loyd/&gt; Some women engage in activities that are believed to aid in recovery such as therapy, [[religion]] and art.{{sfn|Seftel|page = 57}}
&lt;!--Interventions==--&gt;Counseling can be offered but effective interventions to assist in recovery have been difficult to identify due to the reports of efficacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neugebauer|first=Richard|last2=Kline|first2=Jennie|last3=Bleiberg|first3=Kathryn|last4=Baxi|first4=Laxmi|last5=Markowitz|first5=John C.|last6=Rosing|first6=Mark|last7=Levin|first7=Bruce|last8=Keith|first8=Jessica|date=2007|title=Preliminary open trial of interpersonal counseling for subsyndromal depression following miscarriage|journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume=24|issue=3|pages=219–222|doi=10.1002/da.20150|issn=1091-4269|pmid=16988939}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ineffective counseling. Comparisons are hard to make.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Despite the lack of studies that describe effective interventions for those with grief after a miscarriage, some clinicians still offer counselling and follow-up to help women recover and adapt to the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Rachel|date=Jun 20–26, 2012|title=Emotional care for women who experience miscarriage|journal=Nursing Standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain): 1987)|volume=26|issue=42|pages=35–41|doi=10.7748/ns2012.06.26.42.35.c9160|issn=0029-6570|pmid=22908762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendations to help recover from the event include:
* Turning to loved ones and friends for support. Sharing feelings and asking for help when needed.
* Talking to the partner about the miscarriage. 
* Keeping in mind that men and women cope with loss in different ways.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Making good choices for health and well-being such as: eating healthy foods, keeping active, and getting enough sleep to help restore energy.
* Joining a support group. A support group might help with feelings of being alone in the loss.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Doing something in remembrance of the baby.
* Seeking help from a grief counselor, especially if the grief doesn't ease with time.&lt;ref name = whealth/&gt;

Generally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}} Other methods used to promote recovery are be relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and "thought-stopping". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can "emotionally relocate the child", redefine a relationship "with the missing child", and engage in "continuing the bond" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 60}}

Women who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014provision/&gt; One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother "...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response..."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Dorte M.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735816300903|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|language=en|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can "expect parents to move on with their lives."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Since the experiences of women can vary so widely, sensitive nursing care afterward is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radford|first=Eleanor J|last2=Hughes|first2=Mark|date=2015-06-01|title=Women's experiences of early miscarriage: implications for nursing care|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume=24|issue=11–12|pages=1457–1465|doi=10.1111/jocn.12781|pmid=25662397|issn=1365-2702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children and concerns about future pregnancies==
One emotional response to miscarriage is the strong apprehension that can develop anticipating a subsequent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = sing&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Singapore Nursing Journal | title = The impact miscarriage on women's psychological well being and interventions: A literature review | first = Marianne | last = Wen-Yi | first2 = Lam | last2 = Ka Shun | first3 = Priscilla Jia | last3 = Ling Ho et.al }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Procreation abilities may also be questioned by the woman.&lt;ref name = sing/&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Significant distress can develop in the other children in the family when they think a sibling has died. They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings. Children can also need help, understanding and the ability to make sense of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Becoming Parents and Overcoming Obstacles : Understanding the Experience of Miscarriage, Premature Births, Infertility, and Postnatal Depression|last=Quagliata|first=Emanuela|publisher=Karnac Books|year=2013|isbn=9781782200185|location=City|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials and burial==
[[Ritual]]s that recognize the loss can be important in coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's reproductive mental health across the lifespan|others=Lynn-Barnes, Diana|isbn=9783319051154|location=Cham|oclc=880941778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event.

&lt;!--==Narratives==
Women discuss their miscarriage and interact with others who have had the same experience. This is one way that their loss is recognized, publically mourned and socially accepted.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 57}}--&gt;

==In culture==
Grieving after the loss of a child through miscarriage in other cultures can vary from western culture.&lt;ref name="Klass2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klass|first1=Dennis|title=Book Reviews of Narratives of Sorrow and Dignity: Japanese Women, Pregnancy Loss, and Modern Rituals of Grieving|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=70|issue=4|year=2015|pages=454–457|issn=0030-2228|doi=10.1177/0030222815573931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hospicefoundation.org/Grief-(1)/What-to-Expect | title=Hospice Foundation of America - What is Grief?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual’s [[culture]] plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is appropriate to take into account cultural norms before reaching a complicated grief diagnosis.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shear|first1=MK|last2=Simon|first2=N|last3=Wall|first3=M|last4=Zisook|first4=S|last5=Neimeyer|first5=R|last6=Duan|first6=N|last7=Reynolds|first7=C|last8=Lebowitz|first8=B|last9=Sung|first9=S|last10=Ghesquiere|first10=A|last11=Gorscak|first11=B|last12=Clayton|first12=P|last13=Ito|first13=M|last14=Nakajima|first14=S|last15=Konishi|first15=T|last16=Melhem|first16=N|last17=Meert|first17=K|last18=Schiff|first18=M|last19=O'Connor|first19=MF|last20=First|first20=M|last21=Sareen|first21=J|last22=Bolton|first22=J|last23=Skritskaya|first23=N|last24=Mancini|first24=AD|last25=Keshaviah|first25=A|title=Complicated grief and related bereavement issues for DSM-5.|journal=Depression and Anxiety|date=February 2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=103–17|doi=10.1002/da.20780|pmid=21284063|pmc=3075805}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultural differences in emotional levels, how these are expressed and how long they are expressed.

'''Mãe Menininha do Gantois''' (10 February 1894 – 13 August 1986) also known as '''Mother Menininha do Gantois''', was a Brazilian spiritual leader ''(iyalorixá)'' and spiritual daughter of [[Orisha|orixá]] [[Oshun|Oxum]], who officiated for 64 years as the head of one of the most noted [[Candomblé]] temples, the [[Ilê Axé Iyá Omin Iyamassê]], or Terreiro do Gantois, of Brazil, located in Alto do Gantois in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Bahia]].{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|pp=755–56}}{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=95}} She was instrumental in gaining legal recognition of Candomblé and its rituals, bringing an end to centuries of prejudice against Afro-Brazilians, who practiced their faith.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}} When she died on 13 August 1986, the State of Bahia declared a three-day state mourning in her honour,{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}} and the City Council of Salvador held a special session to pay tributes to her.&lt;ref name=Honour&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/bahia/noticia/2011/08/morte-de-mae-menininha-do-gantois-completa-25-anos-neste-sabado.html|title= Morte de Mãe Menininha do Gantois completa 25 anos neste sábado|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher= Globo 1|location=Salvador, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Terreiro do Gantois temple has been declared a protected national monument.{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}}

==Biography==
Maria Escolástica da Conceição Nazaré Assunção was born on 10 February 1894 in Salvador, Bahia.&lt;ref name=Mariano /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniafro.xpg.com.br/biografia_mae_menininha.htm|title=The Mother little girl Gantois|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher= Uniafro de Cultura Negra em Santa Catarina|location=São José, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grand mother, who had baptized her, gave her the nickname as Menininha meaning "Little girl"&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; She was born into a matriarchal society to Maria da Glória{{#tag:ref|Maria da Glória's name is given as both Maria da Glória,&lt;ref name=Honour /&gt; Maria da Glória Nazaré, or Maria da Glória Nazareth{{sfn|Bay|Mann|2013|p=206}} in multiple sources. This convention is confusing in the context of the Afro-Brazilian matrilineal naming customs. Her grandmother Maria Júlia had two daughters, {{Interlanguage link multi|Pulchéria Maria da Conceição Nazaré|pt|3=Pulchéria Maria da Conceição}} and Damiana da Conceição Nazaré.&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; Pulcheria had no children and Maria da Glória was her niece, thus the daughter of Damiana.&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; Traditionally her name would be shown as mother's surname, followed by father's surname, or simply as her mother's surname dropping the father's.|group="notes"}} and Joaquim Assunção,&lt;ref name=Honour /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; who were Afro-Brazilian with [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Nigerian royal ancestry{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=755}} from [[Egba Alake|Egba-Alakê]] in [[Abeokuta|Abeokutá]], a kingdom in the southwestern part of [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=DVpZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=|page=84|title=Ọ̀ṣun Across the Waters: A Yoruba Goddess in Africa and the Americas|author1=Joseph M.

Her great grandparents, Maria Júlia da Conceição do Nazaré and Francisco Nazaré Eta, were the first blacks to be freed from slavery.&lt;ref name=Honour/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; Maria Júlia's daughter Damiana was the mother of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maria da Glória Nazaré|pt|3=Maria da Glória Nazareth}}.&lt;ref name="Mariano"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mariano|first1=Agnes|title=A mãe da sabedoria|url=http://www.ceert.org.br/noticias/liberdade-de-crenca/7930/a-mae-da-sabedoria|publisher=Centro de Estudos das Relações de Trabalho e Desigualdades|accessdate=3 December 2015|location=São Paulo, Brazil|language=Portuguese|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menininha was initiated into the worship of deities at the Terreiro do Gantois when she was 8 years old by her grandmother Maria Julia da Conceição Nazaré who had built the temple "Ile Iyá Omi Axé Iyamassê". She was married to Alvaro MacDowell de Oliveira and they had two daughters. The elder daughter was Mãe [[Cleusa da Conceição Nazaré de Oliveira]], born in 1923, who was a doctor and who became the inherited Candomblé priestess of the temple after her mother's death. She died in 1998 and was succeeded by Menininha's other daughter, Mãe Carmem.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt;&lt;ref name="Order of Merit of Bahia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Governo faz homenagem póstuma a Mãe Cleusa por trabalho social|url=http://www.alba.ba.gov.br/noticias/Impressao.php?id=6529|publisher=Assembléia Legislativa do Estado da Bahia|accessdate=5 December 2015|location=Salvador da Bahia, Brazil|language=Portuguese|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schemo|first1=Diana Jean|title=Cleusa Millet Is Dead at 67; Nurtured Afro-Brazilian Faith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/world/cleusa-millet-is-dead-at-67-nurtured-afro-brazilian-faith.html|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 October 1998|location=New York City, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; As spiritual heads of their temple, all of the Candomblé priestesses receive the honorific 'mãe', which in the [[Portuguese language]] means "mother".{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=755}}

==Career==
The temple, which she headed was established by her grandmother Mãe Pulquéria following a dispute over leadership from Engenho Velho, an older temple said to be one of the oldest Candomblé temple (1830 or even 100 years older) in Bahia which had been built by three freed African women. Two temples were built, one was the Terreiro do Gantois built in 1900 by Mãe Pulquéria and the other was Ile Axe Opo Afonja credited to Mãe Aninha.{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=755}} Mãe Pulquéria, who was the functional head of the Terreiro do Gantois, died suddenly in 1918.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; As she had no children, her niece Maria da Glória Nazaré was designated as her successor, but Maria died in 1920 before assuming office.&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; Then according to hierarchical rights the temple was given to Mother Menininha. This process was confirmed by deities [[Oshosi|Oxóssi]], [[Shango]], Oshun and [[Babalú-Ayé]]. Once chosen and confirmed in 1922 Menininha became the head of the Candomblé do Gantois.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; She dedicated her life to the temple and for the cause of the African religion of Candomblé which represented to her the "last stronghold of the black dignity". She faced persecution at the hands of the Brazilian government and even incarceration, as well as being subjected to harassment. She defended the African-Brazilian traditions of worship at the Terreiro do Gantois and other Terreiros at [[Engenho Velho]] and [[Casa Branca, São Paulo|Casa Branca]].&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; Her struggle, in association with other well known candomblé priesteses like Stella de Oxossi, asserted the Africanness of Candombé, stressing the fact that their religion was not the same as [[Roman Catholicism]].{{Sfn|Appiah|Gates|2005|p=756}}

One of the reasons she became prominent was that she initiated hundreds of "daughters" into the faith,{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=578}} as well as artists,{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=10}} and invited the academic community to study the roots of the religion.{{sfn|Parés|Sansi|2011|p=45}} One of those academics, [[Ruth Landes]] compiled her findings and published a book,&lt;ref name=Andreson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreson|first1=Jamie Lee|title=Ruth Landes e Edison Carneiro: matriarcado e etnografia nos candomblés da Bahia (1938–9)|journal=Revista de História da UEG|volume=2|issue=1|date=January–July 2013|publisher=Universidade Federal da Bahia|url=http://www.revista.ueg.br/index.php/revistahistoria/article/download/1585/969|pages=236–261|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''City of Women'' (1947) discussing how the racial policies of the government were intertwined with the Candomblé religious rites.&lt;ref name=Glenn &gt;{{cite web|last1=Glenn|first1=James R.|title=Register to the Papers of Ruth Landes|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/fa/landes.pdf|website=National Anthropological Archives|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antônio Carlos Magalhães]], a powerful senator from Bahia; [[Carybé]], the illustrator; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Edson Carneiro|pt}} and [[Pierre Verger]], two other anthropologists who studied Afro-Brazilian communities, were also prominent connections used by Menininha to further study and promote the validity of Candomblé.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}} These studies were influential in furthering research on the Nigerian roots of the religion,{{sfn|Parés|Sansi|2011|p=45}} but at the same time brought criticism from other temples in the faith that Menininha was exploiting the religion.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=10}} However, her success in obtaining legalization of the religion in the 1970s facilitated the first freedom to practice their faith in hundreds of years and began the process of eliminating prejudice against other Afro-Brazilian faiths.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=579}}

==Legacy==
Menininha died at the age of 92 on 13 August 1986. At the special session held in the City Council of Salvador to commemorate her death, Edvaldo Britto, Deputy Mayor; Pedro Godinho, President of the House; her friends; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Mabel Veloso|pt}} attended. Veloso paid a tribute to the mother by highlighting her role as the priestess in leading the resistance and fighting against discrimination and religious faith.&lt;ref name="Honour" /&gt; Her successor to the temple was her daughter Cleusa who was chosen as priestess in 1989. Upon Cleusa's death, the deities chose her younger sister, {{Interlanguage link multi|Mãe Carmem de Òsàlá|pt|3=Mãe Carmem}} to succeed her.&lt;ref name="Mariano" /&gt; Menininha became a symbol of motherhood and spiritual daughter of the Orixa Oxum. Her ritual chair, which appears like a throne, is placed at the entry to the city museum in Salvador.{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=755}}

== Poems ==
Many songs have been written paryear songs seeking her blessings and spiritual guidance. [[Beth Carvalho]], a famous singer paid tribute to her in his composition titled '''O Encanto do Gantois'', in 1985. One of these poems reads:&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt;{{Sfn|Henry|2010|p=755}}
 
'''Prayer to Mother Menininha'''&lt;br&gt;Oh my mother&lt;br&gt;My Mother Menininha&lt;br&gt;Oh my mother&lt;br&gt;The little girl Gantois&lt;br&gt;The most beautiful star, &lt;br&gt; huh?

It's in the Gantois &lt;br&gt;Olorun who sent &lt;br&gt;This daughter of Oshun &lt;br&gt;Take care of us &lt;br&gt; And all that is &lt;br&gt;Olorun who sent ô ô &lt;br&gt;Now yeh yeh ô ...&lt;br&gt;Now yeh yeh ô

A Non Contact Force is a [[force]] which acts on an object without coming physically in contact with it.&lt;ref name="gravity"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Basics of Physics
|year=2006
|author= Rusty L. Myers
|isbn=0313328579
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnynjL44pI4C&amp;pg=PA40
|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most familiar example of a non-contact force is [[gravity]], which confers [[weight]].&lt;ref name="gravity"/&gt; In contrast a [[contact force]] is a force applied to a body by another body that ''is'' in contact with it.&lt;ref name="gravity"/&gt;

==Examples==
All four known [[fundamental interaction]]s are non-contact forces:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Preparation for Introductory College Physics: A Guided Student Primer
|year=1997
|author= Jon A. Celesia
|isbn=
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=asZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22non+contact+force%22+strong+weak
|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Gravity]], the force of attraction that exists among all bodies that have [[mass]]. The force exerted on each body by the other through weight is proportional to the mass of the first body times the mass of the second body divided by the square of the distance between them.
* [[Electromagnetism]] is the force that causes the interaction between electrically charged particles; the areas in which this happens are called electromagnetic fields. Examples of this force include: [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[X-rays]] and [[gamma ray]]s. Electromagnetism mediates all chemical, biological, electrical and electronic processes.
* [[Strong nuclear force]]: Unlike gravity and electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force is a short distance force that takes place between fundamental particles within a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. It is [[electric charge|charge]] independent and acts equally between a [[proton]] and a proton, a [[neutron]] and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. The strong nuclear force is the strongest force in nature; however, its range is small (acting only over distances of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m). The strong nuclear force mediates both [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions.
* [[Weak nuclear force]]: The weak nuclear force mediates the [[beta decay|β decay]] of a neutron, in which the neutron [[radioactive decay|decays]] into a proton and in the process emits a [[beta particle|β particle]] and an uncharged particle called a [[neutrino]]. As a result of mediating the β decay process, the weak nuclear force plays a key role in [[supernovae|supernovas]]. Both the strong and weak forces form an important part of [[quantum mechanics]].

{{Campaignbox War of 1812: Naval}}

The '''Nuku Hiva Campaign''' was an armed conflict between the United States and the [[French Polynesia|Polynesian]] inhabitants of [[Nuku Hiva]] during the [[War of 1812]]. It occurred in 1813, following [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s decision to sail his fleet to the island for repairs before continuing his [[commerce raiding|raid]] against British shipping. Upon arrival, the Americans became involved in a tribal war and allied themselves with the [[Te I'i]] people against the [[Happah]] and [[Tai Pi (province)|Tai Pi]] clans.&lt;ref name="HistoryNet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/war-of-1812-commodore-david-porter-and-the-essex-in-the-south-pacific.htm|title=War of 1812: Commodore David Porter and the Essex in the South Pacific|work=Military History ''Magazine''|publisher=History Net/Weider History Network|date=June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Operations in the Pacific began in early 1813 when Captain Porter entered the Pacific, via [[Cape Horn]], in the thirty-two gun [[frigate]] {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}. Originally Porter was assigned to rendezvous with two other warships but both encountered enemy resistance before their meeting and Porter went around the Horn alone. The mission was to harass the British whaling industry off South America and around the [[Galápagos Islands]]. For months the Americans cruised the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] and they [[Action off James Island|captured]] several British whalers that they placed under navy command. By October 1813, ''Essex'' was in serious need of repairs so Porter decided to head for Nuku Hiva, an island in the [[Marquesas]], fearing that a British squadron would find him if he chose to take refuge in a South American port. The American fleet that went to the Marquesas included USS ''Essex'' and the liberated American whaler ''Barclay'', and nine captured British whalers: {{ship||Seringapatam|1799 ship|2}} (22 guns), ''Greenwich'' (10 guns), {{ship||Montezuma|1804 ship|2}} (18 guns), ''[[Essex Junior]]'' (16 guns), {{ship||Hector|1809 ship|2}} (11 guns), ''Charlton'' (10 guns), {{ship||Sir Andrew Hammond|1800 ship|2}}, and ''Catherine'' and {{ship||New Zealander|1808 ship|2}}, both of eight guns. In total, Captain Porter had just over 200 [[United States Navy]] officers and sailors, accompanied by a small detachment of no more than twenty [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] under the command of [[Lieutenant]] [[John M. Gamble]]. One of the sailors was the young [[midshipman]] [[David Farragut]], later the first United States Navy [[admiral]]. (Porter's son [[David Dixon Porter]] was the second U.S. Navy admiral.) Additionally, many of the prisoners from the prize enemy ships were Americans and they volunteered for service; some of the British captives too volunteered.&lt;ref name="HistoryNet" /&gt;

==Campaign==
===Founding of Madisonville===
Porter arrived off Nuku Hiva, on October 25, 1813 and he renamed it Madison's Island after United States President [[James Madison]]. Then Porter began making preparations to establish the first American naval base in the Pacific, as well as a small [[colony]], named [[Madisonville, Nuku Hiva|Madisonville]], to house the sailors. The small [[Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva|Fort Madison]], of four guns, was also constructed on a hill next to [[Massachusetts Bay, Nuku Hiva|Massachusetts Bay]] where an official flag raising ceremony took place on November 19, a seventeen gun salute was fired and some sort of message was buried in the ground for future Europeans to find, should they attempt to colonize the island after Porter and his men left. The declaration stated that the Te I'is were subjects of the United States and that the latter had officially laid claim to the island which Porter hoped would become an important naval base. In this time the sailors also scraped the [[copper sheathing|copper bottom]] hull of ''Essex'' and used smoke to drive out over 1,000 rats hiding in her works. The Americans described the native warriors as being tall and copper colored, with tattoos over their entire bodies. They wore loin cloths and some had capes made of tree bark; the warriors also carried large clubs or spears. The women were clothed in similar fashion to the men, and friendly to the sailors. A half-naked Englishman named Wilson was found to be living on the island, and had been for many years. He served as interpreter between the Americans and the native [[tribal chief|chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 31-34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downes Expedition===
[[File:Nuku Hiva warrior 1813.jpg|150px|left|thumb|''A warrior of Nuku Hiva'' by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]], 1813]]
Nuku Hiva, at the time, was inhabited by many tribes of indigenous peoples, separated in villages by mountain peaks thousands of feet high. The area of land around Massachusetts Bay, which became the town of Madisonville, was controlled by Chief Gattanewa of the Te I'i and in return for rights to build the base, Gattanewa demanded that the Americans become his allies and help fight the war against the Happah. While the majority of the Americans were still building their settlement, [[Lieutenant]] [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], Marine Lieutenant John Gamble and a platoon of forty Marines, were ordered to proceed to an in-land [[redoubt]], located high in the mountains. The main effort of this expedition dragged along a wheeled 6 pound cannon for added effect. The amazement of the aboriginals at gunpowder weapons had already been noted upon their landing on the island. Several hundred Te I'i warriors accompanied the expedition which left the coast in the first week of November. After a journey through the jungle Downes and his men found the fort occupied by 3,000 to 4,000 hostiles. The Te I'i and their American allies attacked; during the fighting a rock hit Downes in the stomach, hurting him. A sailor was wounded by a spear to the neck, but he apparently survived. Lt. Gamble was singled out by a heavily built Happah warrior, who charged at him with a wooden club. Drawing his Mameluke sword Gamble blocked the club from knocking him unconscious as another Marine, seeing Gamble struggling, leveled his musket at the Happah's head. The shot, fired from only a foot away, nearly decapitated the warrior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The assault on the fort was successful and Downes reported that his men had killed five enemies and that the Te I'i massacred the wounded with clubs. Lieutenant Downes also said that he was very surprised that his allies did not eat the dead; instead they used their bones to make necklaces and fan handles. Over the next few days the chiefs of the Happah arrived at the coast to settle a peace agreement. One of the stipulations required the Happah to fight alongside the Te I'i and Americans in another operation against the Tai Pi.&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porter expedition===
Not long after subduing the Happah, the Tai Pi declared war on the Te I'i, the Happah, and the Americans. Thus followed one of the most significant amphibious landings in the history of American operations in the Pacific during the 1800s. It was unopposed but Captain Porter's fleet, combined with around 5,000 friendly warriors, in at least 200 [[canoe|war-canoe]]s, attacked the Tai Pi-held coastline. After that, thirty-six officers and men with a cannon, personally commanded by Porter, led the expedition to a fortress with seven-foot-high walls. A battle began when the Tai Pis ambushed the column in the jungle near the fort. Porter wrote "''We entered the bushes, and at every instant assailed by spears and stones, which came from different parties in the ambuscade. We could hear the snapping of the slings, the whistling of the stones, and the spears came quivering by us, but we could not percieve [sic] from whom they came.''" Skirmishing broke out and the expedition continued forward, encountering heavier resistance the farther they went. The column eventually made it to the fort where a pitched battle began that would last for hours. The Te I'is and Happahs provided the brunt of the attack while the Americans picked off enemy warriors with their muskets; the cannon was aimed at the fortifications. Upon arrival, a Marine sergeant notified Lt. Gamble and Capt. Porter of the hopelessness of their situation. The Marines in his squad were down to three or four cartridges of ammunition. Lt. Gamble and four men were given permission to run back to the beach for a resupply but upon their arrival the situation with their natives allies had deteriorated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Thousands of Tai Pis occupied the heavily defended position and they managed to repel the native attacks. Near the end of the engagement, the Te I'is and Happahs fled, leaving the thirty-six Americans to fend for themselves. Capt. Porter notified Lt. Gamble to order his Marines to cover the retreat back to the beach. Gamble positioned his men at the edge of a bush for one last decisive volley to ensure a strong enemy force did not pursue them. The American force lost one man killed and two wounded. One of the casualties was Lieutenant Downes, who suffered a badly broken leg. "''We returned to the beach much fatigued and harassed with marching and fighting,''" said Porter, who then sailed back to Madisonville.&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Typee Valley===
[[File:Atlas pittoresque pl 054.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''An 1846 lithograph of Nuka Hiva.'']]
Once word spread that Porter and his allies had been defeated, the Te I'i and the Happah warriors began to turn on the Americans which led them to fear that Madisonville would be overrun and the inhabitants massacred. Porter wrote; "''I had now no alternative, but to prove our superiority by a successful attack upon the Typees.''" Porter organized and led most of his men on a second mission into enemy territory, this time overland to [[Typee Valley]] and with limited assistance from the Te I'i. The valley is a dense nine miles across by three miles and was the heartland of the Tai Pi where their villages were located and where they harvested [[coconut]] and [[breadfruit]]. By making a detour to avoid the heavily defended fort near the coast, Porter could make a surprise attack and use terrain and his superior weapons to their advantage. During one night the column marched to the top of a ridge overlooking the valley but because the Americans were exhausted from a long march, Porter decided to wait until the next morning to attack. The following day was rainy and windy according to reports, moisture had temporarily ruined the gunpowder, so the expedition spent another day resting and waiting for the powder to dry. Finally on November 30, the expedition launched their attack and soon after the Americans and Te I'is found themselves in another ambush which they fought off. After that Captain Porter sent the Tai Pi leaders a message advising them to cease hostilities at once or else their villages would be burned. The captain waited for some time and when it became apparent that the message had been ignored, the advance was continued. American forces and the Te I'is eventually won the day when night came and the enemy disengaged. There were no American casualties&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter claimed he took no pleasure in conquering a "''happy and heroic people''" and he described the aftermath of the battle as "''a scene of desolation and horror''". The captain also wrote that he left behind a "''line of smoking ruins''" when he started the return march to Madisonville. Tai Pi emissaries were not far behind and they brought the Americans "''countless''" [[hog (swine)|hog]]s as a peace offering. A British magazine later said that Porter was guilty of &lt;blockquote&gt; "''wantonly murdering unoffending savages''" to which the captain replied; "''Many may censure my conduct as wanton and unjust.... But let such reflect on our peculiar situation--a handful of men residing among numerous war-like tribes, liable every moment to be attacked by them and all cut off; our only hopes on safety was in convincing them of our great superiority over them and from what we have already seen, we must either attack them or be attacked.... Wars are not always just, and are rarely free from excesses--my conscience acquits me of any injustice, and no excesses were committed but what the Typees had in their power to stop by ceasing hostilities.''"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Boot, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Seringapatam'' Mutiny===
By 9 December 1813, USS ''Essex'' was repaired and ready for sailing. The sailors were not happy about leaving their Marquesan girlfriends and Porter had to suppress one [[mutiny]] by declaring that he "''would at once put a match to the magazine, and blow them all to eternity.''" A former Royal Navy sailor by the name of Robert White, was brought before Porter, having been accused of mutinous talk about ''Essex Junior''. White denied the accusations, now confirmed by other sailors, infuriating Porter. Porter thus drew his sword, face turning red, and yelled: "Run you scoundrel! Run for your life!" White ran off, jumped overboard, and swam to a nearby canoe.&lt;ref&gt;''Gamble of the Marines'', Raymond J Toner USN&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 250 crew members remained loyal and ''Essex'' made sail on 9 December 1813 to continue raiding. Most of the fleet left, though ''Sir Andrew Hammond'', ''Seringapatam'', and ''Greenwich'' remained at Nuku Hiva with Lieutenant John Gamble, two midshipmen, nineteen sailors and six prisoners, with the prisoners and some of the sailors being British nationals.

The situation was quiet until on 7 May 1814, the British sailors among the [[garrison]] mutinied. First they released the six prisoners and then attacked Fort Madison before taking over ''Seringapatam'' and getting away. Gamble was wounded in the foot and he was left adrift in a small boat with four others but they eventually made it to ''Sir Andrew Hammond''. Meanwhile the British interpreter Wilson was arousing trouble with the Te I'i by telling them that Porter would not come back. A few days later on 9 May, six of the American sailors were attacked on the beach by the Te I'i; a sixteen-year-old midshipman was killed along with four sailors while two others escaped, one of whom was wounded. Meanwhile, Gamble was alone on his ship, recovering from his wounded foot, when two war-canoes approached for an attack. The cannon of the ship were pre-loaded so single handedly Gamble limped from gun to gun, firing them as fast as possible, until the enemy fell back. On the next morning he gave the order to evacuate Madisonville, there being only eight men left on shore and all were either wounded or ill. Thus ended the existence of America's first naval base and colony in the Pacific Ocean. Captain Porter never returned to the island due to his capture by the British at the [[Battle of Valparaíso]] on March 28, 1814.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Post-script==
The mutineers sailed ''Seringapatam'' to [[New South Wales]]. From there she was sailed back to Great Britain where she was returned to her owners on payment of salvage.

''Cherub'' and {{HMS|Phoebe|1795|2}} had caught up with ''Essex'' and ''Essex Junior'' at Valparaiso. Eventually ''Phoebe'' was able to bring ''Essex'' to battle. The British were able to capture Porter and both American vessels.

Before he left Nuku Hiva, Gamble set fire to ''Greenwich''.&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), Vol. 6, pp.288-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He and seven men (four unfit for duty) then sailed ''Sir Andrew Hammond'' {{convert|2500|mi}} before they had the misfortune to meet up with {{HMS|Cherub|1806|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney (1976), Vol. 6, p.517.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|A first-class share of the salvage money was worth [[£sd|£]]72 13[[shilling|s]] 5[[pence|d]]; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth 16s 6d. ''Cherub'' shared the money with ''Phoebe'' by prior agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17313|page=2534|date=13 December 1817}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Eventually, in 1815, Gamble was able to return to the United States.

The '''Office of the Australian Information Commissioner''' (OAIC), known until 2010 as the '''Office of the Australian Privacy Commissioner''' is an independent [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] agency, acting as the [[national data protection authority]] for Australia, established under the ''Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010'',&lt;ref name="comlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2010A00052}}&lt;/ref&gt;  headed by the [[Australian Information Commissioner]].

The office has three primary functions:&lt;ref name="comlaw1"/&gt; 
* privacy functions, conferred by the ''Privacy Act 1988''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Privacy Act 1988|url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other laws 
* freedom of information functions, in particular, oversight of the operation of the ''[[Freedom of Information Act 1982]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Freedom of Information Act 1982|url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (FOI Act) and review of decisions made by agencies and ministers under that Act
* government information policy functions, conferred on the Australian Information Commissioner under the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010.&lt;ref name="comlaw1"/&gt;

The office is an agency within the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]]'s portfolio. The office liaises with the Business and Information Law Branch, part of the Civil Law Division within the Civil Justice and Legal Services Group of the Attorney-General's Department. However, the office is an independent agency and reports directly to the Parliament of Australia, not to the Attorney-General.

== History ==
The first [[Australian Privacy Commissioner]] was appointed in 1989 to the former Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which was the national privacy regulatory body until 2010. Major changes to federal freedom of information (FOI) law made in 2010 established the present office as the body responsible for FOI, privacy, and information policy. The ''Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010''&lt;ref name="comlaw2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2010A00051}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed in May 2010, and came into effect from November 2010. This Act introduced fundamental changes to the way information held by government is managed and accessed by members of the public (see Freedom of Information).

The Office of the Privacy Commissioner was integrated into the office at this time.

== Structure ==
The office is headed by the Australian Information Commissioner. Despite their titles, all commissioners can exercise the privacy and freedom of information (FOI) functions. However, only the Information Commissioner may exercise the information policy functions.

== Responsibilities ==
The office’s responsibilities include:
* conducting investigations
* reviewing decisions made under the FOI Act
* handling complaints
* monitoring agency administration
* education and awareness programs
* providing advice to the public, government agencies and businesses.

== Freedom of Information ==
The office has freedom of information functions, including the oversight of the operation of the FOI Act and review of decisions made by agencies and ministers under that Act. If a person is dissatisfied with the result of an FOI request, they may seek review by the office. A person may also complain to the office if they are unhappy with the manner in which their request was handled by an agency.

The FOI Act has been a feature of Australia's legislative landscape since 1982. The purpose of the FOI Act was to open government activity to public scrutiny, so as to enhance accountability and encourage citizen engagement with public administration. In 2010, the Australian Parliament implemented wide-ranging open government reforms — the most significant FOI reforms in thirty years. The office was established and substantial changes were made to the FOI Act. These reforms simplified the process for accessing government information, tightened the exemptions to information release, strengthened independent oversight and review of FOI administration, promoted proactive publication of government information, and clearly stated the open government object of the FOI Act.

The object of the Act is 'to increase recognition that information held by the Government is to be managed for public purposes, and is a national resource'.&lt;ref name="comlaw2"/&gt; The Reform Act introduced a new scheme for the proactive publication of government information called the Information Publication Scheme, under which government agencies are required to provide certain operational information on their websites.

The office may initiate an own motion investigation (OMI). The office can also provide information and advice on FOI to individuals and agencies, via the [http://www.oaic.gov.au/about-us/contact-us OAIC enquiries line].

== Privacy ==
Privacy is one of three broad functions conferred on the office. The [[Legislature|legislative]] basis of these privacy functions is drawn primarily from the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act regulates how an individual's personal information is handled. For example, it covers: 
* how personal information is collected (e.g. the personal information a person provides when they fill in a form)
* how it is then used and disclosed
* its accuracy
* how securely it is kept
* a person’s general right to access that information.

The Act also covers more specific matters, such as: 
* the use of tax file numbers
* how credit worthiness information about a person is handled by credit reporting agencies and credit providers.

The office has a range of responsibilities under other laws, including laws relating to data matching, eHealth, spent convictions and tax file numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privacy.gov.au/law |title=Home - OAIC |publisher=Privacy.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office provides information and advice on privacy to individuals, businesses and agencies via the [http://www.oaic.gov.au/about-us/contact-us OAIC enquiries line].

Under the Privacy Act a person can make a complaint to the office about the handling of their personal information by Australian, ACT and Norfolk Island government agencies and private sector organisations covered by the Privacy Act. In some circumstances, the office may also initiate an OMI.

The office has the power to conduct privacy audits of Australian and ACT Government agencies, as well as some other organisations in certain circumstances.

The Privacy Advisory Committee (PAC) provides strategic advice on privacy, from a broad range of perspectives, to the Australian Information Commissioner. PAC was established under section 82 of the Privacy Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Privacy Act 1988|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712}}&lt;/ref&gt; All members except the Commissioner are appointed by Her Excellency the Governor-General. PAC consists of no more than six members and is convened by the Australian Information Commissioner.

== Information policy ==
The Information Commissioner reports to the Attorney-General on matters relating to Australian Government information management policy and practice, including FOI and privacy.

The Information Commissioner is assisted in this regard by an [http://www.oaic.gov.au/about-us/working-with-others/information-advisory-committee Information Advisory Committee] (IAC), comprising senior officers from key agencies and people from outside government who have suitable qualifications or experience.

The office has released a set of ''Principles on open public sector information''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles on open public sector information|url=http://www.oaic.gov.au/information-policy/information-policy-resources/information-policy-agency-resources/principles-on-open-public-sector-information}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and an accompanying report. The principles are based on the premise that public sector information is to be managed for public purposes as a national resource.

The office encourages agencies to embed the principles in their internal policies and procedures on information management. The intention is that by doing so they will help build a culture of proactive information disclosure and community engagement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23370">'''Public interest law''' loosely, refers to legal practices undertaken to help poor or marginalized people, or to effect change in social policies in the public interest, on 'not for profit' terms ([[pro bono|''pro bono publico'']]).

It is not a body of law or a legal field, matters lawyers work on. Rather, it denotes the clientele they represent. Instead of serving powerful economic interests, it stands for the advocacy of otherwise under-represented or vulnerable individuals, especially those living in poverty. It has grown to encompass a broader range of activities, typically the field of non-lawyers like civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forster|first1=Christine M.

==Central and Eastern Europe ==
At the end of the communist period in the early 1990s, the national legal systems of Central and Eastern Europe were still in a formative stage. The most important source of legal authority for the new human rights groups came from outside the region: the [[Council of Europe]], with its [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Rekosh&gt;Edwin Rekosh, Constructing Public Interest Law: Transnational Collaboration and Exchange in Central and Eastern Europe, 13 UCLA J. Int'l L.&amp; For. Aff.55, 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, in the mid-1990s, U.S. experiences became more relevant. The Council of Europe's prerequisite that lawyers use their own country's courts first to seek legal remedies before turning to the European bodies gradually became more than a pro forma exercise, and civil society organizations began to make more effective use of domestic means of adjudication. But by the time local activists were ready to consider the utility of [[impact litigation]], test cases, and other tactics familiar from the U.S. experience, they already understood that their ultimate tactical weapon in any piece of litigation was to use the threat or reality of a supportive decision at the European Court of Human Rights. With this background in mind, it made more sense for the promoters of public interest law in Central and Eastern Europe to talk about "strategic litigation" than about public interest litigation. Using the instrumentality of the European Court of Human Rights effectively required a strategic approach. Not all human rights cases were likely to receive a favorable ruling; a negative ruling could produce more damage to the human rights cause than no ruling at all. The European Court had a rich case law that could provide clues to how a future case might be decided, and there were procedural aspects, such as the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, to consider.

The core lesson from the U.S. experience for local activists was how courts could be used effectively as a tool for civil society engagement in governance.&lt;ref name=Rekosh /&gt;
== Italy ==
The changes to the Italian electoral law from 2014 to 2017 were both "caused by actions born from the bottom (...) the result of a methodical, studied and concerted action. It has been featured by university professors, constitutional and electoral law-makers, parliamentarians and other elected representatives (...), representatives of civil society and ordinary citizens. Their names are, as voters, in more than twenty introductory pleadings (quotations or appeals)"&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.nomos-leattualitaneldiritto.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/maestri-2.pdf Gabriele Maestri, ''ORIZZONTI DI TECNICA ELETTORALE: PROBLEMI SUPERATI, IRRISOLTI ED EMERSI ALLA LUCE DELLA SENTENZA N. 35 DEL 2017'', Nomos, n. 2/2017].&lt;/ref&gt;, all of them brought [[pro bono]].

==China==
Public interest law (公益法, pronounced Gong Yi Fa) is an accepted term in China, where the basic institutions supporting the rule of law are still extremely nascent. China does not have a common-law system in which lawyers are expected to play a key role in “making law.”  Nevertheless, a small but effective community of lawyers has gained acceptance of public interest litigation as a legitimate means of resolving social issues and contributing to a harmonious society, and non-governmental actors have significantly improved the enforcement of rights for migrant workers, women, children and those suffering from environmental degradation, among others. For example, public interest lawyers in China have filed lawsuits in court successfully challenging workplace sexual harassment and the involuntary confinement of healthy people to mental hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2011 Annual Report, Parts II and III (October 10, 2011), available at {{cite web |url=http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213223223/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}; see generally R.P. Peerenboom, China's Long March toward Rule of Law (Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese reformers believe that one avenue for speeding the development of public interest law is implementing an associational standing rule by which organizations can instigate lawsuits to protect the interests of its members. Currently, China’s Civil Procedure Law is undergoing revision. One of the proposed amendments would create a form of associational standing. In theory, the new law would give domestic NGOs the power to file lawsuits in their own name on behalf of their members, but the proposed amendment has engendered spirited debate and its fate is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Draft limits scale of class-action lawsuits|work= [[China Daily]]|date= April 24, 2012|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-04/25/content_15131945.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Public interest law in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong public interest law is an emerging field. The chief vehicle for pursuing public interest claims is judicial review. This is the process by which decisions of the government are challenged in the courts. There has been a surge in judicial review cases since 2000. Environmental issues&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2004/27.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(Society%20for%20Protection%20of%20the%20Harbour%20Ltd%20and%20Town%20Planning%20Board) Society for Protection of the Harbour Ltd v Town Planning Board] [2004] 1 HKLRD 396; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/757.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Clean%20Air%20Foundation%20Ltd Clean Air Foundation Ltd v The Government of the HKSAR] [2007] HKEC 1356.&lt;/ref&gt; and minority rights&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/39.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(W%20and%20Registrar%20of%20Marriages) W v Registrar of Marriages] [2013] HKCFA 39; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/17.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Vallejos%20Evangeline%20Banao Vallejos Evangeline Banao v Commissioner of Registration &amp; Anor] [2013] HKCFA 17.&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most litigated areas.

One of the pioneers in public interest law in Hong Kong was Pamela Baker. In the late 1980s she litigated a series of landmark courtroom cases challenging the government’s treatment of Vietnamese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Geoffrey. [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/27/guardianobituaries ''"Pam Baker"''], ''"[[The Guardian]]"'', Saturday 27 April 2002. Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]] was established with the aim of promoting better human rights protection in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkhrm.org.hk|title=基本法第廿三條|website=www.hkhrm.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the majority of [[Cause lawyering | cause lawyers]] who represent citizens and social groups in human rights and public policy litigation on a consistent basis in Hong Kong are also members of political parties or active participants in social movements outside the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, the [[Legal Aid Department]] provides funding to legal services for those who pass the means and merits test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lad.gov.hk/eng/las/overview.html|title=Legal Aid Department - Legal Aid Schemes - Overview|website=www.lad.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Legal Aid Schemes that it operates, namely the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme (OLAS) and the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme (SLAS) have facilitated the practice of public interest law through narrowing the resource inequality between economically disadvantaged litigants and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause Lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 673.&lt;/ref&gt; However, NGOs and charitable organizations are not eligible to get legal aid.&lt;ref name="karen"&gt;Kong, Karen. "Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?" 39 HKLJ 767, 768.&lt;/ref&gt; The NGOs and Charitable organizations contributed to opening of avenues for people who deserved justice but lacked interest to approach courts and helped them in becoming petitioners to get justice.

Apart from legal aid, the [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] and [[The Law Society of Hong Kong]] jointly provides the Duty Lawyer Scheme which offers free legal representation to eligible defendants on the first day of court appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/duty/duty.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Duty Lawyer Scheme : The Duty Lawyer Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also run the Free Legal Advice Scheme at their Legal Advice Centres within nine District Offices in Hong Kong with the aim to provide one-off preliminary legal advice to the general public without imposing any means test.&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/free/free.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Free Legal Advice Scheme : Free Legal Advice Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong operate their own Bar Free Legal Service Scheme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ archived] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073406/http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Free Legal Consultation Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choosehklawyer.org/en/search_fl_start.asp|title=ChooseHKLawyer|website=www.choosehklawyer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively where enrolled law firms and barristers specializing in different fields volunteer to give consultations on a pro bono basis.&lt;ref name="chung"&gt;Chung, Eugenie. "Why Hong Kong Needs a Pro Bono Clearinghouse" 40 [2010] HKLJ 719, 731-732.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, unlike in the United States where NGOs and public interest law groups routinely bring public interest lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved individuals, in-house counsel working in NGOs and charities in Hong Kong are not allowed to directly represent the people these organizations serve.&lt;ref&gt;Precht, Robert. [http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1310978/more-public-interest-lawyers-can-help-ease-hong-kongs-social "More public interest lawyers can help ease Hong Kong's social tensions], ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (17 September 2013). Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators believe that the inability of NGOs to directly represent clients in legal proceedings has dampened the growth of public interest law in Hong Kong.

Law schools in Hong Kong also organize various programs to promote the idea of ''pro bono'' legal service to students.&lt;ref name="hkuscheme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ke.hku.hk/eng/highlights/2010/legal|title=KE Spotlight - Community Engagement - HKU Knowledge Exchange|website=www.ke.hku.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro bono committees of law firms in Hong Kong also meet on a bimonthly basis in the Hong Kong Legal Community Roundtable, a forum for international law firms to discuss development of pro bono work in Hong Kong and the region.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer Brown LLP, [http://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/d3066e31-ce28-4bef-8230-0ae6dc5897d2/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/575b4443-1989-4db6-be21-19736d732225/ProBonoUpdate_042010.pdf "Pro Bono Update" (Spring 2010)], page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
{{See also|Public interest litigation in India}}
"Public Interest Litigation" or PIL right since its inception in the Indian judicial system,&lt;ref name="Mother of PIL"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rajagopal|first1=Krishnadas|title=Starting the PIL revolution|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/starting-the-pil-revolution/571616/|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=The Indian Express|date=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown some good examples of safeguarding the rights of the people of India and has strengthened the position of the [[Supreme Court of India]] as preeminent guardian of Fundamental Rights enumerated in the [[Indian Constitution]]. It was introduced in India around 1979-80 by the Supreme Court judges, Justice [[V. R. Krishna Iyer]] along with Justice [[P. N. Bhagwati]]. And since then there had been instances when the Courts are keen to decide the matters of public importance without delay, as the case in Shyam sundar where the court accepted the matter even when the application was made by a letter sent through post.

==United States==
[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]] (center) in his office 1916.]]

“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built on a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists"] (Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work—wishing to affect the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Summing up the movement's history in the United States, Stanford University Law Professor Deborah Rhode writes: "Public interest lawyers have saved lives, protected fundamental rights, established crucial principles, transformed institutions, and ensured essential benefits for those who need them most....In virtually every major American social reform movement of the last half century, public interest lawyers have played an important role."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah L.Rhode, Public Interest Law: the Movement and Midlife, 60 Stan.L.Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Public interest law is institutionalized in the United States(USA). Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that work to promote and protect human rights using the U.S. legal system, fight to protect the environment, or advocate on behalf of consumers, call themselves public interest law organizations. A large community of lawyers practices public interest law in the form of providing [[legal aid]] free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay for it. However, the grim reality remains that lawyers are underpaid and grossly overworked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=How Americans Lost the Right to Counsel, 50 Years After 'Gideon' (March, 2013)|url=http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/how-americans-lost-right-counsel-50-years-after-gideon|publisher=The Brennan Center for Justice (NYU School of Law)|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering perfunctory representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bright|first1=Stephen B.|last2=Sanneh|first2=Sia M.|title=Fifty Years of Defiance and Resistance After Gideon v.

Some law schools have public interest law centers, which advise law students interested in pursuing public interest law careers. [[Pro bono]] programs at bar associations and law firms provide opportunities for commercial lawyers to donate time to public interest law activities.&lt;ref name=Cummings/&gt;

==United Kingdom(UK)==
In law, public interest is a defence against certain lawsuits (for instance some [[libel]] suits in the United Kingdom) and an exemption from certain laws or regulations (for instance [[freedom of information]] laws in the UK). Also, judges in [[common law]] systems can make judgements on the grounds of [[public policy (law)|public policy]], a related term.

'''Rhetorical modes''' (also known as '''modes of discourse''') describe the variety, conventions, and purposes of the major kinds of [[language]]-based [[communication]], particularly [[writing]] and [[speaking]]. Four of the most common rhetorical modes and their purpose are [[Narrative mode|narration]], [[description]], [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]], and [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]].{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}  The first codification of these rhetorical modes was by Samuel P. Newman in ''A Practical System of Rhetoric'' in 1827.{{sfn|Connors|1981|p=445}} 

==Narration==
{{further|Exposition (narrative)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of [[narrative mode|narration]] is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Working with narration helps us see clear sequences separate from all other mental functions. Examples include:
*[[Anecdote]]s
*[[Autobiography]]
*[[Biography]]
*[[Novel]]s
*[[Oral history]]
*[[Short story]]

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The  purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. Descriptive writing can be found in the other rhetorical modes.  Examples include:
*[[Personal journal|Journal writing]]
*[[Poetry]]

==Exposition==
Expository writing is a type of [[writing]] where the purpose is to explain, inform, or even describe.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Arnetha F.|title=Expository Writing|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~arnetha/expowrite/info.html|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the four most common rhetorical modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordquist|first=Richard|title=Expository Writing|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/e/g/Expository-Writing-term.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of expository writing is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. In [[narrative]] contexts (such as [[history]] and [[fiction]]), [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]] provides background information to teach or entertain. In other [[nonfiction]] contexts (such as [[technical communication]]), the purpose is to teach and inform. Examples include:{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}

==Argumentation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of argumentation (also called ''[[persuasive writing]]'') is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument to thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing/Persuasion is a type of argumentation with the additional aim to urge the reader to take some form of action.  Examples include:
*[[Copywriting|Advertising copy]]
*[[review|Critical review]]
*[[Editorial]]s
*[[Job evaluation]]
*[[Job application]] letter
*[[Letter of recommendation]]
*[[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]]
*[[Résumé]]s

Another form of persuasive rhetoric is satirical rhetoric, or using humor in order to make a point about some aspect of life or society. Perhaps the most famous example is [[Jonathan Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]".

==Fiction-writing modes==
Each [[fiction-writing mode]] has its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt| Marshall | 1998 | pp = 143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Selgin | 2007 | p = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10546">In the [[regulation]] of [[algorithm]]s, particularly [[artificial intelligence]] and its subfield of [[machine learning]], a '''right to explanation''' (or '''right to ''an'' explanation''') is a [[right]] to be given an [[explanation]] for an output of the algorithm. Such rights primarily refer to [[individual right]]s to be given an explanation for decisions that significantly affect an individual, particularly legally or financially. For example, a person who applies for a loan and is denied may ask for an explanation, which could be "[[Credit bureau]] X reports that you declared bankruptcy last year; this is the main factor in considering you too likely to default, and thus we will not give you the loan you applied for."

Some such [[legal right]]s already exist, while the scope of a general "right to explanation" is a matter of ongoing debate.

== Examples ==
=== Credit score in the United States ===
{{details|Credit score in the United States}}

[[Credit score in the United States]] – more generally, credit actions – have a well-established right to explanation. Under the [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] (Regulation B of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]),
Title 12, Chapter X, Part 1002, [https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1bb14fdfd1afc7d3f2d4756d223aeadb&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.8.1002_19 §1002.9], creditors are required to notify applicants of action taken in certain circumstances, and such notifications must provide specific reasons, as detailed in §1002.9(b)(2):&lt;ref&gt;[[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/1002-9/2011-31714#1002-9-b-2 §1002.9(b)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(2) Statement of specific reasons. The statement of reasons for adverse action required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section must be specific and indicate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action. Statements that the adverse action was based on the creditor's internal standards or policies or that the applicant, joint applicant, or similar party failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditor's credit scoring system are insufficient.}}

The [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/1002-Subpart-Interp/2011-31714#1002-9-b-2-Interp-1 official interpretation] of this section details what types of statements are acceptable.

Credit agencies and data analysis firms such as [[FICO]] comply with this regulation by providing a list of reasons (generally at most 4, per interpretation of regulations), consisting of a numeric '''{{visible anchor|reason code}}''' (as identifier) and an associated explanation, identifying the main factors affecting a credit score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creditscoring.com/creditscore/fico/factors/reason-codes.html US FICO credit risk score reason codes: Fundamental document from FICO listing all of the FICO credit score reasons that a score is not higher], March 31, 2010, by Greg Fisher&lt;/ref&gt; An example might be:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reasoncode.org/reasoncode101 Reason Codes 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

:32: Balances on bankcard or revolving accounts too high compared to credit limits

=== European Union ===

The European Union [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (enacted 2016, taking effect 2018), extends the automated decision-making rights in the 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] to provide a legally disputed form of a right to an explanation, stated as such in [https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/r71.htm Recital 71]: "[the data subject should have] the right ... to obtain an explanation of the decision reached". In full:

{{quote|
The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention.

...

In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision.}}

However, the extent to which the regulations themselves provide a "right to explanation" is heavily debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Bryce |title=European Union Regulations on Algorithmic Decision-Making and a 'Right to Explanation' |last2=Flaxman |first2=Seth |url=https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2741 |journal=AI Magazine |year=2017 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v38i3.2741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iapp.org/news/a/is-there-a-right-to-explanation-for-machine-learning-in-the-gdpr/ Is there a 'right to explanation' for machine learning in the GDPR?], Jun 1, 2017, Andrew Burt&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main strands of criticism. There are significant legal issues with the right as found in Article 22 — as recitals are not binding, and the right to an explanation is not mentioned in the binding articles of the text, having been removed during the legislative process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2903469 |last1=Wachter |first1=Sandra |last2=Mittelstadt |first2=Brent |last3=Floridi |first3=Luciano |title=Why a Right to Explanation of Automated Decision-Making Does Not Exist in the General Data Protection Regulation |date=December 28, 2016 |journal=International Data Privacy Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are significant restrictions on the types of automated decisions that are covered — which must be both "solely" based on automated processing, and have legal or similarly significant effect — which limits their applicability in many of the cases of algorithmic controversy that have been picked up in the media.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=2017|title=Slave to the algorithm? Why a "right to an explanation" is probably not the remedy you are looking for|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2972855|journal=Duke Law and Technology Review|volume=|pages=|ssrn=2972855|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second source of such a right has been pointed to in Article 15, the "right of access by the data subject". This restates a similar provision from the 1995 Data Protection Directive, allowing the data subject access to "meaningful information about the logic involved" in the same significant, solely automated decision-making, found in Article 22. Yet this too suffers from alleged challenges that relate to the timing of when this right can be drawn upon, as well as practical challenges that mean it may not be binding in many cases of public concern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== France ===
In [[France]] the 2016 ''Loi pour une République numérique'' (Digital Republic Act or ''loi numérique'') amends the country's administrative code to introduce a new provision for the explanation of decisions made by public sector bodies about individuals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=2018|title=Enslaving the Algorithm: From a ‘Right to an Explanation’ to a ‘Right to Better Decisions’?|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3052831|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy|volume=|pages=|ssrn=3052831|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It notes that where there is "a decision taken on the basis of an algorithmic treatment", the rules that define that treatment and its “principal characteristics” must be communicated to the citizen upon request, where there is not an exclusion (e.g. for national security or defence). These should include the following:
# the degree and the mode of contribution of the algorithmic processing to the decision- making;
# the data processed and its source;
# the treatment parameters, and where appropriate, their weighting, applied to the situation of the person concerned;
# the operations carried out by the treatment. 
Scholars have noted that this right, while limited to administrative decisions, goes beyond the GDPR right to explicitly apply to decision support rather than decisions "solely" based on automated processing, as well as provides a framework for explaining specific decisions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Indeed, the GDPR automated decision-making rights in the European Union, one of the places a "right to an explanation" has been sought within, find their origins in French law in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bygrave|first=L A|date=2001|title=Minding the Machine: Article 15 of the EC Data Protection Directive and Automated Profiling|url=http://folk.uio.no/lee/oldpage/articles/Minding_machine.pdf|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=17|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(01)00104-2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Some argue that a "right to explanation" is at best unnecessary, at worst harmful, and threatens to stifle innovation. Specific criticisms include: favoring human decisions over machine decisions; being redundant with existing laws; and focusing on process over outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/2017/01/25/429101-eus-right-explanation-harmful-restriction-artificial-intelligence.htm EU's Right to Explanation: A Harmful Restriction on Artificial Intelligence], Nick Wallace, Center for Data Innovation, January 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

More fundamentally, many algorithms used in machine learning are not easily explainable. For example, the output of a [[deep neural network]] depends on many layers of computations, connected in a complex way, and no one input or computation may be a dominant factor. The field of [[Explainable AI]] seeks to provide better explanations from existing algorithms, and algorithms that are more easily explainable, but it is a young and active field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Similarly, human decisions often cannot be easily explained: they may be based on intuition or a "[[gut feeling]]" that is hard to put into words. Requiring machines to meet a higher standard than humans is thus arguably unreasonable.

[[File:Section_retract.svg|thumbnail|''f'' is a retraction of ''g''. ''g'' is a section of ''f''.|150px]]
In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''section''' is a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]] of some [[morphism]]. [[Dual (category theory)|Dually]], a '''retraction''' is a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|left inverse]] of some [[morphism]].
In other words, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' and ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X'' are morphisms whose composition ''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Y'' is the [[identity morphism]] on ''Y'', then ''g'' is a section of ''f'', and ''f'' is a retraction of ''g''.

Every section is a [[monomorphism]], and every retraction is an [[epimorphism]].

In algebra the sections are also called '''split monomorphisms''' and the retractions '''split epimorphisms'''.
In an [[abelian category]], if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a split epimorphism with split monomorphism ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X'',
then ''X'' is isomorphic to the [[direct sum]] of ''Y'' and the [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] of ''f''.

==Examples==
In the [[category of sets]], every monomorphism ([[injective function]]) with a non-empty domain is a section and every epimorphism ([[surjective function]]) is a retraction; the latter statement is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

In the [[category of vector spaces]] over a field ''K'', every monomorphism and every epimorphism splits; this follows from the fact that linear maps can be uniquely defined by specifying their values on a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].

In the [[category of abelian groups]], the epimorphism '''Z'''&amp;rarr;'''Z'''/2'''Z''' which sends every integer to its image [[modular arithmetic|modulo 2]] does not split; in fact the only morphism '''Z'''/2'''Z'''&amp;rarr;'''Z''' is the 0 map. Similarly, the natural monomorphism '''Z'''/2'''Z'''&amp;rarr;'''Z'''/4'''Z''' doesn't split even though there is a non-trivial homomorphism '''Z'''/4'''Z'''&amp;rarr;'''Z'''/2'''Z'''.

The categorical concept of a section is important in [[homological algebra]], and is also closely related to the notion of a [[section (fiber bundle)|section of a fiber bundle]] in topology: in the latter case, a section of a fiber bundle is a section of the bundle projection map of the fiber bundle.

Given a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] &lt;math&gt;\bar X&lt;/math&gt; with quotient map &lt;math&gt;\pi\colon X \to \bar X&lt;/math&gt;, a section of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[Transversal (combinatorics)|transversal]].

'''Social occultation''' occurs when a particular set of cultural [[values]] and [[beliefs]] combine with the operation of personal and [[mass media]] communication functions leads to ''lacunae'', or [[Blind spot (psychology)|blind spots]].

Intentional social occultation is the process of creating [[social invisibility]] while not completely denying the reality of a social circumstance, issue, or problem.  Social occultation is a dynamic of [[social constructionism]]. For example, the recent abuses by the USA military at [[Abu Ghraib]] prison in [[Iraq]] were made highly visible and resulted in shock and outrage in the USA. In contrast, the daily practices of humiliation and abuse in some prison settings in the USA get almost no public attention.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In various circumstances, certain social sub-groups and situations may have attention deflected away; this deflection may be institutionalized in [[media bias]].

As a dynamic of political or social [[Toleration|intolerance]], when segregation is not possible or desirable, social occultation may be found in individual [[behaviors]] and in organizational [[policies]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Outgroups]] have frequently sought visibility as a vehicle to address issues of concern.  For example, in 2004-2005 the incidence of violence to [[transgender]] people in Washington DC was a case where members of the outgroup considered public attention to be lacking.

Incidental neglect of an issue differs from deliberate posturing{{how?|date=April 2014}} (a [[Wiktionary:subversive|subversive]] process) to systematically ignore (in whole or part) the issue as a matter of political or social preference.

__NOTOC__
'''''Source: Music of the Avant-Garde''''' – also known and hereafter referred to as ''Source Magazine'' – was an independent, not-for-profit musical and artistic magazine published between 1967 and 1973 by teachers and students of the [[University of California, Davis]], California. It emerged from the flourishing Californian musical experimentalism of the late 1950s-early 1960s, at UC-Davis and [[Mills College]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein_265"&gt;Bernstein (2008), Thomas M. Welsh, ''Chronology'', p.265&lt;/ref&gt; The 11 issues document new music practices of the period like [[Aleatoric music|indeterminacy]], [[performance]], [[graphic notation (music)|graphic scores]], [[electronic music]] and [[intermedia]] arts.

==Origin==
''Source Magazine'''s board of editors first met in the '''New Music Ensemble''', formed in 1963, an improvised music group led by UC-Davis music teacher [[Larry Austin]]&lt;ref name="Austin_1"&gt;Austin (2011), ''Introduction'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; and comprising two of his students: Stanley Lunetta on drums and [[Dary John Mizelle]] on trombone, in addition to [[Wayne Johnson]], bass clarinet ; Art Woodbury, saxophone ; and [[Richard Swift (composer)|Richard Swift]], keyboards, sometimes augmented by occasional visitors like flutist [[Jon Gibson (minimalist musician)|Jon Gibson]] or soprano Billie Alexander.

In the Spring of 1966, the group officially launched the '''Composer/Performer Edition''' imprint with the idea of publishing a catalog of graphic scores and avantgarde music related material by composers they felt close to, like [[Frederic Rzewski]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], Allan Bryant, or Jon Phetteplace of [[Musica Elettronica Viva]].&lt;ref name="Austin_2"&gt;Austin (2011), ''Introduction'', p.2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, they sent a mailing of 5,000 invitations nationwide, calling for pieces in the form of original scores. Composer/Performer Edition published some of these music scores separately, but the team felt the need to collect the material they received in the form of a magazine titled ''Source''. Austin, Lunetta, Mizelle, Johnson, Woodburry and administrative manager Paul Roberts formed the magazine's board,&lt;ref name="Austin_x"&gt;Austin (2011), Douglas Kahn, ''Preface'', p.x&lt;/ref&gt; with Austin becoming chief editor.

A twelfth issue was planned but never made it to printing due to lack of internal funding.&lt;ref name="Sacramento Press"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burg|first1=William|title=Sacramento’s Source of the Avant-Garde|url=http://sacramentopress.com/2013/10/01/sacramentos-source-of-the-avant-garde/|website=http://sacramentopress.com/|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circulation ==
Each issue had a print run of 2,000 copies, although the first issue originally ran 1,000 copies before selling out and warranting an additional 1,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Sacramento Press"/&gt; According to chief editor Larry Austin, the spiral-bound, 10 ¾ x 13 ½ inches landscape format was inspired by some of John Cage's graphic scores&lt;ref name="Austin_3"&gt;Austin (2011), ''Introduction'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the benefit of being able to stand the magazine up on a piano or music stand when performing pieces.&lt;ref name="Ginsberg Thesis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginsberg|first1=Maya|title=DOCUMENTING THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENTAL TRADITION:  A HISTORICAL EXAMINATION OF SOURCE AND SOUNDINGS|date=2011|publisher=San Diego State University|page=22|url=http://sdsu-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.10/1344/Ginsberg_Maya(2).pdf?sequence=3|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subscribers were composers, teachers, performers or libraries located in North America and Europe. The magazine was never subsided or funded by any institution.&lt;ref name="Austin_xii"&gt;Austin (2011), Douglas Kahn, ''Preface'', p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music content ==
Despite or thanks to its short existence, the scope of ''Source'' magazine appears both focused and wide ranging. Emerging from a rejection of formal concert performance and traditional music notation, ''Source'' also included [[performance art]] and [[sound poetry]] in its coverage of avantgarde graphic scores, therefore expanding the very definition of music. It welcomed veterans like [[Harry Partch]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[John Cage]] or [[Morton Feldman]], as well as young Turks of the avant-garde like [[Hugh Davies (composer)|Hugh Davies]] (b1943), [[Daniel Lentz]] (b1942) or [[Jerry Hunt]] (b1943).

Over the years, ''Source'' covered West Coast experimentalism of the 1960s ([[Gordon Mumma]], [[Robert Ashley]]) ; American Minimalism ([[Steve Reich]], [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]]) ; the birth of [[Sound Art]] as we know it ([[Alvin Lucier]], [[Max Neuhaus]], [[Annea Lockwood]]) ; improvised and indeterminate music (the ONCE Group, Musica Elettronica Viva, Toshi Ichiyanagi) ; [[Fluxus]] and performance art with [[Dick Higgins]] or [[Allan Kaprow]] ; European sound poetry with the [[Fylkingen]] affiliated artists or [[Bernard Heidsieck]] ; the British [[Systems music]] of [[Cornelius Cardew]], [[Howard Skempton]], [[Michael Parsons (composer)|Michael Parsons]] and [[Gavin Bryars]].

''Source'' also welcomed the use of advanced technology (electronic, video, communications) to expand music's scope.&lt;ref name="Romagny_33-48"&gt;Romagny (2011), p.33-48&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine published information on [[Don Buchla]]'s newly built synthesizer,&lt;ref name="Bernstein_163"&gt;Bernstein (2011), p.163&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nam June Paik]]'s first video experiments or Lowell Cross's video/laser light shows featured in issue #9, 1971.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, web site, (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was perfectly in synch with the Art &amp; Technology show&lt;ref name="Tuchman"&gt;Tuchman (1971), ''Report''&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], 1971, where contemporary artists were offered to partner with engineers and technicians of their choice.&lt;ref name="Antin_61"&gt;Antin (2011), p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Themed issues''': Some issues of ''Source'' have overtly or underlying specific themes, like issue #3, January 1968, stressing the importance of groups in new music and including scores, interviews or essays by [[ONCE Group]], [[Musica Elettronica Viva]], [[Sonic Arts Union]] and New Music Ensemble ; issue #8, July 1970, is on concrete and sound poetry, with a report on the Swedish scene from the [[Fylkingen]] festival and venue, and other independent sound poets like [[Bob Cobbing]] and [[Henri Chopin]] ; issue #6, July 1969, is on Politics ; issue #9 (1971) features circuit diagrams ; issue #11 (1972) introduces Fluxus and intermedia.
* '''Guest editors''': a number of issues had guest editors who were invited to choose among the scores received by the magazine for possible inclusion, make their own suggestions of graphic scores to publish and bring their expertise on a specific field. [[Alvin Lucier]] included electronic experiments, in addition to the British Systems music forming the core of issue 10. [[Ken Friedman]] was asked to focus on Fluxus, performance and intermedia art in issue #11. John Cage took advantage of the skills of Source's resourceful printer, Doug Galbreath,&lt;ref name="Austin_2"/&gt; to create a version of ''Not Wanting To Say Anything About Marcel''&lt;ref&gt;See John Cage's Wikipedia [[John Cage#Visual art, writings, and other activities|article]]&lt;/ref&gt; printed on transparencies inserted in issue #7-8.
* '''Accompanying LP recordings''': several issues came with a pair of 10-inch records, a format chosen to fit with the magazine's format of nearly 11" x 14". These recordings collected sound works by artists included in the magazine with issues 4, 7/8 and 9. The two 10-inch LPs coming with issue #4 were subsidized by Columbia records, thanks to [[David Behrman]], an A&amp;R representative for Columbia in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Austin_xi-xii"&gt;Austin (2011), Douglas Kahn, ''Preface'', p.xi-xii&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[universal algebra]] and in [[model theory]], a '''structure''' consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] along with a collection of [[finitary|finitary operations]] and [[finitary relation|relation]]s that are defined on it.

Universal algebra studies structures that generalize the [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[vector space]]s. The term '''universal algebra''' is used for structures with no [[relation symbol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Some authors refer to structures as "algebras" when generalizing universal algebra to allow [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] as well as functions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Model theory]] has a different scope that encompasses more arbitrary theories, including [[foundations of mathematics|foundational]] structures such as models of [[set theory]]. From the model-theoretic point of view, structures are the objects used to define the semantics of [[first-order logic]]. For a given theory in model theory, a structure is called a '''model''', if it satisfies the defining axioms of that theory, although it is sometimes disambiguated as a ''[[semantic model]]'' when one discusses the notion in the more general setting of [[mathematical model]]s. Logicians sometimes refer to structures as [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodges |first=Wilfrid |editor-last=Meijers |editor-first=Anthonie |date=2009 |chapter=Functional Modelling and Mathematical Models |title=Philosophy of technology and engineering sciences |series=Handbook of the Philosophy of Science |publisher=Elsevier |volume=9 |isbn=978-0-444-51667-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[database theory]], structures with no functions are studied as models for relational [[database]]s, in the form of [[relational model]]s.

== Definition ==
{{see also|Model theory#Universal algebra|Universal algebra#Basic idea}}
Formally, a '''structure''' can be defined as a triple &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A=(A, \sigma, I)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a '''domain''' ''A'', a [[signature (logic)|signature]] σ, and an '''interpretation function''' ''I'' that indicates how the signature is to be interpreted on the domain. To indicate that a structure has a particular signature σ one can refer to it as a σ-structure.

=== Domain ===
The [[domain of discourse|domain]] of a structure is an arbitrary set; it is also called the '''underlying set''' of the structure, its '''carrier''' (especially in universal algebra), or its '''universe''' (especially in model theory). In classical first-order logic, the definition of a structure prohibits the [[empty domain]].&lt;ref&gt;This is similar to the definition of a [[prime number]] in elementary [[number theory]], which has been carefully chosen so that the [[irreducible element|irreducible]] number 1 is not considered prime. The convention that the domain of a structure may not be empty is particularly important in logic, because several common inference rules, notably, [[universal instantiation]], are not sound when empty structures are permitted. A logical system that allows the empty domain is known as an [[free logic|inclusive logic]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the notation &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dom}(\mathcal A)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; is used for the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, but often no notational distinction is made between a structure and its domain. (I.e. the same symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; refers both to the structure and its domain.)&lt;ref&gt;As a consequence of these conventions, the notation &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; may also be used to refer to the [[cardinality]] of the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;. In practice this never leads to confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signature ===
{{main article|Signature (logic)}}
The [[signature (logic)|signature]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma = (S, \operatorname{ar})&lt;/math&gt; of a structure consists of a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of '''function symbols''' and '''relation symbols''' along with a function &lt;math&gt;\text{ar:}\ S \to \N_0&lt;/math&gt; that ascribes to each symbol ''s'' a [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;n=\operatorname{ar}(s)&lt;/math&gt; which is called the '''arity''' of ''s'' because it is the [[arity]] of the interpretation of ''s''.

Since the signatures that arise in [[algebra]] often contain only function symbols, a signature with no relation symbols is called an '''algebraic signature'''. A structure with such a signature is also called an '''algebra'''; this should not be confused with the notion of an [[algebra over a field]].

=== Interpretation function ===
{{main article|Interpretation (model theory)}}
The '''interpretation function''' ''I'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; assigns functions and relations to the symbols of the signature. Each function symbol ''f'' of arity ''n'' is assigned an [[arity|''n''-ary]] function &lt;math&gt;f^{\mathcal A}=I(f)&lt;/math&gt; on the domain. Each relation symbol ''R'' of arity ''n'' is assigned an ''n''-ary relation &lt;math&gt;R^{\mathcal A}=I(R)\subseteq A^{\operatorname{ar(R)}}&lt;/math&gt; on the domain. A nullary function symbol ''c'' is called a '''constant symbol''', because its interpretation ''I(c)'' can be identified with a constant element of the domain.

When a structure (and hence an interpretation function) is given by context, no notational distinction is made between a symbol ''s'' and its interpretation ''I(s)''. For example, if ''f'' is a binary function symbol of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, one simply writes &lt;math&gt;f:\mathcal A^2\rightarrow\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;f^{\mathcal A}:|\mathcal A|^2\rightarrow|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Examples ===
The standard signature σ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;  for [[field (mathematics)|fields]] consists of two binary function symbols '''+''' and '''×''', where additional symbols can be derived, such as a unary function symbol '''―''' (uniquely determined by '''+''') and the two constant symbols '''0''' and '''1''' (uniquely determined by '''+''' and '''×''' respectively).
Thus a structure (algebra) for this signature consists of a set of elements ''A'' together with two binary functions, that can be enhanced with a unary function, and two distinguished elements; but there is no requirement that it satisfy any of the field axioms. The [[rational number]]s ''Q'', the [[real number]]s ''R'' and the [[complex number]]s ''C'', like any other field, can be regarded as σ-structures in an obvious way:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal Q = (Q, \sigma_f, I_{\mathcal Q})&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal R = (R, \sigma_f, I_{\mathcal R})&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal C = (C, \sigma_f, I_{\mathcal C})&lt;/math&gt;

In all three cases we have the standard signature given by
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_f = (S_f,\operatorname{ar}_f)&lt;/math&gt; 
with
:::&lt;math&gt;S_f = \{+,\times,-,0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ar}_f(+) = \operatorname{ar}_f(\times) = 2, \operatorname{ar}_f(-) = 1, \operatorname{ar}_f(0) = \operatorname{ar}_f(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref name="sign_and_number" /&gt;

Interpretation functions:
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(+)\colon Q\times Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; is addition of rational numbers,
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(\times)\colon Q\times Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; is multiplication of rational numbers,
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(-)\colon Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; is the function that takes each rational number ''x'' to -''x'', and
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(0)\in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the number 0 and
::&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal Q}(1)\in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the number 1;
and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; are similarly defined.&lt;ref name="sign_and_number"&gt;Note: '''0''', '''1''' and '''―''' on the left refer to signs of &lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt;. 0, 1, 2, and - on the right refer to natural numbers of &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; and to the unary operation ''minus'' in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

But the ring ''Z'' of [[integer]]s, which is not a field, is also a σ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;-structure in the same way. In fact, there is no requirement that ''any'' of the field axioms hold in a σ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;-structure.

A signature for [[ordered field]]s needs an additional binary relation such as &amp;lt; or ≤, and therefore structures for such a signature are not algebras, even though they are of course [[algebraic structure]]s in the usual, loose sense of the word.

The ordinary signature for set theory includes a single binary relation ∈.  A structure for this signature consists of a set of elements and an interpretation of the ∈ relation as a binary relation on these elements.

== Induced substructures and closed subsets ==
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is called an [[substructure (mathematics)|(induced) substructure]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; if
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; have the same signature &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\mathcal A)=\sigma(\mathcal B)&lt;/math&gt;;
* the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|\subseteq |\mathcal B|&lt;/math&gt;; and
* the interpretations of all function and relation symbols agree on &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal B|&lt;/math&gt;.

The usual notation for this relation is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A\subseteq\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;.

A subset &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; of the domain of a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is called '''closed''' if it is closed under the functions of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. if the following condition is satisfied:  for every natural number ''n'', every ''n''-ary function symbol ''f'' (in the signature of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;) and all elements &lt;math&gt;b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n\in B&lt;/math&gt;, the result of applying ''f'' to the ''n''-tuple &lt;math&gt;b_1b_2\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; is again an element of ''B'': &lt;math&gt;f(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)\in B&lt;/math&gt;.

For every subset &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; there is a smallest closed subset of &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; that contains ''B''. It is called the closed subset '''generated''' by ''B'', or the '''hull''' of ''B'', and denoted by &lt;math&gt;\langle B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\langle B\rangle_{\mathcal A}&lt;/math&gt;. The operator &lt;math&gt;\langle\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[finitary closure operator]] on the [[power set|set of subsets]] of &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A=(A,\sigma,I)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset, then &lt;math&gt;(B,\sigma,I')&lt;/math&gt; is an induced substructure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I'&lt;/math&gt; assigns to every symbol of σ the restriction to ''B'' of its interpretation in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, the domain of an induced substructure is a closed subset.

The closed subsets (or induced substructures) of a structure form a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. The [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] of two subsets is their intersection. The [[join (mathematics)|join]] of two subsets is the closed subset generated by their union. Universal algebra studies the lattice of substructures of a structure in detail.

=== Examples ===
Let σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{+,&amp;nbsp;×,&amp;nbsp;−,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1} be again the standard signature for fields. When regarded as σ-structures in the natural way, the [[rational number]]s form a substructure of the [[real number]]s, and the real numbers form a substructure of the [[complex number]]s. The rational numbers are the smallest substructure of the real (or complex) numbers that also satisfies the field axioms.

The set of integers gives an even smaller substructure of the real numbers which is not a field. Indeed, the integers are the substructure of the real numbers generated by the empty set, using this signature.  The notion in abstract algebra that corresponds to a substructure of a field, in this signature, is that of a [[subring]], rather than that of a [[Field extension|subfield]].

The most obvious way to define a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is a structure with a signature σ consisting of a single binary relation symbol ''E''. The vertices of the graph form the domain of the structure, and for two vertices ''a'' and ''b'', &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\!\in \text{E}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; means that ''a'' and ''b'' are connected by an edge. In this encoding, the notion of induced substructure is more restrictive than the notion of [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]]. For example, let ''G'' be a graph consisting of two vertices connected by an edge, and let ''H'' be the graph consisting of the same vertices but no edges. ''H'' is a subgraph of ''G'', but not an induced substructure. The notion in [[graph theory]] that corresponds to induced substructures is that of induced subgraphs.

== Homomorphisms and embeddings ==
{{see also|Universal algebra#Basic constructions}}

=== Homomorphisms ===
Given two structures &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; of the same signature σ, a '''(σ-)homomorphism''' from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is a [[map (mathematics)|map]] &lt;math&gt;h:|\mathcal A|\rightarrow|\mathcal B|&lt;/math&gt; that preserves the functions and relations. More precisely:

* For every ''n''-ary function symbol ''f'' of σ and any elements &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\in|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt;, the following equation holds:
::&lt;math&gt;h(f(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n))=f(h(a_1),h(a_2),\dots,h(a_n))&lt;/math&gt;.
* For every ''n''-ary relation symbol ''R'' of σ and any elements &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\in|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt;, the following implication holds:
::&lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)\in R \implies (h(a_1),h(a_2),\dots,h(a_n))\in R&lt;/math&gt;.

The notation for a homomorphism ''h'' from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;h: \mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt;.

For every signature σ there is a [[concrete category|concrete]] [[category (mathematics)|category]] σ-'''Hom''' which has σ-structures as objects and σ-homomorphisms as [[morphism (category theory)|morphisms]].

A homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h: \mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called '''strong''' if for every ''n''-ary relation symbol ''R'' and any elements &lt;math&gt;b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n\in|\mathcal B|&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)\in R&lt;/math&gt;, there are &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\in|\mathcal A|&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_1=h(a_1),\,b_2=h(a_2),\,\dots,\,b_n=h(a_n).&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=This definition of strong homomorphism looks non-standard.|date=September 2015}}
The strong homomorphisms give rise to a subcategory of σ-'''Hom'''.

=== Embeddings ===
A (σ-)homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; is called a (σ-)'''embedding''' if it is [[injective function|one-to-one]] and

* for every ''n''-ary relation symbol ''R'' of σ and any elements &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n&lt;/math&gt;, the following equivalence holds:
::&lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)\in R \iff(h(a_1),h(a_2),\dots,h(a_n))\in R&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus an embedding is the same thing as a strong homomorphism which is one-to-one.
The category σ-'''Emb''' of σ-structures and σ-embeddings is a concrete [[subcategory]] of σ-'''Hom'''.

Induced substructures correspond to [[subobject]]s in σ-'''Emb'''. If σ has only function symbols, σ-'''Emb''' is the subcategory of [[monomorphism]]s of σ-'''Hom'''. In this case induced substructures also correspond to subobjects in σ-'''Hom'''.

=== Example ===
As seen above, in the standard encoding of graphs as structures the induced substructures are precisely the induced subgraphs. However, a [[graph homomorphism|homomorphism between graphs]] is the same thing as a homomorphism between the two structures coding the graph. In the example of the previous section, even though the subgraph ''H'' of ''G'' is not induced, the identity map id:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''G'' is a homomorphism. This map is in fact a [[monomorphism]] in the category σ-'''Hom''', and therefore ''H'' is a [[subobject]] of ''G'' which is not an induced substructure.

=== Homomorphism problem ===
The following problem is known as the ''homomorphism problem'':

:Given two finite structures &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; of a finite relational signature, find a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal A\rightarrow\mathcal B&lt;/math&gt; or show that no such homomorphism exists.

Every [[constraint satisfaction problem]] (CSP) has a translation into the homomorphism problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Jeavons |first1=Peter |last2=Cohen |first2=David |last3=Pearson |first3=Justin |date=1998 |title=Constraints and universal algebra |journal=Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence |doi=10.1023/A:1018941030227 |volume=24 |pages=51–67 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the [[Complexity of constraint satisfaction#Constraint satisfaction and the homomorphism problem|complexity of CSP]] can be studied using the methods of [[finite model theory]].

Another application is in [[database theory]], where a [[relational model]] of a [[database]] is essentially the same thing as a relational structure. It turns out that a [[conjunctive query]] on a database can be described by another structure in the same signature as the database model. A homomorphism from the relational model to the structure representing the query is the same thing as a solution to the query. This shows that the conjunctive query problem is also equivalent to the homomorphism problem.

== Structures and first-order logic ==
{{see also|Model theory#First-order logic|Model theory#Axiomatizability, elimination of quantifiers, and model-completeness}}
Structures are sometimes referred to as "first-order structures". This is misleading, as nothing in their definition ties them to any specific logic, and in fact they are suitable as semantic objects both for very restricted fragments of first-order logic such as that used in universal algebra, and for [[second-order logic]]. In connection with first-order logic and model theory, structures are often called '''models''', even when the question "models of what?" has no obvious answer.

=== Satisfaction relation ===
Each first-order structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; has a '''satisfaction relation''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \vDash \phi&lt;/math&gt; defined for all formulas &lt;math&gt;\, \phi&lt;/math&gt;  in the language consisting of the language of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; together with a constant symbol for each element of ''M'', which is interpreted as that element.
This relation is defined inductively using Tarski's [[T-schema]].

A structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''model''' of a [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] ''T'' if the language of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the language of ''T'' and every sentence in ''T'' is satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.    Thus, for example, a "ring" is a structure for the language of rings that satisfies each of the ring axioms, and a model of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms|ZFC set theory]] is a structure in the language of set theory that satisfies each of the ZFC axioms.

=== Definable relations ===
An ''n''-ary relation ''R'' on the universe ''M'' of a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''definable''' (or '''explicitly definable''', or &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;-'''definable''') if there is a formula φ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that

:&lt;math&gt;R = \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n ) \in M^n : \mathcal{M} \vDash \varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\}.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, ''R'' is definable if and only if there is a formula φ such that

:&lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n ) \in R \Leftrightarrow  \mathcal{M} \vDash \varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
is correct.

An important special case is the definability of specific elements. An element ''m'' of ''M'' is definable in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a formula φ(''x'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\vDash \forall x ( x = m \leftrightarrow \varphi(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

====Definability with parameters====
A relation ''R'' is said to be '''definable with parameters''' (or &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal M|&lt;/math&gt;-'''definable''') if there is a formula φ with parameters from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''R'' is definable using φ.    Every element of a structure is definable using the element itself as a parameter.

It should be noted that some authors use ''definable'' to mean ''definable without parameters'', while other authors mean ''definable with parameters''.  Broadly speaking, the convention that ''definable'' means ''definable without parameters'' is more common amongst set theorists, while the opposite convention is more common amongst model theorists.

====Implicit definability====
Recall from above that an ''n''-ary relation ''R'' on the universe ''M'' of a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is explicitly definable if there is a formula φ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that

:&lt;math&gt;R = \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n ) \in M^n : \mathcal{M} \vDash \varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \}&lt;/math&gt;

Here the formula φ used to define a relation ''R'' must be over the signature of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and so φ may not mention ''R'' itself, since ''R'' is not in the signature of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  If there is a formula φ in the extended language containing the language of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and a new symbol ''R'', and the relation ''R'' is the only relation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \vDash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then ''R'' is said to be '''implicitly definable''' over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

By Beth's theorem, every implicitly definable relation is explicitly definable.

==Many-sorted structures==
Structures as defined above are sometimes called '''{{visible anchor|one-sorted structure}}s''' to distinguish them from the more general '''{{visible anchor|many-sorted structure}}s'''. A many-sorted structure can have an arbitrary number of domains. The '''sorts''' are part of the signature, and they play the role of names for the different domains. [[Signature (logic)#Many-sorted signatures|Many-sorted signatures]] also prescribe on which sorts the functions and relations of a many-sorted structure are defined. Therefore, the arities of function symbols or relation symbols must be more complicated objects such as tuples of sorts rather than natural numbers.

[[Vector space]]s, for example, can be regarded as two-sorted structures in the following way. The two-sorted signature of vector spaces consists of two sorts ''V'' (for vectors) and ''S'' (for scalars) and the following function symbols:

{| style="width:95%"
|-valign="top"
|
* +&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; and ×&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''S'',&amp;nbsp;''S'';&amp;nbsp;''S'').
* −&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''S'';&amp;nbsp;''S'').
* 0&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; and 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''S'').
|
* +&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''V'',&amp;nbsp;''V'';&amp;nbsp;''V'').
* −&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''V'';&amp;nbsp;''V'').
* 0&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; of arity (''V'').
|
* × of arity (''S'',&amp;nbsp;''V'';&amp;nbsp;''V'').
|}

If ''V'' is a vector space over a field ''F'', the corresponding two-sorted structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal V&lt;/math&gt; consists of the vector domain &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal V|_V=V&lt;/math&gt;, the scalar domain &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal V|_S=F&lt;/math&gt;, and the obvious functions, such as the vector zero &lt;math&gt;0_V^{\mathcal V}=0\in|\mathcal V|_V&lt;/math&gt;, the scalar zero &lt;math&gt;0_S^{\mathcal V}=0\in|\mathcal V|_S&lt;/math&gt;, or scalar multiplication &lt;math&gt;\times^{\mathcal V}:|\mathcal V|_S\times|\mathcal V|_V\rightarrow|\mathcal V|_V&lt;/math&gt;.

Many-sorted structures are often used as a convenient tool even when they could be avoided with a little effort. But they are rarely defined in a rigorous way, because it is straightforward and tedious (hence unrewarding) to carry out the generalization explicitly.

In most mathematical endeavours, not much attention is paid to the sorts. A [[many-sorted logic]] however naturally leads to a [[type theory]]. As [[Bart Jacobs]] puts it: "A logic is always a logic over a type theory." This emphasis in turn leads to [[categorical logic]] because a logic over a type theory categorically corresponds to one ("total") category, capturing the logic, being [[fibred category|fibred]] over another ("base") category, capturing the type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Other generalizations==

===Partial algebras===
Both universal algebra and model theory study classes of (structures or) algebras that are defined by a signature and a set of axioms. In the case of model theory these axioms have the form of first-order sentences. The formalism of universal algebra is much more restrictive; essentially it only allows first-order sentences that have the form of universally quantified equations between terms, e.g. {{all}}&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;{{all}}''y''&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''). One consequence is that the choice of a signature is more significant in universal algebra than it is in model theory. For example, the class of groups, in the signature consisting of the binary function symbol × and the constant symbol 1, is an [[elementary class]], but it is not a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]]. Universal algebra solves this problem by adding a unary function symbol &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the case of fields this strategy works only for addition. For multiplication it fails because 0 does not have a multiplicative inverse. An ad hoc attempt to deal with this would be to define 0&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. (This attempt fails, essentially because with this definition 0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is not true.) Therefore, one is naturally led to allow partial functions, i.e., functions that are defined only on a subset of their domain. However, there are several obvious ways to generalize notions such as substructure, homomorphism and identity.

=== Structures for typed languages ===
In [[type theory]], there are many sorts of variables, each of which has a '''type'''. Types are inductively defined; given two types δ and σ there is also a type σ → δ that represents functions from objects of type σ to objects of type δ. A structure for a typed language (in the ordinary first-order semantics) must include a separate set of objects of each type, and for a function type the structure must have complete information about the function represented by each object of that type.

===Higher-order languages===
{{main article|Second-order logic}}
There is more than one possible semantics for [[higher-order logic]], as discussed in the article on [[second-order logic]].  When using full higher-order semantics, a structure need only have a universe for objects of type 0, and the T-schema is extended so that a quantifier over a higher-order type is satisfied by the model if and only if it is disquotationally true.  When using first-order semantics, an additional sort is added for each higher-order type, as in the case of a many sorted first order language.

===Structures that are proper classes===
In the study of [[set theory]] and [[category theory]], it is sometimes useful to consider structures in which the domain of discourse is a [[proper class]] instead of a set. These structures are sometimes called '''class models''' to distinguish them from the "set models" discussed above. When the domain is a proper class, each function and relation symbol may also be represented by a proper class.

In [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', structures were also allowed to have a proper class as their domain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9907">In [[economics]] and [[game theory]], a participant is considered to have '''superrationality''' (or '''renormalized rationality''') if they have [[perfect rationality]] (and thus maximize their own utility) but assume that all other players are superrational too and that a superrational individual will always come up with the same strategy as any other superrational thinker when facing the same problem. Applying this definition, a superrational player playing against a superrational opponent in a [[prisoner's dilemma]] will cooperate while a rationally self-interested player would defect. 

This [[decision rule]] is not a mainstream model within [[game theory]] and was suggested by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his article, series, and book ''[[Metamagical Themas]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|date=June 1983|title=Dilemmas for Superrational Thinkers, Leading Up to a Luring Lottery|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/1985-hofstadter#dilemmas-for-superrational-thinkers-leading-up-to-a-luring-lottery|journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=248|number=6}} – reprinted in: {{Cite book|title=[[Metamagical Themas]]|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|publisher=Basic Books|year=1985|isbn=0-465-04566-9|pages=737–755}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative type of rational [[decision making]] different from the widely accepted [[game-theoretic]] one. Superrationality is a form of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reviews |first=Paul J. |last=Campbell |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=57 |issue=1 |date=January 1984 |pages=51–55 |jstor=2690298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Volunteer's Dilemma |first=Andreas |last=Diekmann |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=29 |issue=4 |date=December 1985 |pages=605–610 |doi=10.1177/0022002785029004003 |jstor=174243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Hofstadter provided this definition: "Superrational thinkers, by recursive definition, include in their calculations the fact that they are in a group of superrational thinkers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Note that contrary to the [[Homo reciprocans]], the superrational thinker will not always play the equilibrium that maximizes the total social utility, and is thus not a [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].

==Prisoner's dilemma==
The idea of superrationality is that two logical thinkers analyzing the same problem will think of the same correct answer. For example, if two people are both good at math and both have been given the same complicated problem to do, both will get the same right answer. In math, knowing that the two answers are going to be the same doesn't change the value of the problem, but in game theory, knowing that the answer will be the same might change the answer itself.

The [[prisoner's dilemma]] is usually framed in terms of jail sentences for criminals, but it can be stated equally well with cash prizes instead. Two players are each given the choice to cooperate (C) or to defect (D). The players choose without knowing what the other is going to do. If both cooperate, each will get $100. If they both defect, they each get $1. If one cooperates and the other defects, then the defecting player gets $200, while the cooperating player gets nothing.

The four outcomes and the payoff to each player are listed below

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Player B cooperates !! Player B defects
|-
! Player A cooperates
| Both get $100|| Player A: $0 &lt;br/&gt;Player B: $200
|-
! Player A defects
| Player A: $200&lt;br/&gt; Player B: $0 || Both get $1
|}

One valid way for the players to reason is as follows:
# Assuming the other player defects, if I cooperate I get nothing and if I defect I get a dollar.
# Assuming the other player cooperates, I get $100 if I cooperate and $200 if I defect.
# So whatever the other player does, my payoff is increased by defecting, if only by one dollar.

The conclusion is that the rational thing to do is to defect. This type of reasoning defines game-theoretic rationality, and two game-theoretic rational players playing this game both defect and receive a dollar each.

Superrationality is an alternative method of reasoning. First, it is assumed that the answer to a symmetric problem will be the same for all the superrational players. Thus the sameness is taken into account ''before'' knowing what the strategy will be. The strategy is found by maximizing the payoff to each player, assuming that they all use the same strategy. Since the superrational player knows that the other superrational player will do the same thing, whatever that might be, there are only two choices for two superrational players. Both will cooperate or both will defect depending on the value of the superrational answer. Thus the two superrational players will both cooperate, since this answer maximizes their payoff. Two superrational players playing this game will each walk away with $100.

Note that a superrational player playing against a game-theoretic rational player will defect, since the strategy only assumes that the superrational players will agree. {{Citation needed span|text=A superrational player playing against a player of uncertain superrationality will sometimes defect and sometimes cooperate, based on the probability of the other player being superrational.|date=September 2013}}

Although standard game theory assumes common knowledge of rationality, it does so in a different way. The game theoretic analysis maximizes payoffs by allowing each player to change strategies independently of the others, even though in the end, it assumes that the answer in a symmetric game will be the same for all. This is the definition of a game theoretic [[Nash equilibrium]], which defines a stable strategy as one where no player can improve the payoffs by unilaterally changing course. The superrational equilibrium in a symmetric game is one where all the players' strategies are forced to be the same before the maximization step. (There is no agreed upon extension of the concept of superrationality to asymmetric games.)

Some argue that superrationality implies a kind of [[magical thinking]] in which each player supposes that their decision to cooperate will cause the other player to cooperate, despite the fact that there is no communication. Hofstadter points out that the concept of "choice" doesn't apply when the player's goal is to figure something out, and that the decision does not cause the other player to cooperate, but rather same logic leads to same answer independent of communication or cause and effect. This debate is over whether it is reasonable for human beings to act in a superrational manner, not over what superrationality means, and is similar to arguments about whether it is reasonable for humans to act in a 'rational' manner, as described by game theory (wherein they can figure out what other players will or have done by asking themselves, what would I do if I was them, and applying [[backwards induction]] and [[iterated elimination of dominated strategies]]).

==Probabilistic strategies==
For simplicity, the foregoing account of superrationality ignored [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]]: the possibility that the best choice could be to flip a coin, or more generally to choose different outcomes with some probability. In the [[prisoner's dilemma]], it is superrational to cooperate with probability 1 even when mixed strategies are admitted, because the average payoff when one player cooperates and the other defects is the same as when both cooperate, and so defecting increases the risk of both defecting, which decreases the expected payout. But in some cases, the superrational strategy is mixed.

For example, if the payoffs in are as follows:

:: CC – $100/$100
:: CD – $0/$1,000,000
:: DC – $1,000,000/$0
:: DD – $1/$1

So that defecting has a huge reward, the superrational strategy is defecting with a probability of 499,900/999,899 or a little over 49.995%. As the reward increases to infinity, the probability only approaches 1/2 further, and the losses for adopting the simpler strategy of 1/2 (which are already minimal) approach 0. In a less extreme example, if the payoff for one cooperator and one defector was $400 and $0, respectively, the superrational mixed strategy world be defecting with probability 100/299 or about 1/3.

In similar situations with more players, using a randomising device can be essential. One example discussed by Hofstadter is the [[platonia dilemma]]: an eccentric trillionaire contacts 20 people, and tells them that if one and only one of them sends him or her a telegram (assumed to cost nothing) by noon the next day, that person will receive a billion dollars. If they receive more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and communication between players is forbidden. In this situation, the superrational thing to do (if it is known that all 20 are superrational) is to send a telegram with probability p=1/20 — that is, each recipient essentially rolls a [[Icosahedron|20-sided die]] and only sends a telegram if it comes up "1".  This maximizes the probability that exactly one telegram is received.

Notice though that this is not the solution in a conventional game-theoretical analysis. Twenty game-theoretically rational players would each send in telegrams and therefore receive nothing. This is because sending telegrams is the [[dominant strategy]]; if an individual player sends telegrams they have a chance of receiving money, but if they send no telegrams they cannot get anything. (If all telegrams were guaranteed to arrive, they would only send one, and no one would expect to get any money.)

'''Svabhava''' ({{lang-sa|svabhāva}}; {{lang-pi|sabhāva}}; {{zh|c=自性|p=zìxìng}}; {{bo|t=རང་བཞིན|w=rang-bzhin}})&lt;ref&gt;Dharma Dictionary (2008). rang bzhin. Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/rang_bzhin] (accessed: January 29, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; literally means "own-being" or "own-becoming". It is the intrinsic nature, essential nature or essence of living beings.

The concept and term ''svabhāva'' are frequently encountered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions such as [[Advaita Vedanta]] (e.g. in the ''[[Avadhuta Gita|Avadhūta Gītā]]''), [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] (e.g. in the ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga]]''), [[Vaishnavism]] (e.g., the writings of [[Ramanuja]]) and [[Dzogchen]] (e.g. in the [[seventeen tantras]]).

In the nondual Advaita Vedānta yoga text, ''Avadhūta Gītā'', [[Brahman]] (in the Upanishadic denotation) is the ''sabhāva''.

In the Mahāyāna Buddhadharma tradition(s) it is one of a suite of terms employed to denote the [[Buddha-nature]], such as "''[[gotra]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, D. Seyfort (1976). 'The Meanings of the Term "Gotra" and the Textual History of the "Ratnagotravibhāga"'. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 39, No. 2 (1976), pp. 341–363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian philosophy==
The term first appears in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], as a possible first cause (''jagatkāraṇa'').&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya, ''Svabhāvavada'' and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview&lt;/ref&gt; There also seems to have been an Indian philosophical position called ''Svabhāvavada'' which was akin to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] which held that "things are as their nature makes them".&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna, Outlines of Indian Philosophy, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible this position was similar to or associated with [[Charvaka|Carvaka]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya, ''Svabhāvavada'' and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samkhya===
In early [[Samkhya]] philosophy, Svabhava was a term which was associated with [[Prakṛti]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson, Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inherent capacity of [[Prakṛti]], which is independent and self caused.&lt;ref&gt;Knut A. Jacobsen, Prakr̥ti in Samkhya-yoga: Material Principle, Religious Experience, Ethical Implications, 1999, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Vaishnavism===
The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (18.41) has nature (''svabhava'') as a distinguishing quality differentiating the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varṇā]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web |url=http://vedabase.net/bg/18/41/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616084818/http://vedabase.net/bg/18/41/ |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }} (accessed: Tuesday April 6, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Overzee (1992: p.&amp;nbsp;74) in her work on [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881–1955) and [[Ramanuja|Rāmānuja]] (1017–1137) highlights Rāmānuja's usage of ''svabhāva'' in relation to Brahman thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us look more closely at what Rāmānuja means by the Lord's "nature". If you read his writings, you will find that he uses two distinct yet related words when referring to the nature of Brahman: ''svarūpa'' and ''svabhāva''.&lt;ref&gt;Overzee, Anne Hunt (1992).

==Buddhism==
In early [[Theravada|Theravādin]] texts, the term "''svabhāva''" did not carry the technical meaning or the soteriological weight of later writings. Much of Mahayana Buddhism (as in the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'') denies that such a ''svabhāva'' exists within any being; however, in the [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]], notably the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', the Buddha states that the immortal and infinite Buddha-nature - or "true self" of the Buddha - is the indestructible ''svabhāva'' of beings.

===Theravāda===
In the [[Pāli Canon]], ''sabhāva'' is absent from what are generally considered to be the earliest texts. When found in later texts (e.g., the [[paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|paracanonical]] ''[[Milinda Panha|Milindapañha]])'', it generically refers to state (of mind), character or truth.

In the post-canonical [[abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] literature, ''sabhāva'' is used to distinguish an irreducible, [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent]], momentary [[dharma|phenomenon]] (''dhamma'') from a conventionally constructed object.  Thus, a collection of visual and tactile phenomena might be mentally constructed into what is conventionally referred to as a "table"; but, beyond its constituent elements, a construct such as "table" lacks intrinsic existence  (''sabhāva'').

According to Peter Harvey, svabhava in the Theravada Abhidhamma is something conditional and interdependent:
{{quote|"They are dhammas because they uphold their own nature [sabhaava]. They are dhammas because they are upheld by conditions or they are upheld according to their own nature" (Asl.39). Here 'own-nature' would mean characteristic nature, which is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma. This is of significance as it makes the Mahayana critique of the Sarvastivadin's notion of own-nature largely irrelevant to the Theravada.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter; INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHISM, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Vaibhāṣika ===
The [[Sarvastivada|Vaibhāṣika]] school held that dharmas have a constant [[essence]] or inherent nature (''svabhāva'') which persists through past, present and future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Westerhoff, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy in the First Millennium CE, 2018, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also identified as a unique mark or own characteristic (''svalaksana'') that differentiated a dharma and remained unchangeable throughout its existence. According to Vaibhāṣikas, ''svabhavas'' are those things that exist substantially (''dravyasat'') as opposed to those things which are made up of aggregations of dharmas and thus only have a nominal existence (''prajñaptisat'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Madhyamaka===
Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;300) in discussing the [[Buddhist logic]] of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], states:
{{quote|''Svabhāva'' is by definition the subject of contradictory ascriptions. If it exists, it must belong to an existent entity, which means that it must be conditioned, dependent on other entities, and possessed of causes. But a ''svabhāva'' is by definition unconditioned, not dependent on other entities, and not caused. Thus the existence of a ''svabhāva'' is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Richard H. (1957). Some Logical Aspects of Nagarjuna's System. ''Philosophy East &amp; West''. Volume 6, no. 4 (October 1957). University of Hawaii Press. Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041127175124/http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |archivedate=2004-11-27 |df= }} (accessed: Saturday March 21, 2009), p.300&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dzogchen===
Dzogchen upholds a view of ''niḥsvabhāva'', refuting ''svabhāva'' using the same logic employed by Madhyamaka, a freedom from extremes demonstrated succinctly via [[Catuṣkoṭi]] [[Tetralemma]]. 
{{quote|As it ([[rigpa]]) transcends awareness and non-awareness, there are not even the imputations of awareness. This is called the Dzogpa Chenpo, free from extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Thondup Rinpoche, Tulku (1989). ''The Practice Of Dzogchen''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion. {{ISBN|1-55939-054-9}}, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the context of logical analysis, Dzogchen agrees with the view of [[Madhyamaka]] as elucidated by [[Nāgārjuna]], Chögyal [[Namkhai Norbu]] explains:

{{quote|...Madhyamaka explains with the four "beyond concepts," which are that something neither exists, nor does not exist, nor both exists and does not exist, nor is beyond both existing and not existing together. These are the four possibilities. What remains? Nothing. Although we are working only in an intellectual way, this can be considered the ultimate conclusion in Madhyamaka. As an analytical method, this is also correct for Dzogchen. Nagarjuna's reasoning is supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Namkhai Norbu, Chögyal (2006). ''Dzogchen Teachings''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion. {{ISBN|1-55939-243-6}}, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Union of the Sun and Moon'' ({{bo|t=ཉི་ཟླ་ཁ་སྦྱོར|w=nyi zla kha sbyor}}), one of the '[[Seventeen tantras]] of the esoteric instruction cycle' ({{bo|t=མན་ངག་སྡེའི་རྒྱུད་བཅུ་བདུན|w=man ngag sde'i rgyud bcu bdun}}) which are a suite of tantras known variously as: [[Nyingtik]], [[Upadesha]] or [[Menngagde]] within [[Dzogchen]] discourse, states:

{{quote|Whoever meditates on the absence of nature [svabhāva]&lt;br&gt;
in objects that are objective appearances&lt;br&gt;
this is the non-duality of appearance and emptiness,&lt;br&gt;
the relaxed unimpeded group of six.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://www.scribd.com/doc/28606591/Union-of-the-Sun-Moon-1-of-the-17-Upadesha-Tantras Union of the Sun and Moon (Wylie: nyi zla kha sbyor)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102145302/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28606591/Union-of-the-Sun-Moon-1-of-the-17-Upadesha-Tantras |date=2012-11-02 }} (accessed: Friday March 19, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;br&gt;

====Bonpo Dzogchen====
''Svabhāva'' is very important in the [[nontheistic]] [[theology]] of the [[Bonpo]] Great Perfection (Dzogchen) tradition where it is part of a technical language to render macrocosm and microcosm into [[nonduality]], as Rossi (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;58) states:
{{quote|The View of the Great Perfection further acknowledges the ontological identity of the macrocosmic and microcosmic realities through the threefold axiom of Condition (ngang), Ultimate Nature (rang bzhin) and Identity (bdag nyid). The Condition (ngang) is the Basis of all (kun gzhi) -- primordially pure (ka dag) and not generated by primary and instrumental causes. It is the origin of all phenomena. The Ultimate Nature (rang bzhin) is said to be unaltered (ma bcos pa), because the Basis [gzhi] is spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub) in terms of its innate potential (rtsal) for manifestation (rol pa). The non-duality between the Ultimate Nature (i.e., the unaltered appearance of all phenomena) and the Condition (i.e., the Basis of all) is called the Identity (bdag nyid). This ''unicum'' of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous accomplishment (lhun grub) is the Way of Being (gnas lugs) of the Pure-and-Perfect-Mind [byang chub (kyi) sems].&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Donatella (1999). ''The Philosophical View of the Great Perfection in the Tibetan Bon Religion''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion. {{ISBN|1-55939-129-4}}, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra====
The term "''svabhāva''" is mentioned in six verses of the first chapter of the ''[[Avadhuta Gita|Avadhūta Gītā]]'': [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse5|1.5]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse6|1.6]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse44|1.44]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse54|1.54]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse58|1.58]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse76|1.76]].

This extreme nondual yoga text shares a lot of common language with the extreme nondual yoga of [[Atiyoga]] (Dzogchen) and its standard Tibetan analogue ''rang-bzhin'' (Wylie) is employed in ''[[The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra]],'' one of the ''[[Seventeen Tantras]]'' of Atiyoga [[Upadesha]].

Dzogchen strictly refutes the notion of "''svabhāva''", and so ''[[The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra]],'' states specifically that [[dharmakāya]] is non-arisen and natureless:

{{quote|...this meaningful supreme wisdom kāya&lt;br&gt;
ultimate, natureless [rang bzhin med], the state of the nonarising dharmakāya,&lt;br&gt;
the lamp of the teachings, the great light of the dharmakāya&lt;br&gt;
manifests to persons who are in accord with the meaning.&lt;ref&gt;'Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long gi rgyud'. Source: [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Kun_tu_bzang_po_thugs_kyi_me_long_gi_rgyud] (accessed: Monday April 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;br&gt;

The following quotation from ''The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra'' is drawn from the [[Lungi Terdzö]]:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Lungi Terdzö (Wylie: ''lung-gi gter-mdzod'') is the prose autocommentary by [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1364 or possibly 1369) to his'' [[Chöying Dzö]]'' (Wylie: ''chos-dbyings mdzod'') -- which are numbered amongst the ''[[Seven Treasuries]]'' (Wylie: ''mdzod chen bdun'').

====Namkhai Norbu====
[[Dzogchen]] teacher [[Namkhai Norbu]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;155) in discussing the view of the [[pratyekabuddha]]s states that:

Note that the [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (2008) equates the Tibetan ''bdag-med'' with ''[[anātman]]'' (Sanskrit) (Dharma Dictionary, 2008, ''bdag med'', retrieved January 29, 2008 from http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/bdag_med).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[mathematics]], the modern [[component-free]] approach to the theory of  a '''tensor''' views a tensor as an [[abstract object]], expressing some definite type of multi-linear concept. Their well-known properties can be derived from their definitions, as linear maps or more generally; and the rules for manipulations of tensors arise as an extension of [[linear algebra]] to [[multilinear algebra]].

In [[differential geometry]] an intrinsic geometric statement may be described by a [[tensor field]] on a [[manifold]], and then doesn't need to make reference to coordinates at all. The same is true in [[general relativity]], of tensor fields describing a [[physical property]]. The component-free approach is also used extensively in [[abstract algebra]] and [[homological algebra]], where tensors arise naturally.

:'''''Note:''' This article assumes an understanding of the [[tensor product]] of [[vector space]]s without chosen [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]]. An overview of the subject can be found in the main [[tensor]] article.''

==Definition via tensor products of vector spaces==

Given a finite set {{nowrap|{ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }{{null}}}} of [[vector space]]s over a common  [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'', one may form their [[Tensor product#Tensor product of vector spaces|tensor product]] {{nowrap|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ... ⊗ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, an element of which is termed a '''tensor'''.

A '''tensor on the vector space''' ''V'' is then defined to be an element of (i.e., a vector in) a vector space of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;V \otimes \cdots \otimes V \otimes V^* \otimes \cdots \otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[dual space]] of ''V''.

If there are ''m'' copies of ''V'' and ''n'' copies of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; in our product, the tensor is said to be of '''{{nowrap|type (''m'', ''n'')}}''' and contravariant of order ''m'' and covariant order ''n'' and total [[tensor order|order]] {{nowrap|''m'' + ''n''}}. The tensors of order zero are just the scalars (elements of the field ''F''), those of contravariant order 1 are the vectors in ''V'', and those of covariant order 1 are the [[linear functional|one-forms]] in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; (for this reason the last two spaces are often called the contravariant and covariant vectors).  The space of all tensors of type {{nowrap|(''m'', ''n'')}} is denoted

:&lt;math&gt; T^m_n(V) = \underbrace{ V\otimes \dots \otimes V}_{m} \otimes \underbrace{ V^*\otimes \dots \otimes V^*}_{n} .&lt;/math&gt;

The type {{nowrap|(1, 1)}} tensors

:&lt;math&gt;V \otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;

are isomorphic in a natural way to the space of [[linear transformations]] from ''V'' to ''V''.  A [[bilinear form]] on a real vector space ''V'', {{nowrap|''V'' × ''V'' → '''R'''}}, corresponds in a natural way to a type {{nowrap|(0, 2)}} tensor in

:&lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V^* .&lt;/math&gt;

An example of such a bilinear form may be defined, termed the associated ''[[metric tensor]]'' (or sometimes misleadingly the ''[[metric (mathematics)|metric]]'' or ''[[inner product]]''), and is usually denoted ''g''.

==Tensor rank==
{{Main|Tensor rank decomposition}}

A '''simple tensor''' (also called a tensor of rank one, elementary tensor or decomposable tensor {{harv|Hackbusch|2012|pp=4}}) is a tensor that can be written as a product of tensors of the form
:&lt;math&gt;T=a\otimes b\otimes\cdots\otimes d&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'', ''b'', ..., ''d'' are nonzero and in ''V'' or ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; – that is, if the tensor is nonzero and completely [[factorization|factorizable]].  Every tensor can be expressed as a sum of simple tensors.  The '''rank of a tensor''' ''T'' is the minimum number of simple tensors that sum to ''T'' {{harv|Bourbaki|1989|loc=II, §7, no. 8}}.

The [[zero tensor]] has rank zero.  A nonzero order 0 or 1 tensor always has rank 1.  The rank of a non-zero order 2 or higher tensor is less than or equal to the product of the dimensions of all but the highest-dimensioned vectors in (a sum of products of) which the tensor can be expressed, which is ''d''{{i sup|''n''−1}} when each product is of ''n'' vectors from a vector space of finite-dimensional vector space of dimension ''d''.

The term ''rank of a tensor'' extends the notion of the [[rank of a matrix]] in linear algebra, although the term is also often used to mean the order (or degree) of a tensor.  The rank of a matrix is the minimum number of column vectors needed to span the [[Row and column spaces|range of the matrix]].  A matrix thus has rank one if it can be written as an [[outer product]] of two nonzero vectors:
:&lt;math&gt; A = v w^{\mathrm{T}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The rank of a matrix ''A'' is the smallest number of such outer products that can be summed to produce it:
:&lt;math&gt;A = v_1w_1^\mathrm{T} + \cdots + v_k w_k^\mathrm{T}.&lt;/math&gt;
In indices, a tensor of rank 1 is a tensor of the form
:&lt;math&gt;T_{ij\dots}^{k\ell\dots}=a_i b_j \cdots c^k d^\ell\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

The rank of a tensor of order 2 agrees with the rank when the tensor is regarded as a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{harv|Halmos|1974|loc=§51}}, and can be determined from [[Gaussian elimination]] for instance.  The rank of an order 3 or higher tensor is however often ''very hard'' to determine, and low rank decompositions of tensors are sometimes of great practical interest {{harv|de Groote|1987}}.  Computational tasks such as the efficient multiplication of matrices and the efficient evaluation of polynomials can be recast as the problem of simultaneously evaluating a set of [[bilinear form]]s
:&lt;math&gt;z_k = \sum_{ij} T_{ijk}x_iy_j\,&lt;/math&gt;
for given inputs ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.  If a low-rank decomposition of the tensor ''T'' is known, then an efficient [[evaluation strategy]] is known {{harv|Knuth|1998|pp=506–508}}.

==Universal property==
The space &lt;math&gt;T^m_n(V)&lt;/math&gt; can be characterized by a [[universal property]] in terms of [[multilinear map]]pings. Amongst the advantages of this approach are that it gives a way to show that many linear mappings are "natural" or "geometric" (in other words are independent of any choice of basis). Explicit computational information can then be written down using bases, and this order of priorities can be more convenient than proving a formula gives rise to a natural mapping. Another aspect is that tensor products are not used only for [[free module]]s, and the "universal" approach carries over more easily to more general situations.

A scalar-valued function on a [[Cartesian product]] (or [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]]) of vector spaces
:&lt;math&gt;f : V_1\times V_2\times\cdots\times V_N \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
is multilinear if it is linear in each argument. The space of all multlinear mappings from the product {{nowrap|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × ... × ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} into ''W'' is denoted
''L''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''V''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;;&amp;nbsp;''W'').  When ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, a multilinear mapping is just an ordinary linear mapping, and the space of all linear mappings from ''V'' to ''W'' is denoted {{nowrap|''L''(''V''; ''W'')}}.

The [[tensor product#Universal property|universal characterization of the tensor product]] implies that, for each multilinear function
:&lt;math&gt;f\in L^{m+n}(\underbrace{V,V,\dots,V}_m,\underbrace{V^*,V^*,\dots,V^*}_n;W)&lt;/math&gt;
there exists a unique linear function
:&lt;math&gt;T_f \in L(V\otimes\cdots\otimes V\otimes V^*\otimes\cdots\otimes V^*; W)&lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt;f(v_1,\dots,v_m,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n) = T_f(v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_m\otimes\alpha_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V'' and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.

Using the universal property, it follows that the space of (''m'',''n'')-tensors admits a [[natural isomorphism]]
:&lt;math&gt;T^m_n(V) \cong
L(V^* \otimes \dots \otimes V^* \otimes V \otimes \dots \otimes V ; \mathbb{R})
\cong L^{m+n}(V^*,\dots,V^*,V,\dots,V;\mathbb{R}).&lt;/math&gt;

In the formula above, the roles of ''V'' and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; are reversed. In particular, one has

:&lt;math&gt;T^1_0(V) \cong L(V^*;\mathbb{R}) \cong V&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;T^0_1(V) \cong L(V;\mathbb{R}) = V^*&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;T^1_1(V) \cong L(V;V).&lt;/math&gt;

==Tensor fields==
{{Main|tensor field}}

[[Differential geometry]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]] must often deal with [[tensor field]]s on [[smooth manifold]]s. The term ''tensor'' is sometimes used as a shorthand for ''tensor field''. A tensor field expresses the concept of a tensor that varies from point to point on the manifold.

A '''terminal countdown demonstration test''' ('''TCDT''') is a simulation of the final hours of a [[launch countdown]] and serves as a practice exercise in which both the launch team and flight crew rehearse launch day timelines and procedures. In the specific case of a TCDT for the [[Space Shuttle]], the test culminated in a simulated ignition and [[RSLS Abort]] (automated shutdown of the orbiter's main engines). Following the simulated abort, the flight crew was briefed on emergency egress procedures and use of the fixed service structure slidewire system.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-lcc.html#sts-tcd | title = NSTS 1988 News Reference Manual | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On some earlier shuttle missions, and Apollo missions, the test would conclude with the flight crew evacuating the launch pad by use of these emergency systems, however this is no longer part of the test.

Unmanned [[carrier rocket]] launches also undergo TCDTs, when countdown procedures are followed. These vary for specific rockets, for example [[solid rocket|solid-fuelled]] rockets would not simulate an engine shutdown, as it is impossible to shut down a solid rocket after it has been lit.

TCDTs typically are carried out a few days before launch.

'''''The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans''''' is a 2010 nonfiction book by U.S. author [[Mark Jacobson]].&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress catalog record http://lccn.loc.gov/2010015455&lt;/ref&gt; It recounts the attempt to ascertain the origin of a [[Lampshades made from human skin|lampshade]] claimed to be made out of human skin.

==Synopsis==
In the aftermath of  [[Hurricane Katrina]], a lampshade, purported to be made from the skin of a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victim, turned up in a sidewalk [[Garage sale|rummage sale]] in [[New Orleans]]. Purchased for $35 by Skip Henderson, the lampshade was sent to his friend Mark Jacobson, a writer living in [[Brooklyn|New York]]. Jacobson embarked on a quest to discover the origin of the lampshade. [[Genetic testing]] initially confirmed it was made from [[human skin]]. However, because of the condition of the tanned skin, there was no way to determine the ethnic origin of the person whose skin was used, or if it was indeed a relic of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;National Public Radio, [https://www.npr.org/2010/12/28/132416206/New-Book-Tells-Story-Of-The-Lampshade New Book Tells Grim Story Of 'The Lampshade'] December 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next few years, Jacobson attempted to track down the origin of and examine the meaning of the lampshade, how it ended up in New Orleans, and to decide what to ultimately do with the gruesome object. Both the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Yad Vashem]] museum in [[Jerusalem]], declined  to take possession of the lampshade,  saying that the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] lampshades made of human skin were probably a "myth".&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Over the course of his investigation, Jacobson examines the history of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], where such objects were reputed to have been made, as well as the racial and post-Katrina history of New Orleans, the world of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], the [[black market]] trafficking in such goods, and the mythology surrounding objects made from human skin.

==Cow skin==
In 2012 the lampshade was subjected to more sophisticated next-generation DNA testing and was found to be most likely cow skin.&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic'' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuqupFyq1o at 38m 30s&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of [[rhetoric]] has been a matter of considerable debate for millennia. Derived from the Greek word for public speaking, rhetoric's original concern dealt primarily with the spoken word. [[Aristotle]] wrote a philosophical work that still has major scholarly impact, ''Rhetoric'', in which he identifies five [[wikt:canons|canons]] of the field of rhetoric: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. Invention is concerned with the content or idea being expressed, and relates to the rhetorician’s understanding of his goals. Arrangement deals with issues of how to best organize an argument in order to attain the speaker or writer’s goals. It is closely related to style, the third element, which relates to gestures, metaphors, and word choices selected to best influence the audience and reach the desired goal. Memory is the fourth and simplest element of rhetoric in being related specifically to spoken rhetoric, specifically concerned with remembering the words in one’s speech.  Finally, delivery concerns tone, word choice, posture and other such bodily signs that influence the effect of one’s words on an audience.

Rhetorical theory is the body of thought about human symbol use. The term rhetoric, in its popular usage,
typically has negative connotations. Rhetoric is contrasted with action; it is empty words, talk without
substance, mere ornament. This contemporary understanding of rhetoric is at odds with a long history of
rhetorical theory, dating back in the West to ancient Greece and Rome, that provides a long-standing foundation
on which the contemporary discipline of communication is built.

From 1870 to 1900, as the American [[college]] system moved from small schools to a larger, diverse set of universities with distinct academic disciplines, the field of [[composition studies]] grew from traditional rhetorical studies. As pioneers in the field of composition studies, [[Harvard University]] enacted a new program in their English department that, for the first time, made “a total commitment to writing,” though the initial focus was on personal writing and did not include rhetoric or literary analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Brereton, John C., ed. “Introduction.” ''The Origins of Composition Studies in the American College, 1875–1925: A Documentary History''. Pittsburgh: U of P Press, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the field of composition studies soon became paired with the field of rhetoric as the modern [[university]] developed, because scholars began to realize that elements of rhetoric and not “systematic grammatical study” were necessary to improve writing and composition abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Winterowd, W. Ross. “Discovery- Invention- Creation.” ''The English Department: A Personal and Institutional History''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1998. 32–74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While rhetoric traditionally concerned matters related to verbal orations or speeches, both rhetoric and composition are related to the expression of ideas, often in an attempt to influence one’s audience. In addition, composition is also concerned with the principles of invention, arrangement, style, and delivery traditionally associated with rhetoric; even memory can become an element of composition when one is writing a speech or a scholarly paper to be delivered orally.  Thus, rhetoric and composition— colloquially termed “rhet/comp” or “comp/rhet”— became a field of its own and remains a burgeoning discipline in universities today.

==Current-traditional rhetoric==

The rhetoric and composition pedagogy developed in the late nineteenth century, and still used in many schools today, is known as current-traditional rhetoric, commonly referred to among field scholars, and hereinafter, as “CTR.” CTR is defined by an emphasis on the final product, usually the five-paragraph, informal essay or short research paper on an objective topic. In addition, CTR centers around the notion that discourse is delivered in a prescribed, mechanical form, leading to its pedagogical focus on grammar, spelling, syntax, and uniform style and arrangement. Further, CTR promotes the idea that the purpose of writing is the product, which is expected to reflect a predefined, stagnant reality without consideration for process, authorial identity, or audience. For example, a CTR pedagogue might instruct his or her students to write an essay on bicycles; the expected outcome is an objective discussion of bicycles organized in a five-paragraph essay, the identity of the audience or the writer is not to be considered, and the goal is the final product—the “essay”— which should have no errors (or even intentional boundary-breakers) in grammar, spelling, or design. James Berlin and Robert Inkster examine typical CTR textbooks and evaluate their limited approach to teaching composition, concluding that CTR limits “discovery procedures,” diminishes the “importance of the writer,” and restricts writer engagement with audience.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, James A., and Robert P. Inkster. “Current-Traditional Rhetoric: Paradigm and Practice.” ''Freshman English News'' 8.3 (1980): 1–14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, W. Ross Winterowd similarly contends that the pedagogy of CTR is dated and ultimately ineffective in his examination of a number of current-traditional textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Winterowd, W. Ross. “Current-Traditional Textbooks: Take in Small Doses and Shake Well Before Using.” ''The English Department: A Personal and Institutional History''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1998. 75–100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

CTR as pedagogy has been almost universally employed by schools since its inception in the late nineteenth century, and until the 1960s, its limitations and ineffectiveness received little criticism. However, the 1966 Dartmouth Conference reflected an influx of new scholarly ideas about composition studies that introduced the ideas of process over product and the notion that teachers should serve as guides in the composition process rather than dictatorial authority figures. Since then, the main elements of composition pedagogy have been defined and explored by countless scholars, and the concepts associated with CTR have been replaced by a wealth of pedagogical approaches to the field of rhetoric and composition. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the field of rhetoric and composition saw a process revolution, fueled by two distinct pedagogies: expressivism, both moderate and radical, and cognitivism.

==Moderate expressivism and radical expressivism==

The composition pedagogy of moderate expressivism is characterized by a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the [[process theory of composition]], a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for fewer grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, Jr., W.E. “The Teaching of Writing as Writing.” ''College English'' 29.2 (1967): 111–16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald. “Teach Writing as a Process Not Product.” ''The Leaflet'' (Fall 1972): 11–14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Hairston, Maxine. “The Winds of Change: Thomas Kuhn and the Revolution in the Teaching of Writing.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 33.1 (1982): 76–88. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Elbow]] reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during the early stages of the writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when.”&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. “Closing My Eyes As I Speak: An Argument for Ignoring Audience.” ''College English'' 49.1 (1987): 50–69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.

Radical expressivism evolved from the pedagogical ideals of moderate expressivism, and its primary difference lies in its focus on group, rather than individual, development and expression. For example, In 1966, Susan Sontag published a collection of essays in which she stresses the importance of Happenings, “a cross between art exhibit and theatrical performance,” in order to facilitate a sense of group identity, community, and engagement with audience through a shared, unique artistic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sontag, Susan. “Happenings: An Art of Radical Juxtaposition.” ''Against Interpretation and Other Essays''. New York: Picador, 2001. 263–74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical expressivists Charles Deemer and William Lutz also suggest that English composition should be taught as and considered a sort of Happening. Deemer locates the problem with the composition course in its lack of subject content and asserts that writing demands inspiration that can be attained from teacher-induced Happenings, as “clear writing and clear thought follow only after clear experiences.”&lt;ref&gt;Deemer, Charles. “English Composition as a Happening.” ''College English'' 29.2 (1967): 121–26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz’ claims are similar to those of Deemer, noting the need for creative inspiration in the classroom, a typically stagnant environment in which he claims nothing creative can be taught; he argues for the employment of Happenings in the English classroom in order to “make the student respond directly to his own experience and not someone else’s.”&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, William D. “Making Freshman English a Happening.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 22.1 (1971): 35–8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Other such pedagogues include [[Marshall McLuhan]], who presents the idea of using hot, engaging media when teaching rather than cold, sterile media in the classroom,&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. “Media Hot and Cold.” ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. Ed. Terrence W. Gordon. Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press, 2003. 22–32. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and Geoffrey Sirc, who promotes an avant-garde approach to composition pedagogy by encouraging students’ exuberant, unpolished expressions in writing. Sirc can almost be considered a “post-social turn” theorist; his 1980s research claims that the traditional classroom space is confining and argues that the language of “Main Street” should be encouraged in student writing, attacking the idea of suitable “academic” writing presented by theorists like [[David Bartholomae]].&lt;ref&gt;Sirc, Geoffrey. “Writing Classroom as A &amp; P Parking Lot.” ''English Composition as a Happening''. Logan: Utah State UP, 2002. 185–235. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in his own English classroom, Sirc employs the study of rap music and its cultural and racial implications; he views rap music as “loaded with language, desire, style, and humanity” and imbued with poetry he describes as “blunt narratives of the human heart,” teaching students about truth, communication, and reality and effectively strengthening their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Sirc, Geoffrey. “Stagolee as Writing Instructor.” ''Enculturation'' 4.2 (2002): n. pag. Web. 24 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://enculturation.gmu.edu/4_2/sirc/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while retaining many of the ideals of individuality and uninhibited expression associated with Moderate Expressivism, the composition pedagogy of radical expressivism is distinguished by its focus on group reality and community experience, belief in the art and inspirational potential of the Happening, and view that popular media can potentially be used as a pedagogical tool.

==Cognitivism==

The pedagogy of cognitivism prevalent in the early 1970s and early 1980s also promotes the idea of process over product, but it is a more scientific approach to composition studies and is opposed to moderate expressivism in many ways. Abstractly speaking, cognitivists believe that thinking exists in the mind apart from language and are concerned with understanding how language—or writing—is developed from mental processes of the mind. Cognitivists are primarily concerned with the goals of a writer, the decisions made during the writing process by the mind. [[Andrea Lunsford]] addresses the importance of understanding the cognitive mental faculties involved during composition, claiming that the best way to facilitate the writing process is through workshops and discussion rather than lecture-based instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Lunsford, Andrea. “Cognitive Development and the Basic Writer.” ''College English'' 41.1 (1979): 38–46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers like cognitivist Sondra Perl conduct extensive studies of the composing process and the stages through which a writer goes in order to better understand how to teach writing.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. “The Composing Process of Unskilled College Writers.” ''Research in the Teaching of English'' 13.4 (1979): 317–36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitivists [[Linda Flower]] and John Hayes see an exigency in composition studies to understand how and why a writer makes the choices they do during the writing process. Their research led them to claim that writing is a non-linear, hierarchal, goal-driven process. In addition, they concentrate their study of composition on the protocol of the writing process, including planning, translating, embedding, and reviewing.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 32.4 (1981): 365–87. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While like expressivists in their greater concern with the process of writing than with the final product, distinguishing them from the essay-driven pedagogy of current-traditional rhetoric, cognitivism proposes a more scientific approach by studying universal cognitive faculties of the mind in order to better understand the composition process.

==Social constructionism==

Unlike cognitivism, [[social constructionism]], or the “social turn” in composition pedagogy, which evolved the 1980s, is distinguished by the belief that language and the mind are inseparable, as an individual needs language in order to even think. Social constructionist theories also promote the idea that writing is inherently political in nature and that writers are each a part of a particular community of dialogue, or discourse community, with an assumed set of principles and a distinct language of its own. Patricia Bizzell directly attacks the early cognitivist contention that writing can be understood as distinct sets of mental processes, criticizing “inner-directed” theorists like Flowers and Hayes for focusing too much on the individual writer’s language and learning processes and overlooking the importance of society and discourse communities in composition; on the other hand, “outer-directed” theorists like Bizzell recognize the extent to which thinking and language are conditioned by the social context and intended audience being addressed by the writer. Writing, Bizzell claims, “takes place within a community,” and in order to improve composition, teachers should “explain what the community’s conventions are."&lt;ref&gt;Bizzell, Patricia. “Cognition, Convention, and Certainty: What We Need to Know about Writing.” ''PRE/TEXT'' 3.3 (1982): 213–43. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionist James Porter notes the “intertextuality” of all writing as interdependent, based on the principle that all speech and writing evolves from presumed meaning and accepted evidence as defined by each “discourse community,” which Porter defines as “a group of individuals bound by a common interest who communicate through approved channels and whose discourse is regulated.”&lt;ref&gt;Porter, James E. “Intertextuality and the Discourse Community.” ''Rhetoric Review'' 5.1 (1986): 34–47. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Harris agrees with Porter, maintaining that writing is community-driven and noting that the purpose in writing is drawn from “being part of some ongoing discourse.” However, Harris qualifies his argument by noting that, while writers act not as isolated individuals but as members of discourse communities with certain language, practices, and beliefs, the notion that academic or other discourse communities are “discursive utopias” existing without conflict is irrational.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Joseph. “The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 40.1 (1989): 11–22. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; David Bartholomae suggests that students must be assimilated to a specialized discourse in order to write; he writes that students “have to invent the university by assembling and mimicking its language,” learning the “requirements of [academic] convention,” and understanding the “history of a discipline” in order to successfully write and communicate within that discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David. “Inventing the University.” ''When a Writer Can’t Write: Studies in Writer’s Block and Other Composing Process Problems''. Ed. Mike Rose. New York: Guilford, 1985. 273–85. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting an existing conflict between academics and writers, Peter Elbow argues that writing students should not be exposed to the dialogic discourse of academia, as it can be intimidating and ineffective; instead, Elbow suggests that students read and study each other’s writings in the early stages of composition, in order to facilitate a sense of monologic freedom by focusing on the students’ own unique voices.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. “Being a Writer vs. Being an Academic: A Conflict in Goals.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 46.1 (1995): 72–83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social turn in composition pedagogy witnessed a move for community ideology and a newfound acknowledgment of the social, economic, and political forces that affect writers and discourse. James Berlin states, “The question of ideology has never been far from discussions of writing instruction in the modern American college,” and he notes that the writing classroom has always been a place for addressing questions pertaining to ideological subject matter such as class, race, economics, and civil rights. He proposes what is known as a social-epistemic model of writing instruction, in which the socially-constructed nature of knowledge and knowing is recognized. Berlin notes that “social epistemic rhetoric views knowledge as an arena of ideological conflict,” and such a writing pedagogy “offers an explicit critique of economic, political, and social arrangements.”&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, James A. “Rhetoric and Ideology in the Writing Class.” ''College English'' 50.5 (1988): 477–93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the social turn in composition pedagogy represented a move for increased recognition of rhetorical discourse communities, the social, cultural, and political forces that influence the classroom, and the ways that ideology affects writers and the writing classroom.

==Critical pedagogy==

Critical pedagogy was the next phase of pedagogical development in the field of composition studies, and its ideas evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Lisa Delpit explores the way that power works in the classroom, shaped by varied socioeconomic and cultural conditions of students and teachers, results in alienation and miscommunication in the classroom that she terms the “silenced dialogue." Delpit names five specific aspects of the current ‘culture of power’ that defines the conflicting power dynamic in the classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Delpit, Lisa D. “The Silenced Dialogue: Power and Pedagogy in Educating Other People’s Children.” ''Harvard Educational Review'' 58.3 (1998): 280–98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Paulo Freire criticizes the oppressive nature of education and the current educational system’s use of the “banking model” approach to teaching, wherein students serve as depositories for information provided to them by the teacher. While Delpit suggests that the oppressed should be provided with the necessary skills to enable them to enter the culture of power, Freire demands a transformation of the culture of power through revolutionary, practical literary training. Furthermore, Freire posits that human beings are situated in certain temporal and spatial conditions that define who they are, either oppressor or oppressed, and he suggests that dialogue defines humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Freire, Paulo. ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum Books, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Elizabeth Ellsworth discusses the oppressive myths that perpetuate power dynamics in the classroom, including racism on campuses. She calls for a new critical pedagogy “of the unknowable,” suggesting a need to recognize the absence of universal notions of dialogue, rationality, or knowledge, and instead openly acknowledge the many differing social groups and discourse communities in every classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, Elizabeth. ‘Why Doesn’t This Feel Empowering?: Working Through the Repressive Myths of Critical Pedagogy.” ''Harvard Educational Review'' 59.3 (1989): 297–324. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, critical pedagogy can be seen as/in an activist pedagogy, taking into account political inequalities and empowering students to take action through their writing.

==Post-structuralism==

The pedagogy of post-structuralism is marked by an attempt to redefine rhetoric as it relates to composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader with new ideas that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing can be seen as a metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as writing is a performative and not authoritative act.&lt;ref&gt;Vitanza, Victor J. “Abandoned to Writing: Notes Toward Several Provocations.” ''Enculturation'' 5.1 (2003): n. pag. Web. 14 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://enculturation.gmu.edu/5_1/vitanza.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery by identifying the available means of persuasion in making one’s argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as it changes the society in which it is engaged; she attests that rhetoric is the art of giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Sharon. “Composition is not Rhetoric.” ''Enculturation'' 5.1 (2003): n. pag. Web. 14 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://enculturation.gmu.edu/5_1/crowley.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==

The fields of composition and rhetoric remain in flux, as scholars continue to debate regarding appropriate pedagogical methods and the best approach to teaching the art of writing. Since the post-structuralism movement in composition pedagogy, there has been an explosion of discussion in the field of composition pedagogy. More recent ideas in composition pedagogy include the notion of rhetoric’s relationship to travel, on which pedagogues such as Gregory Clark&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Gregory “Writing as Travel, or Rhetoric on the Road.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 49.1 (1998): 9–23. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nedra Reynolds&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nedra. “Who’s Going to Cross this Border? Travel Metaphors, Material Conditions, and Contested Places.” ''JAC'' 20.3 (2000): 541–64. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; have written. In addition, composition studies is an umbrella term for the considerations of writing pedagogy. In its academic application, it is post-modern or post-structural, working both outside and within other academic disciplines.  The national [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] (CCCC) is a national professional association of writing instructors in the United States, the largest organization dedicated to writing research, theory, and teaching pedagogy worldwide. At the annual CCCC convention, pedagogues from around the country deliver their recent research and theories to colleagues. While the goals, methods, and desired results in composition studies are debated and continue to evolve, the importance of writing to the field of education has been indisputably recognized.

[[Image:UnCoupdeDes-cover.jpg|thumb|240px|''Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard'', 1969]]
'''''Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard''''' (''A Throw of the Dice will Never Abolish Chance'') is an [[artist's book]] by [[Marcel Broodthaers]] published November 1969 in [[Antwerp]]. The work is a close copy of the first edition of the French [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist]] poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Stéphane Mallarmé's]] [[Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (Mallarmé)|poem of the same name]], published in 1914, but with all the words removed, replaced by black stripes that correspond directly to the typographic layout used by Mallarmé to articulate the text.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Broodthaers reduces ''Un Coup de Dés'' to its structure - or to put it another way he elevates the structure of the work to a concept worthy of study in its own right, thus acknowledging Mallarmé's own fetishistic attention to this aspect of his work. Rendering the structure concrete, visible, almost tactile, Broodthaers offers a conceptual analysis of Mallarmé's poem across the distance of a nearly a century...It would be hard to imagine a more subtle treatment of Mallarmé's work, or one more capable of demonstrating its essential properties, than this reworked book by Broodthaers. — Johanna Drucker&lt;ref&gt;The Century of Artists' Books, Drucker, Granary, 1995, p115-116&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Often included in exhibitions tracing the history of the artist's book,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforbookarts.org/exhibits/archive/bio.asp?artistID=523 Center for Book Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miami [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2479/is_2_31/ai_113650849 Miami Art Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the work is seen as a seminal example of the European post-avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundation.generali.at/index.php?id=336&amp;L=1 Generali Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often referred to simply as ''Un Coup de Dés''.

== Concrete Poetry ==

=== Mallarmé and Magritte ===
Broodthaers had lived in poverty as a poet in Brussels for twenty years before becoming an artist in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers essay by Michael Compton&lt;/ref&gt; His first exhibition, at the Galere Saint-Laurent, included two unsold parcels of his fourth book of poetry, ''Pense-Bête'', encased in plaster. This was the first of many works that 'employed techniques associated with poetry but applied by him not only to words but to images and symbols.'&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers essay by Michael Compton&lt;/ref&gt; ''Un Coup de Dés'' would become the most famous instance of Broodthaers' interest in setting up a contradiction between the written word and a visual image 'to the profit of the subject.'&lt;ref&gt;Broodthaers quoted in Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p15&lt;/ref&gt;

Broodthaers had been given a copy of Mallarmé's ''Un Coup de Dés'' in 1945 by the Belgian surrealist painter [[Réné Magritte]] as 'a way of explaining his art to a young admirer without explaining it literally.'&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As for the idea of establishing a direct relationship between literature and the plastic arts, I'm afraid I have done so by taking as a subject ''A Throw Of The Dice'', by Mallarmé !!! — Broodthaers&lt;ref&gt;"Quant à l'idée d'établir un rapport direct entre littérature et arts plastique j'ai peur l'avoir fait en prenant comme sujet Le Coup de Dès, de Mallarmé !!!" letter quoted in Marcel Broodthaers, Catalogue des Livres, 1957-75, Galerie Michael Werner, Köln 1982, p27&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mallarmé had written the poem in 1897 and left copious notes as to how it should be typeset, instructions that were finally carried out 16 years after his death, in 1914. The poem was famous for its extraordinary typography, which anticipated the 20th century interest in [[graphic design]] and [[concrete poetry]]. Mallarmé was known to have organised the layout of the poem using rectangles of card, and to leave written pleas to publish the work exactly as he'd intended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vispoets.com/index.php?showtopic=16889]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Broodthaers' work can be seen as a direct quote of Mallarmé's working methods and of his obsession with the visual layout of the text.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mallarmé is the source of all contemporary art... it unconsciously invents modern space. — Broodthaers, 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barcelona2004.org/eng/actualidad/noticias/html/f042384.htm Quoted in Forum, Barcelona]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Literary Exhibition ===
[[Image:UnCoupDeDes-Broodthaers2.jpg|left|300px|thumb|''Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard'', an inner spread]]
Broodthaers' exhibition 'Exposition Littéraire autour de Mallarmé' at the Wide White Space Gallery, Antwerp, December 1969 consisted of a copy of Mallarmé's book 'opened so that, (as nearly always when a book is put in an exhibition) only two pages were visible. The meaning is there but cannot be entirely reached.'&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p12&lt;/ref&gt; A series of metal plates, made of [[Anodised#Anodized_aluminium|anodised aluminium]], engraved with black impressions standing in for the text, were hung on the wall whilst a recording of Broodthaers reciting the poem was played continuously for the duration of the exhibition. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word was "there", more "real", because three dimensional, than the original pages but, of course, negative and illegible. Meanwhile, the tape-recorded voice of the artist read out the poem repeatedly, it was "there" but not simultaneously and continuously present like the words of the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p12&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The book ===
After a brief introduction citing the original edition published in 1914 by Librairie Gallimard, the book starts with the entire poem written as a block of text which is rectangular if the type of Mallarme's poem is 'regular' and oblique if the type from Mallarme is italic. 12 double spreads follow, with immaculately laid out black shapes standing in for the text. The work is soft bound and feels quite insubstantial. The cover is a near-perfect facsimile of the original cover, but with the word 'image' replacing 'poem' in the centre of the design.

The edition was published in Antwerp to coincide with the exhibition on 25 November 1969. 10 copies of the work - unbound, numbered I-X, printed onto 12 aluminium sheets - were made available, along with 90 copies printed on translucent paper and 300 copies on normal paper. The translucent edition came with two sheets of white card cut to the size of the book so that individual pages could be isolated by the reader if they so wished.

=== Reception of the book ===
The book, like Broodthaers' work in general, has gradually grown in stature since his death in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers&lt;/ref&gt; and has found its way into a number of important collections, including [[MOMA]], [[V&amp;A]], and the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp]].
It also has inspired other reworks, like this one by Michalis Pichler: "In Michalis Pichlers’ 2008 rework the blocks are cut out, creating a negative space and geometric pattern of cuts and absence. (...) The idea of remake and of version, using another existing work as point of departure, relieves the artist of the onus of originality while allowing the new gesture to stand as a novel gesture. Un-originality, anti-expressiveness – these are terms that are of more recent vintage than first generation conceptualism." &lt;ref&gt;Johanna Drucker, "Artists’ Books and Conceptualism(s)" in "MULTIPLE, LIMITED, UNIQUE", The Center for Book Arts, New York 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16903">'''Urban metabolism''' is a [[scientific modelling|model]] to facilitate the description and analysis of the [[material flow|flows of the materials]] and [[energy transfer|energy]] within [[cities]], such as undertaken in a [[material flow analysis]] of a city. It provides researchers with a metaphorical framework to study the interactions of natural and human systems in specific regions.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"&gt;Pincetl, S., Bunje, P., &amp; Holmes, T. (2012). An expanded urban metabolism method: Toward a systems approach for assessing urban energy processes and causes. Landscape and Urban Planning, 193-202.&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, researchers have tweaked and altered the parameters of the urban metabolism model. C. Kennedy and fellow researchers have produced a clear definition in the 2007 paper ''The Changing Metabolism of Cities'' claiming that urban metabolism is "the sum total of the technical and socio-economic process that occur in cities, resulting in growth, production of energy and elimination of waste."&lt;ref name= "kennedy1"&gt;Kennedy, C., Cuddihy, J., &amp; Engel-Yan, J. (2007). The changing metabolism of cities. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 11(2), 43-59.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing concern of [[climate change]] and [[atmospheric degradation]], the use of the urban metabolism model has become a key element in determining and maintaining levels of [[sustainability]]  and health in cities around the world. Urban metabolism provides a unified or [[holistic]] viewpoint to encompass all of the activities of a city in a single model.

==History==

With deep roots in [[sociology]], [[Karl Marx]] and fellow researcher [[Friedrich Engels]] may have been the first to raise concerns around issues which we would now call urban metabolism.  Marx and Engels concentrated on the social organization of the harvesting of the Earth's materials by “ analysing the dynamic internal relationships between humans and nature.”&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; Marx used the metaphor of metabolism to refer to the actual metabolic interactions that take place through humans’ exertion of physical labour to cultivate the Earth for sustenance and shelter (M. Fischer-Kowalski, 1998). In short, Marx and Engels found that when humans exerted such physical labour they ultimately altered the biophysical processes as well. This acknowledgement of altering the biophysical landscape is the first stepping stone for the creation of urban metabolism within [[social geography]]. They also used metabolism to describe the material and energy exchange between nature and society in as a critique of industrialization (1883)which created an interdependent set of societal needs brought into play through the concrete organization of human labour. Marx advocated that urban metabolism becomes a power in itself (like capitalism), and will control society unless society is able to control it.

Later, in reaction against industrialization and coal use, [[Patrick Geddes|Sir Patrick Geddes]], a Scottish biologist, undertook an ecological critique of urbanization in 1885, making him the first scientist to attempt an [[empirical]] description of societal metabolism on a macroeconomic scale.&lt;ref name= "mcdonald"&gt;McDonald, G. W., &amp; Patterson, M. G. (2007). Bridging the divide in urban sustainability: From human exemptionalism to the new ecological paradigm.Urban Ecosyst, 10, 169-192&lt;/ref&gt; Through his experimental study of [[urbanization]] he established a physical budget for urban energy and material throughput by way of an input output table.&lt;ref name= "fischer"&gt;Fischer-Kowalski, M. (1998). Society’s metabolism the intellectual history of materials flow analysis, part I, I 860- I 970. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 2(1), 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

:“Geddes’ table consisted of the sources of energy and materials transformed into products in three stages: (1) extraction of fuels and raw materials; (2) the manufacture and transport; and (3) exchange. The table also included intermediary products used for manufacture or transport of the final products; calculation of energy losses between each of the three stages; and the resultant final product; which was often surprisingly small, in material terms, compared with its overall material inputs.”&lt;ref name= "mcdonald"/&gt;

It wasn't until 1965 when [[Abel Wolman]] fully developed and used the term urban metabolism in his work, “The Metabolism of Cities” which he developed in response to deteriorating air and water qualities in American cities.&lt;ref name= "kennedy1"/&gt; In this study Wolman developed a model which allowed him to determine the inflow and outflow rates of a hypothetical American City with a population of 1 million people. &lt;ref =name “deck”&gt;Decker, E., Elliot, S., Smith, F., Blake, D., &amp; Rowland, F. S. (2000). Energy and material flow through the urban ecosystem. Energy Environment, 25, 685-740.&lt;/ref&gt; The model allows the monitoring and documentation of natural resources used (mainly water) and the consequential creation and out-put of waste.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"&gt;Kennedy, C., Pincetl, S., &amp; Bunje, P. (2011). The study of urban metabolism and its applications to urban planning and design. Environmental Pollution,159, 1965-1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolman’s study highlighted the fact that there are physical limitations to the natural resources we use on a day-to-day basis and with frequent use, the compilation of waste can and will create problems. It also helped focus researchers and professionals of their time to focus their attention on the system wide impacts of consumption of goods and sequential production of waste within the urban environment.&lt;ref name= "d"&gt;Wachsmuth, D. (2012). Three ecologies: Urban metabolism and the society-nature opposition. The Sociological Quarterly, (53), 506-523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working off of Wolman’s pioneering work in the 60’s, environmentalist [[Herbert Girardet]] (1996) began to see and document his findings in the connection between urban metabolism and sustainable cities.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Girardet laid the foundation for the [[industrial ecology]] approach to urban metabolism in which it is seen as the “conversion of nature into society.”&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt; Aside from being a great advocate and populariser for urban metabolism, Girardet significantly coined and drew the difference between a ‘circular’ and ‘linear’ metabolism.&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt;  In a circular cycle, there is nearly no waste and almost everything is re-used. Girardet characterizes this as a natural world process.  On the other hand, a ‘linear’ metabolism which is characterized as an urban world process has a clear resource in-put and waste out-put. Girardet emphasizes that the accelerated use of linear metabolisms in urban environments is creating an impending global crisis as cities grow.

More recently the metabolism frame of reference has been used in the reporting of environmental information in Australia where researchers such as Newman have begun to link urban metabolic measures to and it has been suggested that it can be used to define the sustainability of a city within the ecosystems capacity that can support it.&lt;ref name= "newman"&gt;Newman, P. (1999). Sustainability and cities: Extending the metabolism model. Landscape and Urban Planning, (44), 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt;  This research has stayed mainly at a descriptive level and did not reach into the political or social forces of urban form and stages of flow.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; From this research there has been a strong theme in present literature on urban sustainability is that of the need to view the urban system as a whole if we are to best understand and solve the complex problems.&lt;ref name= "deck"&gt;Decker, E., Elliot, S., Smith, F., Blake, D., &amp; Rowland, F. S. (2000). Energy and material flow through the urban ecosystem. Energy Environment, 25, 685-740.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two main schools of approach==

===The energy method===
[[File:Energy Systems Symbols H.gif|thumbnail]]
{{Main article|Emergy}}

Developed in 1970’s [[Howard T. Odum]], a [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]], wanted to emphasize the dependence on the source of almost all energy on the planet: the sun.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Odum believed that previous research and development on urban metabolism was missing and did not account for qualitative differences of [[mass]] or [[energy transfer|energy flows]]. Odum’s study took this into count and he coined the term "energy" to track and account for the metabolic flows by measuring the [[solar energy]] used directly or indirectly to make a product or deliver a service. This method also emphasizes the use of a standard unit of measurement to calculate energy, nutrient and waste movement in the biophysical system; the unit chosen was "solar energy joules". At first glance, the notion to use standard units seems like a beneficial idea for calculating and comparing figures; in reality the ability to convert all urban processes into solar energy joules has proven to be a difficult feat, and difficult to understand.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt;

=== Material flow analysis ===
[[File:MFASystem 1.png|thumbnail]]
{{Main article|Material flow analysis}}

Currently, the Urban Metabolism (UM) approach, as deducted from international literature, has been applied several times to assess and describe urban flows and impacts related to them, using different tools such as Material Flow Analysis (MFA) (Ioppolo et al., 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo, Giuseppe; Reinout Heijungs, Stefano Cucurachi, Roberta Salomone, and René Kleijn, 2014. Urban Metabolism: Many Open Questions for Future Answers. Pp 23-32 in ''Pathways to Environmental Sustainability'', eds. Roberta Salomone and Giuseppe Saija. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The MFA, researched by Baccinni and Brunner in the 1990s, "measures the materials flowing into a system, the stocks and flows within it, and the resulting outputs from the system to other systems in the form of pollution, waste, or exports."&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; Much like Wolmans case model for a hypothetical American City, this method  is based on the concept that the mass of the resources used will equal the mass "plus" stock changes out.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; The MFA technique has become the mainstream school of urban metabolism because it uses more practical units that the public, workers, government officials and researchers can understand.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt;

== Applications ==
There are four main uses of urban metabolism that are used today by urban planners and designers; sustainability reporting, urban [[greenhouse gas accounting]], mathematical modelling for policy analysis and urban design.

===Sustainability indicators===
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumbnail]]

With the issue of sustainability at the core of many environmental issues today, one of the main uses of Urban Metabolism in the modern era is to track and record levels of sustainability in cities and regions around the world. Urban metabolism collects important and very useful information about [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[material cycling]], [[waste management]] and [[urban infrastructure|infrastructure]] in urban environments. The urban metabolism model records and analyzes environmental conditions and trends which are easily understood for policy makers and consequently comparable over time&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; making it easier to find unhealthy patterns and develop a plan of action to better the level of sustainability.

===Greenhouse gas accounting===
[[File:Greenhouse Effect.svg|thumbnail]]

Staying in line with the notion of sustainability, urban metabolism is also a helpful tool for tracking [[greenhouse gas]] emissions on a city or regional level. As mentioned above, with the proliferation of linear metabolisms such as cars, the production of greenhouse gases has increased exponentially since the birth and mass production of the automobile causing a problem for our atmosphere.&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt; Urban metabolism has been proven to be a necessary tool for measuring levels of greenhouse gas because it is an out-put or waste product that is produced through human consumption. The model provides quantifiable parameters which allow officials to mark unhealthy levels of GHG emissions and again, develop a plan of action to lower them.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt;

===Mathematical models===

Aside from the two accounting applications above, urban metabolism has begun to develop mathematical models to quantify and predict levels of particles and nutrients within the urban metabolism model. Such models have mostly been created and used by MFA scholars and are helpful in determining present and future sub-processes and material stocks and flows within the urban environment &lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; With the ability to predict future levels, these mathematical models allow progress to be made and possible pollution prevention programs to be instated rather than end-of-the-pipe solutions which have been favoured in the past.&lt;ref name= "ep"&gt;Cleaner production versus end-of-pipe. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.centric.at/services/cleaner-production/cleaner-production-versus-end-of-pipe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design tools===

Through utilization of the 3 applications above, scholars and professionals are able to use urban metabolism as a design tool to create greener and more sustainable infrastructure from the beginning. By tracing flows of energy, materials and waste through urban systems as a whole, changes and alterations can be made to close the loops to create circular metabolisms where resources are recycled and almost no waste is produced.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Such initiatives are being made around the world with technology and inventions which make building green that much easier and accessible.

:Uses of the model are however not restricted to strictly functional analysis, as the model has been adapted to examine the relational aspects of urban relationships between infrastructure and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Gandy, M. (2004). ''Rethinking urban metabolism: Water, space and the modern city. City'', http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/people/academics/matthew-gandy/files/pdf2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13281">In [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a top-dimensional form (i.e., a [[differential form]] of top degree).   Thus on a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'', a volume form is an ''n''-form, a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[line bundle]] {{nowrap|1=Ω&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') = &amp;#x22C0;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M'')}}.  A manifold admits a nowhere vanishing volume form if and only if it is orientable. An [[orientable manifold]] has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]].

A volume form provides a means to define the [[integral]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on a differentiable manifold.  In other words, a volume form gives rise to a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] with respect to which functions can be integrated by the appropriate [[Lebesgue integral]].  The absolute value of a volume form is a [[volume element]], which is also known variously as a ''twisted volume form'' or ''pseudo-volume form''.  It also defines a measure, but exists on any differentiable manifold, orientable or not.

[[Kähler manifold]]s, being [[complex manifold]]s, are naturally oriented, and so possess a volume form.  More generally, the ''n''th [[exterior power]] of the symplectic form on a [[symplectic manifold]] is a volume form. Many classes of manifolds have canonical volume forms: they have extra structure which allows the choice of a preferred volume form.  Oriented [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s have an associated canonical volume form.

== Orientation ==
A manifold is [[orientable]] if it has a [[coordinate atlas]] all of whose transition functions have positive [[Jacobian determinant]]s.  A selection of a maximal such atlas is an orientation on ''M''.  A volume form ''ω'' on ''M'' gives rise to an orientation in a natural way as the atlas of coordinate charts on ''M'' that send ''ω'' to a positive multiple of the Euclidean volume form &lt;math&gt;dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;.

A volume form also allows for the specification of a preferred class of [[moving frame|frames]] on ''M''. Call a basis of tangent vectors (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) right-handed if

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n) &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The collection of all right-handed frames is [[group action|acted upon]] by the [[group (mathematics)|group]] GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') of [[general linear group|general linear]] mappings in ''n'' dimensions with positive determinant.  They form a [[principal bundle|principal GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') sub-bundle]] of the [[linear frame bundle]] of ''M'', and so the orientation associated to a volume form gives a canonical reduction of the frame bundle of ''M'' to a sub-bundle with structure group GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'').  That is to say that a volume form gives rise to [[G-structure|GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')-structure]] on ''M''.  More reduction is clearly possible by considering frames that have

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\omega(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Thus a volume form gives rise to an SL(''n'')-structure as well.  Conversely, given an SL(''n'')-structure, one can recover a volume form by imposing ({{EquationNote|1}}) for the special linear frames and then solving for the required ''n''-form ''ω'' by requiring homogeneity in its arguments.

A manifold is orientable if and only if it has a volume form.  Indeed, {{nowrap|SL(''n'') → GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')}} is a [[deformation retract]] since {{nowrap|1=GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = SL × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the [[positive reals]] are embedded as scalar matrices.  Thus every GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')-structure is reducible to an SL(''n'')-structure, and GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'')-structures coincide with orientations on ''M''.  More concretely, triviality of the determinant bundle &lt;math&gt;\Omega^n(M)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to orientability, and a line bundle is trivial if and only if it has a nowhere-vanishing section. Thus the existence of a volume form is equivalent to orientability.

== Relation to measures ==
{{See also|Density on a manifold}}
Given a volume form ''ω'' on an oriented manifold, the [[density on a manifold|density]] {{abs|''ω''}} is a volume [[pseudotensor|pseudo-form]] on the nonoriented manifold obtained by forgetting the orientation. Densities may also be defined more generally on non-orientable manifolds.

Any volume pseudo-form ''ω'' (and therefore also any volume form) defines a measure on the [[Borel set]]s by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\omega(U)=\int_U\omega .&lt;/math&gt;

The difference is that while a measure can be integrated over a (Borel) ''subset'', a volume form can only be integrated over an ''oriented'' cell. In single variable [[calculus]], writing &lt;math&gt;\int_b^a f\,dx = -\int_a^b f\,dx&lt;/math&gt; considers &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; as a volume form, not simply a measure, and &lt;math&gt;\int_b^a&lt;/math&gt; indicates "integrate over the cell &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; with the opposite orientation, sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;\overline{[a,b]}&lt;/math&gt;".

Further, general measures need not be continuous or smooth: they need not be defined by a volume form, or more formally, their [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] with respect to a given volume form need not be [[absolutely continuous]].

==Divergence==
Given a volume form ''ω'' on ''M'', one can define the [[divergence]] of a [[vector field]] ''X'' as the unique scalar-valued function, denoted by div&amp;nbsp;''X'', satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{div} X)\omega = L_X\omega = d(X\;\lrcorner\;\omega) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[Lie derivative]] along ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;X\;\lrcorner\;\omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[interior product]] or the left [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of ''ω'' along ''X''. If ''X'' is a [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector field and ''M'' is a [[manifold with boundary]], then [[Stokes' theorem]] implies

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M (\operatorname{div} X)\omega = \int_{\partial M} X\;\lrcorner\;\omega,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a generalization of the [[divergence theorem]].

The [[solenoidal]] vector fields are those with {{nowrap|1=div ''X'' = 0}}.  It follows from the definition of the Lie derivative that the volume form is preserved under the [[vector flow|flow]] of a solenoidal vector field.  Thus solenoidal vector fields are precisely those that have volume-preserving flows.  This fact is well-known, for instance, in [[fluid mechanics]] where the divergence of a velocity field measures the compressibility of a fluid, which in turn represents the extent to which volume is preserved along flows of the fluid.

==Special cases==

=== Lie groups ===

For any [[Lie group]], a natural volume form may be defined by translation.  That is, if ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;{\textstyle\bigwedge}^n T_e^*G&lt;/math&gt;, then a left-invariant form may be defined by &lt;math&gt;\omega_g=L_{g^{-1}}^*\omega_e&lt;/math&gt;, where ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is left-translation.  As a corollary, every Lie group is orientable.  This volume form is unique up to a scalar, and the corresponding measure is known as the [[Haar measure]].

=== Symplectic manifolds ===

Any [[symplectic manifold]] (or indeed any [[almost symplectic manifold]]) has a natural volume form.  If ''M'' is a 2''n''-dimensional manifold with [[symplectic form]] ''ω'', then ''ω''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is nowhere zero as a consequence of the [[nondegeneracy]] of the symplectic form.  As a corollary, any symplectic manifold is orientable (indeed, oriented).  If the manifold is both symplectic and Riemannian, then the two volume forms agree if the manifold is [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]].

=== Riemannian volume form ===

Any [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] (including [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{|g|} dx^1\wedge \dots \wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;dx^i&lt;/math&gt; are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.  Here, &lt;math&gt;|g|&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.

The volume form is denoted variously by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \mathrm{vol}_n = \varepsilon = {\star}(1) .&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the {{math|⋆}} is the [[Hodge star]], thus the last form, {{math|⋆(1)}}, emphasizes that the volume form is the Hodge dual of the constant map on the manifold, which equals the [[Levi-Civita tensor|Levi-Civita ''tensor'']] ''ε''.

Although the Greek letter ''ω'' is frequently used to denote the volume form, this notation is not universal; the symbol ''ω'' often carries many other meanings in [[differential geometry]] (such as a symplectic form).

==Invariants of a volume form==
Volume forms are not unique; they form a [[torsor]] over non-vanishing functions on the manifold, as follows. Given a non-vanishing function ''f'' on ''M'', and a volume form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;f\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a volume form on ''M''. Conversely, given two volume forms &lt;math&gt;\omega, \omega'&lt;/math&gt;, their ratio is a non-vanishing function (positive if they define the same orientation, negative if they define opposite orientations).

In coordinates, they are both simply a non-zero function times [[Lebesgue measure]], and their ratio is the ratio of the functions, which is independent of choice of coordinates. Intrinsically, it is the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem#Radon.E2.80.93Nikodym derivative|Radon–Nikodym derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.  On an oriented manifold, the proportionality of any two volume forms can be thought of as a geometric form of the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]].

===No local structure===
A volume form on a manifold has no local structure in the sense that it is not possible on small open sets to distinguish between the given volume form and the volume form on Euclidean space {{harv|Kobayashi|1972}}.  That is, for every point ''p'' in ''M'', there is an open neighborhood ''U'' of ''p'' and a [[diffeomorphism]] ''&amp;phi;'' of ''U'' onto an open set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that the volume form on ''U'' is the [[pullback]] of &lt;math&gt;dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt; along ''&amp;phi;''.

As a corollary, if ''M'' and ''N'' are two manifolds, each with volume forms &lt;math&gt;\omega_M, \omega_N&lt;/math&gt;, then for any points &lt;math&gt;m\in M, n\in N&lt;/math&gt;, there are open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''m'' and ''V'' of ''n'' and a map &lt;math&gt;f\colon U \to V&lt;/math&gt; such that the volume form on ''N'' restricted to the neighborhood ''V'' pulls back to volume form on ''M'' restricted to the neighborhood ''U'': &lt;math&gt;f^*\omega_N\vert_V = \omega_M\vert_U&lt;/math&gt;.

In one dimension, one can prove it thus:
given a volume form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) := \int_0^x \omega.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the standard [[Lebesgue measure]] &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pulls back]] to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; under ''f'': &lt;math&gt;\omega = f^*dx&lt;/math&gt;. Concretely, &lt;math&gt;\omega = f'\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  In higher dimensions, given any point &lt;math&gt;m \in M&lt;/math&gt;, it has a neighborhood locally homeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and one can apply the same procedure.

===Global structure: volume===
A volume form on a connected manifold ''M'' has a single global invariant, namely the (overall) volume (denoted &lt;math&gt;\mu(M)&lt;/math&gt;), which is invariant under volume-form preserving maps; this may be infinite, such as for Lebesgue measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. On a disconnected manifold, the volume of each connected component is the invariant.

In symbols, if &lt;math&gt;f\colon M \to N&lt;/math&gt; is a homeomorphism of manifolds that pulls back &lt;math&gt;\omega_N&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\omega_M&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt;\mu(N)=\int_N \omega_N = \int_{f(M)} \omega_N = \int_M f^*\omega_N = \int_M \omega_M=\mu(M)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the manifolds have the same volume.

Volume forms can also be pulled back under [[covering map]]s, in which case they multiply volume by the cardinality of the fiber (formally, by integration along the fiber). In the case of an infinite sheeted cover (such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} \to S^1&lt;/math&gt;), a volume form on a finite volume manifold pulls back to a volume form on an infinite volume manifold.

The '''Worker Student Alliance''' (WSA) in the [[United States]] was the section of [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] led by the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]]. The WSA argued that the best way to build a movement in the [[working class]], like SDS wanted, was for students to become involved in workers' struggles both on and off the campuses. In practice, that usually meant students enrolled in school would get jobs as cafeteria hands and other [[manual labour|manual labor]] jobs at those schools.

==Organizational history==

The WSA explicitly rejected the rest of the [[New Left]]'s insistence that it would be various combinations of 'progressive' [[nationalism]] and popular rebellion that would jump-start the revolution; rather, the WSA said the catalyst would be organized workers in various [[industries]] and the [[service sector]], and that students could best help spread and deepen workers' [[class consciousness]] by really being among the workers themselves, rather than just using their class designation in [[rhetoric]] to appear more [[Marxist]].

The WSA faction took about 900 of the approximately 1400 representatives in the split at the 1969 [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] convention in Chicago. The other 500, who had been the [[Revolutionary Youth Movement]], left to form [[new communist movement|a myriad of other groups]]. SDS chapters around the country then split along these same lines, or disbanded entirely.

Both the RYM and the WSA kept the SDS name, but the [[Weather Underground Organization|Weatherman organization]] continued to hold the SDS National Office and all the SDS membership lists; thus it was able to assume effective "command" of the name and public face of SDS despite its inferior size. Nearly immediately post-conference, Weatherman led their "Days of Rage" Chicago riots of 1969 and other sporadic acts of violence — all under the SDS name — until 1970, when [[Mark Rudd]] and a few other Weathermen decided to close the SDS National Office and drop the SDS name. PL, however, continued to keep its SDS for several more years. Since all active SDS chapters after 1970 were SDS-WSA, the "WSA" initials were dropped.

In 1974 PL's SDS voted to dissolve itself and join the [[International Committee Against Racism|Committee Against Racism]] which PL had helped to form at a conference at [[New York University]] in November 1973. The CAR eventually expanded to several other countries and added "International" to its name to become InCAR, but InCAR was in many respects another "mass organization" led and directed by the PLP, with separate publications and staff, but always with a goal of winning InCAR members to support PLP. By 1996, this strategy was too much to maintain, and PLP elected to pursue pure and open communist activity again, using only its own party as an organizational structure.

The original post, as well as the subsequent publications, mentions not 19, but 20 principles, "counting the one (...) for [[Guido Van Rossum|Guido]] to fill in", but the twentieth missing principle was never published and may never have existed. The principal text is released into [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="pep20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/|title=PEP20 -- The Zen of Python|author=Tim Peters|date=2015-11-18|orig-year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zen of Python is written as an informational entry number 20 in [[Python Enhancement Proposal]]s (PEP), and can be found on the official Python website. It is also included as an [[Easter egg (software)|easter egg]] in the Python [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], which can be displayed by entering &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=python inline&gt;import this&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;.&lt;ref name="hitchhiker"/&gt;

==Principles==
Principles are listed as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than '''right''' now.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In the interpreter easter egg, this is written as "Although never is often better than *right* now." This follows a longstanding convention of [[Plain text|plain-text]] communication—in which common formatting features are often impossible—where [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]] is represented with asterisks.&lt;/ref&gt;
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
