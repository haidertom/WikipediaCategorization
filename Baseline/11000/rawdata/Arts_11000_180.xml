{{DISPLAYTITLE:''art press''}}
'''''art press''''' is a monthly international review of [[contemporary art]]. Its first issue was for December 1972&amp;ndash;January 1973. The original [[brand]]ing, which has hardly changed since, was by [[Roger Tallon]]. Articles are in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].

==History==
In her first editorial, [[Catherine Millet]] (co-founder with the art dealer [[Daniel Templon]], and editor-in-chief) explained why she refused a journalistic approach, too much relying on anecdote; that she no more wanted an avant-garde review that erased art history than she wanted a review on the history of art longing for antiques. Finally, she said, she wanted break the [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] habits of French culture.

In her autobiographical novel, {{lang|fr|La vie sexuelle de Catherine M.}} ("The sex-life of Catherine M."), Millet explains that setting up the review, and the acquisition of its independent capital, was largely tied to its individual constitution, and she also noted the spirit of free enterprise.

Thirty years later, ''art press'' is one of the few influential journals in the French contemporary art market; it can promote, for example, an artist's standing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ''art press'' also gives its opinion, supported by references, on wider debates in society.

==''art press 2''==
In May 2006, ''art press 2'' was first published. It was a new collection of three-monthly bilingual themed issues, commenting on news events. Issues of ''art press 2'' have had the themes: {{lang|fr|La Scène française}} ("The French scene"), {{lang|fr|Berlin, ville transit}} ("Berlin, transit city"), {{lang|fr|Cynisme et art contemporain}} ("Cynicism and contemporary art"), {{lang|fr|Les Nouveaux Réalistes}} ("The new realists"), {{lang|fr|Un numéro de choix}} ("A choice issue"), {{lang|fr|Londres, nouvelles sensations}} ("London, new sensations"), {{lang|fr|Performances contemporaines}} ("Performance today").

==artpress.com==
Designed and produced by the editorial team of the ''art press'' review, artpress.com is the updated Internet version of the magazine, with a selection of articles, interviews and reports, enriched by unedited content and longer editorials that are not in the paper review.

The '''Association des Écrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires''' (AEAR) was a French association of revolutionary artists and writers active between 1932 and 1939. 

An association of the same name was formed in 2006.

The AEAR was founded by communist and communist-sympathizing writers in March 1932 as the French section of the [[International Union of Revolutionary Writers]], established by the [[Comintern]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1930. Leading figures included [[Paul Vaillant-Couturier]], [[Léon Moussinac]], [[Charles Vildrac]] and [[Francis Jourdain]].

The members of the AEAR mobilized against war and [[fascism]]. Together with the [[Fédération Musicale Populaire]] (FMP), the organization played a key role in introducing Soviet music to France. Among other activities, the AEAR published the journal ''Commune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aear.net/Textes/HistoriqueAEAR.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090107062737/http://www.aear.net/Textes/HistoriqueAEAR.html | archivedate = 2009-01-07 | title = A.E.A.R. - Historique | trans-title = AEAR - History | language = fr | publisher = Association des Écrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires | location = Pantin, France }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auguste Dreyfus''' (28 June 1827 – 25 May 1897) was a French [[businessman]] who made his fortune by financing the Peruvian trade in [[guano]].{{efn|The cold [[Humboldt Current]] runs north along the coast of Peru and is rich in fish. It provides food for a huge population of seabirds. The climate is warm and dry, and bird droppings accumulate to great depth, particularly on the [[Chincha Islands]]. The guano deposits had great value as fertilizer and played a central role in the Peruvian economy for most of the 19th century.{{sfn|Hollett|2008|p=24}} }} Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima, Peru to act as their local representative. He became involved in the guano trade, and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe.
With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income.

The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction. The government ran into increasing financial difficulties. These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano-producing province. A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile. The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end. He retired to France, where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art.

==Early years==
[[File:Wissemourg7.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Wissembourg]], where Dreyfus was born]]
Auguste Dreyfus was born into a Jewish family in [[Wissembourg]], Bas-Rhin, on 28 June 1827.{{sfn|Riviale|1996|p=376}}
He was the tenth of twelve children of the merchant Edward Dreyfus (1788–1866) and his wife Sara Marx (1791–1865). 
He was the youngest of their seven boys.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=150}}

On 29 August 1852 Auguste's brothers Prospere, Jérome and Isidore started Dreyfus Frères &amp; Cie.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
This was a small company in Paris trading in fabrics and other commodities.
Auguste Dreyfus joined the company in 1856.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
By 1859 Auguste Dreyfus, now residing in Peru, had become a minority partner.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
Auguste began trading in guano, and quickly became wealthy through careful attention to the fluctuations in the global demand for the commodity.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}

Prospere and Jérôme retired from the business in 1864 and Isidore in 1866.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=421}}
Leon Dreyfus, who had moved to Peru and made influential connections, 
became a partner on 19 January 1866 and remained associated with Auguste until 1869.{{sfn|Novak|2005|p=140}}
Auguste became respected in business circles on both sides of the Atlantic for his skill and the profitability of his enterprises.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=421}}

===Dreyfus contract===
The government of [[Peru]] had been exploiting their guano reserves on a consignment system, in which the state paid contractors to extract, transport and sell it on a cost-plus basis. This  encouraged corruption and inefficiency. Contractors were motivated to overstate costs and sell at low prices in order to drive up volumes. By 1868 Peru had large and growing debts. In response to growing public criticism, the government chose a new approach. {{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=53}}
On 5 July 1869 the government cancelled all consignment arrangements and granted Dreyfus Frères the exclusive right to sell up to two million tons of guano in Europe.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} 
Dreyfus was to pay 50 ''soles''{{efn|In the 1860s a Peruvian ''sole'' was worth almost a dollar.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=198}} 50 soles was ₤7.6.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} }} per ton for the guano, a considerably higher price than the government had been receiving up to then.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}

Auguste Dreyfus was backed by the [[Société Générale]] of [[Paris]].{{sfn|Bethell|2008|p=551}}
Dreyfus arranged for a partnership in which shares were issued with a nominal value of 60 million francs.  
Société Générale and the international trading house Leiden, Premsel &amp; Cie. both took 22.5 million francs while Dreyfus took 15 million.
Each of the major partners in turn distributed shares to subordinate partners.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=154}}
A private addendum to the contract stipulated that Dreyfus's choice of banker would handle Peruvian financial affairs in London.
He chose [[J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co.]], a bank of the City of London.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=154}}
Schroders would handle the bond issues of 1870 to 1872.

[[File:Nicolás de Piérola Presidente.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Nicolás de Piérola]], the finance minister who arranged the Dreyfus contract and subsequent loans]]
The royalty payments were to start in the early 1870s as the other contracts expired.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}}
In the meantime, Dreyfus would advance the government 2.4 million soles per year and 700,000 soles monthly for the first twenty months.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
The contract also included clauses through which his company would assume government debts to former guano contractors and foreign bondholders, 
charging the government 5% interest on this debt until it was paid off.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=54}}
The total debt was 21 million soles. The agreement was ratified on 17 August 1869.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}}
The Minister of Finance, who arranged the deal, was [[Nicolás de Piérola]].{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}

The former contractors did not have popular support but fought the contract, which had not been open to competition.
In November 1869 the Supreme Court said the contract should be cancelled since it had stripped Peruvian citizens of their rights.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=156}}
The government rejected this ruling, saying it was for the legislature to decide.
In November 1870 the Chamber of Deputies approved the contract by 63 votes to 33, 
and the Senate ratified the decision soon after.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=156-157}}

===Government loans===

The income provided by the Dreyfus contract was absorbed in payments to an expanding civil service and armed forces.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=57}}
Rather than reduce debts or invest in urgently needed schools or irrigation projects, Pierola used the income from the contract as collateral for additional loans, 
which President [[José Balta]] used for an ambitious plan promoted by [[Henry Meiggs]] to build railways in the mountainous [[Andes]] country.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}
Dreyfus arranged to float these loans in Europe, one in 1870 for ₤12 million of 6% bonds sold at 82.5% of face value, 
and a second in 1872 of 5% bonds sold at 77.5% of face value.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=57-58}}
Peru had hoped to sell almost ₤37 million of the 1872 bonds, but investors were concerned about the country's ability to serve its soaring debts, and there were rumors that the guano supplies were running out.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=199}} 
Dreyfus and his associates bought most of the ₤22 million that was issued, paying just ₤13 million.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}}
By 1872 almost all of the government's guano revenue was going to debt interest payments, and the deficit was running at 50%.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=58}}

[[File:Mpardol.png|thumb|240px|[[Manuel Pardo]], President of Peru (1872–1876), who inherited the debt crisis]]
The public saw no return from the railway projects, and in May 1872 elected [[Manuel Pardo]] as President, a popular former mayor of Lima. An attempted coup d'état before Pardo took power did not succeed.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=18}}
Pardo inherited a financial crisis. The best-quality and most accessible gauno had already been extracted, so prices were falling and costs rising.{{sfn|Farcau|2000|p=19}}
Pardo reduced the size of the army by three-quarters and canceled two orders for battleships from Britain, 
but continued the railway construction program.{{sfn|Kaufman|Macpherson|2005|p=437}}
He allowed Dreyfus to continue with the last bond issue, which proved a failure. Only ₤8.3 million was raised, one quarter of what had been hoped.
The money mainly went to paying Dreyfus and refinancing debts.{{sfn|Cushman|2013|p=68}}

Dreyfus now began suffering from the declining quality of the remaining [[guano]] and from competition with artificial [[fertilizer]] manfuctured in Germany. In November 1873 Dreyfus announced that he no longer had enough income to service Peru's [[foreign debt]]. The government responded by withdrawing Dreyfus's permit to ship guano, and stated that bondholders of the two loans had first claim on Peruvian guano, ahead of Dreyfus.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}} 
The government threatened to sue Dreyfus in Europe if he failed to meet his payments on the loans. An agreement was reaching in April 1874 under which Dreyfus could export another 850,000 tons of guano, the remainder of the 2 million tons agreed in the contract, and Dreyfus would continue to service the foreign debt until 1 July 1875. Dreyfus would also advance cash to the government based on the gross value of the guano extracted.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=200}}

===Later operations===

On 1 January 1876 the Peruvian government defaulted on payments on its foreign debt.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34-35}}
Peru reserved 100,000 tons of gauno as security for the payments they had missed.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34}} 
In March 1876 a new contract for guano sales was agreed with the Peruvian Guano Company, formed by the London merchant bank [[Raphaels Bank|Raphael &amp; Sons]], and the Peruvians Carlos Gonzales Candamo and Arturo Heeren.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=169}}
On 31 March Peru concluded a contract with the Société Générale of Paris for the sale of guano.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=34}}
Manuel Pardo's presidency ended among growing economic problems compounded by civil unrest and a brewing crisis with Chile. He was succeeded by General [[Mariano Ignacio Prado]], to whom he had lent his support.{{sfn|Masterson|1991|p=67}}
One of Prado's first acts was to travel to London, where on 7 June 1876 he signed an agreement by which Peru sold 1,900,000 tons of guano to Raphael's consortium.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=36}}

The Dreyfus contract expired on 31 October 1876, leaving Dreyfus Brothers with about half a million tons of unsold guano.
It was expected to take until mid-1878 to clear this inventory.{{sfn|Corporation of Foreign Bondholders|1876|p=36}}
The competing Peruvian Guano Company was handicapped by terms that favored Peru, and until 1879 was not allowed to sell at competitive prices. 
Dreyfus had large stocks of higher-quality guano, and continued to dominate the global market.
The Peruvian Guano Company's bondholders tried to sue Dreyfus for a share of his guano revenue, but did not succeed.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=205}}

In February 1879 the [[War of the Pacific]] broke out between Chile and Bolivia with Peru. One of the causes was the 1875 nationalization by Peru of nitrate production facilities in [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá province]], many of them owned by Chilean companies.{{sfn|Keen|Haynes|2008|p=256}} Chile quickly seized control of the main ports through which guano was exported and also Tarapacá, a key source of guano as well as of nitrates.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=205}} By late 1879 the Peruvian government still owed Dreyfus £4 million, secured by the country's remaining reserves of guano.{{sfn|Clayton|1985|p=146}}
In December 1879 President Prado left Peru and was replaced by Nicolás de Piérola. In January Piérola and Dreyfus agreed on a new contract under which the government recognized a debt to Dreyfus of 21 million soles, or ₤4 million, to be recovered by Dreyfus through further sales of guano. Dreyfus was to export only to markets that were not being served by the Peruvian Guano Company. The British protested against the agreement, but were not supported by the French.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=210}}

On 30 June 1880 a new agreement was made between Peru and Dreyfus to consolidate its debt. Peru would give up control of its railways for twenty five years and pay Dreyfus £3,214,388. About the same time, the Chilean government agreed to give the bondholders of the Peruvian Guano Company the right to export guano from the occupied territories.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=216}}
Chile occupied Lima in January 1881, effectively deciding the war, although a guerrilla struggle continued.{{sfn|Castillo-Feliú|2000|p=52}}
On 9 February 1882 a new agreement was made with Chile in which that country would sell one million tons of guano from Tarapacá to the highest bidder, with half the profit going to creditors of Peru whose claims were secured by the guano, including Dreyfus. Chile probably made this concession to avoid intervention by the creditor governments.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=219}}
The [[Treaty of Ancón]], signed on 20 October 1883, ended the war. Chile acquired Tarapacá permanently.{{sfn|Keen|Haynes|2008|p=256}}

[[File:Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau by Nadar.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau]], who defended Dreyfus and was named as the executor of his will]]
In the years that followed Dreyfus, the bondholders of the Peruvian Guano Company and other creditors, sometimes backed by the French or British governments, 
made conflicting claims against Chile and Peru with limited success.{{sfn|Aggarwal|1996|p=220ff}}
Dreyfus chose Waldeck-Rousseau, a prominent Republican who had been Minister of the Interior in 1884, as his advocate in his case against the Société Générale, formerly his partner.{{sfn|Bonin|2006|p=511}}{{sfn|Mayeur|2003|p=224}}

==Personal life==

===Family and friends===

Dreyfus converted to Catholicism shortly before his marriage in Lima with the Peruvian Sofia Bergman on 15 August 1862.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=150}}
His wife's brothers, Charles and Frederick Bergman, won a contract in August 1869 to build and run dock facilities in the port of [[Callao]], which they sold to the Société Générale in 1874. Sofia Bergman died in Lima in 1871.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=164}}
Dreyfus married his second wife in Lima on 8 January 1873.
Luisa González Orbegoso (1847–1924), Marquise de Villahermosa, was granddaughter of Marshal [[Luis José de Orbegoso]], one of the first presidents of the Republic of Peru.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}}

Two sons and two daughters were born of Dreyfus's second marriage. Louis Dreyfus (1874–1965), was successively authorized by decree of 12 August 1885 to call himself Dreyfus-Gonzalez de Andia, then in 1925 by [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], to assume – contrary to the Spanish noble usage – the title of his mother, who died a year before, and finally, by decree of 26 July 1935, to remove Dreyfus from his name.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}} 
Louis married Félicie de Talleyrand-Périgord, daughter of Archambaud de Talleyrand-Périgord and Marie de Gontaut-Biron.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
[[Édouard Dreyfus Gonzalez]] (1876–1941) was a lawyer and Count of Premio Real. He wrote songs under the name Jean Dora.{{sfn|Conde de Premio Real}} 
He married Anne-Hélène de Talleyrand-Périgord, sister of Félicie.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
Emilie Dreyfus married the viscount, banker and politician [[Hervé de Lyrot]].{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=153}}{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}
Her sister married René de Lyrot.{{sfn|DREYFUS Y GONZALES}}

Dreyfus was described in 1886 as having great vigor and agility, despite being somewhat overweight.
He was a good friend of the President of France, [[Jules Grévy]].{{sfn|Tavernier|1886|p=300}} 
Grévy supported Dreyfus in his claims against Peru.{{sfn|Quiroz|2008|p=204}}
Despite his conversion, Dreyfus was a target of anti-Semites such as [[Édouard Drumont]] in his 1888 polemic ''La France juive'' (Jewish France).{{sfn|Read|2012|p=33-35}}
His children would also suffer from anti-semitism.{{sfn|Wieviorka|2009|p=35}}

Dreyfus died in Paris on 25 May 1897.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=153}}

===Art collector===
[[File:Jouars-Pontchartrain Château.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Château de Pontchartrain]], which Dreyfus purchased in 1888]]
In November 1874 Dreyfus bought an imposing neo-classical hotel at 3 Rue Ruysdael.
There he accumulated an extraordinary art collection, which he inventoried in detail in 1887.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=152}}
Dreyfus showed objects in the Peru pavilion at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]] in Paris, including furniture encrusted with pearls and objects of art. He also sent three mummies from Peru to the Paris Anthropological society in 1878.{{sfn|Riviale|1996|p=376}}
In June 1888 Dreyfus bought the domain of the [[Château de Pontchartrain]] from Count [[Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck]].{{sfn|Rounding|2004|p=282}}
In 1891 the architect [[Émile Boeswillwald]] was given the task of restoring the chateau.{{sfn|Paris et Ile-de-France 1979|p=263}}

In June 1889 Dreyfus sold 116 items from his collection, realizing 861,000 francs.{{sfn|Appletons' Annual Cyclopedia 1890|p=320}}
In June 1896 the Dreyfus-Gonzalez collection was sold at public auction in Paris, and included among other valuables four candelabra called "the sirens and garlands of leaves" (c. 1783–1784) attributed to the great bronze sculptor [[François Remond]] and coming from a series of six that were part of the furniture of the Parisian hotel of the second Duke of Praslin (1735–1791), which were acquired by the Duke of Hamilton. They were sold to Dreyfus in 1882.{{sfn|La Gazette de l'Hotel Drouot|p=62-63}}

'''Black Spark''' is an anonymous male American [[film director]] and [[photographer]]&lt;ref name = "A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/detail.asp?id=28676 |title=Need to Know: Black Spark |publisher=Out Magazine |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |first=Phillip | last=Crook}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born on 14 August 1990) who is most noted for his hypersexualized [[music videos]] and unique surreal style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theauthenticgay.com/whatever-happened-black-spark/ |title=Whatever Happened to Black Spark|publisher=The Authentic Gay |date=4 September 2016 |accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began posting videos in the fourth quarter of 2010. He has stated in interviews that he is bisexual, that all videos are about his own sex life, and that he is influenced by art [[pornography]] from the 1970s.&lt;ref name = "A" /&gt;

[[File:Black Spark.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Black Spark]]

== Identity ==
Much speculation about his identity has been made. Some sources claimed to have identified him as an [[Pornographic film actor|adult film actor or model]] who has done scenes for a web company called "CollegeDudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.queerty.com/who-is-black-spark-let-him-tell-you-himself-20110131/ | title=Who Is Black Spark? Let Him Tell You Himself | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | date=January 31, 2011 | publisher=Queerty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blackspark.co | title=Official Black Spark Site | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | date=January 31, 2011 | publisher=DHill90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Spark has given reasons in interviews as to why he has chosen to be anonymous. His everyday real life is the opposite of Black Spark's hypersexualized life, he works on other projects, and he doesn't want the Black Spark identity to hinder his "large-scale future plans in film".&lt;ref name = "A" /&gt;

'''''Buile Shuibhne''''' or '''''Buile Suibhne'''''{{efn|Alternate spellings are  also: Shuibni, Suibne}} ({{IPA-ga|ˈbˠɪlʲə ˈhɪvʲnʲə}}, '''''The Madness of Suibhne''''' or '''''Suibhne's Frenzy''''') is an old Irish tale about the '''Suibhne mac Colmain''', king of the [[Dál nAraidi]], driven insane by [[St. Ronan]]'s curse. The insanity makes Suibhne leave the [[Battle of Mag Rath]], enter a life of wandering (which earns him the nickname Suibne Geilt or "Mad Sweeney"), until he dies under the refuge of [[Mo Ling|St. Moling]].

The tale is the final installment of a three-text cycle in [[Irish bardic poetry]], continuing on from ''Fled Dúin na nGéd'' (''The Feast of Dun na nGéd'') and ''Cath Maige Rátha'' (''The Battle of Mag Rath'').

Suibhne's name appears as early as the ninth century in a law tract (''Book of Aicill''), but ''Buile Suibhne'' did not take its current form until the twelfth century.&lt;ref name="sailor"&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Sailor |first=Susan Shaw |title=Suibne Geilt: Puzzles, Problems, and Paradoxes|journal=The Canadian Journal of Irish Studies |volume=24 | number =1 |year=1998 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25515239 | doi = 10.2307/25515239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvnb|Ó Béarra|2014}} includes a detailed analysis of the language and date of the text.

==Suibhne's identity==
The identity of Suibhne is a very convoluted matter as several texts mention different Suibhnes in regards with the Battle of Mag Rath.&lt;ref name="sailor"/&gt; Buile Suibhne specifies Suibhne as the son of Colman Cuar and as the pagan king of [[Dál nAraidi]] in [[Ulster]] in [[Ireland]] (in particular in the areas of present-day county Down and county Antrim).&lt;ref name="sailor"/&gt; This particular Suibhne son of Colman's name can also be found in the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]''&lt;!--Tighenach--&gt; and the [[Book of Lismore]].&lt;ref name="sailor"/&gt; The ''Annals of Tigernach'' state Suibhne, son of Colman, died in the Battle of Mag Rath, making Buile seem a fanciful imagining of dead warrior. Historical records of Dál nAraidi do exist. It was a historical kingdom inhabited by the [[Cruthin]].&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, Eoin. Phases of Irish History. Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; However the king lists of Dál nAraidi in the [[Book of Leinster]] fail to mention any Suibhne son of Colman Cuar as king, and identifies [[Congal Cáech|Congal Claen]] as king of Dál nAraidi during this time. James G. O’Keeffe has hypothesized a possible scenario where Suibhne might have been elected by the Cruthin to act as regent in the midst of King Congal's exile.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=xxxi}}

==Text==
There are three manuscripts, '''B''' (Royal Irish Academy, B iv i), 1671–4; '''K''' (Royal Irish Academy, 23 K 44), 1721–2; and '''L''' (Brussels, 3410), 1629, a condensed version in the hand of [[Michael O'Clery]]. The text can be dated to broadly from 1200–1500 on linguistic grounds, but [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] asserted the writer must have lived before 1197 when the last [[Kings of Tír Chonaill|chieftain of Tir Connail]]&lt;!--Flaithbhertach O'Muldory--&gt; died who was descended from [[Domnall mac Áedo]], since the work is intended to flatter this monarchic dynasty.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=xiii–xix}} 

== Plot ==
===The saint's curse===
In the legend, while St. Ronan was marking boundaries for a new church, the sound of his bell&lt;!--suspended on his breast--&gt; reached Suibhne's ear. Suibhne, upon learning that this was church-making activity on his grounds, rushed out to expel St. Ronan from his territory. His wife Eorann tried to detain him by grabbing his cloak, which unraveled, leaving Suibhne to exit the house stark naked. Suibhne grabbed Ronan's [[Psalter]] and threw it into the lake, and seized the Saint by the hand and started to drag him away. But Suibhne was interrupted by a messenger from [[Congal Cáech|Congal Claen]] requesting aid in the [[Battle of Mag Rath]] (near modern [[Moira, County Down|Moira]], 637 A.D.).

The next day, the Psalter was returned unharmed by an otter that fetched it from the lake. The saint laid a curse upon Suibhne, condemning him to wander and fly around the world naked, and to meet his death by spear-point. In the ongoing war, St. Ronan had mediated a truce to last from each evening until morning, but Suibhne habitually broke this by killing during the hours when combat was not permitted.

One day, Bishop Ronan and his psalmists were on their round blessing the troops. Suibhne too received the sprinkling of [[holy water]], but taking this as a taunt, he killed one of the bishop's psalmists with a spear, and cast another at Ronan himself. The weapon pierced a hole in Ronan's bell (hanging on his breast), and the broken-off shaft hurled in the air. At this, Ronan repeated the same curse: that Suibhne will wander like a bird, much as the spear-shaft, perch on tree branches at the sound of the bell, and die by the spear just as he had killed the monk. When battle resumed, the tremendous noise of the armies clashing drove Suibhne insane. His hands were numbed, his weapons fell, and he began to tread ever so lightly as a bird levitating in the air.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=3–15}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dillon |first=Myles |author-link=Myles Dillon |title=Buile Shuibni |work=Early Irish Literature |place=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago |year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is revealed much later on that like a bird, feathers had grown on him.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=119}})

===The madness and wandering===
The deranged Suibhne then left the battlefield behind, reaching a forest called Ros Bearaigh, in Glenn Earcain{{efn|name="ros-bearaigh-and-earcain"|Ros Bearaigh may be another forest in the vicinity of Ros Earcain ([[Rasharkin]], [[Co. Antrim]]), which occurs as a separte location in this tale, {{harvnb|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=notes, p.162 (to §12, p. 15), 164 (to §17, p.23), 167 (to §35, p.51)}}}} and perched on a [[yew tree]]. He was discovered by his kinsman Aongus the Fat, who was making his retreat from battle. Suibhne fled to Cell Riagain{{efn|[[Kilrean]], {{harvnb|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=notes, p.162}}}} in [[Tir Conaill]], alighting on another tree. There he was surrounded by the forces of [[Domnall mac Áedo]], which was the side Suibhne and his Dál nAraidi kinsmen were warring against. The victorious Domnall nevertheless praised and pitied Suibhne and offered him gifts, but the madman would not comply.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=15–23}}

Suibhne went to his home territory of Glenn Bolcáin,{{efn|Possibly Glenbuck, near Rasharkin, {{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998|loc="Bolcáin, Glenn", p. 47}}, citing [[Gearóid Mac Eoin]] (1962), "Gleann Bolcáin agus Gleann na nGealt" in ''Béaloideas'' 30; O'Keeffe could not pinpoint it but also believed it to be somewhere in N. Antrim, {{Harvnb|O'Keeffe|1913|p=164}}.}} wandered seven years throughout Ireland, and returned to Glenn Bolcain, which was where his fortress and dwelling stood, and a celebrated valley of madmen.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=x}}{{sfnp|Mackillop|1998|loc="Bolcáin, Glenn", p. 47}} Suibhne's movement was now being tracked by his kinsman Loingsechan, who had successfully taken the madman into custody thrice before. Loingsechan in his millhouse had a chance to capture Suibhne, but the attempt failed, and he must await another chance. Suibhne then paid visit to his wife, who was living with another man, a contender for Suibhne's kingship. Eorann maintained she would rather be with Suibhne, but he told her to remain with her new husband. An army stormed in, but Suibhne eluded capture.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=23–39, 41, 45–46}}

Suibhne then returned to the yew tree at Ros Bearaigh, the same tree he went to when he first developed his madness, but when Eorann came to deceive and capture him, he moved away to another tree in [[Rasharkin|Ros Ercain]].{{efn|name="ros-bearaigh-and-earcain"}} But his whereabouts was discovered, and Loingsechan coaxed him out of the tree, tricking him with the false news that his entire family had perished. Loingsechan brought Suibhne back to normal life and restored his sanity, but while recuperating, the mill hag taunted him into a contest of leaping. As they leapt, the noise of a hunting party returned Suibhne to madness. The mill hag eventually fell from her leap and was dashed to pieces. And since she was Loingsechan's mother-in-law, it meant Suibhne's could not return to Dál nAraidi without facing vengeance.{{sfnp|Frykenberg|2006|p=1797}}{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=49–83}}

Subhne subsequently wandered various parts of Ireland, into Scotland and Western England. He went from [[Roscommon]] to [[Slieve Aughty]], Slieve Mis, [[Slieve Bloom]] mountain ranges;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Names of mountain ranges in Munster, except O'Keeffe believes [[Slieve Mish]] is not meant here, but rather [[Slemish]] in Ulster.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=Index of Places and Tribes, pp. 194–7}}}} [[Inishmurray|Inismurray]] island; the Cave of [[Donnán of Eigg|St. Donnan]] of [[Eigg]], an island in the Scottish [[Inner Hebrides]];{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=Index of Places and Tribes, p. 195}} then tarried for a month and a half in "Carrick Alastair" ([[Ailsa Craig]] off Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Smyth |first=Daragh |title=A Guide to Irish Mythology |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=1996|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached Britain and befriended a Fer Caille (Man of the Wood), who was another madman, spending an entire year together. The Briton giant met his predestined death by drowning in a waterfall.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=83–105}}

===Death according to prophecy===
"Fly through the air like the shaft of his spear and that he might die of a spear cast like the cleric whom he had slain."

Suibhne then returned to Ireland, to his home dominion of Glen Bocain. He visited his wife Eorann again but refused to go in the house for fear of confinement. Eorann then told him to leave, never to return, because the sight of him was an embarrassment to all.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=105–111}} But after a while, Suibhne regained his lucidity and made his resolve to go back to [[Dál nAraidi]], whatever judgment may befall him. [[St. Ronan]] learned of this and prayed to God to hinder Suibhne. Suibhne is haunted by headless cadavers and detached heads at [[The Fews|Sliabh Fuaid]].{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=105–111}}

Eventually, Suibhne arrived at "The House of [[St. Moling]]", i.e. Teach Moling ([[St Mullin's]] in [[Co. Carlow]]{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|loc=Index of Places and Tribes, pp. 194–7}}), and Moling harbored him after hearing the madman's story. It might be noted that earlier, Suibhne had sung a stave predicting this place to be the place where he would meet his demise,{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=81}} and likewise, the Saint also knew this to be the madman's resting place.{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|p=143}} As Suibhne attended Moling's [[vespers]], the priest instructed a parish woman employed as his cook to provide the madman with a meal ([[Collation (meal)|collation]]), in the form of daily milk. She did so by emptying milk into a hole she made with her foot in the cow dung. However, her husband (Moling's herder) believed malicious hearsay about the two having a tryst, and in a fit of jealousy,  thrust a spear into Suibhne while he was drinking from the hole. Thus Suibhne died in the manner prescribed by Ronan, but received his sacrament from Moling, "as [[Éraic|eric]]".{{sfnp|O'Keeffe|1913|pp=143–147}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dillon|1948|pp=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary style==
The poetry in the story of Suibhne is rich and accomplished, and the story itself of the mad and exiled king who composes verse as he travels has held the imagination of poets through to the twentieth century. At every stop in his flight, Suibhne pauses to give a poem on the location and his plight, and his descriptions of the countryside and nature, as well as his [[pathos]], are central to the development of the text. Ó Béarra (2014) includes a detailed analysis of the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;https://vanhamel.nl/codecs/%C3%93_B%C3%A9arra_2014a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and adaptions==
Many poets have invoked Sweeney – most notably [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Heaney published a translation of the work into English, which he entitled ''[[Sweeney Astray]]''. Eliot made Sweeney the central figure in his verse drama ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. The author [[Flann O'Brien]] incorporated much of the story of ''Buile Shuibhne'' into his [[comic novel]] ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'', whose title is the English translation of the place name "Snamh da en" in the tale.{{sfnp|Mackillop|1998|loc="Buile Shuibhne", p. 63–4}} Another version from the Irish text, titled ''[[The Poems of Sweeny, Peregrine]]'', was published by the Irish poet [[Trevor Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundeye.org/trevorjoyce|title=The Poems of Sweeny, Peregrine|author=Trevor Joyce|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602185632/http://soundeye.org/trevorjoyce/|archivedate=2 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern Irish version of Buile Shuibhne was published in 2010 by Seán Ó Sé.{{sfnp|Ó Sé|2010}} This was the first time that the full original text was made available in modern Irish.

Sweeney also appears as a character in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s novel ''[[American Gods]]'' and is portrayed by [[Pablo Schreiber]] in its [[American Gods (TV series)|TV adaptation]].&lt;ref name="Schreiber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/pablo-schreiber-cast-mad-sweeney-american-gods-starz-thumper-1201752004/|title=Pablo Schreiber To Play Mad Sweeney In ‘American Gods’ Starz Series, Joins Indie ‘Thumper’|work=Deadline|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary version of the legend by poet Patricia Monaghan explores Sweeney as an archetype of the warrior suffering from "[[Da Costa's syndrome|Soldier's Heart]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourthorder.org/id37.htm Mad Sweeney&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109142035/http://www.fourthorder.org/id37.htm |date=January 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. D. Snodgrass]] introduces his poem ''Heart's Needle''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15302 Heart's Needle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919122651/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15302 |date=2006-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a reference to ''The Madness of Suibhne''.

Irish poet and playwright [[Paula Meehan]] loosely based her 1997 drama ''Mrs. Sweeney'' on the Sweeney legend. Set in an inner-city Dublin flat complex called The Maria Goretti Mansions (a metaphor for the notorious Fatima Mansions Flats in Dublin), the play examines what life must have been like for Sweeney's wife; as Meehan states, "I wondered what it must have been like to be his woman."&lt;ref&gt;Meehan, Paula, Author's Note for 'Mrs Sweeny', in "Rough Magic: First Plays" (Dublin: New Island Books, 1998), p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt; The play charts the trials and tribulations of Lil Sweeney's life in the Maria Goretti flats as she deals with crime, poverty, unemployment, drug abuse, and tries to come to terms with the premature death of her daughter Chrisse, a heroin addict who died a year before the action starts from an AIDS related illness. Lil's husband, Sweeney, is a pigeon fancier who, upon discovering that all his pigeons have been killed, retreats into a bird-like state.

Irish composer [[Frank Corcoran]] wrote a series of works between 1996 and 2003 around the tale. This includes the choral work ''Buile Suibhne / Mad Sweeney'' (1996, after Heaney), the electro-acoustic composition ''Sweeney's Vision'' (1997), and the chamber work ''Sweeney's Smithereens'' (2000).

The Centre was the first contemporary art institution in [[Suisse Romande]] (i.e. in French speaking Switzerland).&lt;ref name="saatchi" /&gt; As a ''Kunsthalle'', it does not have a collection, but organizes temporary exhibitions and projects with regional and international artists.

The Centre d'Art Contemporain Genève gained international renown with exhibitions by artists such as [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Martin Boyce]], [[Olaf Breuning]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Roberto Cuoghi]], [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Joan Jonas]], [[On Kawara]], [[William Kentridge]], Robert Overby, [[Pipilotti Rist]], [[Ugo Rondinone]], [[Sterling Ruby]], [[Thomas Scheibitz]], [[Shirana Shahbazi]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Josh Smith (artist)|Josh Smith]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Christopher Wool]].

In 2010, the Centre took on the mission of the [[Centre pour l’Image Contemporaine]] (CIC), established in Geneva in 1985.&lt;ref name="cic"&gt;[http://www.centreimage.ch/cic.php The Centre for Contemporary Image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206121032/http://www.centreimage.ch/cic.php# |date=2010-12-06 }}, Centre pour l’Image Contemporaine, Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;
CIC was established to organize events and exhibitions of images using new technologies such as video, multimedia, and the Internet, as well as more traditional photography and film ([[Biennale of Moving Images|Biennale de l'Image en Mouvement]]).

'''Chris Campbell''' (born 1952) is an American realist painter who grew up in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].  After graduating from [[Louisiana State University]], she earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from [[Tulane University School of Medicine]].  She completed a radiology residency at [[New York University School of Medicine]] as well as a fellowship in nuclear medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]].  Her career changed direction when she enrolled in the [[Art Students League of New York]] and studied under [[Harvey Dinnerstein]], [[David Leffel]], and [[Robert Maione]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chriscampbellartist.com/chriscampbellartist.com/resume.html The artist's website]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998 she moved to Hawaii and began painting Native Hawaiian women.

The term '''Chromogen''' is applied in [[chemistry]] to a colourless (or weakly coloured) chemical compound that can be converted by chemical reaction into a compound which can be described as "coloured".&lt;ref name="Burkinshaw2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burkinshaw |first1=Stephen M. |title=Physico-chemical Aspects of Textile Coloration |date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118725696 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SjdCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=chromogen+chemistry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiitvaJgp3dAhVkiFQKHeDeB58Q6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=chromogen%20chemistry&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cain1905"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cain |first1=John Cannell |last2=Thorpe |first2=Jocelyn Field |title=The Synthetic Dyestuffs and the Intermediate Products from which They are Derived |date=1905 |publisher=C.

Various dictionaries give the following definitions.
* A substance capable of conversion into a pigment or dye.
* Any substance that can become a pigment or coloring matter, a substance in organic fluids that forms colored compounds when oxidized, or a compound, not itself a dye, that can become a dye.
* Any substance, itself without color, giving origin to a coloring matter.
In [[biochemistry]] the term has a rather different meaning. The following are found in various dictionaries.
* A precursor of a biochemical pigment
* A pigment-producing microorganism
* Any of certain bacteria that produce a pigment  
* A strongly pigmented or pigment-generating organelle, organ, or microorganism.

The '''Cincinnati Conservatory of Music''' was a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]], part of a girls' [[finishing school]], founded in 1867 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt; It merged with the [[College of Music of Cincinnati]] in 1955, forming the [[University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music|Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music]], which is now part of the [[University of Cincinnati]].

The Conservatory, founded by '''Clara Baur''', was the first music school in Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;Shotwell, pg. 373&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, Mr. Burnet Corwin Tuthill, General Manager of the Conservatory, instigated the formation of the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] together with five other institutions ([[American Conservatory of Music]], Bush Conservatory of Music, Louisville Conservatory of Music, Pittsburgh Musical Institute, and Walcott Conservatory of Music) at a meeting held on June 10, 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Tuthill, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, Inc., became an institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music on February 1, 1930. Its certificate was signed by the President, Harold L. Bulter and Secretary, Burnet M. Bushelf.

Noted alumni include singer and actor [[Aaron Lazar]], trumpeter [[Al Hirt]], jazz pianist [[Pat Moran McCoy]], singer and entertainer [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], composers [[Harold Morris (composer)|Harold Morris]], [[Conlon Nancarrow]] and Christy Altomare of ''Spring Awakening'' fame, as well as pathologist [[Aldred Scott Warthin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7991">[[File:Circular reporting.svg|thumb|300px|Two basic ways that circular reporting can happen. Dashed lines indicate sourcing that isn't visible to the final reviewer.  In both cases, one original source (top) appears to the final reviewer (bottom) as two independent sources]]

'''Circular reporting''' or '''false confirmation''' is a situation in [[source criticism]] where a piece of information appears to come from multiple independent sources, but in reality comes from only one source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/caj/documents/vol_11/iss_2/CAJ_Vol11.2_12_e.pdf|title=The Challenge of Centralized Control Faced by the Intelligence Function in Afghanistan|publisher=Canadian Army Journal|date=Summer 2008|author1=Marcus Sterzer, CD|author2=Patrick McDuff B.A.|author3=Jacek Flasz|lastauthoramp=yes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305201954/http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/caj/documents/vol_11/iss_2/CAJ_Vol11.2_12_e.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MotherJones"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/06/8595_three_days_in_r.html|title=The Cocktail Napkin Plan for Regime Change in Iran|date=June 2008|publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the problem happens mistakenly through sloppy intelligence gathering practices. However, at other times the situation can be intentionally contrived by the original source as a way of reinforcing the widespread belief in its information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Solemnly Swear|author1=Micheal T. Hurley |author2=Kenton V. Smith |ISBN=0-595-29947-4|chapter=8|page=128|quote=Circular reporting occurs when what is reported is fed back to the originator in revised fashion which makes it difficult to objectively view the end product until you can trace back the sources to determine where the original information actually came from. Pan Am would eventually try to play that game by trying to introduce into court news reports that they themselves had a hand in producing.}} [https://books.google.com/books?q=%22Circular+reporting+occurs+when+what+is+reported+is+fed+back+to+the+originator+in+revised+fashion+which+makes+it+difficult+to+objectively+view+the+end+product+until+you+can+trace+back+the+sources+to+determine+where+the+original+information+actually+came+from.+Pan+Am+would+eventually+try+to+play+that+game+by+trying+to+introduce+into+court+news+reports+that+they+themselves+had+a+hand+in+producing.%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books Google Book search], retrieved on 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem occurs in a variety of fields, including [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]],&lt;ref name="MotherJones" /&gt; [[media echo chamber|journalism]], and scholarly [[research]]. It is of particular concern in [[military intelligence]] because the original source has a higher likelihood of wanting to pass on misinformation, and because the chain of reporting is [[fog of war|more prone to being obscured]]. The case of the 2002 [[Niger uranium forgeries]] was a classic instance of circular reporting by intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/17/nation/na-niger17|title=2006-02-17|publisher=Los Angeles Times|quote="This became a classic case of circular reporting," said a U.S. intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to reporters. "It seemed like we were hearing it from lots of places. People didn't realize it was the same bad information coming in different doors." | first1=Bob | last1=Drogin | first2=Tom | last2=Hamburger | date=2006-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples involving Wikipedia==
[[File:Relationship between Wikipedia and the press.svg|thumb|Diagram illustrating circular reporting by Wikipedia and the press]]
[[Wikipedia]] is sometimes criticized for being used as a source of circular reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research.ars |title=Wikipedia hoax points to the limits of journalists' research |publisher=Ars Technica |last=Timmer |first=John |date=May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia advises researchers and journalists to [[WP:Citing Wikipedia|be wary of, and generally avoid, using Wikipedia as a direct source]], and instead focus on verifiable information found in an article's [[WP:Citing sources|cited references]].

In the following examples, false claims were propagated on Wikipedia and in news sources because of circular reporting. [[Randall Munroe|Randall Monroe]], in his comic [[xkcd]], coined the term "citogenesis" to describe this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://xkcd.com/978/|title=xkcd: Citogenesis|website=xkcd.com|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Wikipedia and [[The Northern Echo]]: In January 2014 a statement was anonymously added to the Wikipedia page on UK comedian/broadcaster [[Dave Gorman]] stating that "he had taken a career break for a sponsored hitch-hike around the Pacific Rim countries". When this was questioned, an article published at a later date (September 2014) in ''The Northern Echo'', a daily regional newspaper in North East England was cited as evidence. The falsity of the original claim was confirmed by Gorman in an episode of his UK TV show [[Modern Life is Goodish]] (first broadcast 22 November 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardwick|first1=Viv|title=Mears sets his sights on UK|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20140929214806/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/entertainment/11460855.Mears_sets_his_sights_on_UK/|accessdate=30 August 2017|work=[[The Northern Echo]]|date=9 September 2014|quote=He once hitchhiked around the Pacific Rim countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wikipedia and ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 2009, regarding [[Karl-Theodor Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bildblog.de/5704/|publisher=BildBlog.de|title=Wie ich Freiherr von Guttenberg zu Wilhelm machte|language=German|date=2009-02-10}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/02/10/2211220|title=False Fact On Wikipedia Proves Itself|publisher=[[Slashdot]]|date=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wikipedia and ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2007, propagating the false information that [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] worked at Goldman Sachs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techdebug.com/blog/2008/04/19/wikipedia-article-creates-circular-references/|title=Wikipedia Article creates Circular references|publisher=Tech Debug blog|date=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wikipedia on the [[coati]] beginning in 2008, when an arbitrary addition "also known as....the Brazilian aardvark" by an American student resulted in much subsequent citation and usage of the unsubstantiated nickname as part of the general consensus, including published articles in ''[[The Independent]]'', ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', and a book published by the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/05/how-a-raccoon-became-an-aardvark.html|title=How a Raccoon Became an Aardvark|publisher=New Yorker|date=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ComicBase''' is a [[computer program]] for tracking [[comic book]] collections. It was created in 1992&lt;ref name="Company Information"&gt;[http://www.comicbase.com/mycb/company_information.aspx Company Information]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Peter Bickford]] as an [[Apple Macintosh]] program. A Windows version was introduced in 1996. As of February 2015, it is on its nineteenth version (dubbed ComicBase 2017) and is available for computers running [[Microsoft Windows]] Windows 7, and later. Its database includes pricing and notes on over 800,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbase.com/mycb/products/products.aspx ComicBase Product Features]&lt;/ref&gt; individual comic book issues, and allows users to sell their comics online at a website marketplace called Atomic Avenue.

'''''Cricket''''', also called '''''Cricket (Hearts and Wickets)''''', is a short musical written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]]. It was commissioned for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]'s 60th birthday celebration, and was first performed at [[Windsor Castle]] on 18 June 1986.

Several of the tunes from the show were later used for ''[[Aspects of Love]]'', so the work was dropped from public performance or recording.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.webring.com/people/oc/camillofan/cricket/musical.html ''Cricket'' – The Musical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727062109/http://webspace.webring.com/people/oc/camillofan/cricket/musical.html |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=citron355&gt;Citron, Stephen.

==History==
After their collaboration on ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' in 1978, composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]] took what was originally intended to be a temporary break from their illustrious theatrical partnership. They did not work together again until the request for this ''pièce d'occasion'' came up, and ''Cricket'' ended up being their final original musical.

[[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], the Queen's youngest son, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother's 60th birthday celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Snelson, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RRFx7fFsi0AC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=%22a+commission+from+Prince+Edward,+The+Queen's+youngest+son%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PsqDT7etIImriAKar4WABg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20commission%20from%20Prince%20Edward%2C%20The%20Queen's%20youngest%20son%22&amp;f=false ''Andrew Lloyd Webber'']. Yale University Press, 2009. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The game of [[cricket]] was Tim Rice's favourite pastime – he had a cricket field on the grounds of his home and had his own cricket team&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. ''Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical.'' Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; – and Rice had a particular passion for this new comic musical about England's national sport. Rice used actual cricket-related names for his characters, boosting the light-hearted feeling of the piece. He and Lloyd Webber created a 25-minute tongue-in-cheek "musicalette" for the Queen.

''Cricket'' is entirely [[sung-through]], with no spoken dialogue.

==Summary==
Set against the backdrop of the semi-fictional [[Headingley Stadium#Headingley_Carnegie_Cricket_Ground|Headingley Cricket Club]]'s matches, the comic and slightly melodramatic plot of ''Cricket'' has star player Donald torn between his team and his girlfriend Emma – as she decides to abandon watching cricket for what appears to be a far more exciting life at the race track with the caddish Vincent.

The leads in the cast are Donald, Emma, Emma's father, Vincent, and a West Indian [[Fast bowling|fast-bowler]] from the opposing team named Winston B. Packer. The musical's chorus are the rest of the cricket players.

==Synopsis==
The show begins during a match of Headingley Cricket Club. The game is watched by the Earl of Headingley, his daughter Emma Kirkstall-Lane, and Vincent St. Leger. The Earl and the cricketers sing the praises of cricket. ("The Summer Game")

Emma intends to marry Headingley player Donald Hobbs. And at the moment, even though he is Emma's father, the Earl is more approving of Donald than of Emma, because he feels his daughter is not supportive enough of Donald's cricketing. Emma loves Donald, but she thinks he neglects her somewhat for his cricket playing, and she wants more time together. She feels that she will be forever secondary in Donald's eyes until he retires from cricket. ("As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By")

Vincent, who is devoted to horse races, overhears Emma, and offers his own rather self-interested solution: leaving for the races in lieu of the cricket match. Emma is reluctant at first, but decides that maybe Vincent is right, and runs off with him. ("The Sport of Kings") The opposing team's [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]], Winston B. Packer, sings about how wonderful it is to be able to hit batsmen when they miss – and he injures several batsmen during the course of the song. ("The Art of Bowling")

While Donald is batting, he sees Emma leave with Vincent. He's hurt and truly torn – does he stay and bat to help his team win and lose Emma, or does he leave and try to get her back? In the end, sportsmanship prevails: Donald cannot let his team down. But he has been hit a few times during the song, and is suddenly levelled. As he lies dazed on the ground, lines from various people and various moments of the game bombard him – Winston, Emma, Vincent, his team. ("All I Ask of Life")

During the tea interval, Emma returns, dejected, feeling Vincent has deceived her. Not only has she lost all of her money, but she has lost Donald as well. She blames herself, and doesn't see how anyone will ever love her again. ("Fools Like Me")

Donald and the cricketers return to the game after the interval, but Donald ignores Emma. The Earl, however, lets fly at Emma and Vincent. Because of Emma's gambling debts, the Earl has lost his reputation and is in financial distress. Vincent tries to speak, but the Earl turns his attention, and wrath, onto him. The Earl is a powerful member of the [[Jockey Club]], and bans Vincent from all racing events for life. Vincent turns to Emma for sympathy, but she accuses him of deceiving her and getting her into trouble with her father. ("A Ban for Life")

Vincent and Emma's conversation is cut off by a scream. Wittering has been injured and can no longer continue in the game. Headingley CC needs 10 more runs to win, but there is no one to take Wittering's place alongside Donald. The Earl laments the bad day for Headingley. ("Wittering's Final Innings") Vincent suddenly speaks up and says he will take Wittering's place. ("The Making of St. Leger") He joins Donald and the game continues – to the amazement of the cricketers, who believed Vincent had no redeeming qualities. Vincent is beaten up badly during the game, but keeps playing.

Donald's and Vincent's scores win the game and they are both proclaimed heroes. The Earl is so impressed by Vincent's bravery (and recovery of a vital match!) that he withdraws the horse-racing ban. And Donald tells Emma he will play less cricket and spend more time with her. She wonders, could they go to the horse races? Vincent says he will spend Sundays playing cricket. Winston vows to try [[Spin bowling|slow bowling]]. And to top it all off, Wittering is feeling better. ("The Final Stand")

Donald and Emma finish making up, and vow to stay together with a sweeping love ballad which ends in a crescendo that everyone joins into, proclaiming the triumph of the cricket metaphor for life and love. ("One Hot Afternoon")

==Productions==
The show debuted as planned on 18 June 1986 at Windsor Castle, directed by [[Trevor Nunn]] and starring [[Ian Charleson]], [[Sarah Payne (actor)|Sarah Payne]], and [[John Savident]]. The musicians were members of [[Colosseum II]] and others – the ensemble that had first performed Lloyd Webber's ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]''. The men's vocal group [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] played the cricketers' chorus.

The Windsor Castle performance was quite spirited and amusing, and was very well received. Two more performances followed. One was at Lloyd Webber's [[Sydmonton Festival]] on 15 July 1986. The last performance was in November 1986 at Tim Rice's favourite charity, the [[Lord's Taverners|Lord's Taverners Ball]], where Rice played the cricketer Wittering, dressed in his own Heartaches Cricket Club&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartaches.co.uk/ Heartaches Cricket Club]&lt;/ref&gt; uniform.

A segment of the original rehearsals of ''Cricket'' was televised on the Andrew Lloyd Webber instalment of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', which aired on 15 November 1986. The segment featured Sarah Payne and Alvin Stardust rehearsing "As the Seasons Slip Fruitlessly By" and "The Sport of Kings".

There have been no further performances of the musical.

==Original cast==

*[[Ian Charleson]] – Donald Hobbs, devoted cricketer for Headingley Cricket Club
*[[Sarah Payne (actor)|Sarah Payne]] – Emma Kirkstall-Lane, Donald's girlfriend
*[[John Savident]] – the Earl of Headingley, Emma's father, the solicitous patron of the Headingley Cricket Club, and a Steward of the [[Jockey Club]]
*[[Alvin Stardust]] – Vincent St. Leger, a caddish fellow who spends his time betting at horse races
*[[George Harris (actor)|George Harris]] – Winston B. Packer, a lethal [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] originally from the [[West Indies]]
*[[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] – Chorus of cricketers
*[[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|HRH Prince Edward]] – Wittering, the gallant last [[batsman]] for Headingley Cricket Club

==After 1986==
Lloyd Webber used at least five of the tunes from ''Cricket'' in his musical ''[[Aspects of Love]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name=citron355 /&gt; This meant that ''Cricket'', which had been extremely well received, was a dead item, a fact that greatly distressed Tim Rice. The piece could thus never be expanded into a full theatrical musical.&lt;ref name=citron355 /&gt; Lloyd Webber used other tunes from ''Cricket'' in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

The ''Cricket'' libretto was published in '''A Breathless Hush ...': The MCC Anthology of Cricket Verse'' (2004). ''Cricket'' has not been recorded for commercial release, although a non-commercial instrumental demo studio album was recorded on solo piano in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://castalbumcollector.com/recordings/6803 ''Cricket'' demo recording] at CastAlbumCollector.com&lt;/ref&gt; The performance rights for the piece have not yet been made available.

The men's vocal group [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]] recorded "The Summer Game", featuring [[Tim Rice]] singing as the Earl, on their 2011 CD ''Songs of Cricket''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005BAKU3Q ''Songs of Cricket''] – CD by [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>since the lead was not citing a source and seems a bit confusing, I rewrote it with two sources about that "dervish" is commonly held in classical Islamic literature (such as performing miracles). I didn't know about dervishes leading Tariqa. further a dervish is not necessarily part of an order (just like the first source states). Further they are not always "poor". dervishes of cervish orders often had political positions and earned money by advising the Sultan.</comment>

==Etymology==
{{Sufism}}{{Sunni Islam}}
[[File:A Pakistani Punjabi Dervish.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A [[Pakistan]]i Dervish at [[Tulamba]] (May 2008).]]

The Persian word ''darvīsh'' ({{lang|fa|درویش}}) is of ancient origin and descends from a [[Proto-Iranian]] word that appears in [[Avestan]] as {{nobreak|''drigu-'',}} "needy, [[mendicant]]", via Middle Persian ''driyosh.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/darvis |title=Encyclopædia Iranica &amp;#124; Articles |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian word is probably a [[cognate]] with the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word {{nobreak|''adhrigu-'',}} an [[epithet]] of uncertain meaning applied to several deities. The Vedic word is probably to be analysed as {{nobreak|''a-dhrigu-'',}} that is "not {{nobreak|''dhrigu-'',"}} perhaps "not poor", i.e., "rich." The existence of this Vedic cognate suggests that the institution of the holy mendicant was as prominent among the ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] people as it has been historically in later Iran in the form of dervish brotherhoods, and also in India in the form of the various schools of [[sannyasi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_2_122/ai_n7042986/?tag=content;col1 | work=The Journal of the American Oriental Society | title=Adhrigu and drigu: on the semantics of an old Indo-Iranian word | first=George | last=Thompson | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the etymology of the word is not apparent from the point of view of the modern Persian language, there have been attempts to make the parts of the word interpretable in terms of contemporary words and with reference to Sufic mystical concepts. ''Der'', spelt as ''dar'' before 1964 ([[Dari language]]), means "door" in [[Persian language|Persian]]; ''dervish'' has been interpreted as "one who goes from door to door".&lt;ref name=islam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelus á S. Joseph: Gazophylacium linguae Persarum, triplici linguarum clavi, Italicae, Latinae  […] [https://books.google.com/books?id=-CIBwuRw0AEC&amp;pg=PA297], Amsterdam, 1684, Pg 6, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian word also gives terms for "ascetic" in some languages, as in the [[Urdu]] phrase ''darveshaneh tabi'at'', "an unflappable or ascetic temperament". According to the [[Bundahishn]] ''dervish'' or ''darwesh'' means "visitor from many doors". The term is a composition of the word ''der'' or ''dar'' and the adjective ''wish'' or ''wesh'' ويش or وش ''vsh'' (much, more), and means "someone who goes from door to door and sings, gets money, and wakes the people". This word is outdated in Persian, but it exists in the Indo-Iranian language of [[Pashto]] as ''wesh zalmanyan'' or ''wish zalmayan'', meaning "awakened youth".&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Justi:Der Bundeshesh, zum ersten Male, herausgegeben, transcribiert, übersetzt und mit Clossar versehen, Leipzig,1868 [https://archive.org/stream/derbundeheshher00unkngoog#page/n9/mode/1up], Pg. 139, 262, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious practice==
[[File:Preziosi - Derviş cerşetor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A dervish.]]
Many dervishes are mendicant ascetics who have taken a vow of poverty, unlike [[mullah]]s. The main reason they beg is to learn humility, but dervishes are prohibited to beg for their own good. They have to give the collected money to other poor people. Others work in common professions; Egyptian [[Qadiriyya]] – known in Turkey as Kadiri – are fishermen, for example.

Some classical writers indicate that the poverty of the dervish is not merely economic. [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], for instance, who himself travelled widely as a dervish, and wrote extensively about them, says in his ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'':
{{Quotation|Of what avail is frock, or rosary,
Or clouted garment? Keep thyself but free&lt;br&gt;
From evil deeds, it will not need for thee&lt;br&gt;
To wear the cap of felt: a darwesh be&lt;br&gt;
In heart, and wear the cap of Tartary.&lt;ref&gt;chapter 2 story 16: [https://archive.org/stream/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog_djvu.txt "The Gulistān; or, Rose-garden, of Shek̲h̲ Muslihu'd-dīn Sādī of Shīrāz, translated for the first time into prose and verse, with an introductory preface, and a life of the author, from the Ātish Kadah"] a story later adapted by La Fontaine for his tale 'Le songe d'un habitant du Mogol'&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Rumi]] writes in Book 1 of his [[Masnavi]]:&lt;ref&gt;''The Masnavi: Book One'', translated by Jawid Mojaddedi, Oxford World's Classics Series, Oxford University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-19-955231-3}}, p63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whirling dervishes==
{{Main|Sufi whirling}}

The whirling dance or [[Sufi whirling]] that is proverbially associated with dervishes is best known in the West by the practices (performances) of the [[Mevlevi]] order in Turkey, and is part of a formal ceremony known as the [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]. It is, however, also practiced by other orders. The Sama is only one of the many Sufi ceremonies performed to try to reach [[religious ecstasy]] (''majdhb'', ''fana''). The name ''Mevlevi'' comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], who was a dervish himself. This practice, though not intended as entertainment, has become a tourist attraction in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koentges|first=Chris|title=13 Things The Whirling Dervishes Can Teach You About Spinning Until You’re Dizzy Enough To Puke|url=http://veryethnic.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/13-things-the-whirling-dervishes-can-teach-you-about-spinning-until-youre-dizzy-enough-to-puke/|publisher=The Very Ethnic Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

==Orders==
[[File:Turkey.Konya050.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Dervish mannequins (Mevlâna mausoleum, [[Konya, Turkey]])]]
There are various orders of dervishes, almost all of which trace their origins from various Muslim saints and teachers, especially [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Imam Ali]]. Various orders and suborders have appeared and disappeared over the centuries. Dervishes spread into [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], [[Turkey]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Tajikistan]].

Other dervish groups include the [[Bektashi]]s, who are connected to the [[Janissary|janissaries]], and the [[Senussi]], who are rather orthodox in their beliefs. Other fraternities and subgroups chant verses of the [[Qur'an]], play drums or [[Sema|whirl]] in groups, all according to their specific traditions. They practice [[meditation]], as is the case with most of the Sufi orders in [[South Asia]], many of whom owe allegiance to, or were influenced by, the [[Chishti]] order. Each [[fraternity]] uses its own garb and methods of acceptance and initiation, some of which may be rather severe.

==Somali Dervish movement==
{{main|Dervish movement (Somali)}}
The [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]] was an early 20th-century [[Somalis|Somali]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic state]] that was established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a religious leader who gathered Somali soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands claimed by the Somali [[Sultan]]s, the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] and the [[Europe]]an powers. The Dervish movement acquired renown in the [[Islamic world|Islamic]] and [[West world|Western]] worlds due to its resistance against [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Italy]]. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed British-led Somali and Ethiopian forces four times and forced them to retreat to the coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of African history - Page 1406&lt;/ref&gt; The polity also maintained relations with other authorities, receiving support from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German empire]]s. The [[Turkish people|Turks]] also named Hassan [[Emir]] of the Somali nation,&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Lewis, ''The modern history of Somaliland: from nation to state'', (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: 1965), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[German people|Germans]] promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Ofcansky, Historical dictionary of Ethiopia, (The Scarecrow Press, Inc.: 2004), p.405&lt;/ref&gt; The Dervish movement was finally [[Somaliland campaign (1920)|defeated by the British in 1920]].

==Other historical uses==

===Mahdists===
Various western historical writers have sometimes used the term ''dervish'' rather loosely, linking it to, among other things, the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist uprising]] in [[Sudan]] and other rebellions against [[colonialism|colonial]] powers. In such cases, the term "dervishes" may have been used as a generic (and often pejorative) term for the opposing Islamic entity and all members of its military, political and religious institutions, including persons who would not be considered "dervishes" in the strict sense.

For example, a contemporary British drawing of the fighting in Sudan was entitled "The defeat of the dervishes at Toski" (see [[History of Sudan (1884–1898)#British response]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4108">The '''Embroidery Software Protection Coalition''' (ESPC) was a United States embroidery industry [[industry trade group|trade group]].  Its primary activity was the investigation and prosecution of alleged acts of [[copyright infringement]].  The group drew media attention for its campaign of settlement demands against individual buyers as well as sellers of embroidery patterns and software.  It drew further attention with a 2006 [[slander and libel|defamation]] suit against two individual Internet critics, in which it attempted to subpoena the identities of every subscriber of the critics' [[electronic mailing list]].

==eBay buyer infringement claims==
[[Image:ESPC Letterhead-1-.jpg|thumb|160px|right|This ESPC letter accuses an eBay buyer of copyright infringement.]]
&lt;!-- FAIR USE of ESPC Letterhead-1-.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:ESPC Letterhead-1-.jpg for rationale --&gt;

On August 3, 2005, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] approved the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by the ESPC and ESPC member companies against [[eBay]] and [[PayPal]], pursuant to a stipulation agreement between the parties.

On September 7, 2005, [[WNDU-TV]] reported that the ESPC was mailing settlement demands to individual eBay buyers.&lt;ref name="wndu_wayback"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wndu.com/ |title=WNDU-TV: South Bend, IN|publisher=Accessed on [[Internet Archive]]|date=09-07-2005 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20041016181331/http%3A//www%2Ewndu%2Ecom/ |archivedate = October 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one such demand letter, dated October 17, 2005, the buyers were identified by personal records provided by eBay and eBay sellers.

The October 17 letter further claimed that buyers, by purchasing and possessing unlicensed copies of embroidery software or patterns, had violated United States copyright law.  "By purchasing the counterfeit goods, they're encouraging the pirates to stay out there and put the legitimate businesses out of business," said Carole Faulkner, attorney for the ESPC, in the September 7 WNDU-TV report.  A [[University of Notre Dame]] law professor disagreed, telling WNDU-TV "copyright laws make it illegal to distribute copies, not buy them".

==Defamation suit==

As of April 28, 2006, the ESPC claimed to represent seven United States embroidery publishers and distributors.&lt;ref name="espc_wayback"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embroideryprotection.org/about_us.html|title=About the Embroidery Software Protection Coalition|date=2006-04-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428085918/http://www.embroideryprotection.org/about_us.html|archivedate=2006-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legitimacy of the ESPC was disputed by critics, who suggested that the ESPC was associated with only one publisher, Great Notions Embroidery Designs.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

On June 28, 2006, the ESPC responded to two such critics, against whom the ESPC had previously filed copyright infringement lawsuits, by filing a new lawsuit.  In the new lawsuit, the ESPC alleged defamation, [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]], business disparagement, and [[tortious interference]].

The ESPC subsequently petitioned for a subpoena seeking the identities of every subscriber to the two critics' Internet mailing list.  In September 2006, after the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] intervened on behalf of the anonymous targets of the subpoena, the subpoena was withdrawn.
&lt;ref name="eff_espc_v_ebert"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/ESPC_v_Ebert/|title=EFF: Embroidery Software Protection Coalition v. Ebert &amp; Weaver|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|date=2006-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referenced critics, since February 2006 have entered an out of court settlement with ESPC. Prior out of court settlements show that the infringers hand over lists of buyers and individuals to whom the machine embroidery designs were sent.

Starting in the 18th century, ideas of aesthetic pleasure have tried to define "taste". [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] both argued that there was universal good taste, which made aesthetic pleasure. A feminist line of logic about these attempts is that, because [[fine art]] was a leisure activity at this time, those who could afford to make art or produce supposed universal truths about how it is enjoyed would do so in a way that creates class and sex division.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Even when those universal aesthetists did address gender, they categorized aesthetics into two categories: [[beauty]] and [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]]; with beauty being small and delicate (feminine) and sublimity being large and awe-inspiring (masculine).&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics analyzes why "feminine" traits are subservient compared to "masculine" traits in art and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415266581|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation for the male-domination of forming aesthetic theory is that feminists express their aesthetic pleasure differently than non-feminist aesthetes for "whom the pleasure of theorizing [...] is a form of [[jouissance]]". Instead, a feminist is less likely to view the object as a disinterested interpreter, and intellectualize the sensation (Hilde Hein).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics of feminist art argue that politics have no place in art, however, many art forms contain politics, but because of their subject position, the critics are unable to perceive it. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|last=Hein|first=Hilde|last2=Korsmeyer|first2=Carolyn|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Bloomington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the ''creative genius'' is inspected in feminist aesthetics. In particular, women artists are often excluded from being creative or artistic geniuses.&lt;ref name=":0" group="encycl"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Genius and Feminism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aesthetics|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Battersby|first=Christine|date=1998|editor-last=Kelly|editor-first=Michael|isbn=9780195113075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exclusion in part stems from the traditional masculine definitions of genius.&lt;ref name=":0" group="encycl" /&gt; Christine Battersby has critiqued the fact that women are excluded from being known as geniuses because female artists will be separated from their art, and instead their art will be called genius, instead of the artist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, women were also excluded because they lacked the opportunities for artistic education required to be recognized as artists and geniuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2004|isbn=9780203646632|series=Understanding Feminist Philosophy|location=London|pages=59|chapter=Amateurs and Professionals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the idea of the creative genius itself celebrates individualism – which Christine Battersby calls "a kind of masculine heroism" – and overlooks the work of joint collaborations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender and Genius: Towards a Feminist Aesthetics|last = Battersby|first = Christine|publisher = The Women's Press Ltd.|year = 1989|isbn = 978-0704343009|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic theories that make a distinction between "arts" and "crafts" can be viewed as anti-feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Differencing the Canon: Feminism and the Writing of Art's Histories|last=Pollock|first=Griselda|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9780415066990|location=New York|pages=25|chapter=Differencing: Feminism's encounter with the canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, art usually refers to ''fine art'' and crafts refers to everything else which has ''[[Everyday Aesthetics|everyday aesthetics]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Art forms traditionally used by women, such as embroidery or sewing, are perceived as crafts and not art, because of their domestic uses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics focuses on all objects created by women, whether or not they are seen as "art".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since those craft practices occur in the home where many women continue to work, their creativity is overlooked by the perception of "art", because their domain is marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The aesthetics of everyday life|last = Leddy|first = Thomas|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''For Us the Living: The Medgar Evers Story''''' is a [[Television movie|made-for-television]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] that aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on March 22, 1983. The film was based on the book, ''For Us, the Living'', by [[Myrlie Evers-Williams]] and [[William Peters (journalist)|William Peters]].

==Synopsis==
[[Howard Rollins]] stars as assassinated NAACP [[civil rights]] activist [[Medgar Evers]], while [[Irene Cara]] co-stars as his wife (and future [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] chairperson) [[Myrlie Evers|Myrlie]]. The film concentrates on Medgar Evers, an ex-insurance agent turned activist, in the final years of his life as the first NAACP field secretary in Mississippi. In 1954, he is involved in a boycott against white merchants and was instrumental in eventually [[desegregation|desegragating]] the [[University of Mississippi]] in 1962. His home in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] is besieged by [[Bigotry|bigots]], and he and his family are threatened with dire consequences. Myrtle Evers with her children were often at home alone when fire bombs and bricks were thrown against their home and through their windows.  However, The Everses continued to work towards the goal of [[Racial integration|integrating]] the racially polarized. Medgar Evers truly believed The Constitution to include the rights within were for each American citizen, no matter color, age, class or education. On June 12, 1963, however, the 37-year-old Medgar Evers is shot to death in front of his home by [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Byron De La Beckwith]].

'''Georg Wilhelm Timm''', also known as '''Vasily Fyodorovich Timm''' (Russian: Василий Фёдорович Тимм; 21 June 1820, [[Riga]] - 19 April 1895, [[Berlin]]) was a [[Baltic-German]] painter, [[lithographer]] and ceramic designer, known for his [[Genre art|genre]] and battle scenes. He was also the publisher of the ''{{ill|Russian Art Gazette|ru|Русский художественный листок}}''.

== Biography ==
[[File:Timm modified.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Self-caricature from the [[endpaper]] of a book.]]
His father, Friedrich Wilhelm Timm (1779-1848), was the mayor of Riga.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/t/tim/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Paintings.&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, Emilie, married the painter [[Karl Bryullov]] in 1839. His first art studies were in Riga, then he went to Saint Petersburg, where he enrolled as a "foreign student" at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. His primary instructor there was the battle painter, [[Alexander Sauerweid]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/early-19th-century/romantic/georg-wilhelm-timm Brief biography] @ RusArtNet.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded two silver medals and graduated in 1839 with the title of "Artist". Five years later, thanks to an Imperial scholarship, he went to Paris where he worked under the direction of [[Horace Vernet]], also a battle painter, and made a visit to [[Algiers]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; Upon his return to Paris, he began exhibiting at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] where he attracted critical praise.

The onset of the [[French Revolution of 1848]] forced him to return to Saint Petersburg,&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; where he was initially employed as an illustrator; notably for the works of [[Faddey Bulgarin]] and [[Nikolay Gretsch]]. He worked primarily in the media of lithography and woodcuts and was sometimes referred to as the "Russian [[Paul Gavarni|Gavarni]]".

He travelled extensively throughout Russia, serving as a battle painter during the second phase of the [[Caucasian War]]. In 1852, he accompanied Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] on a visit to Finland . Later, he made sketches at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Siege of Sevastopol]]. As a result, in 1855, he was named an "Academician" by the Imperial Academy.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; 

From 1851 to 1862, by leave of the Royal Family, he published the ''Russian Art Gazette'', which featured works by many prominent Russian artists, made into lithographs by Timm.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He had to stop publishing the gazette when he began to suffer from an eye disease. 

In 1867, he moved to Berlin to seek treatment and took up a position as the Director of a privately operated ceramics institute.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He never returned to Russia. In 1876, he was appointed a Professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] and began working at the [[Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin|Royal Porcelain Factory]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; After his death, his widow donated his estate to the [[Latvian National Museum of Art|Riga City Art Museum]]. A major retrospective was held at their new building in 1906.

'''HUGE Improv Theater''' is a [[Minneapolis]] theater founded in 2005 dedicated to long form [[improvisational theater]]. The non-profit theater acquired its own building in 2010, where it runs scheduled nightly improv performances, acts as one of the [[Minnesota Fringe Festival]]'s venues, and hosts the annual Twin Cities Improv Festival.

{{About|the epic poem}}
{{Trojan War}}
{{Italic title}}
The '''''Iliad''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|l|i|ə|d}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Iliad "Iliad"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|Ἰλιάς}} ''{{transl|grc|Iliás}}'', {{IPA-el|iː.li.ás|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]; sometimes referred to as the '''''Song of Ilion''''' or '''''Song of Ilium''''') is an [[ancient Greek]]  [[epic poem]] in [[dactylic hexameter]], traditionally attributed to [[Homer]]. Set during the [[Trojan War]], the ten-year [[siege]] of the city of [[Troy]] (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King [[Agamemnon]] and the warrior [[Achilles]].

Although the story covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war, the ''Iliad'' mentions or alludes to many of the Greek legends about the siege; the earlier events, such as the gathering of [[warriors]] for the siege, the cause of the [[war]], and related concerns tend to appear near the beginning. Then the epic narrative takes up events prophesied for the future, such as Achilles' imminent death and the fall of Troy, although the narrative ends before these events take place. However, as these events are prefigured and alluded to more and more vividly, when it reaches an end the poem has told a more or less complete tale of the Trojan War.

The ''Iliad'' is paired with something of a [[sequel]], the ''[[Odyssey]]'', also attributed to Homer. Along with the ''Odyssey'', the ''Iliad'' is among the oldest extant works of [[Western literature]], and its written version is usually dated to around the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Vidal-Naquet|Vidal-Naquet, Pierre]]. ''Le monde d'Homère'' (The World of Homer), Perrin (2000), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern vulgate (the standard accepted version), the ''Iliad'' contains 15,693 lines; it is written in [[Homeric Greek]], a literary amalgam of [[Ionic Greek]] and other [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialects]]. According to [[Michael N. Nagler]], the ''Iliad'' is a more complicated epic poem than the ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14932229|title=Approaches to teaching Homer's Iliad and Odyssey|date=1987|publisher=Modern Language Association of America|others=Myrsiades, Kostas., Modern Language Association of America.|isbn=0873524993|location=New York|oclc=14932229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Beginning Iliad.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The first verses of the ''Iliad'']]
:''Note: Book numbers are in parentheses and come before the synopsis of the book.''

({{Iliad|en|1}}) After an [[invocation]] to the [[Muse]]s, the story launches ''[[in medias res]]'' towards the end of the Trojan War between the Trojans and the besieging [[Greeks]]. [[Chryses]], a Trojan priest of [[Apollo]], offers the Greeks wealth for the return of his daughter [[Chryseis]], held captive of [[Agamemnon]], the Greek leader. Although most of the Greek army is in favour of the offer, Agamemnon refuses. Chryses &lt;!--THIS IS NOT A TYPO--&gt; prays for Apollo's help, and Apollo causes a plague to afflict the Greek army.

After nine days of plague, [[Achilles]], the leader of the [[Myrmidons|Myrmidon]] contingent, calls an assembly to deal with the problem. Under pressure, Agamemnon agrees to return Chryseis to her father, but decides to take Achilles' captive, [[Briseis | Brisēís]], as compensation. Angered, Achilles declares that he and his men will no longer fight for Agamemnon and will go home. [[Odysseus]] takes a ship and returns Chryseis to her father, whereupon Apollo ends the plague.

In the meantime, Agamemnon's messengers take Briseis away. Achilles becomes very upset, sits by the seashore, and prays to his mother, [[Thetis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Homer|title=The Iliad|page=115|publisher= Norton Books|location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles asks his mother to ask [[Zeus]] to bring the Greeks to the breaking point by the Trojans, so Agamemnon will realize how much the Greeks need Achilles. Thetis does so, and Zeus agrees.

({{Iliad|en|2}}) Zeus sends a dream to Agamemnon, urging him to attack Troy. Agamemnon heeds the dream but decides to first test the Greek army's morale, by telling them to go home. The plan backfires, and only the intervention of Odysseus, inspired by [[Athena]], stops a rout.

Odysseus confronts and beats [[Thersites]], a common soldier who voices discontent about fighting Agamemnon's war. After a meal, the Greeks deploy in companies upon the Trojan plain. The poet takes the opportunity to describe the provenance of each Greek contingent.

When news of the Greek deployment reaches King [[Priam]], the Trojans too sortie upon the plain. In a list similar to that for the Greeks, the poet describes the Trojans and their allies.

({{Iliad|en|3}}) The armies approach each other, but before they meet, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] offers to end the war by fighting a duel with [[Menelaus]], urged by his brother and head of the Trojan army, [[Hector]]. While [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] tells Priam about the Greek commanders from the walls of Troy, both sides swear a truce and promise to abide by the outcome of the duel. Paris is beaten, but [[Aphrodite]] rescues him and leads him to bed with Helen before Menelaus can kill him.

({{Iliad|en|4}}) Pressured by [[Hera]]'s hatred of Troy, Zeus arranges for the Trojan [[Pandarus|Pandaros]] to break the truce by wounding Menelaus with an arrow. Agamemnon rouses the Greeks, and battle is joined.

({{Iliad|en|5}}) In the fighting, [[Diomedes]] kills many Trojans, including Pandaros, and defeats [[Aeneas]], whom Aphrodite rescues, but Diomedes attacks and wounds the goddess. Apollo faces Diomedes and warns him against warring with gods. Many heroes and commanders join in, including [[Hector]], and the gods supporting each side try to influence the battle. Emboldened by Athena, Diomedes wounds [[Ares]] and puts him out of action.

({{Iliad|en|6}}) Hector rallies the Trojans and prevents a rout; the Greek Diomedes and the Trojan [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaukos]] find common ground and exchange unequal gifts. Hector enters the city, urges prayers and sacrifices, incites Paris to battle, bids his wife [[Andromache]] and son [[Astyanax]] farewell on the city walls, and rejoins the battle.

({{Iliad|en|7}}) Hector duels with [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], but nightfall interrupts the fight, and both sides retire. The Greeks agree to burn their dead, and build a wall to protect their ships and camp, while the Trojans quarrel about returning Helen. Paris offers to return the treasure he took and give further wealth as compensation, but not Helen, and the offer is refused.
A day's truce is agreed for burning the dead, during which the Greeks also build their wall and a trench.

({{Iliad|en|8}}) The next morning, Zeus prohibits the gods from interfering, and fighting begins anew. The Trojans prevail and force the Greeks back to their wall, while Hera and Athena are forbidden to help. Night falls before the Trojans can assail the Greek wall. They camp in the field to attack at first light, and their watchfires light the plain like stars.

[[File:Iliad VIII 245-253 in cod F205, Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, late 5c or early 6c.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Iliad'', Book VIII, lines 245–53, Greek manuscript, late 5th, early 6th centuries AD.]]
({{Iliad|en|9}}) Meanwhile, the Greeks are desperate. Agamemnon admits his error, and sends an embassy composed of Odysseus, Ajax, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]], and two heralds to offer Briseis and extensive gifts to Achilles, who has been camped next to his ships throughout, if only he will return to the fighting. Achilles and his companion [[Patroclus]] receive the embassy well, but Achilles angrily refuses Agamemnon's offer and declares that he would only return to battle if the Trojans reached his ships and threatened them with fire. The embassy returns empty-handed.

({{Iliad|en|10}}) Later that night, Odysseus and Diomedes venture out to the Trojan lines, kill the Trojan [[Dolon (mythology)|Dolon]], and wreak havoc in the camps of some [[Thracian]] allies of Troy's.

({{Iliad|en|11}}) In the morning, the fighting is fierce, and Agamemnon, Diomedes, and Odysseus are all wounded. Achilles sends Patroclus from his camp to inquire about the Greek casualties, and while there Patroclus is moved to pity by a speech of [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s.

({{Iliad|en|12}}) The Trojans attack the Greek wall on foot. Hector, ignoring an omen, leads the terrible fighting. The Greeks are overwhelmed and routed, the wall's gate is broken, and Hector charges in.

({{Iliad|en|13}}) Many fall on both sides. The Trojan seer [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]] urges Hector to fall back and warns him about Achilles, but is ignored.

({{Iliad|en|14}}) Hera [[seduce]]s Zeus and lures him to sleep, allowing [[Poseidon]] to help the Greeks, and the Trojans are driven back onto the plain.

({{Iliad|en|15}}) Zeus awakes and is enraged by Poseidon's intervention. Against the mounting discontent of the Greek-supporting gods, Zeus sends Apollo to aid the Trojans, who once again breach the wall, and the battle reaches the ships.

({{Iliad|en|16}}) Patroclus cannot stand to watch any longer and begs Achilles to be allowed to defend the ships. Achilles relents and lends Patroclus his armor, but sends him off with a stern admonition not to pursue the Trojans, lest he take Achilles' glory. Patroclus leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle and arrives as the Trojans set fire to the first ships. The Trojans are routed by the sudden onslaught, and Patroclus begins his assault by killing Zeus's son [[Sarpedon]], a leading ally of the Trojans. Patroclus, ignoring Achilles' command, pursues and reaches the gates of Troy, where Apollo himself stops him. Patroclus is set upon by Apollo and [[Euphorbos]], and is finally killed by Hector.

({{Iliad|en|17}}) Hector takes Achilles' armor from the fallen Patroclus, but fighting develops around Patroclus' body.

({{Iliad|en|18}}) Achilles is mad with grief when he hears of Patroclus' death and vows to take vengeance on Hector; his mother Thetis grieves, too, knowing that Achilles is fated to die young if he kills Hector. Achilles is urged to help retrieve Patroclus' body but has no armour. Bathed in a brilliant radiance by Athena, Achilles stands next to the Greek wall and roars in rage. The Trojans are dismayed by his appearance, and the Greeks manage to bear Patroclus' body away. Polydamas urges Hector again to withdraw into the city; again Hector refuses, and the Trojans camp on the plain at nightfall. Patroclus is mourned. Meanwhile, at Thetis' request, [[Hephaestus]] fashions a new set of armor for Achilles, including a [[Shield of Achilles|magnificently wrought shield]].

({{Iliad|en|19}}) In the morning, Agamemnon gives Achilles all the promised gifts, including Briseis, but Achilles is indifferent to them. Achilles fasts while the Greeks take their meal, straps on his new armor, and heaves{{clarify|date=September 2016}} his great spear. His horse [[Balius and Xanthus|Xanthos]] prophesies to Achilles his death. Achilles drives his chariot into battle.

({{Iliad|en|20}}) [[Zeus]] lifts the ban on the gods' interference, and the gods freely help both sides. Achilles, burning with rage and grief, slays many.

({{Iliad|en|21}}) Driving the Trojans before him, Achilles cuts off half their number in the river [[Scamander|Skamandros]] and proceeds to slaughter them, filling the river with the dead. The river, angry at the killing, confronts Achilles but is beaten back by Hephaestus' firestorm. The gods fight among themselves. The great gates of the city are opened to receive the fleeing Trojans, and Apollo leads Achilles away from the city by pretending to be a Trojan.

({{Iliad|en|22}}) When Apollo reveals himself to Achilles, the Trojans have retreated into the city, all except for Hector, who, having twice ignored the counsels of Polydamas, feels the shame of the rout and resolves to face Achilles, despite the pleas of his parents, Priam and [[Hecuba]]. When Achilles approaches, Hector's will fails him, and he is chased around the city by Achilles. Finally, Athena tricks him into stopping, and he turns to face his opponent.  After a brief duel, Achilles stabs Hector through the neck.  Before dying, Hector reminds Achilles that he, too, is fated to die in the war. Achilles takes Hector's body and dishonours it by dragging it behind his chariot.

({{Iliad|en|23}}) The ghost of Patroclus comes to Achilles in a dream, urging him to carry out his burial rites and to arrange for their bones to be entombed together. The Greeks hold a day of funeral games, and Achilles gives out the prizes.

({{Iliad|en|24}}) Dismayed by Achilles' continued abuse of Hector's body, Zeus decides that it must be returned to Priam. Led by [[Hermes]], Priam takes a wagon out of Troy, across the plains, and into the Greek camp unnoticed. He clasps Achilles by the knees and begs for his son's body. Achilles is moved to tears, and the two lament their losses in the war. After a meal, Priam carries Hector's body back into Troy. Hector is buried, and the city mourns.

Much debate has surrounded the nature of the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus, as to whether it can be described as a homoerotic one or not. Classical and Hellenistic Athenian scholars perceived it as [[pederasty|pederastic]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]] does portray it so in Fragment 134a.&lt;/ref&gt; while others perceived it as a platonic warrior-bond.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, S. and Spawforth, A.

===Gods===
In the literary [[Trojan War]] of the ''Iliad'', the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods, goddesses, and minor deities]] fight among themselves and participate in human warfare, often by interfering with humans to counter other gods. Unlike their portrayals in Greek religion, Homer's portrayal of gods suited his narrative purpose. The gods in traditional thought of fourth-century Athenians were not spoken of in terms familiar to us from Homer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Honor Thy Gods: Popular Religion in Greek Tragedy|last=Mikalson|first=Jon|publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical-era historian [[Herodotus]] says that Homer and [[Hesiod]], his contemporary, were the first writers to name and describe the gods' appearance and character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/netshots/homer.htm Homer's Iliad], Classical Technology Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Greek Gods Human Lives: What We Can Learn From Myths'', [[Mary Lefkowitz]] discusses the relevance of divine action in the ''Iliad'', attempting to answer the question of whether or not divine intervention is a discrete occurrence (for its own sake), or if such godly behaviors are mere human character metaphors. The intellectual interest of Classic-era authors, such as [[Thucydides]] and [[Plato]], was limited to their utility as "a way of talking about human life rather than a description or a truth", because, if the gods remain religious figures, rather than human metaphors, their "existence"—without the foundation of either dogma or ''a'' bible of faiths—then allowed Greek culture the intellectual breadth and freedom to conjure gods fitting any religious function they required as a people.&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, Mary. ''Greek Gods, Human Lives: What We Can Learn From Myths'' (2003) New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taplin, Oliver. "Bring Back the Gods", ''The New York Times'' 14 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion had no founder and was not the creation of an inspired teacher which were popular origins of existing religions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion:A Study in Survivals|last=Lawson|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|page=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals were free to believe what they wanted, as the Greek religion was created out of a consensus of the people. These beliefs coincide to the thoughts about the gods in polytheistic Greek religion. In the article "Greek Religion" A.W.H. Adkins, agrees with this by saying, “The early Greeks personalized every aspect of their world, natural and cultural, and their experiences in it. The earth, the sea, the mountains, the rivers, custom-law (themis), and one’s share in society and its goods were all seen in personal as well as naturalistic terms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-religion|title=Greek religion {{!}} ancient religion|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this thinking, each god or goddess in Polytheistic Greek religion is attributed to an aspect of the human world. For example, [[Poseidon]] is the god of the sea, [[Aphrodite]] is the goddess of beauty, [[Ares]] is the god of war, and so on and so forth for many other gods. This is how Greek culture was defined as many Athenians felt the presence of their gods through divine intervention in significant events in their lives. Oftentimes they found these events to be mysterious and inexplicable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In ''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind'', psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]] uses the ''Iliad'' as a major piece of evidence for his theory of [[Bicameralism (psychology)|Bicameralism]], which posits that until about the time described in the ''Iliad'', humans had a much different mentality than present day humans. He says that humans during that time were lacking what we today call consciousness. He suggests that humans heard and obeyed commands from what they identified as gods, until the change in human mentality that incorporated the motivating force into the conscious self. He points out that almost every action in the ''Iliad'' is directed, caused, or influenced by a god, and that earlier translations show an astonishing lack of words suggesting thought, planning, or introspection. Those that do appear, he argues, are misinterpretations made by translators imposing a modern mentality on the characters.&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, Julian. (1976) ''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind''. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Divine intervention ====
Some scholars believe that the gods may have intervened in the mortal world because of quarrels they may have had among each other. [[Homer]] interprets the world at this time by using the passion and emotion of the gods to be determining factors of what happens on the human level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kullmann|first=Wolfgang|date=1985-01-01|title=Gods and Men in the Iliad and the Odyssey|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=89|pages=1–23|doi=10.2307/311265|jstor=311265}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of one of these relationships in the ''Iliad'' occurs between [[Athena]], [[Hera]], and Aphrodite. In the final book of the poem Homer writes, “He offended Athena and Hera&amp;mdash;both goddesses.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Iliad|last=Homer|first=|last2=Fagles|first2=Robert|last3=Knox|first3=Bernard|publisher=New York, N.Y: Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=|location=|page=589|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athena and Hera are envious of Aphrodite because of a beauty pageant on Mount Olympus in which [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose Aphrodite to be the most beautiful goddess over both Hera and Athena. Wolfgang Kullmann further goes on to say, “Hera’s and Athena’s disappointment over the victory of Aphrodite in the Judgement of Paris determines the whole conduct of both goddesses in ''The Iliad'' and is the cause of their hatred for Paris, the Judge, and his town Troy.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hera and Athena then continue to support the Achaean forces throughout the poem because Paris is part of the Trojans, while Aphrodite aids Paris and the Trojans. The emotions between the goddesses often translate to actions they take in the mortal world. For example, in Book 3 of The Iliad, Paris challenges any of the Achaeans to a single combat and [[Menelaus]] steps forward. Menelaus was dominating the battle and was on the verge of killing Paris. “Now he’d have hauled him off and won undying glory but Aphrodite, Zeus’s daughter was quick to the mark, snapped the rawhide strap.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aphrodite intervened out of her own self-interest to save Paris from the wrath of Menelaus because Paris had helped her to win the beauty pageant. The partisanship of Aphrodite towards Paris induces constant intervention by all of the gods, especially to give motivational speeches to their respective proteges, while often appearing in the shape of a human being they are familiar with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This connection of emotions to actions is just one example out of many that occur throughout the poem.

===Fate===
[[Destiny|Fate]] ({{lang|grc|κήρ}}, ''kēr'', "fated death") propels most of the events of the ''Iliad''. Once set, gods and men abide it, neither truly able nor willing to contest it. How fate is set is unknown, but it is told by the [[Moerae|Fates]] and by [[Zeus]] through sending omens to seers such as [[Calchas]]. Men and their gods continually speak of heroic acceptance and cowardly avoidance of one's slated fate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1375344 Fate as presented in Homer's "The Iliad"], Everything2&lt;/ref&gt; Fate does not determine every action, incident, and occurrence, but it does determine the outcome of life—before killing him, Hector calls Patroclus a fool {{citation needed span|for cowardly avoidance of his fate, by attempting his defeat;|date=November 2016}} Patroclus retorts:
&lt;ref&gt;[http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/homer.htm Iliad Study Guide], Brooklyn College {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205014548/http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/homer.htm |date=December 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No, deadly destiny, with the son of Leto, has killed me,&lt;br /&gt;
and of men it was Euphorbos; you are only my third slayer.&lt;br /&gt;
And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;
You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already&lt;br /&gt;
death and powerful destiny are standing beside you,&lt;br /&gt;
to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 16.849–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Patroclus alludes to fated death by Hector's hand, and Hector's fated death by Achilles's hand. Each accepts the outcome of his life, yet, no-one knows if the gods can alter fate. The first instance of this doubt occurs in Book XVI. Seeing Patroclus about to kill [[Sarpedon]], his mortal son, Zeus says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ah me, that it is destined that the dearest of men, Sarpedon,&lt;br /&gt;
must go down under the hands of Menoitios' son Patroclus.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 16.433–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About his dilemma, Hera asks Zeus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since&lt;br /&gt;
doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?&lt;br /&gt;
Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 16.440–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In deciding between losing a son or abiding fate, Zeus, King of the Gods, allows it. This motif recurs when he considers sparing Hector, whom he loves and respects. This time, it is Athene who challenges him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Father of the shining bolt, dark misted, what is this you said?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since&lt;br /&gt;
doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?&lt;br /&gt;
Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 22.178–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, Zeus appears capable of altering fate, but does not, deciding instead to abide set outcomes; yet, contrariwise, fate spares Aeneas, after Apollo convinces the over-matched Trojan to fight Achilles. Poseidon cautiously speaks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But come, let us ourselves get him away from death, for fear&lt;br /&gt;
the son of Kronos may be angered if now Achilleus&lt;br /&gt;
kills this man. It is destined that he shall be the survivor,&lt;br /&gt;
that the generation of Dardanos shall not die&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 20.300–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Divinely aided, Aeneas escapes the wrath of Achilles and survives the Trojan War. Whether or not the gods can alter fate, they do abide it, despite its countering their human allegiances; thus, the mysterious origin of fate is a power beyond the gods. Fate implies the primeval, tripartite division of the world that Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades effected in deposing their father, [[Cronus]], for its dominion. Zeus took the Air and the Sky, Poseidon the Waters, and Hades the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], the land of the dead—yet they share dominion of the Earth. Despite the earthly powers of the Olympic gods, only the Three Fates set the destiny of Man.

===Kleos===
''[[Kleos]]'' ({{lang|grc|κλέος}}, "glory, fame") is the concept of [[:wikt:glory|glory]] earned in heroic battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athome.harvard.edu/programs/nagy/threads/concept_of_hero.html |title=The Concept of the Hero in Greek Civilization |publisher=Athome.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421140227/http://athome.harvard.edu/programs/nagy/threads/concept_of_hero.html |archivedate=2010-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Achilles must choose only one of the two rewards, either ''nostos'' or ''kleos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/~cldue/texts/introductiontohomer.html |title=Heroes and the Homeric Iliad |publisher=Uh.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book IX (IX.410–16), he poignantly tells Agamemnon's envoys—Odysseus, Phoenix, Ajax—begging his reinstatement to battle about having to choose between two fates ({{lang|grc|διχθαδίας κήρας}}, 9.411).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Volk, Katharina. "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1215546 ΚΛΕΟΣ ΑΦΘΙΤΟΝ Revisited]". ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 97, No. 1 (Jan., 2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;61–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage reads:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|
{{lang|grc|μήτηρ γάρ τέ μέ φησι θεὰ Θέτις ἀργυρόπεζα (410)
διχθαδίας κῆρας φερέμεν θανάτοιο τέλος δέ.
εἰ μέν κ’ αὖθι μένων Τρώων πόλιν ἀμφιμάχωμαι,
ὤλετο μέν μοι νόστος, ἀτὰρ κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται
εἰ δέ κεν οἴκαδ’ ἵκωμι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν,
ὤλετό μοι κλέος ἐσθλόν, ἐπὶ δηρὸν δέ μοι αἰὼν (415)
ἔσσεται, οὐδέ κέ μ’ ὦκα τέλος θανάτοιο κιχείη.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|en|9|410|416}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|attr2=Translated by [[Richmond Lattimore]]|
For my mother [[Thetis]] the goddess of silver feet tells me
I carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death.  Either,
if I stay here and fight beside the city of the Trojans,
my return home is gone, but my glory shall be everlasting;
but if I return home to the beloved land of my fathers,
the excellence of my glory is gone, but there will be a long life
left for me, and my end in death will not come to me quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In forgoing his ''nostos'', he will earn the greater reward of ''kleos aphthiton'' ({{lang|grc|κλέος ἄφθιτον}}, "fame imperishable").&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In the poem, ''aphthiton'' ({{lang|grc|ἄφθιτον}}, "imperishable") occurs five other times,&lt;ref&gt;II.46, V.724, XIII.22, XIV.238, XVIII.370&lt;/ref&gt; each occurrence denotes an object: Agamemnon's sceptre, the wheel of [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]'s chariot, the house of Poseidon, the throne of Zeus, the house of [[Hephaestus]]. Translator [[Richmond Lattimore|Lattimore]] renders ''kleos aphthiton'' as ''forever immortal'' and as ''forever imperishable''—connoting Achilles's mortality by underscoring his greater reward in returning to battle Troy.

Kleos is often given visible representation by the prizes won in battle. When Agamemnon takes Briseis from Achilles, he takes away a portion of the kleos he had earned.

Achilles' shield, crafted by Hephaestus and given to him by his mother Thetis, bears an image of stars in the centre. The stars conjure profound images of the place of a single man, no matter how heroic, in the perspective of the entire cosmos.

===Nostos===
''[[Nostos]]'' ({{lang|grc|νόστος}}, "homecoming") occurs seven times in the poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|en|2|155}}, {{Iliad|en|2|251}}, {{Iliad|en|9|413}}, {{Iliad|en|9|434}}, {{Iliad|en|9|622}}, {{Iliad|en|10|509}}, {{Iliad|en|16|82}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it a minor theme in the Iliad itself.  Yet the concept of homecoming is much explored in other Ancient Greek literature, especially in the post-war homeward fortunes experienced by the Atreidae (Agamemnon and Menelaus), and Odysseus (see the ''[[Odyssey]]'').

===Pride===

''[[Pride]]'' drives the plot of the Iliad. The Greeks gather on the plain of Troy to wrest Helen from the Trojans. Though the majority of the Trojans would gladly return Helen to the Greeks, they defer to the pride of their prince, Alexandros, also known as Paris. Within this frame, Homer’s work begins. At the start of the Iliad, Agamemnon’s pride sets forth a chain of events that leads him to take from Achilles, Briseis, the girl that he had originally given Achilles in return for his martial prowess. Due to this slight, Achilles refuses to fight and asks his mother, Thetis, to make sure that Zeus causes the Greeks to suffer on the battlefield until Agamemnon comes to realize the harm he has done to Achilles. Achilles’ pride allows him to beg Thetis for the deaths of his Greek friends and countrymen. When in Book 9 his friends urge him to return, offering him loot and his girl, Briseis, he refuses, stuck in his vengeful pride. Achilles remains stuck until the very end, when his anger at himself for Patroclus’ death overcomes his pride at Agamemnon’s slight and he returns to kill Hector. He overcomes his pride again when he keeps his anger in check and returns Hector to Priam at epic’s close. From epic start to epic finish, pride drives the plot.&lt;ref&gt;In “An Origin of a Theory: A Comparison of Ethos in the Homeric Iliad with That Found in Aristotle’s Rhetoric.” Rhetoric Review, vol. 22, no. 1, 2003, pp. 16-30, T.S. Frobish writes that the war starts with his pride and immaturity, yet is finished with his skill and bravery on the battlefield” (24).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timê===
Akin to ''kleos'' is ''timê'' ({{lang|grc|τιμή}}, "respect, honor"), the concept denoting the respectability an honorable man accrues with accomplishment (cultural, political, martial), per his station in life. In Book I, the Greek troubles begin with King Agamemnon's dishonorable, unkingly behavior—first, by threatening the priest Chryses (1.11), then, by aggravating them in disrespecting Achilles, by confiscating Briseis from him (1.171). The warrior's consequent rancor against the dishonorable king ruins the Greek military cause.

===Hybris===

''Hybris'' (''Ὕβρις'') plays a part similar to ''timê.'' The epic takes as its thesis the anger of Achilles and the destruction it brings. Anger disturbs the distance between human beings and the gods. Uncontrolled anger destroys orderly social relationships and upsets the balance of correct actions necessary to keep the gods away from human beings. (footnote Thompson). Despite the epic’s focus on Achilles’ rage, hybris plays a prominent role also, serving as both kindling and fuel for many destructive events. Agamemnon refuses to ransom Chriseis up out of hybris and harms Achilles’ pride when he demands Briseis. Hybris forces Paris to fight against Menelaus. Agamemnon spurs the Greeks to fight, by calling into question Odysseus, Diomedes, and Nestor’s pride, asking why they were cowering and waiting for help when they should be the ones leading the charge. While the events of the Iliad focus on the Achilles’ rage and the destruction it brings on, hybris fuels and stokes them both.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Diane P. “Achilles’ Wrath and the Plan of Zeus.”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menis===
[[File:Wrath of Achilles2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''The Wrath of Achilles'' (1819), by Michel Drolling.]]

The poem's initial word, {{lang|grc|μῆνιν}} (''mēnin'', [[accusative]] of {{lang|grc|μῆνις}}, ''mēnis'', "wrath, rage, fury"), establishes the ''Iliad's'' principal theme: The "Wrath of Achilles".&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, W.H.D. ''The Iliad'' (1938) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; His personal rage and wounded soldier's vanity propel the story: the Greeks' faltering in battle, the slayings of Patroclus and Hector, and the fall of Troy. In Book I, the Wrath of Achilles first emerges in the Achilles-convoked meeting, between the Greek kings and the seer [[Calchas]]. King Agamemnon dishonours Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, by refusing with a threat the restitution of his daughter, Chryseis—despite the proffered ransom of "gifts beyond count".&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad'', Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 1.13.&lt;/ref&gt; The insulted priest prays his god's help, and a nine-day rain of divine plague arrows falls upon the Greeks. Moreover, in that meeting, Achilles accuses Agamemnon of being "greediest for gain of all men".&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad'', Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 1.122.&lt;/ref&gt; To that, Agamemnon replies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But here is my threat to you.&lt;br /&gt;
Even as Phoibos Apollo is taking away my Chryseis.&lt;br /&gt;
I shall convey her back in my own ship, with my own&lt;br /&gt;
followers; but I shall take the fair-cheeked Briseis,&lt;br /&gt;
your prize, I myself going to your shelter, that you may learn well&lt;br /&gt;
how much greater I am than you, and another man may shrink back&lt;br /&gt;
from likening himself to me and contending against me.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 1.181–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After that, only Athena stays Achilles's wrath. He vows to never again obey orders from Agamemnon. Furious, Achilles cries to his mother, Thetis, who persuades Zeus's divine intervention—favouring the Trojans—until Achilles's rights are restored. Meanwhile, Hector leads the Trojans to almost pushing the Greeks back to the sea (Book XII). Later, Agamemnon contemplates defeat and retreat to Greece (Book XIV). Again, the Wrath of Achilles turns the war's tide in seeking vengeance when Hector kills Patroclus. Aggrieved, Achilles tears his hair and dirties his face. Thetis comforts her mourning son, who tells her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So it was here that the lord of men Agamemnon angered me.&lt;br /&gt;
Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, and for all our&lt;br /&gt;
sorrow beat down by force the anger deeply within us.&lt;br /&gt;
Now I shall go, to overtake that killer of a dear life,&lt;br /&gt;
Hektor; then I will accept my own death, at whatever&lt;br /&gt;
time Zeus wishes to bring it about, and the other immortals.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad''. Richmond Lattimore, translator. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1951). 18.111–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accepting the prospect of death as fair price for avenging Patroclus, he returns to battle, dooming Hector and Troy, thrice chasing him 'round the Trojan walls, before slaying him, then dragging the corpse behind his chariot, back to camp.

The poem dates to the [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] period of [[Classical Antiquity]]. Scholarly consensus mostly places it in the 8th century BC, although some favour a 7th-century date. [[Herodotus]], having consulted the [[Oracle]] at [[Dodona]], placed Homer and [[Hesiod]] at approximately 400 years before his own time, which would place them at c.850 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus (de Sélincourt 1954), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical backdrop of the poem is the time of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], in the early 12th century BC. Homer is thus separated from his subject matter by about 400 years, the period known as the [[Greek Dark Ages]]. Intense scholarly debate has surrounded the question of which portions of the poem preserve genuine traditions from the [[Mycenaean period]]. The ''[[Catalogue of Ships]]'' in particular has the striking feature that its geography does not portray Greece in the [[Iron Age]], the time of Homer, but as it was before the [[Dorian invasion]].

The title {{lang|grc|Ἰλιάς}} "Ilias" (genitive {{lang|grc|Ἰλιάδος}} "Iliados") is elliptic for {{lang|grc|ἡ ποίησις Ἰλιάς}} "he poíesis Iliás", meaning "the Trojan poem". {{lang|grc|Ἰλιάς}}, "of Troy", is the specifically feminine adjective form from {{lang|grc|Ἴλιον}}, "Troy"; the masculine adjective form would be {{lang|grc|Ἰλιακός}} or {{lang|grc|Ἴλιος}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*)ilia/s|Ἰλιάς}}, {{LSJ|*)iliako/s|Ἰλιακός}}, {{LSJ|*)/ilios|Ἴλιος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Hist.]]'' 2.116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Venetus A]], copied in the 10th century AD, is the oldest fully extant manuscript of the ''Iliad.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/news/2007/06/iliad_scan Robot Scans Ancient Manuscript in 3-D], Wired.{{unreliablesource|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Iliad'' as oral tradition===
In antiquity, the Greeks applied the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' as the bases of [[pedagogy]]. Literature was central to the educational-cultural function of the itinerant [[rhapsode]], who composed ''consistent'' epic poems from memory and improvisation, and disseminated them, via song and chant, in his travels and at the [[Panathenaic Festival]] of athletics, music, poetics, and sacrifice, celebrating [[Athena]]'s birthday.&lt;ref&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition (1994) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Classical scholars treated the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' as written poetry, and Homer as a writer. Yet, by the 1920s, [[Milman Parry]] (1902–1935) had launched a movement claiming otherwise. His investigation of the oral Homeric style—"stock epithets" and "reiteration" (words, phrases, stanzas)—established that these ''formulae'' were artifacts of [[oral tradition]] easily applied to an [[hexameter|hexametric]] line. A two-word stock epithet (e.g. "resourceful Odysseus") reiteration may complement a character name by filling a half-line, thus, freeing the poet to compose a half-line of "original" formulaic text to complete his meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, John. ''The Iliad as Oral Formulaic Poetry'' (8 May 2006)  University of Saskatchewan. Retrieved 26 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Yugoslavia, Parry and his assistant, [[Albert Lord]] (1912–1991), studied the oral-formulaic composition of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] oral poetry, yielding the [[Parry/Lord thesis]] that established [[oral tradition]] studies, later developed by [[Eric Havelock]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Walter Ong]], and [[Gregory Nagy]].

In ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'' (1960), Lord presents likenesses between the tragedies of the Greek Patroclus, in the ''Iliad'', and of the [[Sumer]]ian [[Enkidu]], in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', and claims to refute, with "careful analysis of the repetition of thematic patterns", that the Patroclus storyline upsets Homer's established compositional formulae of "wrath, bride-stealing, and rescue"; thus, stock-phrase ''reiteration'' does not restrict his originality in fitting story to rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Albert. ''The Singer of Tales'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press (1960) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Albert. ''The Singer of Tales'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press (1960) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, in ''The Arming Motif'', Prof. James Armstrong reports that the poem's ''formulae'' yield richer meaning because the "arming motif" ''diction''—describing Achilles, Agamemnon, Paris, and Patroclus—serves to "heighten the importance of&amp;nbsp;... an impressive moment", thus, "[reiteration] creates an atmosphere of smoothness", wherein, Homer distinguishes Patroclus from Achilles, and foreshadows the former's death with positive and negative turns of phrase.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'', Book XVI, 130–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, James I.  ''The Arming Motif in the Iliad''. The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 79, No. 4. (1958), pp. 337–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iliad'', occasional syntactic inconsistency may be an oral tradition effect—for example, Aphrodite is "laughter-loving", despite being painfully wounded by Diomedes (Book V, 375); and the divine representations may mix Mycenaean and [[Greek Dark Age]] (c. 1150–800 BC) mythologies, parallelling the hereditary ''basileis'' nobles (lower social rank rulers) with minor deities, such as [[Scamander]], et al.&lt;ref&gt;Toohey, Peter. ''Reading Epic: An Introduction to the Ancient Narrative''. New Fetter Lane, London: Routledge, (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warfare in the ''Iliad''==
===Depiction of infantry combat===
Despite Mycenae and Troy being maritime powers, the ''Iliad'' features no sea battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|en|3|45|shortref}}–50&lt;/ref&gt; So, the Trojan shipwright (of the ship that transported Helen to Troy), [[Phereclus]], fights afoot, as an infantryman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|5|59|shortref}}–65&lt;/ref&gt; The battle dress and armour of hero and soldier are well-described. They enter battle in [[chariot]]s, launching javelins into the enemy formations, then dismount—for hand-to-hand combat with yet more javelin throwing, rock throwing, and if necessary hand to hand sword and a shoulder-borne ''hoplon'' (shield) fighting.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]]. ''[[A History of Warfare]]'' (1993) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax the Greater, son of Telamon, sports a large, rectangular shield ({{lang|grc|σάκος}}, ''sakos'') with which he protects himself and Teucer, his brother:

:Ninth came Teucer, stretching his curved bow.
:He stood beneath the shield of Ajax, son of Telamon.
:As Ajax cautiously pulled his shield aside,
:Teucer would peer out quickly, shoot off an arrow,
:hit someone in the crowd, dropping that soldier
:right where he stood, ending his life—then he'd duck back,
:crouching down by Ajax, like a child beside its mother.
:Ajax would then conceal him with his shining shield.
: (''Iliad'' 8.267–72, Ian Johnston, translator)

Ajax's cumbersome shield is more suitable for defence than for offence, while his cousin, Achilles, sports a large, rounded, octagonal shield that he successfully deploys along with his spear against the Trojans:

:Just as a man constructs a wall for some high house,
:using well-fitted stones to keep out forceful winds,
:that's how close their helmets and bossed shields lined up,
:shield pressing against shield, helmet against helmet
:man against man. On the bright ridges of the helmets,
:horsehair plumes touched when warriors moved their heads.
:That's how close they were to one another.
: (''Iliad'' 16.213–17, Ian Johnston, translator)

In describing infantry combat, Homer names the [[phalanx formation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Iliad|en|6|6|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most scholars do not believe the historical Trojan War was so fought.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, Tomas. ''Sailing the Wine Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bronze Age]], the chariot was the main battle transport-weapon (e.g. the [[Battle of Kadesh]]). The available evidence, from the Dendra armour and the Pylos Palace paintings, indicate the Mycenaeans used two-man chariots, with a long-spear-armed principal rider, unlike the three-man Hittite chariots with short-spear-armed riders, and unlike the arrow-armed Egyptian and Assyrian two-man chariots. Nestor spearheads his troops with chariots; he advises them:

:In your eagerness to engage the Trojans,
:don't any of you charge ahead of others,
:trusting in your strength and horsemanship.
:And don't lag behind. That will hurt our charge.
:Any man whose chariot confronts an enemy's
:should thrust with his spear at him from there.
:That's the most effective tactic, the way
:men wiped out city strongholds long ago —
:their chests full of that style and spirit.
: (''Iliad'' 4.301–09, Ian Johnston, translator)

Although Homer's depictions are graphic, it can be seen in the very end that victory in war is a far more somber occasion, where all that is lost becomes apparent. On the other hand, the funeral games are lively, for the dead man's life is celebrated. This overall depiction of war runs contrary to many other{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ancient Greek depictions, where war is an aspiration for greater glory.

===Influence on classical Greek warfare===
While the Homeric poems (the ''Iliad'' in particular) were not necessarily revered scripture of the ancient Greeks, they were most certainly seen as guides that were important to the intellectual understanding of any educated Greek citizen.  This is evidenced by the fact that in the late fifth century BC, "it was the sign of a man of standing to be able to recite the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' by heart."&lt;ref&gt;Lendon, J.E."Soldiers and Ghosts" (2005) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it can be argued that the warfare shown in the ''Iliad'', and the way in which it was depicted, had a profound and very traceable effect on Greek warfare in general. In particular, the effect of epic literature can be broken down into three categories: [[Military tactics|tactics]], [[ideology]], and the [[mindset]] of commanders.  In order to discern these effects, it is necessary to take a look at a few examples from each of these categories.

Much of the detailed fighting in the ''Iliad'' is done by the heroes in an orderly, one-on-one fashion.  Much like the ''Odyssey'', there is even a set ritual which must be observed in each of these conflicts.  For example, a major hero may encounter a lesser hero from the opposing side, in which case the minor hero is introduced, threats may be exchanged, and then the minor hero is slain.  The victor often strips the body of its armor and military accoutrements.&lt;ref&gt;Lendon, J.E. "Soldiers and Ghosts" (2005) pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Here is an example of this ritual and this type of one-on-one combat in the ''Iliad'':&lt;blockquote&gt;
There Telamonian Ajax struck down the son of Anthemion,
Simoeisios in his stripling's beauty, whom once his mother
descending from Ida bore beside the banks of Simoeis
when she had followed her father and mother to tend the
sheepflocks.
Therefore they called him Simoeisios; but he could not
render again the care of his dear parents; he was short-lived,
beaten down beneath the spear of high-hearted Ajax,
who struck him as he first came forward beside the nipple
of the right breast, and the bronze spearhead drove clean
through the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad''. 4.473–83, Lattimore, translator&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The biggest issue in reconciling the connection between the epic fighting of the ''Iliad'' and later Greek warfare is the phalanx, or hoplite, warfare seen in Greek history well after Homer's ''Iliad''.  While there are discussions of soldiers arrayed in semblances of the phalanx throughout the ''Iliad'', the focus of the poem on the heroic fighting, as mentioned above, would seem to contradict the tactics of the phalanx.  However, the phalanx did have its heroic aspects. The masculine one-on-one fighting of epic is manifested in phalanx fighting on the emphasis of holding one's position in formation.  This replaces the singular heroic competition found in the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Lendon, J.E. "Soldiers and Ghosts" (2005) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of this is the Spartan tale of 300 picked men fighting against 300 picked Argives.  In this battle of champions, only two men are left standing for the Argives and one for the Spartans.  Othryades, the remaining Spartan, goes back to stand in his formation with mortal wounds while the remaining two Argives go back to Argos to report their victory.  Thus, the Spartans claimed this as a victory, as their last man displayed the ultimate feat of bravery by maintaining his position in the phalanx.&lt;ref&gt;{{Anabasis|6|5|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the ideology of commanders in later Greek history, the ''Iliad'' has an interesting effect.  The ''Iliad'' expresses a definite disdain for tactical trickery, when Hector says, before he challenges the great Ajax: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I know how to storm my way into the struggle of flying horses; I know how to tread the measures on the grim floor of the war god. Yet great as you are I would not strike you by stealth, watching for my chance, but openly, so, if perhaps I might hit you.&lt;ref&gt;(''Iliad''. 7.237–43, Lattimore, translator)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, despite examples of disdain for this tactical trickery, there is reason to believe that the ''Iliad'', as well as later Greek warfare, endorsed tactical genius on the part of their commanders.  For example, there are multiple passages in the ''Iliad'' with commanders such as Agamemnon or Nestor discussing the arraying of troops so as to gain an advantage.  Indeed, the Trojan War is won by a notorious example of Greek guile in the [[Trojan Horse]].  This is even later referred to by Homer in the ''Odyssey''.  The connection, in this case, between guileful tactics of the Greeks in the ''Iliad'' and those of the later Greeks is not a difficult one to find. Spartan commanders, often seen as the pinnacle of Greek military prowess, were known for their tactical trickery, and, for them, this was a feat to be desired in a commander. Indeed, this type of leadership was the standard advice of Greek tactical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Lendon, J.E. "Soldiers and Ghosts" (2005) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, while Homeric (or epic) fighting is certainly not completely replicated in later Greek warfare, many of its ideals, tactics, and instruction are.&lt;ref&gt;A large amount of the citations and argumentation in this section of the article must be ultimately attributed to:Lendon, J.E. ''Soldiers and Ghosts: A History of Battle in Classical Antiquity''. New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans van Wees argues that the period that the descriptions of warfare relate can be pinned down fairly specifically—to the first half of the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Greek Warfare: Myth and Realities [Paperback]

==Influence on the arts and literature==
{{Main article|Trojan War in popular culture}}
The ''Iliad'' was a standard work of great importance already in [[Classical Greece]] and remained so throughout the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods. Subjects from the Trojan War were a favourite among ancient Greek dramatists. [[Aeschylus]]' trilogy, the ''[[Oresteia]]'', comprising ''Agamemnon'', ''The Libation Bearers'' and ''The Eumenides'', follows the story of Agamemnon after his return from the war. Homer also came to be of great influence in European culture with the resurgence of interest in Greek antiquity during the [[Renaissance]], and it remains the first and most influential work of the [[Western canon]]. In its full form the text made its return to Italy and Western Europe beginning in the 15th century, primarily through translations into Latin and the vernacular languages. 

Prior to this reintroduction, however, a shortened Latin version of the poem, known as the ''[[Ilias Latina]]'', was very widely studied and read as a basic school text. The West tended to view Homer as unreliable as they believed they possessed much more down to earth and realistic eyewitness accounts of the Trojan War written by [[Dares]] and [[Dictys Cretensis]], who were supposedly present at the events. These [[late antique]] forged accounts formed the basis of several eminently popular [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[chivalric romance]]s, most notably those of [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]] and [[Guido delle Colonne]]. These in turn spawned many others in various European languages, such as the first printed English book, the 1473 ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye]]''. Other accounts read in the Middle Ages were antique Latin retellings such as the ''[[Excidium Troiae]]'' and works in the vernaculars such as the [[Trójumanna saga|Icelandic Troy Saga]]. Even without Homer, the Trojan War story had remained central to Western European [[medieval literature|medieval literary]] culture and its sense of identity. Most nations and several royal houses traced their origins to heroes at the [[Trojan War]]. Britain was supposedly settled by the Trojan [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], for instance.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[William Shakespeare]] used the plot of the ''Iliad'' as source material for his play ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', but focused on a medieval legend, the love story of [[Troilus]], son of King Priam of Troy, and [[Cressida]], daughter of the Trojan soothsayer Calchas. The play, often considered to be a comedy, reverses traditional views on events of the Trojan War and depicts Achilles as a coward, Ajax as a dull, unthinking mercenary, etc.

[[William Theed the elder]] made an impressive bronze statue of Thetis as she brought Achilles his new armor forged by Hephaesthus. It has been on display in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City since 2013.

[[Robert Browning]]'s poem ''Development'' discusses his childhood introduction to the matter of the ''Iliad'' and his delight in the epic, as well as contemporary debates about its authorship.

* ''The Rage of Achilles'', by American author and Yale Writers' Conference founder [[Terence Hawkins]], recounts the ''Iliad'' as a novel in modern, sometimes graphic language. Informed by [[Julian Jaynes]]' theory of the [[bicameral mind]] and the historicity of the [[Trojan War]], it depicts its characters as real men to whom the gods appear only as hallucinations or command voices during the sudden and painful transition to truly modern consciousness.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}
* ''The Righteous Dark'', by American author Jake Enholm, features a main character named Oddy based on [[Odysseus]] who is an artificial intelligence fighting other artificially intelligent beings in a war between two star systems in the future. The war lasts for ten years, and ends with Oddy defeating the Trojan-like enemy by embedding his own mind inside a disguised upgrade to the enemy's operating system.&lt;ref&gt;Enholm, Jake (2018), ''The Righteous Dark''.

==English translations==
[[File:Iliad1660Frontis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Wenceslas Hollar]]'s engraved title page of a 1660 edition of the ''Iliad'', translated by [[John Ogilby]].]]
{{further information|English translations of Homer}}
[[File:Iliad editions.jpg|thumb|Sampling of translations and editions of ''Iliad'' in English]]
[[George Chapman]] published his translation of the ''Iliad'', in installments, beginning in 1598, published in "fourteeners", a long-line ballad metre that "has room for all of Homer's figures of speech and plenty of new ones, as well as explanations in parentheses. At its best, as in Achilles' rejection of the embassy in ''Iliad'' Nine; it has great rhetorical power".&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Guide to English Literature in Translation, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly established itself as a classic in English poetry. In the preface to his own translation, Pope praises "the daring fiery spirit" of Chapman's rendering, which is "something like what one might imagine Homer, himself, would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion".

[[John Keats]] praised Chapman in the sonnet ''[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]'' (1816). [[John Ogilby]]'s mid-seventeenth-century translation is among the early [[annotated]] editions; [[Alexander Pope]]'s 1715 translation, in heroic couplet, is "The classic translation that was built on all the preceding versions",&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Guide to English Literature in Translation, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; and, like Chapman's, it is a major poetic work in its own right. [[William Cowper]]'s [[Miltonic]], blank verse 1791 edition is highly regarded for its greater fidelity to the Greek than either the Chapman or the Pope versions: "I have omitted nothing; I have invented nothing", Cowper says in prefacing his translation.

In the lectures ''[[On Translating Homer]]'' (1861), [[Matthew Arnold]] addresses the matters of translation and interpretation in rendering the ''Iliad'' to English; commenting upon the versions contemporarily available in 1861, he identifies the four ''essential'' poetic qualities of Homer to which the translator must do justice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[i] that he is eminently rapid; [ii] that he is eminently plain and direct, both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; [iii] that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, [iv] that he is eminently noble.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After a discussion of the metres employed by previous translators, Arnold argues for a poetical dialect hexameter translation of the ''Iliad'', like the original. "Laborious as this meter was, there were at least half a dozen attempts to translate the entire ''Iliad'' or ''Odyssey'' in hexameters; the last in 1945. Perhaps the most fluent of them was by [[J. Henry Dart]] [1862] in response to Arnold".&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Guide to English Literature in Translation, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, the American poet [[William Cullen Bryant]] published a blank verse version, that [[Van Wyck Brooks]] describes as "simple, faithful".

An 1898 translation by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] was published by Longmans. Butler had read [[Classics]] at Cambridge University, graduating during 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] – [http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/iliad-1898 The Iliad (1898)] [[Cambridge University]] [Retrieved 2016-06-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1950, there have been several English translations. [[Richmond Lattimore]]'s version (1951) is "a free six-beat" line-for-line rendering that explicitly eschews "poetical dialect" for "the plain English of today". It is literal, unlike older verse renderings. [[Robert Fitzgerald]]'s version ([[Oxford World's Classics]], 1974) strives to situate the ''Iliad'' in the musical forms of English poetry. His forceful version is freer, with shorter lines that increase the sense of swiftness and energy. [[Robert Fagles]] ([[Penguin Classics]], 1990) and [[Stanley Lombardo]] (1997) are bolder than Lattimore in adding dramatic significance to Homer's conventional and formulaic language. [[Rodney Merrill]]'s translation ([[University of Michigan Press]], 2007) not only renders the work in English verse like the [[dactylic hexameter]] of the original, but also conveys the oral-formulaic nature of the epic song, to which that musical meter gives full value. [[Barry B. Powell]]'s translation ([[Oxford University Press]], 2014) renders the Homeric Greek with a simplicity and dignity reminiscent of the original. Caroline Alexander published the first full-length English translation by a woman in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Júpiter y Tetis, por Dominique Ingres.jpg|thumb|300px|''Jupiter and Thetis'', 1811, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]. Oil on canvas, 136⅝ × 101¼  inches. Musée Granet, [[Aix-en-Provence]], France. "She sank to the ground beside him, put her left arm round his knees, raised her right hand to touch his chin, and so made her petition to the [[Zeus|Royal Son of Cronos]]", ''[[Iliad]]'' 1.500–502]]

'''''Jupiter and Thetis''''' is an 1811 painting by the French [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painter [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], in the Musée Granet, [[Aix-en-Provence]], France. Painted when the artist was yet 31, the work severely and pointedly contrasts the grandeur and might of a cloud-born [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] male deity against that of a diminutive and half nude [[nymph]]. Ingres' subject matter is borrowed from an episode in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' when the sea nymph [[Thetis]] begs [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] to intervene and guide the fate of her son [[Achilles]]; who was at the time embroiled in the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name="R72"&gt;Rosenblum, 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is steeped in the traditions of both classical and neoclassical art, most notably in its grand scale of 136⅝&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;101¼ inches.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman, Michael. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/arts/31iht-ingres.html?_r=1 The peculiar realism of Ingres]". ''International Herald Tribune'', March 31, 2006. Retrieved on November 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingres creates many visual contrasts between the god and the slithering nymph: Jupiter is shown facing the viewer frontally with both his arms and legs spread broadly across the canvas, while the color of his dress and flesh echoes that of the marble at his feet. In contrast, Thetis is rendered in sensuous curves and portrayed in supplication to the mercy of a cruel god who holds the fate of her son in his hands. Thetis' right hand falls on Jupiter's hip with a suggestion of erotic caress, while the dark green of her dress accents the dread and foreboding of the bare landscape behind. Her clothing is drawn up against her lower hip, and seems about to fall off. The focal point of the work is Thetis' left hand extended vertically upright as she attempts to stroke the beard of the god.&lt;ref name="R72" /&gt;

Jupiter's pose is closely based on that of the famous [[chryselephantine sculpture]], the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]] ([[Zeus]] being Jupiter's Greek equivalent), one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].  This was made by the Greek sculptor of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], [[Phidias]], circa 432 BC and destroyed in Antiquity, but its pose is known from coins and small replicas.  Here the pose is reversed right to left, and the arm to the viewer's right is higher than in the original, which held out a statue of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].

''Jupiter and Thetis'' was painted to meet the artist's obligations to the [[French Academy in Rome]],&lt;ref name="boime"/&gt; and although its overhand tone correctly reflected the patriarchal bias of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s regime in its contrast between male power and female subservience,&lt;ref name="boime"&gt;Boime, Albert. ''Art in an Age of Bonapartism, 1800-1815''. Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1993. 206-207. {{ISBN|0-226-06336-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally regarded as a rejection of such values.&lt;ref name="R72"&gt;Rosenblum, 72&lt;/ref&gt; Ingres highly regarded the painting, and in a manner it marries the great motifs of his career: the voluptuousness of the female character and the authoritative austerity on the male deity.&lt;ref name="R72" /&gt;

Ingres kept ''Jupiter and Thetis'' in his studio until 1834, when it was purchased by the state. In 1848, he made a single pencil copy.&lt;ref name="R72" /&gt; The painting was first exhibited at the 1811 Paris [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]],&lt;ref&gt;Symmons, Sarah. "J. A. D. Ingres: The Apotheosis of Flaxman". ''The Burlington Magazine'', Volume 121, Number 920. 1979. 721-731&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when Ingres' attention to line coupled with his disregard for anatomical reality was yet to find favour among critics.

'''Larry John Bissonnette''' (born 1957 in [[Winooski, Vermont]]) is an American [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] artist and activist for [[Autism|autism]] and general disabilities. Bissonnette was diagnosed with multiple other disorders including an [[Intellectual Disability|intellectual disability]] and [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenia]]. Bissonnette's art is found at the [[Collection de l'art brut|Musée de l'Art Brut]] in [[Switzerland]] and multiple private collections.

==Early life==
At age two, Bissonnette suffered from a high fever, which might have caused some kind of damage to his nervous system. By the time he was eight, he was sent to the [[Brandon Training School]], which was Vermont's only institute for the mentally handicapped at the time. During his 10-year confinement at Brandon, he was diagnosed as autistic, schizophrenic, mentally retarded and clinically insane.

During this time, he used concepts of art such as drawing and painting to help himself through self-expression. To him, it's a form of therapy as he was non-verbal since the age of three or four. By the time he was 18, he was then transferred to Vermont Psychiatric Hospital in [[Waterbury, Vermont]], but was soon released by his sister, Sally, who learned about how Larry was physically abused at the institutes, and even receive scars. Bissonnette was then enrolled with an residential program for the developmentally disabled.&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2012)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ECrXMfHffM|title=Autistic Artist Taboo: Strange Behavior|last=|first=|date=2012-06-15|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRACE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graceart.org/collections/larry-bissonette/|title=Larry Bissonette|last=Jameslov|first=|date=2016-08-24|website=GraceArt.org|publisher=Grass Roots Art and Community Effort (GRACE)|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Larry began communicating for the first time after more than 30 years by typing with an assistive device. Apart from his art, this was another option to express his feelings and thoughts.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/bios/larry-bissonnette/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his years wandering around in public, Larry displayed a threatening appearance which led to some treating him like an outcast, according to Pascal Cheng who is Larry's aid. But, Larry is aware of this after releasing his thoughts through typing.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Cheng (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/bios/pascal-cheng/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2013)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku5rYjgbbPg|title=Taboo: Extreme Lives Strange Behaviours - Autism|last=|first=|date=2013-01-21|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning as an public speaker==
In 1998, Larry began his journey as a public speaker at several National Educational Conferences in which he spoken about autism, communication, and art.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"/&gt; Despite being nonverbal, Larry uses his assistive-device typing skills to describe what he wishes to say. He says he is aware that everyone viewed and treated him like an outcast which made everyone realize he is the same as everyone else.&lt;ref name="YouTube.com (2012)"/&gt;

In 2010, Larry and another autism-rights speaker, Tracy Thresher, described others treating them as outcasts, and revealed that they are actually capable despite others' beliefs. With assistive devices and encouraging others on the autism spectrum about what they can do, others can learn that they are not freaks, but can reach out not only with words, but with courage to work with others including those who are non-autistic. The two men traveled the world and visited several nations such as Japan and Finland.&lt;ref name="WretchesAndJabberers.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/|title=Wretches &amp; Jabberers|last=|first=|date=2011-04-01|website=WretchesAndJabberers.org|publisher=State of the Art Inc.|access-date=2018-07-06|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
Larry's success in public speaking brought him to the attention of various media. In 2005, Larry starred in his biographical film, ''My Classic Life as an Artist: A Portrait of Larry Bissonnette'', which earned an award.&lt;ref name="W&amp;J Bissonnette (2011)"/&gt; In 2011, Larry and his ally, Tracy, was in a documentary called ''Wretches and Jabberers'', and in 2012, they were both featured in an episode of the National Geographic ''[[Taboo (2002 TV series)|Taboo]]'' television series which was titled "Strange Behavior".

'''Limoges enamel''' has been produced at [[Limoges]], in south-western [[France]], over several centuries up to the present.  There are two periods when it was of European importance. From the 12th century to 1370 there was a large industry producing metal objects decorated in [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] using the [[champlevé]] technique, of which most of the survivals (estimated at around 7,500 pieces),&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 307, n. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and probably most of the original production, are religious objects such as [[reliquaries]].

After a gap of a century, the industry revived in the late 15th century, now specializing in the technique of painted enamel, and within a few decades making rather more secular than religious pieces. In the [[French Renaissance]] it was the leading centre, with several dynastic workshops, who often signed or punchmarked their work.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 333–334&lt;/ref&gt;  Luxury pieces such as plates, plaques and ewers were painted with sophisticated [[Mannerist]] decoration of pictorial figure scenes which on vessels were surrounded by elaborate borders.

In both periods the largest pieces include narrative scenes. These exemplify the styles of their respective periods.  In the medieval champlevé the action is simply and directly shown by a few figures, with patterned backgrounds.  In the Mannerist painted pieces numerous figures and detailed backgrounds tend to overwhelm the activity of the main figures.

After a decline from about 1630, and later competition from [[porcelain]], high-quality production revived in the mid-19th century, and adopted [[art nouveau]] and other contemporary styles, with a relatively small production.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

Limoges was already the largest and most famous, but not the most high quality, European centre of [[champlevé]] [[vitreous enamel]] production by the 12th century; its works were known as ''Opus de Limogia'' or ''Labor Limogiae''.&lt;ref name="Addison"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F5zL1xN_Cs4C&amp;pg=PA97 ''Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages'' by Julia De Wolf Gi Addison p.97''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The town's main competitors in the price-conscious market were northern Spanish workshops, and Limoges work shows signs of Spanish and Islamic influence from very early on; it has been speculated that there was movement of workers between the two regions.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 228&lt;/ref&gt;  The later [[vermiculated]] style and [[pseudo-Kufic]] borders are two examples of such influence.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 32; O'Neill, 87&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the early Limoges enamel pieces display a band in pseudo-Kufic script, which "was a recurrent ornamental feature in Limoges and had long been adopted in Aquitaine".&lt;ref name="Louvre"&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;bmLocale=en Louvre museum notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615183547/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2011-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Champlevé plaques and "[[chasse (casket)|chasse caskets]]" or reliquaries on copper were eventually almost mass-produced and affordable by parish churches and the gentry.  However the highest quality champlevé work came from the [[Mosan art|Mosan Valley]], in pieces such as the [[Stavelot Triptych]], and later the [[basse-taille]] enamellers of Paris, [[Siena]] and elsewhere led the top end of the enamel market, often with bases in precious metal; almost all these pieces have been melted down at some point.   But Limoges still received orders for important pieces for cathedrals or royal patrons, especially in the 12th and 13th centuries, and there were a range of qualities of work available.  The industry was already in decline by 1370, when the brutal sack of the city after the [[Siege of Limoges]] by the English, led by [[Edward the Black Prince]], effectively ended it.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 333; lasko, 228&lt;/ref&gt;  By then, goldsmiths in larger centres had mostly turned to other techniques such as ''[[basse-taille]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techniques===
Limoges enamel was usually applied on a [[copper]] base, but also sometimes on silver or gold.&lt;ref name="Addison"/&gt; Preservation is often excellent due to the toughness of the material employed,&lt;ref name="Addison"/&gt; and the cheaper Limoges works on copper have survived at a far greater rate than courtly work on precious metals, which were nearly all recycled for their materials at some point.  The parts not covered in enamel were generally [[mercury gilding|gilded]]; there were two basic styles. In the first, the more common but only introduced around 1200, the figures were gilded and often at least partly in [[relief]], while the backgrounds were mainly in coloured enamels.  In the other, this was reversed, and the figures were enamels, against a gilded background.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 104; Lasko, 232–234&lt;/ref&gt;

The gilded areas were also marked with incised lines, depicting the faces and clothes of figures or patterns in the backgrounds (this last known as the [[vermiculation|vermiculated]] style). Pieces were often decorated with jewels, usually imitations in enamel or glass in surviving pieces, and the multicoloured roundels in many of the backgrounds can be understood as imitation gems. From about 1200, blue, with the gold of the gilded areas, was the predominant colour in the Limoges palette. In [[medieval art]] blue was notoriously expensive in other media such as painting, but relatively easy to achieve in both enamel and [[stained glass]], whose makers took full advantage of this.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The smaller relief elements were mainly made by stamping into [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] carrying the design of details like the heads of figures that are otherwise flat; where whole figures are in relief they are usually made from a separate piece of copper which is first pushed out from behind to make the rough shape, then finished by working on the front. These were attached to the main piece with copper [[rivets]], the round heads of which can usually be easily seen.  In some pieces, especially those such as [[crosier]] heads with a three dimensional shape that is the same on two sides, the whole body was hammered into metal matrices carrying the design.  The two sides were then most likely to be soldered together.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, 43–44"&gt;O'Neill, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth===
The growth of the Limoges industry and its reputation in the 12th century appears to have owed much to the [[Grandmontines]], a monastic order whose mother house of Grandmont was outside the city.  The order grew rapidly after the death of its founder, Saint [[Stephen of Muret]] in 1124, and was patronized by King [[Henry II of England]]. It is no longer thought that there was an enamel workshop in the abbey of Grandmont itself; instead the secular workshops of Limoges were patronized. The order had little land and was poor, as well as its austere rule on the face of it discouraging spending on art; it did not use monumental sculpture.  Nonetheless, enamels were sent to the new houses springing up, mainly in France.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 43–44; 199–230&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Innocent III]] (1198–1216), who visited Grandmont twice, commissioned Limoges work for Rome: a [[reliquary]] for his titular church and work for the shrine of [[Saint Peter]] in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], effectively the most prestigious setting in the Western Church.  The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|4th Lateran Council]], convened by Innocent, specified that Limoges enamel was suitable for one of the two [[pyx]]es every church was required to have (although it was not considered an appropriate material for [[chalice]]s, which Catholic regulations still generally require to be at least plated in precious metal).&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 52-534&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors in spreading the reputation of Limoges work were that Limoges was on a main [[pilgrimage]] route to [[Santiago de Compostella]], and was also patronized by the [[Knights Templar]].  Pieces were given as gifts as far afield as the [[Crusader Kingdoms]] of the [[Holy Land]] and [[Scandinavia]], and have been preserved at [[Novgorod]] in Russia.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, 43–44"/&gt;

===Uses===
[[File:Reliquary Three Wise Men MNMA Cl23822.jpg|thumb|Chasse reliquary with the [[Three Kings]], c. 1200.]]
Apart from the caskets which are such a large part of production throughout the period, there were many other types of objects made in Limoges enamel. Those made for church use have had a better chance of surviving, and in the early part of the period probably predominated. Some types of objects, such as candlesticks, which are usually small with a pricket, and ornamental medallions for chests, usually have secular or neutral decoration and were probably made the same for both markets.  In the later period other objects can have distinctly secular decoration, such as [[chivalric]] scenes of knights in combat,&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 360–368; Lasko, 307 n. 13&lt;/ref&gt; or rarer scenes of [[courtly love]].&lt;ref name="O'Neill, 365–368"&gt;O'Neill, 365–368&lt;/ref&gt; Religious book-covers (or [[treasure binding]]s) were made in numbers throughout the period, usually in pairs of plaques which have rarely survived together; [[God the Father]] and the [[Crucifixion of Christ]] are common subjects.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 114, figure&lt;/ref&gt;

Other subjects that appear in Limoges enamel rather more often than in other religious art of the period include the life of Saint [[Valerie of Limoges]], a local heroine, as well as the martyrdom of Saint [[Thomas Becket]], whose cult was vigorously promoted by the church after his death, including the distribution of secondary relics (pieces of his clothes soaked in his diluted blood) around Europe.  That there are more than twenty Limoges chasses showing the story of the [[Three Magi]] has slightly puzzled art historians.  Their relics were "translated" from [[Milan]] to [[Cologne]] in 1164,&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 124&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that parts of the masonry from the old shrine in Milan were available as relics.&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier M-M. and François G., ''Émaux méridionaux: Catalogue international de l'oeuvre de Limoges – Volume I: Epoque romane'', 11, Paris, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  In subjects like these, with many surviving examples, the depictions are often closely similar, or fall into groups, suggesting shared designs, and perhaps different workshops using the same patterns. 
     
In the 13th century there was a fashion for the tops of elite tombs to have an enamel and metal panel with an effigy of the deceased, which was often in [[relief]].  Two children of  [[Saint Louis IX]] (1214–1270) who died young had such tombs in [[Royaumont Abbey]] outside Paris (now in the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]]),&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 402–405&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of tombs of bishops and great nobles are recorded; few survived the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 435–444, 397–421&lt;/ref&gt;  This was part of a trend for late Limoges work to become increasingly sculptural, often with only small touches in enamel.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 344–358&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of secular pieces, or those that have survived, increased in the later period, including candlesticks, medallion plaques for ornamenting chests and other things,&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, 360–365&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gemellion]]s, bowls for ceremonial hand-washing that came in pairs, servants pouring over the hands from one into the other.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, 365–368"/&gt;

The painted enamel technique appeared during the mid-15th century, perhaps first in the Netherlands, soon followed by Limoges during the reign of [[Louis XI]] (1461–1483).&lt;ref&gt;NGA, 82; Campbell, 43&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant master, who goes by the name Monvaerni, or Pseudo-Monvaerni as the name is now known to be based on the misreading of an inscription, worked in the last decades of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, 8 (see Note 1)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was followed by the unknown artists called the "Master of the Louis XII Triptych", after a piece in [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the "Master of the Orléans Triptych" who created a number of religious pieces before about 1515 in a style still based on the painting of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, 8–14&lt;/ref&gt;  These were too small for churches and evidently used for private devotions, perhaps especially for frequent travellers.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique flourished in various Limoges workshops throughout the 16th century, enjoying privileges from the king that gave it almost a monopoly in France.  In addition, from the time of Louis XI the ability to attain the title of master in the enamellers' guild was confined to a few families by royal edicts.&lt;ref&gt;NGA, 82&lt;/ref&gt;  Enamels were produced in workshops which often persisted in the same family for several generations, and are often signed in the enamel, or identifiable, at least as far as the family or workshop, by punch marks on the back of panels, as well as by style.&lt;ref name="Tait 2015"&gt;Tait, 42–49; Thornton (2015), 108–125; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

At least initially, these were very high-status objects for the refined taste of the court and other wealthy collectors,&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 11, 23-26, 29&lt;/ref&gt; with wealthy townsmen adding to the customer base from the 1530s, as the industry expanded.&lt;ref name="Caroselli, 28"&gt;Caroselli, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike medieval Limoges champlevé, these enamels were made for a market mainly restricted to France, though some pieces were commissioned from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 83&lt;/ref&gt;  While the medieval champlevé of Limoges competed with a number of other centres around Europe, in the 16th century there was really no other city producing any quantity of large pictorial enamels in a [[Mannerist]] style.  Some pieces of [[Murano glass]] were partly painted in a broadly equivalent style.

By 1580 the style seems to have been falling from fashion, and [[Bernard Palissy]], the creator of a complementary style in ceramics, wrote that "their art has become so cheap that they can barely make a living".&lt;ref name="Caroselli, 36"&gt;Caroselli, 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Production continued into the 17th century, but at declining quality after the first decades.  In the 18th century the role of luxury enamelware objects was largely superseded by European [[porcelain]], but after some technical refinements enamel painting became widely used for small [[portrait miniature]]s, before this an English eccentricity.  These were painted in many major cities where there were customers, and Limoges played only a minor part.  Limoges was also an active centre of painted [[faience]] and later [[Limoges porcelain]].&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

===Style and technique===
The new technique produced pieces painted with highly detailed figurative scenes or decorative schemes. As with Italian [[maiolica]], to which in some ways Limoges painted enamel was a belated French riposte, the imagery tended to be drawn from classical mythology or allegory, though it includes religious scenes, often from the  [[Old Testament]].  Many masters were becoming [[Huguenot]]s (French [[Calvinists]]) over the century, and new printed [[Bible moralisée]]s, with illustrations by [[Bernard Salomon]] and others, were making accessible a large number of narrative scenes that were previously not widely familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Waddesdon bequest British Museum DSCF9814 05.JPG|thumb|300px|Detail of enamel dish, Limoges, mid-16th century, attributed to [[Jean de Court]] (marked "I.C." at centre), [[Waddesdon Bequest]], [[British Museum]]]]

The compositions were mostly taken from German, French or Italian [[old master print|prints]], especially for the larger scenes with many figures.  Borders on the larger pieces are highly elaborate and use the full range of Mannerist ornament, diffused by [[ornament print]]s and other models.  There is much [[strapwork]] and fantastic [[grotesque]]s are often given a comic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 33-35; Vincent, 16–25, especially 18–19, 22; NGA, 82&lt;/ref&gt;  The jolly grotesques illustrated at right are on the reverse of a large dish whose main face shows a brightly-coloured depiction of the ''Destruction of Pharaoh's army in the Red Sea''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=34876&amp;partId=1 BM collection database, WB.33], accessed 31 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Both designs are closely paralleled, without being exactly copied, in pieces in other collections, notably one in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.  The designs are also based on prints, but adapted by the enamellers for their pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, 16–25, especially 18–19, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction, around 1530, of the ''[[grisaille]]'' style, with most of the composition in black and white, may seem surprising in a medium which generally relied for its effect on a wide range of bright colours which could only be matched by pottery in the other media, such as metalwork, in which similar objects were made.  Muted other colours, especially gold and pink for flesh, were often included.  There may have been an influence from the black and white of the prints the designs were drawn from, and the style was probably much easier to fire. Grisaille areas were usually made by firing a coat of "black" enamel, in fact usually a very dark [[mulberry]] colour, sometimes a very dark blue, then adding a coat of white, and partially scratching this away before firing again.  Highlights in white, gold, or other colours might then be added.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 20-21; NGA, 83, 107–108; there was a variant technique, giving a slight [[relief]] effect.&lt;/ref&gt;  Grisaille pieces dominated production in the approximate period between 1530 and 1560, and thereafter continued to be made alongside polychrome ones.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 20-21; NGA, 107–108; Tait, 44–46&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been claimed that these pieces were "dark and sombre, reflecting the pessimism prevalent during the Reformation".&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

Enamels were still applied to bases of copper sheets; the construction of the complicated three dimensional shapes often now used could not use [[solder]], which would not withstand the firing temperature.  The back of the sheets also needed to be enamelled, even where these would be invisible, to reduce buckling during firing; this unseen enamel is called "counterenamel" and used waste material from the painted sides.  The technique required (if not in ''grisaille'') multiple firings at closely controlled temperatures to fire the various colours, though the number of firings actually required has become a matter of some controversy in recent decades.  Up to twenty was claimed by earlier writers, but a maximum of eight or nine now seems more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 19; NGA, 82–83; Osborne, 334&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mercury gilding]] was used for gold areas, very common in the borders; this and some other colours were only briefly fired, as the final stage.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 19; NGA, 105&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Waddesdon Bequest British Museum DSCF9660 11.JPG|thumb|Signature of [[Suzanne de Court|"Suzanne Court"]] on a charger]]

===Artists===
Given the royal privileges, enamel workshops tended to stay in the family, and are also rather poorly documented compared to painters; the various signatures and [[monogram]]s on pieces have given art historians much to argue about.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, 15, 40; Tait, 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hallmark]]s on the metal frames or setting can be helpful in giving dates.  [[Léonard Limousin]] was the most famous of seven enamel artists of the Limousin family, whose signed and dated works stretch from 1532 to 1574.  The Court/de Court family probably included most of [[Jean Court]] (active 1550s), [[Jean de Court]] (active 1560s and 1570s, also a successful portrait painter in oils), [[Suzanne de Court]], perhaps active 1570s to 1620s, and [[Pierre Courteys]] (or Courtois), signing works from 1550 to 1568.  The Pénicault, Laudin and Reymond or Raymond ([[Pierre Reymond]]) families were also prominent enamellers,&lt;ref name="Tait 2015"/&gt; the Laudins especially prominent in the 17th century, as the "last spark" of the Limoges tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 36 (quoted), 199-203&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cup Pierre Reymond MBA Lyon H642.jpg|thumb|[[Tazza (cup)|Tazza]] by [[Pierre Reymond]]]]

Some of these signatures (typically just initials in fact) may represent "from the firm/workshop of" rather than "painted by". Some individual painters are also known from particular works, with others attributed to them based on their style; the illustration here is from a series on the ''[[Aeneid]]'' by the "Master of the Aeneid ",&lt;ref&gt;Or "Aeneid Master", "Master of the Aeneid Legend"; [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Master_of_the_Aeneid_Legend Wikimedia Commons images]&lt;/ref&gt; who made a large set of plaques around the 1530s, of which 74 are now widely dispersed in various collections.  They copy the compositions of the [[woodcut]] illustrations first used in an edition of the works of [[Virgil]] published in [[Strasbourg]] in 1502, and then reused in [[Lyons]] editions in 1517 and 1529; there were 143 illustrations to the ''[[Aeneid]]'' in these, and none of the last three books have any surviving enamel versions.  They may have decorated a small study,&lt;ref name="Tait, 42"&gt;Tait, 42&lt;/ref&gt; set into wood panelling as in the ''cabinet des emaux'' belonging to Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]] at her death in 1589, set with small enamel portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aeneid'' series reflect the essentially Gothic style of the woodcuts copied,&lt;ref name="Tait, 42"/&gt; but were probably made when Léonard Limousin was already in the service of the king.  His exposure to the Italian style of the [[First School of Fontainebleau]] was probably the key to the rapid adoption of sophisticated [[Mannerist]] style by Limoges artists, where it held sway for the rest of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, 47–49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses===
Enamels were made as objects such as candlesticks, dishes, vessels and mirror backs, and also as flat plaques to be included in other objects such as caskets.  Although they were very often made in shapes for serving food and drink, the evidence suggests that they were not generally used for this, but kept among other ''[[objets d'art]]'' in reception rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 29&lt;/ref&gt;   As with medieval enamels, while some pieces were evidently made to order, others were probably made for stock to sell or distribute to the market.&lt;ref name="Caroselli, 28"/&gt;  Hat badges became popular as the industry and clientele expanded; the grand preferred traditional jewellery for these.&lt;ref name="Caroselli, 36"/&gt;

The largest three-dimensional piece to survive is a ''grisaille'' "table fountain" 490&amp;nbsp;mm tall at [[Waddesdon Manor]] in England, dated 1552, purportedly made for [[Diane de Poitiers]], mistress of [[Henri II of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this may be a "composite" piece made up in the 18th and 19th centuries from a number of 16th century pieces, and with the joined initials of Henri and Diane added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collection.waddesdon.org.uk/search.do?view=detail&amp;page=1&amp;id=43344&amp;db=object Page on Waddesdon website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202065057/http://collection.waddesdon.org.uk/search.do?view=detail&amp;page=1&amp;id=43344&amp;db=object |date=2017-02-02 }}, see expanded comments by Phillippa Plock, 2014.  The piece is in the Smoking Room, and can be seen at a distance from the doorway.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Casket of the Sybyls in the [[Waddesdon Bequest]] in the [[British Museum]] (one of the better collections, and always on display) is an elaborate small locking casket with a framework of silver-gilt and gems, set with [[grisaille]] panels with touches of gold and flesh-tints. It represents the sophisticated court taste of about 1535, and was probably intended for a lady's jewels.  Most such sets of enamel inserts have lost the settings they were intended for,&lt;ref&gt;Thornton (2015), 108–115&lt;/ref&gt; but many are now in replacement frames added by the Paris dealers in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Caroselli, 37"&gt;Caroselli, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collecting history===
After a long period when they were very little collected, interest in painted Limoges revived in the first half of the 19th century, as part of a general Renaissance revival.  The taste grew until late in the century, with Paris as the main market for gathering examples from chateaux, if necessary doing them up with the usual 19th-century audacity, and selling them to an increasingly international group of very wealthy collectors.  The skills reacquired for repairs led to some downright forgeries.  Art historians began to reconstruct the names and biographies behind the tangled evidence from signatures and styles,&lt;ref name="Caroselli, 37"/&gt; as well as imitations in ceramics from France and England.&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-century large groups were included in appropriate exhibitions in Paris and London, and later the private collections mostly passed into museums; "the important collections of Limoges enamels are found today in a dozen museums":&lt;ref&gt;Caroselli, 37-38 (38 quoted), giving the following list&lt;/ref&gt;

*France: [[Louvre]]: [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]] (formerly Musée de Cluny, essentially champlevé), Paris: [[Château d'Écouen]] (Musée national de la Renaissance): Municipal Museum of Limoges.   
*England (all London): [[British Museum]], including the [[Waddesdon Bequest]]: [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]: [[Wallace Collection]]
*USA: [[Frick Collection]], New York: [[Walters Art Gallery]], Baltimore: [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York: [[Taft Museum of Art]], Cincinnati.
*Russia: [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg.

===Limoges Cross===
This piece is the central plaque from a cross", from the first third of the 13th century. It is now in the San Francisco [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honour]].  The uncarved area is gilded to help frame the enameled portions.  This cross was probably used in the Abbey of St. Martial probably as a [[processional cross]].
[[File:Limoges Reliquary Casket.tiff|thumb|220px|Becket chasse reliquary]]

===Limoges Reliquary Casket===
This reliquary casket depicts scenes from the death of [[Thomas Becket]]. St. Thomas Becket, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was murdered in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1170, supposedly on the wishes of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II of England]].  Beckett was canonized as a saint within three years of his murder, and scenes from the life and death of Thomas Becket very quickly became a popular sources of inspiration for the artists of Limoges, that are on over 45 caskets surviving today.&lt;ref&gt;Binski, Paul in: Jonathan Alexander &amp; Paul Binski (eds), Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200–1400, Royal Academy/Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is now in the San Francisco Legion of Honor in the Medieval Art Galleries.

The [[Becket Casket]] in London (illustrated at top) is another Limoges example; it is the largest surviving Becket casket, and possibly the oldest.  It may have been made as few as ten years after Becket's murder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O80222/casket-the-becket-casket/ The Becket Casket at the Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dub Version===
;Opening:
# "Wild Challenger" by Jindou (Episodes 1-76) 

The only differences between the Japanese version and the English version of Wild Challenger is at very the beginning it shows the English title edit (and has a different sequence for showing it, however the music remains the same) and Jelly Jiggler doesn't jiggle in the middle of the opening (when stepped on) and at the very end (note that the Jelly Jiggler also didn't jiggle in the Japanese opening for the 2 first episodes yet he does in the later episodes).

Small parts of Baka Survivor are used in episodes 38, 45, 52, and 69.

;Ending:
# "US Ending"  
#"US Color Ending" The US ending but with the background in color.

This ending includes scenes from Baka Survivor and music from the series.

Small parts of H.P.S.J. are used in episodes 38, 45, and 52.

==Bobobo DVDs &amp; Blu-rays==

===[[Illumitoon Entertainment]] DVD Volumes===
*Volume 1 - Bo-nafide Protector
Released on February 13, 2007, this volume contains episodes 1-4. The cover features BoBoBo-Bo holding up three fingers.

*Volume 2 - Scream for Ice Cream
Released on May 1, 2007, this volume contains episodes 5-8. The cover features Softon in front with Don Patch coming out of BoBoBo-Bo's afro in the background. Special features include the opening and closing with Kanji credits, line art, and character profiles.
&lt;!-- Shown in the Shonen Jump February 2007 addition --&gt;

*Volume 3 - Gasser Up!
This was going to be released on May 22, 2007. This volume would have contained episodes 9-12. The cover features Gasser in front with Geha the Gale enraged in the background.

Many fans, however, were very disappointed when the first DVD was "uncut" but still dubbed pretty much the same. Even more disappointing, however, was that it was "dubtitled", or just subtitles using the dubbed version.

===S'more Entertainment DVD Collections===
*Collection 1
Released on April 10, 2012, this 4-disc DVD collection contains episodes 1-38. This collection says that it includes Japanese with English Subtitles when it was actually shown with no subtitles at all. It does, however, include original scripts from all of the episodes from that set.

*Collection 2
Released on November 19, 2012, this 4-disc DVD collection contains episodes 39-76. This collection fixes the problem, admitting that S'more Entertainment didn't have the cost to do subtitles. This set also includes original scripts from all of the episodes from that set.

Many fans were very disappointed about S'more Entertainment not translating for the Japanese language, especially when the first collection misled them. Due to the controversial decisions, it wasn't too long for Toei to pull the license away, letting S'more shut down not long afterwards.

===[[Discotek Media]] SD on [[Blu-ray Disc|BD]] Collection===

During Discotek Media's panel at [[Otakon]] in August 2018, they announced the license of the series and it will be released as a 2-disc SD on BD set with all the 76 episodes in the future. This is the first time the Japanese version of the show will be shown subtitled in its entirety.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9549">'''Louis Charles Christopher Krieger''' (11 February 1873&amp;nbsp;– 31 July 1940) was an American [[mycology|mycologist]] and [[botanical illustrator]] who was considered the finest painter of North American fungi.&lt;ref name=kbs/&gt;

==Personal life==

Born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on February 11, 1873, Krieger received his early education from the [[Lutheran]] schools in that city. He showed artistic talents at an early age, and at 13 enrolled in the [[Maryland Institute College of Art|Maryland Institute School of Art and Design]]. Krieger continued his studies at the [[Charcoal Club of Baltimore]] and the [[Schuler School of Fine Arts]]. He married Agnes Checkley Keighler in 1904; she died in 1939. They had one daughter.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Russula virescens illustration 1898.jpg|thumb|right|Krieger's illustration of ''[[Russula virescens]]'', from [[Thomas Taylor (botanist)|Thomas Taylor's]] 1898 work ''Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America Edible and Poisonous'']]

At the age of 18, Krieger started employment as an artist assistant in the Division of Microscopy at the Department of Agriculture, and spent time painting mushrooms found around the [[District of Columbia]] area.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; When the [[Secretary of Agriculture]], [[Julius Sterling Morton]], closed the department in 1895, Krieger spent a year in [[Munich]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts]]. After returning to America in 1896, he became an instructor of drawing and painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art and Design. Although he developed a reputation as a portrait painter, Krieger did not particularly enjoy this employment, finding it dull.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

In 1902, Krieger started working as a [[botanical illustrator]] for mycologist [[William Gilson Farlow]] at [[Harvard University]], a position that lasted for the next decade. During this time, he earnestly immersed himself in his work, painting over 350 images of mushrooms.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; He also started indexing the world's mycological literature, a project that continued for the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

In 1912, Krieger accepted a position at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], at the Plant Introduction Garden in [[Chico, California]]. Here, under the supervision of [[David Griffiths (botanist)|David Griffiths]], he produced a series of images on species of the ''[[Opuntia]]'' [[cactus]] genus.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt;

Krieger returned to illustrating mushrooms in 1918 when he returned to Baltimore to work for the noted gynecologist [[Howard A. Kelly]], for whom he produced over 300 paintings of fungi.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; He also assisted Kelly in indexing his mycological library, which, with about 12,000 items and valued at $100,000, was considered one of the most extensive privately owned mycological libraries in the country.&lt;ref name="Kanouse 1943"/&gt; Kelly donated his library and fungus collections to the [[University of Michigan]], where, according to Kelly's wishes, it was named the "L.C.C. Krieger Mycological Library".&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

[[File:Krieger cherries-Marasca-Moscata-1933.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of Marasca Moscata variety of cherry (''Prunus avium'') by Louis Charles Christopher Krieger, 1933.]]

Over the following 10 years, Krieger published several scientific articles that appeared in ''[[Mycologia]]'' and other journals, including the May 1920 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', which featured 16 of his colored plates.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

Krieger was an artist with the Tropical Plant Research Foundation in Cuba from 1928–29, where he illustrated [[sugarcane]] diseases for the USDA. He was briefly a mycologist with the [[New York State Museum]], during which time he prepared the book ''A Popular Guide to the Higher Fungi (Mushrooms) of New York State'', which was eventually published in 1935.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt; In the 1930s, he painted some 80 watercolors of fruit for USDA, mainly apples, citrus, and stone fruit; these paintings are now in the National Agricultural Library's [[United States National Agricultural Library#Pomological Watercolor Collection|Pomological Watercolor Collection]].

[[File:Five Lufsig dolls.jpg|thumb|Five Lufsig dolls inside an IKEA store in Taipei, Taiwan]]
'''Lufsig''' is a [[stuffed toy]] wolf sold at Swedish furniture chain [[IKEA]]. The toy, designed by German designer {{Interlanguage link multi|Silke Leffler|de}}, is inspired by the fairy tale "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]" as a representation of the [[Big Bad Wolf]]. The plush was sold as part of IKEA's annual ''Soft Toys for Education'' campaign, where the company donates a portion from each toy sold towards various causes. The name "Lufsig" is derived from the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] verb "lufsa", meaning "to lumber".

In December 2013, the toy became a symbol of opposition to the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]], after an incident during a town hall event where a Lufsig was thrown by a protester at [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[CY Leung]] (who had been nicknamed "the wolf" by his critics).  Following the incident (and the discovery that its transliterated Chinese name sounds similar to a [[Cantonese profanity|profanity]] when pronounced in [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]), Lufsig experienced a surge in popularity, selling out at IKEA stores in Hong Kong, as well as in 11 out of 14 stores in mainland China.

== Development ==
Lufsig was designed by German designer Silke Leffler, drawing inspiration from the fairy tale ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''.&lt;ref name=ikeahk&gt;[http://www.ikea.com/hk/en/catalog/products/20247576/ LUFSIG – Soft toy, wolf $99.9] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6LpSF99aI?url=http://www.ikea.com/hk/en/catalog/products/20247576/ |date=13 December 2013 }}.

[[CY Leung]], the former [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], has suffered low popularity ratings since his [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2012|election in 2012]]. Of particular criticism was the election process itself, where the new Chief Executive was chosen by the [[Election Committee]], a group of 1200 individuals, many of whom belong to the [[pro-Beijing camp]]. The election of Leung, combined with speculation during the campaign that Leung was connected to the [[Communist Party of China]], sparked a pro-democracy movement and protests calling for the adoption of [[universal suffrage in Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=bbc-cytroubles&gt;{{cite web|title=CY Leung: The troubles of Hong Kong's unloved leader|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23193421|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-elected&gt;{{cite web|title=CY Leung elected Hong Kong's new leader|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-17503171|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His approval ratings among citizens reached a record low in December 2013.&lt;ref name="thelocal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; Critics of Leung have nicknamed him "the Wolf", alluding to his alleged cunningness, and as a pun of his name and the Chinese word for wolf.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

On 7 December 2013, during a town hall meeting, a Lufsig plush toy was thrown at Leung by an anti-government protester.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Following the incident, it was also discovered that the [[transliteration]] of Lufsig's name as listed on IKEA's Mainland Chinese website, "路姆西" (pronounced as ''louh móuh sāi'' in [[Cantonese]]), could be misinterpreted as [[Cantonese profanity|profanity]]; in particular, ''louh móuh sāi'' could be read as a [[pun]] on ''lóuh móu hāi'' ("老母閪", lit. "mother's [[vagina]]"), and that the expression "丟你路姆西" (''dīu néih louh móuh sāi'', lit. "throw your Lufsig" or "throw a Lufsig at you"), could be a pun on the vulgar phrase "𨳒你老母閪" (''díu néih lóuh móu hāi''), which can be translated as "[[fuck]] your mother's vagina."&lt;ref name="chan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Yuen|title=IKEA Toy Wolf Becomes Unlikely Anti-Government Symbol in Hong Kong|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yuen-chan/lufsig-hong-kong_b_4414080.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scmp"/&gt;&lt;ref name=20131210mcbain&gt;McBain, Sophie (10 December 2013).

Following the incident, Lufsig experienced a surge in popularity in Hong Kong; people lined up outside IKEA's three Hong Kong locations the next morning to purchase the toy, which were sold out within hours.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chan"/&gt; The popularity soon extended to mainland China (where 11 of the 14 IKEA stores sold out), and even to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20131215000011&amp;cid=1103 "IKEA toy wolf popular in Canada after being thrown at HK chief executive"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216182948/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20131215000011&amp;cid=1103 |date=16 December 2013 }}.

On 11 December 2013, Leung himself posted a picture of himself with a Lufsig he bought for his daughter, and praised the "creativity" of Hong Kong people.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; IKEA called the unintended pun "unfortunate" the same day, and changed the official Chinese name to "路福西" (pronounced as "Lufuxi" in [[Standard Chinese|Putonghua]] and as "louh fūk sāi" in Cantonese), incorporating a Chinese character meaning "good fortune".&lt;ref name=20131212standard/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ikea Wolf Toy Gets Renamed in China After Old One Deemed Vulgar|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-12/ikea-wolf-toy-gets-renamed-in-china-after-old-one-deemed-vulgar.html|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=11 December 2013|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New materials in 20th-century art''' were introduced to art making from the very beginning of the century. The introduction of new materials (and techniques) and heretofore non-art materials helped drive change in art during the 20th century. Traditional materials and techniques were not necessarily displaced in the 20th century. Rather, they functioned alongside innovations that came with the 20th century. Such mainstays as [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting, and sculpting in traditional materials continued right through the 20th century into the 21st century. Furthermore, even "traditional" materials were greatly expanded in the course of the 20th century. The number of pigments available to artists (painters, primarily) has increased both in quantity and quality, by most reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Mayer, The Painter's Craft, {{ISBN|0-14-046895-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; New formulations for traditional materials especially the commercial availability of [[acrylic paint]] have become widely used, introducing initial issues over their stability and longevity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenpaints.com/company/history.php History of Golden paints], retrieved July 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Joseph Cornell]] and others incorporated paper [[collage]] and mixed drawing (materials) with [[paint]] to fashion their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archivedate=2008-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Picasso and [[Marcel Duchamp]] pioneered the use of [[found objects]] as material for paintings and sculpture during the 1910s. In the 1940s [[Jackson Pollock]] pioneered the use of housepaint, silver and aluminum paint, duco, and various objects for use in his paintings. In the 1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] included [[dimension|3-D]] elements like tires and stuffed animals
as well as using discarded materials like crushed or flattened [[cardboard box]]es. [[Yves Klein]] incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] used crushed auto parts for sculpture. In the 1960s [[Pop Art|Pop artists]] [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] made art from commercial products, or art that resembled commercial products like television sets, soup cans, brillo boxes, comic books, household furniture and restaurant items among other things. [[Edward Kienholz]] made replicas of actual environments both domestic and commercial, while [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]] made life-size plaster figures in settings using real objects and props. [[Dan Flavin]] used electric [[fluorescent light]]s and [[Electrical ballast|ballast]]s to create sculpture. In the 1970s [[Frank Stella]] introduced honeycombed aluminum and glitter. In the 1980s [[Julian Schnabel]] made "plate paintings" with broken [[crockery]] stuck to the surface and then painted over, [[Anselm Kiefer]] and [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] used [[mud]], [[soil]] or [[tar]] in their works. In the 1960s and again in the 1990s artists used [[excrement]] notably - the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]] in 1961 and the British artist [[Chris Ofili]] who specialized in using [[elephant]] dung in the 1990s. [[Tracey Emin]] included her bed, entitled [[My Bed]], in 1999.

Some innovations concerning materials used in art merely function in a supportive way, and other innovative materials are much more conspicuous. [[Frank Stella]]'s use of honeycombed aluminum served as a lightweight and strong and very configurable support for imagery. In the sculpture entitled "Monogram," by [[Robert Rauschenberg]], an [[angora goat]] assumes a position of central importance.

==Early 20th century==
[[Image:Compotier avec fruits, violon et verre.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''Compotier avec fruits, violon et verre,'' 1912]]
The advent of [[Modernism]] and [[Modern Art]] in the first decades of the 20th century inspired artists to test and transcend the boundaries and the limitations of the traditional and conventional forms of art making in search of newer forms and in search of new materials. The innovations of painters like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and the French [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]] provided essential inspiration for the development of modern art by the younger generation of artists in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. [[Henri Matisse]] and other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive, paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and scores of young artists in Paris made their first modern paintings venturing toward [[Abstract art|abstraction]] and other new ways of formulating [[figurative art|figurative]], [[still-life]] and [[landscape art|landscape]] imagery.

===1900s===
During the first decade of the 20th century modern art developed simultaneously in several different areas in Europe (France, England, Scandinavia, Russia, Germany, Italy), and in the United States. Artists began to formulate different directions of modern art, seemingly unrelated to one another.

In [[printmaking]], the [[linocut]] was invented by the artists of [[Die Brücke]] in Germany between 1905 and 1913.  At first they described their prints as [[woodcut]]s, which sounded more respectable. The technique remains popular as a very simple method of printmaking, even suitable for use in schools.

===1910s===

====Cubism====

Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris and other [[Cubism|cubist]] artists introduced new elements and materials like newspaper clippings, fabric, and sheet music into their paintings. Eventually the movement was called [[Synthetic Cubism]] developed between 1912 and 1919. Synthetic cubism is characterized by works with different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of subject matter. It was the beginning of collage materials being introduced as an important ingredient of fine art work by the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Cooper, "The Cubist Epoch", pp. 11–221, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered the first work of this new style was Pablo Picasso's ''"Still Life with Chair-caning"'' (1911–1912), which includes oil cloth that was printed to look like chair-caning pasted onto an oval canvas, with text; and rope framing the whole picture. At the upper left are the letters "JOU", which appear in many cubist paintings and refers to the newspaper titled ''"Le Journal"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson, John]].

====Dada====
The [[Dada]] movement began during [[World War I]] as a protest against the madness and violence of war. Applying shock tactics and anarchy to art the Dadaists pioneered the use of new artistic techniques such as [[collage]], [[photomontage]] [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] and the use of [[found objects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4059997.stm "Duchamp's urinal tops art survey"], [[BBC News]] December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]] and others incorporated into their work random everyday objects often combined with more conventional artist materials. They included photographs, panes of glass, picture frames, eyeglasses, boxes, newspapers, magazines, ticket stubs, metal pipes, bulbs, bottle racks, urinals, bicycle wheels and other objects. [[Marcel Duchamp]] created ''The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even,'' working on the piece from 1915 to 1923. He made the work on two panes of glass; with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Janis: [http://www.artchive.com/artchive/D/duchamp.html ''Marcel Duchamp, 1887–1968: Art as Anti-Art''] as reproduced at artchive.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===

====Surrealism====
During the 1930s [[Surrealist]] artist [[Méret Oppenheim]] created sexually charged erotic pieces. Oppenheim's best known piece is ''[[Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' (1936). The sculpture consists of a teacup, saucer and spoon that the artist covered with fur from a Chinese gazelle.  It is displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.

===1950s===
[[Robert Rauschenberg]] began to create what became known as his [[Combine painting]]s in the early 1950s.

===1960s===
In 1960 [[Yves Klein]] incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. [[Yves Klein|Klein]] also made use of [[Photomontage]] in the famous pseudo-performance picture of himself diving off a wall onto a [[Paris]] street ''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (Leap into the Void. In the 1960s [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] continued using crushed auto parts for sculpture.  [[Dan Flavin]] used electric [[fluorescent light]]s and [[Electrical ballast|ballast]]s to create his sculpture. In May 1961 Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]] used his own [[excrement]], selling it in cans titled ''[[Artist's Shit]]'' (''Merda d'Artista'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/193259521X Poop Culture: How America is Shaped by its Grossest National Product] by Dave Praeger {{ISBN|1-932595-21-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the contents of the cans remain a much-disputed enigma, since opening them would destroy the value of the artwork. Various theories about the contents have been proposed, including speculation that it is plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/visualart/story/0,,2101617,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Merde d'artiste: not exactly what it says on the tin | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | date=June 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''obelisk''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|b|əl|ɪ|s|k}}; from {{lang-grc|ὀβελίσκος}} ''obeliskos'';&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)beli/skos|ὀβελίσκος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|obelisk}}&lt;/ref&gt; diminutive of {{lang|grc|ὀβελός}} ''obelos'', "[[Spit (cooking aide)|spit]], nail, pointed pillar"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)belo/s|οβελός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a tall, four-sided, narrow tapering monument which ends in a pyramid-like shape or [[pyramidion]] at the top. These were originally called ''tekhenu'' by their builders, the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] who saw them used the Greek term 'obeliskos' to describe them, and this word passed into [[Latin]] and ultimately [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Rosalie F.|title=Ancient Egyptians: People of the Pyramids|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195122213|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gw5prEJQq10C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22Tekhenu+%22+egyptian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FJAdU_iHNcPxhQeY9oGQDg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tekhenu%20%22%20egyptian&amp;f=false|author2=Charles Baker |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient obelisks are [[monolith]]ic; that is, they consist of a single stone. Most modern obelisks are made of several stones; some, like the [[Washington Monument]], are buildings.

The term ''[[stele]]'' is generally used for other monumental, upright, [[inscription|inscribed]] and sculpted stones.

==Ancient obelisks==

===Egyptian===
{{See also|List of obelisks in Rome}}
[[File:Pylons and obelisk Luxor temple.JPG|thumb|[[Pylon (architecture)|Pylon]] of the Temple of Luxor with the remaining obelisk (of two) in front (the second is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris).]]
[[File:Heliopolis200501.JPG|thumb|right|Obelisk of Pharaoh [[Senusret I]], Al-Maalla area of [[Al-Matariyyah]] district in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|modern Heliopolis]].]]

Obelisks were prominent in the architecture of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, who placed them in pairs at the entrance of the [[Egyptian temple|temples]]. The word "obelisk" as used in English today is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because [[Herodotus]], the Greek traveller, was one of the first classical writers to describe the objects. A number of&lt;!-- can't find a current source, 19th century sources say more --&gt; ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the "[[Unfinished Obelisk]]" found partly hewn from its quarry at [[Aswan]]. These obelisks are now dispersed around the world, and fewer than half of them remain in Egypt.

The earliest [[temple]] obelisk still in its original position is the {{convert|20.7|m|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} {{convert|120|MT|ST|adj=on|lk=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/cairo.html|title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; A World of Obelisks: Cairo |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; red granite Obelisk of [[Senusret I]] of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|XIIth]] [[List of Egyptian dynasties|Dynasty]] at [[Al-Matariyyah]] in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|modern Heliopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Obelisk |volume=19 |page=945 |first=Francis Llewellyn |last=Griffith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obelisk symbolized the sun god [[Ra]], and during the brief religious reformation of [[Akhenaten]] was said to be a petrified ray of the [[Aten]], the sundisk. It was also thought that the god existed within the structure.

[[Benben]] was the mound that arose from the primordial waters [[Naunet|Nu]] upon which the creator god [[Atum]] settled in the creation story of the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|Heliopolitan creation myth]] form of Ancient Egyptian religion. The Benben stone (also known as a pyramidion) is the top stone of the Egyptian pyramid. It is also related to the Obelisk.

It is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Blackwell Gary and Richard Talcott, "Stargazing in Ancient Egypt", ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'', June 2006, pp. 62–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[pyramid]] and obelisk might have been inspired by previously overlooked astronomical phenomena connected with [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]: the [[zodiacal light]] and [[sun pillar]]s respectively.

The Ancient Romans were strongly influenced by the obelisk form, to the extent that there are now more than twice as many obelisks standing in Rome as remain in Egypt. All fell after the Roman period except for the [[St. Peter's Square#Obelisk|Vatican obelisk]] and were re-erected in different locations.

The largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [[Lateran Obelisk]] in the square at the west side of the [[Lateran Basilica]] in Rome at {{convert|105.6|ft|m}} tall and a weight of {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; A World of Obelisks: Rome |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome. [[Herod the Great]] imitated his Roman patrons and set up a red granite Egyptian obelisk in the hippodrome of his new city [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] in northern [[Judea]]. This one is about {{convert|40|ft|m}} tall and weighs about {{convert|100|MT|ST}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highskyblue.web.fc2.com/caesarea.htm|title=Caesarea Obelisk |publisher=Highskyblue.web.fc2.com |date=18 June 2001 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered by archaeologists and has been re-erected at its former site.

In [[Constantinople]], the Eastern [[Emperor Theodosius]] shipped an obelisk in AD 390 and had it set up in his [[hippodrome]], where it has weathered [[Crusade]]rs and [[Seljuks]] and stands in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome square]] in modern [[Istanbul]]. This one stood {{convert|95|ft|m}} tall and weighing {{convert|380|MT|ST}}. Its lower half reputedly also once stood in Istanbul but is now lost. The Istanbul obelisk is {{convert|65|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/istanbul.html|title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; A World of Obelisks: Istanbul |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome is the obelisk capital of the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The most well-known is probably the {{convert|25|m|ft}}, {{convert|331|MT|ST|adj=on}} obelisk at [[Saint Peter's Square]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; The obelisk had stood since AD 37 on its site on the wall of the [[Circus of Nero]], flanking St Peter's Basilica:
:"The elder [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-erecting the obelisk had daunted even [[Michelangelo]], but [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect it in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project.

The obelisk, half-buried in the debris of the ages, was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dellªobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&amp;word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. – NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [[Carlo Maderno]] came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.

Three more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: the one behind [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] (1587), the giant obelisk at the [[Lateran Basilica]] (1588), and the one at [[Piazza del Popolo]] (1589).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-117|title=Della trasportatione dell'obel – Titelansicht – ETH-Bibliothek Zürich (NEBIS) – e-rara|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An obelisk stands in front of the church of [[Trinità dei Monti]], at the head of the [[Spanish Steps]]. Another obelisk in Rome is sculpted as carried on the back of an [[elephant]]. Rome lost one of its obelisks, the [[Boboli obelisk]] which had decorated the temple of Isis, where it was uncovered in the 16th century. The Medici claimed it for the [[Villa Medici]], but in 1790 they moved it to the [[Boboli Gardens]] attached to the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]], and left a replica in its stead.

Several more Egyptian obelisks have been re-erected elsewhere. The best-known examples outside Rome are the pair of {{convert|21|m|ft|adj=on}} {{convert|187|MT|ST|adj=on}} [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]]s in London ({{convert|69|ft|m|order=flip|disp=or}}) and New York City ({{convert|70|ft|m|order=flip|disp=or}}) and the {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} {{convert|227|MT|ST|adj=on}} [[Luxor Obelisk|obelisk at]] the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/world.html|title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; A World of Obelisks |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyrian===
Obelisk monuments are also known from the [[Assyria]]n civilization, where they were erected as public monuments that commemorated the achievements of the Assyrian king.

The [[British Museum]] possesses four Assyrian obelisks:

The [[White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I]] (named due to its colour), was discovered by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] in 1853 at [[Nineveh]]. The obelisk was erected by either [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1050–1031 BC) or [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king’s seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.

The Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [[Hormuzd Rassam]], was found on the citadel of [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments. The surviving parts of the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing to the king from Syria and the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=366799&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Rassam+Obelisk&amp;page=1|title=Collection object details|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Obelisk]] was discovered by [[Sir Austen Henry Layard]] in 1846 on the citadel of Kalhu. The obelisk was erected by [[Shalmaneser III]] and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, [[Jehu]] the Israelite and Sua the Gilzanean, giving gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III’s annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.

The Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh. Only the top of this [[monolith]] has been reconstructed in the British Museum. The obelisk is the oldest recorded obelisk from Assyria, dating to the 11th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=277955&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Broken+Obelisk&amp;page=1|title=Collection object details|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axumite (Ethiopia)===
[[Image:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|[[King Ezana's Stele]] in [[Axum]].]]
A number of obelisks were carved in the ancient [[Axumite Kingdom]] of today northern [[Ethiopia]]. Together with ({{convert|21|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}) [[King Ezana's Stele]], the last erected one and the only unbroken, the most famous example of axumite obelisk is the so-called ({{convert|24|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}h) [[Obelisk of Axum]]. It was carved around the 4th century AD and, in the course of time, it collapsed and broke into three parts. In these conditions it was found by Italian soldiers in 1935, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], looted and taken to Rome in 1937, where it stood in the Piazza di [[Porta Capena]]. Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.

The largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})&lt;ref&gt;"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World" edited by Chris scarre 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in "stelae fields".

===Ancient Roman===
[[Image:Örme dikilitaş.JPG|thumb|The Walled Obelisk in [[Sultanahmet Square]]]]
The Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style. Examples include:

*Arles, France —the [[Arles Obelisk]], in Place de la République, a 4th-century obelisk of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin

===Byzantine===
*[[Walled Obelisk]], Hippodrome of Constantinople. Built by [[Constantine VII]] Porphyrogenitus (905–959) and originally covered with gilded bronze plaques.

===Pre-Columbian===
The prehistoric Tello Obelisk, found in 1919 at ''[[Chavín de Huantar]]'' in [[Peru]], is a monolith stele with obelisk-like proportions. It was carved in a design of low relief with Chavín symbols, such as bands of teeth and animal heads. Long housed in the ''[[Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú]]'' in [[Lima]], it was relocated to the ''Museo Nacional de Chavín'', which opened in July 2008. The obelisk was named for the archeologist [[Julio C. Tello]], who discovered it and was considered the "father of Peruvian archeology."  He was America's first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] archeologist.&lt;ref name="iowa"&gt;[http://www.uiowapress.org/books/2009-spring/burger.htm Richard L. Burger, Abstract of "The Life and Writings of Julio C. Tello"], University of Iowa Press, accessed 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erection experiments==
In late summer 1999, Roger Hopkins and [[Mark Lehner]] teamed up with a [[NOVA (TV series)]] crew to erect a 25-ton obelisk. This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August–September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.

First Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html "Dispatches"], NOVA&lt;/ref&gt; Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].

One experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.

The final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15° had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations. It seems to have been supported by a 3,000-year-old [[papyrus]] [[scroll]] in which one scribe taunts another to erect a monument for "thy lord". The scroll reads "Empty the space that has been filled with sand beneath the monument of thy Lord."&lt;ref&gt;[[NOVA (TV series)]] ''Secrets of Lost Empire II'': "Pharaoh's Obelisks"&lt;/ref&gt; To erect the obelisks at Luxor with this method would have involved using over a million cubic meters of stone, mud brick and sand for both the ramp and the platform used to lower the obelisk.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile'', New York: TIME/Life, 1993, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; The largest obelisk successfully erected in ancient times weighed {{convert|455|MT|ST}}. A {{convert|520|MT|ST|adj=on}} stele was found in [[Axum]], but researchers believe it was broken while attempting to erect it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1228">The '''People's Music Network for Songs of Freedom and Struggle, Inc.''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] that serves as a network of musicians, activists, songwriters, concert producers, sound engineers, and others, who use music and culture to promote progressive ideas and values.  Founded in 1977 by [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Charlie King (folksinger)|Charlie King]], the organization has two gatherings each year, one in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] in early June, and one in late January in various cities (usually on the east coast of the USA, but sometimes in other locations).  The gatherings serve to provide networking opportunities for artists and activists, offering workshops on various topics (environmental songs, women's songs, labor songs, etc.), a Round Robin where each participant can perform one song for all others, and a loosely structured "Songs of the Spirit" session where inspiring a capella songs are sung.

'''Peter Barrett''' designed and provided the artwork for a set of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|United Kingdom postage stamps]] depicting dogs in 1979. A commemorative [[First day of issue|first day cover]] was also brought out.

==Illustrations==

Peter Barrett's career as an illustrator took off after writing and illustrating a three book series for very young children, along with his wife Susan Barrett. Published by [[Ward Lock]], the books (The circle Sara drew, The square Ben drew, The line Sophie drew) became very popular. Barrett subsequently concentrated on animal art and illustrations, illustrating numerous children's non-fiction books, specializing in dogs, horses and dinosaurs. His illustrations for ''Birdwatcher's Diary'', by ''Roger Lovegrove'', in 1982 drew critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A biographical perspective of his work was published in 1986 by his wife Susan Barrett titled "Travels with a wildlife artist: the living landscape of Greece". Peter Barrett illustrated the book and also contributed to the text. In the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, his stature as an animal artist and children's book illustrator has grown hand in hand. Peter Barrett illustrated reprints and collections of  famous animal centric stories and books by [[Gerald Durrell]], [[Desmond Morris]] and [[James Herriot]]. He illustrated a number of books under the highly popular [[Little Golden Books]] label for children. He has also illustrated the 1987 Random House edition of the children's classic [[The Wind in the Willows]], by [[Kenneth Grahame]].

'''''Saint Catherine of Alexandria''''' (c. 1598) is an oil painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]]. It is part of the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection]] of [[Madrid]]. 

[[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]] was a popular figure in [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[iconography]]. She was of noble origins, and dedicated herself as a [[Christianity|Christian]] after having a [[vision (religion)|vision]]. At the age of 18 she confronted the [[Roman Emperor]] Maximus (presumably this refers to [[Galerius]] Maximianus), debated his [[paganism|pagan]] [[philosophy|philosophers]], and succeeded in [[proselytism|converting]] many of them to Christianity.  Imprisoned by the emperor, she converted his empress and the leader of his armies. Maximus executed her converts (including the empress) and ordered that Catherine herself be put to death on a [[Breaking wheel|spiked wheel]].  The wheel reportedly shattered the moment Catherine touched it. Maximus then had her beheaded. She became patron saint of libraries and librarians, as well as teachers, archivists, and all those associated with wisdom and teaching, and all those whose livelihoods depended upon wheels. The year of her martyrdom was traditionally held to have been 305, (the year of a major persecution of Christians under Galerius), and her feastday was celebrated on 25 November. In 1969 the Church, persuaded by the overwhelming opinion of historians that Catherine had probably never existed, removed her from the [[calendar of saints]]; by 2002, while the majority of historians had not changed their minds, the Church had, and she was reinstated. Her qualities are supposed to be those of beauty, fearlessness, virginity, and intelligence.

[[File:Hunting King Plate, 303-309 AD, Sasanian, Iran, silver and gilt - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08117.JPG|thumb|300px|Silver-gilt bowl with king hunting, a typical subject in Sasanian metalwork]]

'''Sasanian art''', or Sassanid art, was produced under the [[Sasanian Empire]] which ruled from the 3rd to 7th centuries AD, before the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] was completed around 651.  In 224 AD, the last [[Parthia]]n king was defeated by [[Ardashir I]]. The resulting [[List of shahanshahs of the Sasanian Empire|Sasanian dynasty]] would last for four hundred years, ruling modern Iran, Iraq, and much territory to the east and north of modern Iran. At times the Levant, much of Anatolia and parts of Egypt and Arabia were under its control. It began a new era in Iran and [[Mesopotamia]], which in many ways was built on [[Achaemenid]] traditions, including the art of the period. Nevertheless, there were also other influences on art of the period that came from as far as China and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Harper; Cotterell, 177–178;&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving art of the Sassanids is best seen in its architecture, reliefs and metalwork, and there are some surviving paintings from what was evidently a widespread production.  Stone reliefs were probably greatly outnumbered by interior ones in plaster, of which only fragments have survived.  Free standing sculptures are fewer than in [[Parthian art]], but the [[Colossal Statue of Shapur I]] (r. AD 240–272) is a major exception, carved from a [[stalagmite]] grown in a cave;&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;Harper&lt;/ref&gt; there are literary mentions of other colossal statues of kings, now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Keall&lt;/ref&gt;  There are important Sassanid rock reliefs, and the Parthian tradition of moulded stucco decoration to buildings continued, also including large figurative scenes.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt;
[[File:Iranian - Plate - Walters 57709.jpg|thumb|Silver plate, 6th century]]

Surviving Sassanid art depicts courtly and chivalric scenes, with considerable grandeur of style, reflecting the lavish life and display of the Sassanid court as recorded by Byzantine ambassadors.  Images of rulers dominate many of the surviving works, though none are as large as the [[Colossal Statue of Shapur I]]. Hunting and battle scenes enjoyed a special popularity, and lightly-clothed dancing girls and entertainers.  Representations are often arranged like a coat of arms, which in turn may have had a strong influence on the production of art in Europe and East Asia. Although Parthian art preferred the front view, the narrative representations of the Sassanian art often features figures shown in the profile or a three-quarter view. Frontal views occur less frequently.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt;

==Sculpture and rock reliefs==

[[File:IR04-08-23a.jpg|thumb|[[Taq Bostan]]; the "knight" is probably [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrow Parviz]] mounted on [[Shabdiz]]]]
Free standing sculptures are rare in this period, compared under the Parthians.  The [[Colossal Statue of Shapur I]] (r. AD 240–272) is the single outstanding exception to survive.

The large carved [[rock relief]], typically placed high beside a road, and near a source of water, is a common medium in Persian art, mostly used to glorify the king and proclaim Persian control over territory.&lt;ref&gt;Canepa, 53 and throughout. Canepa, 63–64, 76–78 on siting&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins with [[Lullubi]] and [[Elam]]ite rock reliefs, such as those at [[Kul-e Farah]] and [[Eshkaft-e Salman]] in southwest Iran, and continues under the Assyrians.  The [[Behistun Inscription|Behistun relief and inscription]], made around 500 BC for [[Darius the Great]], is on a far grander scale, reflecting and proclaiming the power of the [[Achaemenid empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Luschey; Canepa, 55–57&lt;/ref&gt; Persian rulers commonly boasted of their power and achievements, until the Muslim conquest removed imagery from such monuments; much later there was a small revival under the [[Qajar dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Herrmann and Curtis"&gt;Herrmann and Curtis&lt;/ref&gt;

Behistun is unusual in having a large and important inscription, which like the Egyptian [[Rosetta Stone]] repeats its text in three different languages, and was important in the modern understanding of these languages. Other Persian reliefs generally lack inscriptions, and the kings involved often can only be tentatively identified.  The problem is helped in the case of the Sassanids by their custom of showing a different style of crown for each king, which can be identified from their coins.&lt;ref name="Herrmann and Curtis"/&gt;

[[Naqsh-e Rustam]] is the [[necropolis]] of the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] (500–330 BC), with four large tombs cut high into the cliff face. These have mainly architectural decoration, but the facades include large panels over the doorways, each very similar in content, with figures of the king being invested by a god, above a zone with rows of smaller figures bearing tribute, with soldiers and officials. The three classes of figures are sharply differentiated in size. The entrance to each tomb is at the centre of each cross, which opens onto a small chamber, where the king lay in a [[sarcophagus]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cotterell, 162; Canepa, 57–59, 65–68&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal beam of each of the tomb's facades is believed to be a replica of the entrance of the palace at [[Persepolis]].

Well below the Achaemenid tombs, near ground level, are rock reliefs with large figures of Sassanian kings, some meeting gods, others in combat.  The most famous shows [[Shapur I]] on horseback, with the Roman Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] bowing to him in submission, and [[Philip the Arab]] (an earlier emperor who paid Shapur tribute) holding Shapur's horse, while the dead Emperor [[Gordian III]], killed in battle, lies beneath it (other identifications have been suggested).  This commemorates the [[Battle of Edessa]] in 260 AD, when Valerian became the only Roman Emperor who was captured as a prisoner of war, a lasting humiliation for the Romans.  The placing of these reliefs clearly suggests the Sassanid intention to link themselves with the glories of the earlier [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann and Curtis; Canepa, 62, 65–68&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three further Achaemenid royal tombs with similar reliefs at [[Persepolis]], one unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/va-vh/vandenberghe/vandenberghe_list.html Vanden Berghe #27–29]&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven Sassanian reliefs, whose approximate dates range from 225 to 310 AD, show subjects including investiture scenes and battles.  The earliest relief at the site is [[Elam]]ite, from about 1000 BC. About a kilometre away is [[Naqsh-e Rajab]], with a further four Sassanid rock reliefs, three celebrating kings and one a high priest.  Another important Sassanid site is [[Taq Bostan]] with several reliefs including two royal investitures and a famous figure of a [[cataphract]] or Persian heavy cavalryman, about twice life size, probably representing the king [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrow Parviz]] mounted on his favourite horse [[Shabdiz]]; the pair continued to be celebrated in later Persian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann and Curtis; Canepa, 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Firuzabad, Fars]] and [[Bishapur]] have groups of Sassanian reliefs, the former including the oldest, a large battle scene, now badly worn.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann and Curtis; Keall for the six at Bishapur&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Barm-e Delak]] a king offers a flower to his queen.

Sassanian reliefs are concentrated in the first 80 years of the dynasty, though one important set are 6th-century, and at relatively few sites, mostly in the Sassanid heartland.  The later ones in particular suggest that they draw on a now-lost tradition of similar reliefs in palaces in [[stucco]].  The rock reliefs were probably coated in plaster and painted.&lt;ref name="Herrmann and Curtis"/&gt;

The standard catalogue of pre-Islamic Persian reliefs lists the known examples (as at 1984) as follows: [[Lullubi]] #1–4; [[Elam]] #5–19; Assyrian #20–21; Achaemenid #22–30; Late/Post-Achaemenid and Seleucid #31–35; Parthian #36–49; Sasanian #50–84; others #85–88.&lt;ref&gt;Vanden Berghe, Louis, ''Reliefs rupestres de l' Iran ancien'', 1983, Brussels, per [http://www.livius.org/va-vh/vandenberghe/vandenberghe_list.html online summary of his list here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliefs==
[[File:Taq-e Bostan - equestrian statue.jpg|thumb|[[Rock relief]] of [[Khosrau II]] mounted on his horse [[Shabdiz]] fully armed for battle]]
[[File:Taq-e Bostan - Low-relief the boar hunt.jpg|thumb|Boar hunt in Taq-e Bostan]]

Some of the greatest achievements are mainly a series of more than thirty [[rock relief]] monuments. They are mostly found in [[Fars Province]], which was the original province of the ruling Sassanid house. The reliefs mostly date back to between the 3rd and beginning of the 4th centuries.  The reliefs depict some significant event and are usually attributed to specific rulers.

A relief at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] is mounted below the Achaemenid royal tombs, and is therefore probably in reference to this, as a way for a monarch to likein and connect himself to the old dynasty and pay homage.   Ardashir I is depicted with the god [[Ahura Mazda]], each in strict profile and of the same size. This depicts an equality of the monarch and the god, indicating a greatness about him. The relief is modeled very strong, but is rather cautious in the presentation of details. There is evidence of [[Hellenistic]] influences in the relief.

Other reliefs, such as at Taq-e Bostan, are mounted in a rock-hewn arch. On the back wall of this there are almost fully sculpted figures. [[Khosrau II]] is illustrated on a horse in a heavy suit of armor. The scenes on the sides of this show a royal hunt. The figure of the ruler is shown in front view, his face contrast in three-quarter view. His figure is tall and dominates the whole scene, other figures, however, are shown comparatively small. The composition gives the representation of landscape and many details such as the court of the king, a rather picturesque impression and was certainly once painted.

==Stucco==
In addition to the rock reliefs, stucco reliefs played a major role in art under the Sassanids. Since stone brick buildings were conceived as ugly, they were covered in stucco.  Within these stucco walls reliefs were often carved of mainly floral patterns, but also figurative representations and especially animals.  Often important state buildings, such as palaces and administrative headquearers, would have been decorated as such, often colored white.  The practice of such was probably adopted to rival the same custom from the [[Greco-Roman world]], despite that at the time Rome and Sassanid Persia were [[Roman–Persian Wars|rivals]].

==Paintings==
Paintings played a substantial role in Sassanid art, although it is currently poorly documented.  [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] was known to have been a painter of some fame, apparently for panel paintings or miniatures in books.  Nothing of this sort remains from the period, although the tradition of the [[Persian miniature]] from some centuries later was apparently the earliest in the Islamic world.

One of the few sites where wall-paintings survived in quantity is [[Panjakent]] in modern [[Tajikistan]], and ancient [[Sogdia]], which was barely, if at all, under the control of the central Sassanid power.  The old city was abandoned in the decades after the Muslims eventually took the city in 722 and has been extensively excavated in modern times.  Large areas of wall paintings survived from the palace and private houses, which are mostly now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] or [[Tashkent]].  They covered whole rooms and were accompanied by large quantities of reliefs in wood.  The subjects are similar to other Sasanian art, with enthroned kings, feasts, battles, and beautiful women, and there are illustrations of both Persian and Indian epics, as well as a complex mixture of deities.  They mostly date from the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Marshak, Boris I, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/panjikant "Panjicant"], 2002, ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''; Canby (1993), 9; Harper; many photos at [http://warfare.ml/Persia/Sogdian_murals_from_Panjakent-6-8C.htm warfare.ml]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hajjiabad, Fars|Hajiabad]] a mansion in Iran was excavated, that still contained well-preserved paintings. The walls were decorated with frontal view busts.&lt;ref&gt;Massoud Azarnoush: ''The Sasanian manor house at Hājīābād, Iran'', Firenze 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The frescos at [[Dura Europos]], on the frontier of the Roman Empire and Sassanid Persia, are also relevant, with many figures in Persian dress. The most famous come from the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], and date from around 244-256; those in the [[Dura-Europos church]] may be a few years older.

At [[Bishapur]] floor [[mosaic]]s in a broadly Greco-Roman style have survived, and these were probably widespread in other elite settings, perhaps made by craftsmen from the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Keall for Bishapur; see Harper for other sites&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Ctesiphon-ruin 1864.jpg|thumb|[[Taq Kasra]] at [[Ctesiphon]] in 1864, before further collapses, with three men at the top of the arch.]]
[[File:Firuz abad iwan.jpg|thumb|250px|The arch of the palace at [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]]]]

The grandest buildings of [[Sassanid architecture]] were very large palaces in brick, with high vaulted halls, that were important in the development of the [[iwan]] in [[Islamic architecture]].  The Sassanids further developed the vaults and arches used by the Parthians, usually with a large opening to one side of the hall in iwan style.

[[Taq Kasra]], the palace at [[Ctesiphon]], is dominated by an arched hall, with much of the enormous vault still standing. The facade is elaborately articulated with columns and niches which once bore paintings and reliefs.

The Palace of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]] (Iran) was built by [[Ardashir I]]. It is located on a small lake, which opens to the main arch of the structure. From that opening on both sides slightly smaller halls present are also curved. Behind the main arch is also a hall with a dome 22-meters high., with two domed rooms on either side. Behind these rooms, there is a surrounding courtyard which connects all around. The walls of the rooms are divided by niches and once had rich stucco decorations. The area around the palace was once a garden.  The garden, palace, and lake were all built together and were at a time connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =A Sassanian Palace or Fire Temple?| work =Vohuman.org| url =http://www.vohuman.org/SlideShow/Firuzabad/Firuzabad00.htm Firuzâbâd -- A Sassanian Palace or Fire Temple?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban planning===

The Sassanids built numerous new cities during their dynasty with elaborate planning. Many of them are circular, mainly as a defensive tactical advantage it had during sieges. The walls of a round city could enclose with the same length of a larger area. But there were also rectangular-scale urban systems. These are usually associated with Roman architects who were abducted by the Sassanids. Although this was probably needed for the planning of these cities in the Sassanid style. Rectangular city facilities are therefore considered as an alternative Sasanian urban planning system.

[[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]] is a settlement built under Ardashir I and a well-documented example of Sasanian urban planning. The city had a diameter of 2&amp;nbsp;km and was circular. Two roads divided them into four districts, which in turn were divided into 5 smaller sectors and thus ordered the entire city in 20 sectors. The detailed planning seems to have continued in the surrounding landscape. Bishapur and [[Gundeshapur]], however, are conversely perpendicular cities. Bishapur seems to have been developed by Roman craftsmen, since the local palace is decorated with mosaics in the Hellenistic style.

==Coinage==
[[File:Ardaschiri coin 3.jpg|thumb|250px|Coin with image of [[Ardashir I]] with eternal fire on lapel to the right]]
[[File:Hormidzii.jpg|thumb|250px|Coin of [[Hormizd II]].  Note that the Sassanid crown changes from ruler to ruler.]]
Coins are a particularly important source for a major reason; they are easily datable from all periods of the Sassanid period. Using the name of the ruler's image on the coin in [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] and it can be used to date other works of art. The front usually shows the image of the ruler, sometimes together with a son or wife, rarely with both. On the back there are several scenes, including an investiture or an altar, on which the eternal fire is burning. The tradition of these designs begins with the rather stiff image of [[Ardashir I]] (224-242), and under [[Shapur I]] (240–270). Under [[Shapur II]] (310–379), it is again made of the same material, while the detail modeling is slightly decreased. This is, however, important again later. In the following period the designs are often highly stylized and have been partially recorded.

==Arts and crafts==
[[File:Iran sasanide, coppa ovale in argento con sogg. vegetali e geometrici, VII sec.JPG|thumb|left|Sasanian decoration on the underside of a silver vessel, 7th century]]

===Metalwork===
A number of Sasanid silver vessels have survived, especially rather large plates or bowls used to serve food.  These have high-quality engraved or embossed decoration from a courtly repertoire of mounted kings or heroes, and scenes of hunting, combat and feasting, often partially [[gilding|gilded]].  Ewers, presumably for wine, may feature dancing girls in relief. These were exported to China, and also westwards.&lt;ref&gt;Harper; Cotterell, 189–190&lt;/ref&gt;

A special feature of Sassanid art is represented by shells of silver and gold, on the inner surface of which a scene is etched into a relief. About a hundred specimens are known of, which demonstrate the literary splendor of the court. Many come from excavations, but they are mostly chance finds. Many were found near the [[Ural Mountains]] in Russia and were likely traded in this area. The original purpose, function and authority of these shells therefore remains in the dark. Often, a ruler is shown at the hunt. He usually sits on a horse that moves in a flying gallop. He stands with his sword pointed at a dangerous animal such as a [[boar]] or [[lion]] or shooting a bow and arrow. The face often appears in three-quarter view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Shapur II| work =The State Hermitage| url =http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_5_4a.html Schapur II. auf der Löwenjagd| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130823221830/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_5_4a.html| archivedate =2013-08-23| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some peaceful representations that occur, such as depictions of animals and fantasy creatures. Earlier versions of the silver shell bowls usually depict a monarch in full relief, dominating the entire shell. Later,however, in the 4th and 5th centuries the focal character of the shell shares space with a smaller secondary character or element.

Another group of metal goods are present; richly decorated vessels whose shape may have been adopted from the customs of the Mediterranean.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Textiles===
Carpets evidently could reach a high level of sophistication, as the praise lavished on the lost royal [[Baharestan Carpet]] by the Muslim conquerors shows. But the only surviving fragments that might originate from Sasanid Persia are humbler productions, probably made by nomad tribes.  Sasanid textiles were famous, and fragments have survived, mostly with designs based on animals in compartments, in a long-lasting style.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt;

There are indications that especially colorful decorated fabrics had a special importance under the Sassanids. However, the assessment of this art form presents many difficulties for the research, as there are few textiles that date back to the Sassanid Empire itself and the findings outside the empire (e.g. in [[Egypt]]) are not always of clear origin, if it was imported from the Sassanids or their own imitations or creations. Especially when the textiles are decorated with heraldic animal patterns, a Sassanid origin is usually assumed. Typical are [[peacock]]s, [[Sheep|ram]]s and other animals that are arranged singly or in pairs within a rosette. The ram was the god of war in connection to [[Verethragna]] and therefore held a particular popularity in the Sasanian arts as a motif for textiles.

===Glass===
[[File:Tabriz Museum Sasanid Glass 1.jpg|thumb|Sassanid glass bowls]]
[[Sasanian glass]] continued and developed [[Roman glass]] technology. In simpler forms it seems to have been available to a wide range of the population, and was a popular luxury export to [[Byzantium]] and China, even appearing in elite burials from the period in Japan.  Technically, it is a silica-soda-lime glass production characterized by thick glass-blown vessels relatively sober in decoration, avoiding plain colours in favour of transparency and with vessels worked in one piece without over- elaborate amendments. Thus the decoration usually consists of solid and visual motifs from the mould (reliefs), with ribbed and deeply cut facets, although other techniques like trailing and applied motifs were practised.&lt;ref name="Harper"/&gt; Sasanian pottery does not seem to have been used by the elites, and is mostly utilitarian.

==Influence==
Sassanid art had a strong influence on the Islamic art of [[Persia]]. Arches are one of the most characteristic elements of Persian architecture. Especially in Central Asia, such as [[Sogdiana]] the methods and customs of art are directly attributable to the Sassanids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Soldier on wall painting from Pendischkent in a heavily influenced Sassanid style| work =Kroraina| url =http://www.kroraina.com/ca/pict/ca18bg.jpg Soldat auf Wandmalerei aus Pendischkent in einem stark sassanidisch beeinflussten Stil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heraldic arrangement of animals in pairs found in [[Byzantine]] and [[medieval Europe]] later seems to have been adopted directly from the artwork of the Sassanid Empire.

It was mainly through textiles that heraldric motifs spread, although some mosaics as early as the 6th century from [[Antioch]] depicted the same motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Sacred Destinations| work =Antioch Mosaic Photos| url =http://www.sacred-destinations.com/turkey/antioch-mosaic-photos/ibexes-louvre-cc-Antiquite-Tardive-flickr.jpg.html Ausschnitt aus Mosaik| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003937/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/turkey/antioch-mosaic-photos/ibexes-louvre-cc-Antiquite-Tardive-flickr.jpg.html| archivedate =2007-09-27| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saturn Devouring His Son''''' is the name given to a painting by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Francisco Goya]]. According to the traditional interpretation, it depicts the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of the [[titans (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]] (in the title Romanized to [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]), who, fearing that he would be overthrown by one of his children,&lt;ref&gt;"These great Cronos swallowed as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees with this intent, that no other of the proud sons of Heaven should hold the kingly office amongst the deathless gods. For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus." - Hesiod {{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm|title= Theogony |publisher=Sacred-Texts.com |accessdate=2013-08-25 |date=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[filicide|ate each one]] upon their birth. The work is one of the 14 ''[[Black Paintings]]'' that Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823. It was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]] after Goya's death and has since been held in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]].

==Background==
[[File:Quinta del Sordo 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Quinta del Sordo, c. 1900]]
In 1819, Goya purchased a house on the banks of [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]] near Madrid called [[Quinta del Sordo]] (Villa of the Deaf Man). It was a two-story house which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, although the name was fitting for Goya too, who had been left deaf after contracting a fever in 1792. Between 1819 and 1823, when he left the house to move to [[Bordeaux]], Goya produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with [[oil painting|oils]] directly onto the walls of the house. At the age of 73, and having survived two life-threatening illnesses, Goya was likely to have been concerned with his own mortality, and was increasingly embittered by the [[Trienio Liberal|civil strife]] occurring in Spain. Although he initially decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images, in time he overpainted them all with the intensely haunting pictures known today as the ''Black Paintings''. Uncommissioned and never meant for public display, these pictures reflect his darkening mood with some tense scenes of malevolence and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;"But never before and never since, as far as we know, has a major, ambitious cycle of paintings been painted with the intention of keeping the pictures an entirely private affair." Licht, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saturn Devouring His Son'', a disturbing portrait of the titan Saturn consuming one of his children, was one of six works with which Goya decorated the dining room. According to Roman myth (inspired by the original Greek myth), it had been foretold that one of the sons of Saturn would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his father, [[Caelus]]. To prevent this, Saturn ate his children moments after each was born. His wife [[Ops]] eventually hid his third son, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], on the island of [[Crete]], deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling in his place. Jupiter eventually supplanted his father just as the prophecy had predicted.

Goya never named the works he produced at Quinta del Sordo; the names were assigned by others after his death,&lt;ref name="Licht, 168"&gt;Licht, 168&lt;/ref&gt; and this painting is also known as just ''Saturn'', ''Saturn Devouring One of His Sons'', ''Saturn Devouring his Children'' or by the Spanish names ''Saturno devorando a su hijo'' or ''Saturno devorando a un hijo''.

Goya depicts Saturn feasting upon one of his sons. His child's head and part of the left arm have already been consumed. The right arm has probably been eaten too, though it could be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking another bite from the left arm; as he looms from the darkness, his mouth gapes and his eyes bulge widely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his fingers into the back of the body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis,&lt;ref&gt;Morden and Pulimood in Farthing, 375&lt;/ref&gt; but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rubens saturn.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Peter Paul Rubens]]' more [[Baroque]]-style ''[[Saturn (Rubens)|Saturn Devouring His Son]]'' (1636) may have inspired [[Goya]].]]
Various interpretations of the meaning of the picture have been offered: the conflict between youth and old age, time as the devourer of all things, the wrath of God and an allegory of the situation in Spain, where the fatherland consumed its own children in wars and revolution. There have been explanations rooted in Goya's relationships with his own son, Xavier, the only of his six children to survive to adulthood, or with his live-in housekeeper and possible mistress, Leocadia Weiss; the sex of the body being consumed cannot be determined with certainty. If Goya made any notes on the picture, they have not survived; as he never intended the picture for public exhibition, he probably had little interest in explaining its significance. It has been said that the painting is "essential to our understanding of the human condition in modern times, just as [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] is essential to understanding the tenor of the 16th century".&lt;ref&gt;Licht, 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Goya may have been inspired by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]' 1636 [[Saturn (Rubens)|picture of the same name]]. Rubens' painting, also held at the Museo del Prado, is a brighter, more conventional treatment of the myth: his Saturn exhibits less of the [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] ferocity portrayed in Goya's rendition. However, some critics have suggested that Rubens' portrayal is the more horrific: the god is portrayed as a calculating remorseless killer, who – fearing for his own position of power&amp;nbsp;– murders his innocent child. Goya's vision, on the other hand, shows a man driven mad by the act of killing his own son. Or it could be interpreted as a titan driven wild with fear at the idea of usurpation from one of his children.  In addition, the body of the son in Goya's picture is that of an adult, not the helpless baby depicted by Rubens. Goya had produced a chalk drawing of the same subject in 1796-7 that was closer in tone to Rubens' work: it showed a Saturn similar in appearance to that of Rubens', daintily biting on the leg of one of his sons while he holds another like a leg of chicken, with none of the gore or madness of the later work.  Goya scholar Fred Licht has raised doubts regarding the traditional title however, noting that the classical iconographical attributes associated with Saturn are absent from the painting, and the body of the smaller figure does not resemble that of an infant.&lt;ref name="Licht, 168"/&gt; The rounded buttocks and wide hips of the headless corpse has also called into question the identification of this figure as a male.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transfer from the Quinta del Sordo==
Although they were not meant to be seen by the public, the paintings remain important works in Goya's oeuvre. When Goya went into self-imposed exile in France in 1823, he passed Quinta del Sordo to his grandson, Mariano. After various changes of ownership, the house came into the possession of the Belgian Baron [[Frédéric Emile d'Erlanger|Emile d'Erlanger]] in 1874. After 70 years on the walls of Quinta del Sordo, the murals were deteriorating badly and, in order to preserve them, the new owner of the house had them transferred to canvas under the direction of [[Salvador Martínez Cubells]], the chief art restorer at the Museo del Prado. After showing them at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1878 in Paris, d'Erlanger eventually donated them to the Spanish state. The effects of time on the murals, coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas, meant that most of the murals required restoration work and some detail may have been lost, but in this respect ''Saturn Devouring His Son'' appears to have fared better than some of the other works.

==Notes==
{{reflist|30em}}
Guillermo del Toro's ''Pan's Labyrinth'' (2006) models a monster-character, the Pale Man, after the Saturn who devoured his children. On the walls of the Pale Man's subterranean lair, a replica of the worldside banquet table of the monstrous Captain Vidal, whose inner self the Pale Man represents, are paintings of the Pale Man murdering children.

The '''State Institute of Film and Television''' ('''SIFTV''') is a [[Film School]] under the [[State University of Performing And Visual Arts]] located in [[Rohtak]], [[Haryana]], [[India]]. The institute was established in 2011 by the [[Government of Haryana]] to grow regional cinema.

==History==

The institute was established in 2011. The Integrated Institutional Campus at Rohtak comprises four institutions, namely State Institute of Design (SID), State Institute of Fine Arts (SIFA), '''State Institute of Film and Television''' ('''SIFTV''') and State Institute of Urban Planning and Architecture (SIUPA). These institutions are being established at a capital expenditure of Rs.300.0 crores by Govt. of Haryana through Government Technical Institution Society (GTIS), Rohtak. After 2014 these institutes were affiliated to [[State University of Performing And Visual Arts]]

==Courses==
The Institute of Film and Television is a part of the larger campus with necessary and modern facilities for training students in the art of film making. While students grasp the practical aspect of film making, they also learn the finer nuances of this art. They begin to view their art in context with the moving image and the impact it has on the viewers. There are five fields of this art in which training is offered. A common thread that binds all the courses is a one-year foundation course where all students, irrespective of their chosen discipline, learn all aspects of film making at a basic level. This is considered essential to imbibe team spirit and equipping a student so that he/she understand the job responsibilities and crafts of other crew members of a film making team. From the second year onwards the focus shifts to a better understanding of the student’s chosen field of specialisation. Other than acquiring professional skill in the specialization, a student also learns aesthetics and finer points of the art. Intensity of practical work increases in proportion to theoretical inputs and there is frequent interaction with visiting faculty from the film and television industry. Study tours also enrich students’ experience. By the third year a student acquires sufficient knowledge of his/her field of specialization, and enough practical exercises are stated where he/she can showcase conceptual and technical skills culminating in the year end project that compares to a near professional, finished film. This is his/her show reel. The institute offers following streams: Acting, Cinematography, Direction, Editing, Sound Recording and Sound Design.

== Plot ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}

=== Part One ===

'''&lt;u&gt;Opening Sequence - Home Again Tour - ''New Mexico 1997''&lt;/u&gt;'''

Narration by Brook Payne ([[Wood Harris]]), the group's first manager, sets the stage: all six members of [[New Edition]] are back on tour in 1997, almost twenty years after the group's formation, separations, and solo projects.  The divisions are still present as, in addition to performing the group's hits, the three solo acts - [[Ralph Tresvant]], [[Johnny Gill]], and [[Bobby Brown]] - and the trio [[Bell Biv DeVoe]] (or BBD, for short, made up by [[Ricky Bell (singer)]], [[Michael Bivins]], and [[Ronnie DeVoe]]) also have their own scheduled sets.

Tensions reach a boiling point at the [[New Mexico]] concert.  As Brown - whose decade-long selfishness and severely erratic behavior resulted in his being suspended from the group a decade prior - starts yet another song well after his scheduled time is up, DeVoe goes on stage, thanking Brown for his performance. He then directs the [[disc jockey|DJ]] to begin playing the BBD set.  After briefly walking off stage, an enraged Brown returns and gets into a confrontation with DeVoe, as the musical performance is replaced by a wild brawl among the various New Edition members and their entourages, punctuated by a gunshot.

Payne's narration states that ego, pride, and greed resulted in this blow up of what had once been a successful group and decides to rewind the scene nearly twenty years, back to the group's founding in Roxbury, Massachusetts.	 	
	
'''&lt;u&gt;The rise of New Edition - ''Roxbury, MA - 1978-1983''&lt;/u&gt;'''
	
It's a normal day for the people of [[Roxbury, Boston|Orchard Park]] Housing Projects (also called "O.P."), in Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1978.

Despite his mother' refusal to grant her son permission, a young [[Ricky Bell (singer)|Ricky Bell]] (played as a youth by [[Caleb McLaughlin]]) sneaks out at night to meet his friend, [[Michael Bivins|Michael "Mike" Bivins]] (played as a youth by Dante Hoagland) to go to a local talent show, where their mutual friend, [[Bobby Brown]] (played as a youth by Tyler Marcel Williams) is scheduled to perform.  Ricky and Mike are impressed by the sound of a vocal group called "The Untouchables", while Bobby's performance is a disappointment as he gets [[stage fright]] within the first few seconds of his song.

The next day, Bobby asks Ricky and Mike to join him on stage the next time he performs, thinking that will help him with his stage fright.  Initially unsure, the pair agree as long as another kid from the neighborhood, [[Ralph Tresvant]] (played as a youth by Jahi D'Allo Winston), can join. The trio made an assumption of the fact he can be pulled away from a girl, whom he has unsuccessfully been trying to impress with his [[karate]] skills.

The quartet try to practice at Ricky's house but squabble a fair amount.  Recognizing they need some guidance, Ricky's sister, Peanut (Bre-Z), suggests they meet with Brooke Payne ([[Wood Harris]]), a manager for several of Boston's rising musical acts.  The boys sneak into the back alley of a club to convince Brooke to manage them, finally winning him over with an [[a capella]] version of [[The Jackson 5]]'s "[[I Want You Back]]".

The next morning, the boys arrive on time to meet Payne. However, Payne doesn't sugarcoat them, warning them they will be doing some extra hard work on their path to becoming musical artists.  Payne comes up with the group's name of New Edition, as if they were either a new version or new edition of the Jacksons.  Weeks of strenuous training features time spent on [[choreography]], physical and mental discipline, and singing, Payne prepares the quartet in  for a big talent showcase at the [[Strand Theatre (Dorchester, Massachusetts)|Strand Theater]], where the winning act will receive a recording contract from [[Maurice Starr]] ([[Faizon Love]]) under his independent record label.

In a format reminiscent of the Amateur Night of the [[Apollo Theater]], New Edition dazzles the crowd. Unfortunately, the judges grant 1st prize to a hip-hop duo, "The Boston Rebels."  The crowd booed the decision, chanting for New Edition so loudly that Maurice gives New Edition a studio recording session and a record deal as well.  To strengthen the Jackson 5 connection, Maurice encourages making the group a quintet, with Brooke suggesting his nephew [[Ronnie DeVoe]] (played as a youth by Myles Truitt) as the fifth member. Ronnie's audition is good enough for the group to accept him, completing the initial five-member formation of New Edition.

Squabbling returns at the recording session, with Ricky and Bobby fighting over a pair of [[headphones]], while Ralph was patiently waiting his turn. Instead, Maurice decides to let Ralph sing first. As a result, the performance is so impressive that Ralph is given the lead vocals for "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]," which would become New Edition's first hit.  Prior to finalizing the group, Maurice offers Ralph a solo deal instead, but Ralph declines, preferring to remain part of New Edition. With their mothers' oversight, the members of New Edition sign their record contract, receiving upfront payments of $500 each and a [[Betamax]] machine.  With "Candy Girl" a nationwide hit, New Edition now are rising young stars. The quintet begin taking photo shoots for the cover of their debut album (also named [[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]), while also getting ready for a nationwide tour.
 	
'''&lt;u&gt;First Album and Candy Girl Tour - ''1983''&lt;/u&gt;'''

With "Candy Girl" #1 on the [[Billboard charts]] (topping Michael Jackson), New Edition begins making TV and concert hall appearances, including headlining a show at the [[Roseland Theater]] in [[New York City]] with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Kurtis Blow]].  When the group has been on tour (with international dates added) for several weeks, the mothers of Ricky and Bobby, who are struggling financially and on food stamps, seem concerned that they have not yet received any checks their sons should have earned from the shows. Therefore, they decide to confront Brooke Payne, who says he is not in control of the group's finances, despite being its manager.  After grumbling about firing Brooke in order to get a manager who could improve the financial situation, they agree to give him a little more time to see if things improve.

'''&lt;u&gt;Transition of Power / Boys Gone Wild - ''1983 to 1984''&lt;/u&gt;'''

The tour finally ends, with the teenagers leaving the high life and returning home to the poverty of Roxbury, at least until their tour checks arrive.  However, when the checks finally show up, each member received $1.87 for the entire tour.  Brooke, who had never had a major deal with a music industry label before New Edition and may have made some mistakes due to that inexperience, tries to explain the intricacies of the deal: the label advanced the group money that it needed to record the album and to promote the tour, with the label recouping that advance from the money the boys would have earned from the various tour dates.  An emotional Brooke, who didn't even get $1.87 for all of his work on the tour, insists that he cares about the boys and wouldn't have intentionally made a deal that was bad for the boys.  Four of the mothers vote to fire Brooke as manager. On the other hand, the lone holdout was Flo DeVoe ([[La La Anthony]]), Brooke's sister, who threatened to pull Ronnie out of the group. Brooke, however, reminded her that the group was their only best chance at getting out of the projects.

The mothers replace Brooke as manager with Gary Evans ([[Michael Rapaport]]), who promises to replace their current deal with Maurice Starr with a better one due to his relationship with [[MCA Records]]. Jheryl Busby ([[Tank (American singer)|Tank]]), an executive at MCA, privately expresses to Gary a lack of interest with New Edition, whom he views as "some ghetto kids."

Having tasted fame and experiencing typical teenage rebellion, the young men of New Edition are less easy to control. Both Gary and the two security guards, Jeff Dyson ([[Wallace Smith (actor)|Wallace Smith]]) and Khalil, unexpectedly walking in on some of the members [[sexual intercourse|having sex]] with female groupies. There is more tension and a lot of anxiety within the group as well. Ralph ([[Algee Smith]])'s talent and constant professionalism result in him taking the lead vocals on most of the songs for the new album. Feeling slighted, the rest of the group focuses more on women and having fun, often without Ralph, to whom they mockingly refer as "the big star."  This in turn makes Ralph feel betrayed by his friends and frustrated that he is carrying so much of the group's work.

=== Part Two ===
'''&lt;u&gt;Roller coaster of troubles - ''1984-1985''&lt;/u&gt;'''

In an effort to patch things up, Ralph asks Gary if the others could have lead vocals in more songs and Gary agrees. It starts with Bobby ([[Woody McClain]]) having lead vocals on "[[Mr. Telephone Man]]" when New Edition was working with singer-songwriter and producer [[Ray Parker Jr.]].  During the recording, Bobby (perhaps letting his constant prominence go to his head) maliciously starts making fun of Mike ([[Bryshere Y. Gray]]) for being unable to correctly hold a note. Mike takes this and teasing by the other members personally. He decides to take a [[Taxicab|cab]] rather than get in the group's [[limousine|limo]], slamming the door shut in frustration. The driver, hearing the slam, assumes that Mike is in the car with them. He backs up and accidentally runs over Mike's foot. When Bobby antagonizes Mike yet again, Mike spits in his face. This eventually triggers a fight that prompted the rest of the group to break up. Gary tells the group that their moms think Mike should be kicked out of the group due to fighting. However, the other guys (including Bobby) stick up for Mike. When Mike returns, Bobby goes up to him first and apologizes for his actions. This allows the group to move forward. While internally repaired, New Edition is clashing with their new choreographer. A frustrated Gary decides to bring in someone who can help keep the group focused: Brooke, who was back only as the choreographer, not the manager.

Echoing the concerns of MCA executive Jheryl (who, while satisfied financially, is still concerned about the "ghetto boys'" public persona), Gary presses New Edition to maintain a clean image and be (or at least appear to be) single, the latter of which is particularly important to their young, female fanbase. While rehearsing for the "Cool It Now" tour, Bobby gets arrested for [[speeding]] in someone else's car that doesn't belong to him and driving without a license. When Gary comes to the station to bail him out, Bobby reveals that his girlfriend, who was in the car with him, is [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. Meanwhile, Ralph's girlfriend back home is also pregnant, but he hasn't told anyone yet. It was later revealed that she would have a [[miscarriage]], partially because Ralph wasn't there to support her during the pregnancy. While smoking [[marijuana|weed]] backstage on tour, the group runs into [[Johnny Gill]] ([[Luke James]]). Johnny is a [[Washington, D.C.]] native, who is another young artist within the MCA family. At another stop on New Edition's tour, no one can locate Bobby, until Gary finds him in the car doing [[cocaine]] with and receiving [[fellatio]] from female groupies. When discussing the situation with his fellow New Edition members, Bobby insists that he has his personal life under control.

&lt;u&gt;'''Out with the old, In with the new - ''1985-1988''&lt;/u&gt;

After the tour, the mothers meet with Gary, frustrated yet again at their sons receiving less money than expected. Gary brings up the group's various expenses and drug/alcohol habits as contributing to the smaller checks, despite New Edition's [[New Edition (album)|self-titled second album]] with MCA being certified platinum.

Viewing the act as "Bobby Brown with New Edition" instead of just "New Edition," Bobby's ego continues to inflate out of control. With his personal and professional life causing two things for New Edition: disturbance and disrespect, it comes to a head at a show in [[Oakland, California]]. While enjoying the whole spotlight to himself after singing lead vocals for "Mr. Telephone Man," Bobby became emotionally irate. Also (in his mind, at least), he was initially upset over being quickly ignored by the crowd, who cheers for New Edition as a whole. Meanwhile, Ronnie, Mike, Ricky, and Ralph initially felt annoyed over Bobby selfishly trying to hog the entire onstage spotlight to himself. As a result, they all quickly transitioned into their next song,      "[[Cool It Now]]." This further enrages Bobby, who has an attitude with the audience (by whom he was ignored), dictating that he wouldn't perform with New Edition anymore. Since Bobby does not get his way in the group, he disrespectfully tosses his [[microphone|mike]] in the air before storming off the set. Fed up with Bobby's actions, Gary pressures Ronnie, Mike, Ricky, and Ralph into voting to kick Bobby out of the group as punishment. Despite their initial reluctance to kick him out, thinking about Bobby's arrest, severe drug usage, continual selfishness, and disrespect eventually prompts the four to unanimously vote Bobby out instead.

While driving with Jeff (one of the group's security guards that Gary had hired), Mike speculates on what (if any) future the group has without Bobby. Jeff makes a suggestion that Mike should consider getting in the business side of the industry, given how few broke executives there are compared to broke musicians, as well as giving him more control. Mike glances at the [[All for Love (New Edition album)|All For Love]] record, which he and the group (including Bobby) had recorded the year prior and notices "Fast Break Productions" on the record rather than MCA Records.  Mike storms into Jheryl's office, interrupting a meeting to demand an explanation. The MCA executive explains to Mike that, rather than being signed to MCA Records, they were signed to Fast Break Productions, which was Gary's company, which in turn had a relationship with MCA Records.  In other words, rather than just being a manager who could use his connections to get the group a deal with MCA (as Gary had indicated to the mothers and the members of the group), Gary had drafted a contract that gave him two things: ownership and control of New Edition. This ensured that he got his money before the group did, as well as allowing him to do things like negotiating a shoe deal without consulting the members of the group. Still stunned that their contract with Gary wasn't much better than their $1.87 contract with Maurice Starr four years ago, Mike can't really respond when Jheryl rhetorically asks him if he even read Gary's contract before signing it as opposed to just relying on Gary's explanation. Jheryl finally ends the meeting with a response, saying, "Welcome to the music business." This gives Mike the opportunity to see what it is like to be a music executive- with the group's approval- meets with an attorney to fire Gary as manager and to work by getting out of their contract in order to sign directly with MCA.

Back home with his mom, Bobby is doing cocaine while watching the remaining members of New Edition perform "[[Count Me Out (song)|Count Me Out]]" on [[Soul Train]]. His mom enters his room to tell him that he has a visitor: Jheryl. He feels Bobby has too much talent to waste his life to drugs and offers him a solo deal with MCA, where he eventually [[King of Stage|records his debut solo album]]. Having moved in together, Ralph's girlfriend encourages him to similarly go solo. Ralph insists that while he is happy with the group, he does start to record some solo tracks without telling the rest of the group beforehand. When Ralph plays some of the solo songs for Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, they feel betrayed. They are not very supportive even when Ralph says he would still be part of the group and just do the solo stuff as a side project, which results in Ralph feeling isolated and frustrated.  When Ronnie expresses concern about how he'd take care of his family without New Edition, Mike starts working on a plan, so that they aren't dependent on Ralph. Meanwhile, Ralph, looking forward to solo money rather than splitting with other members of New Edition, shares his feelings with Jheryl. He stresses the importance of two things: timing and positioning, which is why Ralph's solo album will come out later after New Edition records another album. This one with [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], who had just produced [[Janet Jackson]]'s smash album, [[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]] a year prior.

The group arrives in [[Minneapolis]] to begin recording [[Heart Break]] with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.  Ralph - who is known for always being on time and ready to go - travels separately and arrives late. After a chilly greeting with Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, Ralph is baffled to see a fifth member of New Edition: Johnny Gill, who Mike and Jheryl thought would be a good fit for the group. Angered that he wasn't even consulted about the decision and upset over having to split money five ways again, Ralph storms off. Johnny, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis are also rattled, as they assumed Ralph knew about Johnny.

Still sulking, Ralph can't help but be impressed by Johnny's voice (if not his cowboy boot fashion sense). After a recording session, the two have a private conversation (because the other three guys didn't bother to hang around for the session), with Ralph apologizing for his initial conduct. He was admitting that the situation was more about his relationship with the other guys than anything Johnny had done. Ralph and Johnny realize they have several things in common, including professionalism and being fed the same story by Jheryl about delaying a solo project until after recording a New Edition album. Now that Ralph and Johnny were cool, Ralph jokingly asked if wannabe executive Mike sold Johnny on being the next Bobby. Johnny honestly replied that Mike described it as being the next Ralph. Slightly jarred by the thought of being replaced, Ralph regains his normal focus and dedication, with the entire group contributing to a great performance of "[[Can You Stand The Rain]]" and work well together recording the rest of the album.  While preparing for Heart Break's album cover photo shoot, the men discuss how they've grown personally and professionally in their years in the recording business. When the photographer encourages them to smile, the group insists they know what works best for them and opts for a more serious facial expression.

While working on a music video for [[If It Isn't Love]] (with Brooke Payne once again providing choreography) and preparing for another tour, MCA's A&amp;R/business partner [[Louis Silas Jr.]] ([[Duane Martin]]) drops the bombshell that Bobby will be touring with them.

=== Part Three ===

'''&lt;u&gt;A Fork in the Road - ''1988-1990''&lt;/u&gt;'''

New Edition continues their preparations for the upcoming tour by releasing their new single "[[If It Isn't Love]]." Meanwhile, at the [[Paramount Pictures]] studio, Bobby Brown (who has skyrocketed to super-stardom with his second album ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]'') prepares for his "[[Every Little Step]]" music video.  Brown's barber (DC Young Fly) is distracted by the girls that will appear in the video and accidentally cuts off a chunk of Bobby's hair. This left a slant in Bobby's hair that Bobby irately compares to "[[Gumby]]." Without time to fix it, Bobby is forced to debut what would become his signature look in the video instead.

Bobby and New Edition are generally able to work well together on the tour, which also features singer [[Al B. Sure!]] (Josh David). Despite this, Bobby bristles a bit when "his" supposed lead vocals on [[Jealous Girl]] and [[Mr. Telephone Man]] will be both sung by Johnny even after Bobby originally offered to sing them himself. After a [[Washington, D.C.]] performance, Mike agrees to listen to a group of young men from [[Philadelphia]] sing one of New Edition's songs for him outside the tour bus. Impressed, Mike gives them a business card and encourages the group that will become [[Boyz II Men]] to call him.

In 1989, a party to celebrate the success of the tour, revealing how the group split up again. Jheryl is leaving his job at MCA Records to take a major role at Motown and convinces Johnny to come with him and record his [[Johnny Gill (1990 album)|self-titled third album]] - the one Jheryl promised he would support if Johnny recorded Heart Break with New Edition - at Motown. Ralph's similarly promised solo album will be released by MCA but must be re-recorded because Ralph and the executives felt that it would sound too much like Bobby's Don't Be Cruel album. Ralph is annoyed, because his album was originally ready to be released before Heart Break. However, it was delayed in favor of the New Edition album. As for Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis suggest the trio start their own group, which would become [[Bell Biv DeVoe]], based on their last names. Finally, the arrogant and disrespectful Bobby, who made a scene by sticking his hands into both of the party's cakes, is angry despite his individual success and being surrounded by attractive women. He almost showed constant jealousy looking out at his former group members.

In March 1990, all six members of New Edition reunite by making an appearance for ''[[Video Soul]]'' with Sherry Carter. There is clearly awkwardness and tension during the interview, with barbed comments flying all around, particularly between Ralph and Mike (still not yet over inviting Johnny to the group without consulting Ralph), as well as Bobby and everyone else. The show also airs each of the separate acts' music videos: [[Bell Biv DeVoe|BBD]]'s "[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]", Ralph Tresvant's "[[Sensitivity (song)|Sensitivity]]", and Johnny Gill's "[[My, My, My]]."  When the host asked the most anticipated question, "Would the group ever reunite for a new album?," Ralph suggested there was a possibility to record a reunion album in the coming future.

&lt;u&gt;'''Are we "Home Again" or not? -''' '''''1996-1997'''''&lt;/u&gt;

The [[Home Again (New Edition album)|reunion album]] is made six years later, in 1996, after the various independent acts somewhat fizzled. This left several in debt, or at least precarious, financial position, especially Ricky ([[Elijah Kelley]]).  Several of the group members, now approaching their 30s, are also dealing with personal issues: Ralph is struggling with the passing of his mother, while Bobby is no longer the only member with drug and alcohol issues. Also, Ricky is secretly using cocaine, popping pills, and drinking heavily, hiding his problems from his wife as well as the rest of New Edition.

As the group prepares for a tour of Home Again, Brooke is amazed at their expenses - separate tour buses, large entourages, lots of luggage - despite their limited success as independent acts, as well as being less professional than when they were kids. While the group will perform New Edition songs, they will also perform the songs of their various respective acts. Unfortunately, this tour does not go well, with Bobby's penchant for missing various interviews and even performances annoying the rest of the group and interfering with scheduled performance times. At one stop, Bobby arrived after the rest of the group had finished performing but decided to close the show solo instead. Bobby claimed that he felt like singing, because the crowd was chanting for him.

The tour arrives in [[New Mexico]], where the miniseries began, though with some additional details on what would lead to the massive brawl.  Bobby - on time for a change - decided to sing an extra song, at least partially because Bell Biv DeVoe couldn't go on as Ronnie ([[Keith Powers]]) was late. Bobby assumes that he was the real star of the tour. Thus, when Ronnie charged onto the stage to cut off Bobby, Bobby was partially angry, claiming that he was covering for Ronnie by doing an extra song. Storming backstage angry, Bobby tries to blast Bell Biv DeVoe with water from a fire hose but can't get the emergency device to work. Instead, he and his bodyguard march onstage, which brings in the various entourages for a chaotic scene, finally culminating with a gun shot that scatters everyone.

In the chaos, Brooke stumbles away and has a heart attack before being found by one of the members of the Bell Biv DeVoe entourage. An [[ambulance]] arrives to take him to the [[hospital]], but won't allow Ronnie (who is Brooke's nephew) in with him. Instead, both Ricky and Mike try to keep Ronnie calm while waiting for a car. Ralph and Johnny get filled in, but Ronnie nearly loses it when Bobby appears to ask what's going on. He angrily blames Bobby for starting the fracas that led to his uncle having a heart attack. Bobby, on the hand, counter-argued that he would never hurt Brooke and that it was Ronnie who provoked the situation. Ronnie angrily storms off for good this time, saying he's done with the tour. Also, he's fed up with Ralph and Johnny always coddling Bobby. Bobby walks off, stating that he was doing everyone else a favor by agreeing to the reunion, but Johnny snaps at Bobby stating that he did nothing for him. Bobby angrily lashes out and Johnny, saying the group is deceased and finished. Ralph leaves after getting into it with Mike, and Johnny was fed up wasting his time with the hostility. A panicked Ricky asks Mike what they are going to do with so many shows left, and Mike essentially says the tour and the group are done.

'''&lt;u&gt;Souls falling apart / Finding myself - ''1998-2004&lt;/u&gt;'''

In the years after the tour, the New Edition members largely stay out of contact and have their lives go in different directions.

*Johnny is largely OK music wise, forming a new group called [[LSG (band)|LSG]] with [[Gerald Levert]] and [[Keith Sweat]] but not seeming interested in talking to a radio personality about New Edition and the destruction of the group during the Home Again album and tour during a radio interview.  
*Taking all the knowledge of the business side of the music industry that Jeff game, Mike becomes a full-time music executive himself. He starts his own label [[Biv 10 Records]]. Mike is now finding himself on the other side of the table when dealing with artists and often using the same words ("Did you even read your contract?") that people like Jheryl had said to Mike when New Edition was just starting.  
*Ralph's short marriage to his longtime girlfriend Xeina ends in a grimey divorce, with her taking the cars, house, sole custody of the kids and half of their shared assets. Being the mild mannered guy that he is, Ralph eventually deciding not to fight too much to contest. 
* With the Home Again tour falling apart and the group not on any speaking terms whatsoever, Ronnie decides to pursue a whole endeavor by enrolling in some real estate classes to become a real estate agent. However, he feels somewhat embarrassed when a fan recognizes him, feeling like he is at a rock bottom. 
*The New Edition member really at rock bottom is Ricky, whose drug and alcohol use gets worse when he faces bankruptcy, aggravated by lawsuits from the tour's abrupt end and lack of any job or trade skills other than music. Ricky's wife, Amy, suggests asking the members of New Edition for help but he refused. Instead, he asks her if she knows someone with a truck to help them move out of their foreclosed house. 
*Bobby's life at this time, including his relationship with his then wife at the time, [[Whitney Houston]], is not shown in the miniseries.

Ricky eventually has an [[overdose]], but his wife finds him in time for help to arrive and save him.  At rehab, Ricky admits that what he was chasing was the feeling of fame, fortune, and popularity that he had years prior, as well as trying to fight the fear that the feeling wouldn't come back.  
In 2004, Ronnie's wedding planning isn't going well, with his latest concern being wasting money for inedible flowers on the wedding cake. His fiancée, Shamari, gets him to admit that his real issue is not having reunited New Edition, either as a musical group or to be his groomsmen for his rapidly approaching wedding.  Concerned that their egos and behavior will both prevent any of them from showing up, Ronnie is convinced to at least invite the other five members to his wedding so that he won't have regrets.

'''&lt;u&gt;I am my Brother's Keeper / BET 25th Celebration - ''2005''&lt;/u&gt;'''

The day of the wedding, Ronnie is in his prep room, on his own, accepting that he's going to be at the altar without any groomsmen. He hears a knock on the door and "Police!", only for it to be Bobby in a dazzling all-white tuxedo. Although Bobby thanks Ronnie for the invitation to be a groomsman, he declines an offer for a drink, saying he has cooled on drugs and alcohol. The rest of New Edition arrives, including a sober Ricky, with Ralph and Mike at least able to be civil to each other. The final arrival is Brooke, back to normal, after his heart attack at the disastrous tour and ready to see his nephew Ronnie get married.

At the reception, Ralph and Mike have a longer conversation, with Mike apologizing for starting the group's break up by bringing in Johnny to replace Ralph. Ralph counters that the group faced bigger problems than that, citing that the problems, which the members were only ready to deal with now that they were older. Rather than just a temporary truce, Ralph and Mike seem to have rekindled their friendship, ready to move forward without dwelling on negative events from the past.

Brooke toasts Ronnie and his new wife and includes New Edition in his toast by reminiscing about raising Ronnie and the other members of the group, encouraging them to be thankful for their success as a musical group and as men.  New Edition reunites to serenade Ronnie's wife with their first hit song "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]." A [[BET]] producer approaches Brooke with the idea of having a New Edition reunion at the channel's 25th anniversary special. Brooke advises him to move quickly, as he does't know the next time the group will be together like this. The producer, however, does move quickly enough, as the group agrees to reunite for the BET special.

At the special, New Edition begins to perform a medley of hit singles: "[[If It Isn't Love]]," "[[Can You Stand the Rain]]," "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]," and "[[Cool It Now]]" before introducing Bobby Brown to perform "[[Mr. Telephone Man]]" with them. After Bobby gives a solo performance of his solo classic hit single "[[My Prerogative]]," Bobby then invites the group along to perform a medley with him, with highlights of the miniseries airing as the group sings. They all take a bow and give props and credit to BET for giving their long standing partnership as a final sendoff.

===Production===
In August 2015, it was announced that [[BET]] commissioned the television film that would air as a three night miniseries. Five of the group's members--[[Ricky Bell (singer)|Ricky Bell]], [[Michael Bivins]], [[Ronnie DeVoe]], [[Johnny Gill]] and [[Ralph Tresvant]], had signed on as co-producers, while [[Bobby Brown]] did not. In addition, the band's longtime manager Brooke Payne had also been tapped as a co-producer and the film was to be written by Abdul Williams who wrote the 2010 film ''[[Lottery Ticket (2010 film)|Lottery Ticket]]''.

===Critical===
''The New Edition Story'' has garnered positive reviews from critics. On [[Metacritic]], the series holds a score of 76 out of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Edition Story Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-new-edition-story|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently has a 100% rating, with an average score of 7.2/10 on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], along with the consensus being, "''The New Edition Story'' colorfully showcases its subjects with honesty and clarity while offering an entertainingly paced overview that leaves room for plenty of the group's greatest hits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_new_edition_story/s01/|title=The New Edition Story: Season 1 - Rotten Tomatoes|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received rave reviews for the child actors who portrayed younger versions of New Edition in the first part of the series. Sylvia Obell of [[Buzzfeed]] praised the casting as "absolute perfection" and rated it an A+. Obell compared the film to another iconic television miniseries -- "it is on its way to being the best black TV biopic since ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]''" which aired on ABC in 1992. The most talked about similarities is the uncanny "jawdropping" striking resemblance of the young [[Bobby Brown]], portrayed by Tyler Marcel Williams, who nailed the looks, demeanor and Bobby's most iconic "body roll". Also another uncanny resemblance were of the vocals of the young Ralph Tresvant, portrayed by Jahi Di'Allo Winston. For viewers, hearing his first lead solo appearance in the film singing "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]" gave chills for nailing every note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/sylviaobell/the-child-actors-from-new-edition-story-are-absolute-perfect|title=The Child Actors From "New Edition Story" Are Absolute Perfection|first=Sylvia |last=Obell|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|publisher=BuzzFeed Inc.|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trey Mangum of [[Blavity]] said that BET "outdid" themselves, saying "With the warm reception and open arms that the world received The New Edition Story with, it's clear that this story needed to be told, and this was the perfect time." Mangum complimented the "spot-on" casting of both the young and adult casts, as well as the fact both casts recorded their own vocals, a rarity for musical biopics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blavity.com/11-reasons-why-the-new-edition-story-was-super-lit|title=11 reasons why 'The New Edition Story' was absolutely epic |first=Trey |last=Mangum|work=[[Blavity]]|publisher=Blavity Inc.|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]] on the radio show, ''[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]'', co-host [[Angela Yee]] described the casting for the film as "fantastic." Michael Bivins praised Algee Smith's portrayal of Tresvant and said he was "real nice, sliding into the most difficult spot."  Smith did an outstanding job portraying Tresvant, especially for his first major role, and displayed amazing vocals somewhat similar to Tresvant's himself. Bivins' own mother pushed for Gray during the casting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject= New Edition |subject-link= New Edition |subject2= Bell Biv DeVoe |subject-link2= Bell Biv DeVoe |subject3= The New Edition Story |subject-link3= The New Edition Story |interviewer= [[DJ Envy]], [[Angela Yee]] and [[Charlamagne Tha God]]|title= Bell Biv DeVoe Discusses The New Edition Story &amp; More on The Breakfast Club |type= radio |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hegEmiQpWJI|work= [[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]] |publisher= [[Premiere Radio Networks]] |location= [[New York City]] |date= January 26, 2017 |access-date= January 28, 2017 |dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview, Ricky Bell along with Bivins praised Elijah Kelley for his portrayal of Ricky in the film. Bell further praised young actor [[Caleb McLaughlin]] for his portrayal as well. Bell was amazed by McLaughlin's attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CacOFhIb60I&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Red Room Company''' (also  Red Room Poetry) is a [[non-profit organisation]] based in [[Sydney, Australia]] whose vision is to make poetry a meaningful part of everyday life.&lt;ref name=red1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redroomcompany.org/about|title=About|accessdate=8 February 2018|publisher=The Red Room Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by [[Johanna Featherstone]] in 2002, emerging from The Red Room Radio Show, which broadcast on [[Eastside Radio|89.7FM Eastside Radio]] from 2001.&lt;ref name=red1 /&gt;

Red Room Poetry creates poetic projects and learning programs in collaboration with a spectrum of poets, schools, communities and partners for positive social impact. Their mission is to make poetry accessible to all, especially those who face the greatest barriers to creative opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Red Room Company Website|url=http://redroomcompany.org|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetic Learning==

Red Room Poetic Learning is The Red Room Company's poetry education program. It sends contemporary Australian poets into primary and secondary schools all across Australia. It was launched in 2007 with support from the Keir Foundation and the Ian Potter Foundation, initially piloting in four NSW high schools. In 2008 it expanded into Victoria and in 2009-2010 moved further interstate to Norfolk Island and Queensland schools. Red Room Poetic Learning is now a national program, servicing schools everywhere in Australia. Red Room Poetic Learning collaborates with students, teachers and communities to deepen their encounters with poetry. Our learning programs connect poets with students to unlock poetic ways of seeing, writing and responding. Red Room is committed to publishing these outcomes and providing a platform for young poets to share their work with wider audiences.

==Poetry Object==
[[File:The Poetry Object.jpeg|thumbnail|150px|A Croydon Public School student with her poetry object.]]
Red Room Poetry Object is a free poetry writing competition inviting young writers and their teachers to submit poems about special and curious objects. It is open to students in Years 3-10 and teachers from Australia and New Zealand. In 2017, Poetry Object published over 3400 student and teacher poems from over 190 school communities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry Object|url=http://redroomcompany.org/projects/poetry-object|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant and refugee students benefit from the opportunity to positively express their story through poetry. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/south-west/parkour-poet-tim-sinclair-and-red-room-company-inspire-students-at-canterbury-high-school/news-story/6dc04b3322a70ad3e097ac8d57ea1ce3 Retrieved 2017-09-04&lt;/ref&gt; 

As part of Red Room Poetry Object, each year six Australian poets have been commissioned to write new poems about their own talismanic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Poetry Object Site|url=http://redroomcompany.org/projects/poetry-object/|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unlocked==
[[File:Unlocked logo.jpeg|thumbnail|left|Unlocked logo]]
Unlocked is an educational arts program developed and run by The Red Room Company in collaboration with educational staff from NSW Correctional Centres, which 'unlocks' the potential of inmates through poetry. The initiative's goal is to encourage self-expression and reflection while improving inmates' literacy. Introduced in Sydney in 2010, the project has entered its third year.

At correctional centres across NSW, Australian poets run intensive writing workshops, collaborating with students on every stage of the writing process: from the initial exercises and experimentations, through the editing and rewriting process, to recording, performing and publishing their work in a professionally designed print anthology.

The project was developed in collaboration with Corrections NSW Audiovisual Unit and education staff, 2SER's Jailbreak radio show, Blood &amp; Thunder Publishing Concern and Boccalatte.&lt;ref name="Unlocked site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlocked site|url=http://redroomcompany.org/projects/unlocked/|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Unlocked at Balund-a.jpeg|thumbnail|right|A participant at an Unlocked workshop in Balund-a]]
* '''Current Unlocked Projects''' 
The most recent Unlocked project was held at the Balund-a Project, a residential diversionary programme for male and female offenders between 18 and 40. Indigenous poet [[Lionel Fogarty]] led the workshops, and the students responded with great enthusiasm to Lionel's work and stories. There was a particular interest in Lionel's use of language, his mixing of English and Bandjalang dialect.&lt;ref name="Unlocked site"/&gt;

In October 2012 Red Room Company poets Lionel Fogarty and Nick Bryant-Smith will travel to South Coast Correctional Centre to run an intensive, three-day workshop.

* '''Project Outcomes''' 
According to The Red Room Company, Unlocked offers a range of potential outcomes and benefits for the students involved. Through Unlocked, poets work with both with the vocational education providers working in NSW Correctional Centres, as well as education providers such as ACE Community Colleges, an  Adult Education provider and Registered Training Organisation which runs accredited courses in the Balund-a Project.

At the completion of each project, a limited-edition anthology of work created during the project is published. These publications are made available to inmates who participated in workshops, and is distributed among libraries in correctional centres around Australia.

Through Unlocked, students can return to their community with recognised qualifications, as a part of the study that they have completed inside. In this way the value of the project is not only supporting students to come to terms with emotions, past experiences or relationships, but to build practical literacy and communication skills, and the confidence to apply them.&lt;ref name="Unlocked site"/&gt;

==Public Projects==

The Red Room Company regularly runs major public creative projects whose goal is to commission new works by contemporary Australian poets, then publicise this new work as widely as possible. Past Projects include:

*Pigeon Poetry - eight poets from across the country were commissioned to each write a poem that would be raced by thoroughbred pigeons on 3 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pigeon Poetry Page|url=http://pigeonpoetry.com/|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early art in the Land of Israel was mainly [[decorative art]] of a religious nature (primarily [[Jewish]] or [[Christian]]), produced for religious [[pilgrims]], but also for export and local consumption. These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, rubber stamps, etc., most of which were decorated with [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] from [[graphic arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer, ''Art and Artisan in the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1979, Israel Museum) (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jewish settlements artists worked at [[gold smithing]], silver smithing, and embroidery, producing their works in small crafts workshops. A portion of these works were intended to be amulets. One of the best known of these artists, [[Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi]] of Jerusalem made Shiviti (or Shivisi, in the Ashkenazic pronunciation, meditative plaques used in some Jewish communities for contemplation over God's name) on glass and amulets on parchments, with motifs such as the Sacrifice of Isaac, the [[Book of Esther]], and views of the [[Temple Mount]] and the [[Western Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;Haviva Peled, "Seven Artists", in Fischer (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Objects of applied art were produced also at the "[[Torah ve-Melakhah]]" ("Torah and Work") school founded in 1882 by the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, "First Starts: Torah and Work", in [http://www.openu.ac.il/zmanim/zmanim103/download/zmanim103-ofrat.pdf ''Zmanim''], 103, Summer 2008 (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; This school opened departments for the production of art objects in [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] and [[Baroque]] styles, produced by combining manual labor with modern machines.

A large body of artistic work was produced by European artists, primarily Christian painters, who came to document the sites and landscapes of the "[[Holy Land]]". The motive behind these works was [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and religious and focused on documentation – first of the [[painting]] and later of the [[photography]] – of the holy sites and the way of life in the [[Orient]], and on the presentation of exotic people.&lt;ref&gt;Yehoshua Ben Arie, ''Artists and art of the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1992, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi)&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the Holy Land, which also served as the basis for paintings, focused on documenting structures and people in full daylight, due to the limitations of photography at that time.&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Parry, ''Jerusalem 1861: Impressions'' (1978, Ariel)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore an ethnographic approach is in evidence in the photographs, which present a static and stereotypical image of the figures they depict. In the photographs of the [[France|French]] photographer [[Felix Bonfils]] such as, for example in his prominent photographs of the Holy Land in the last decades of the 19th century, we even see an artificial desert background, in front of which his figures are posed At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, local photographers began to appear, the most important of whom is [[Khalil Raad]], who focused on an ethnographic description of the reality of the Holy Land, in large part colonialistic. In addition there were other photographers, many of them Armenian, who worked as commercial photographers in the Land of Israel and neighboring countries.

In the 1920s, many Jewish painters fleeing pogroms in Europe settled in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="forward.com"/&gt;

==Art of "The Land of Israel", 1906–1932==

===Bezalel===
[[File:Ehad haam school3.jpg|thumb|"Hebron", homemade glazed tiles made at the ceramics workshop at Bezalel.]]

Until the beginning of the 20th century no tradition of fine arts existed in the Land of Israel although European artists came as visitors and painted the "Holy Land". Artists and craftsmen of Judaica objects and other applied arts made up the majority of artists working in the Land of Israel. Although the “Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts,” known as "[[Bezalel]]", was not the first art school established in the Jewish settlement, its importance in setting the boundaries of the tradition of [[modern art]] in the Land of Israel was very great indeed, and it is customary to view its establishment as the beginning of Israeli art. The school was founded in 1906 by [[Boris Schatz]] with the support of heads of Jewish and [[Zionist]] institutions. At Bezalel emphasis was placed on objects of [[applied art]] with a metaphysical dimension.

At the art school the influence of European [[Art Nouveau]] was in evidence, in addition to other social movements such as the British "[[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]" movement. In the logo of the quarterly magazine "''Yalkut Bezalel''", designed by [[Ze'ev Raban]], we see within the ornate frame [[cherub]]s with a painter and a sculptor on each side and a lamp maker and a rug weaver next to them. Under the illustration is the caption "Work is the fruit; art is the bud; art without a soul is like prayer without conviction".&lt;ref&gt;Yael Granot, "Bezalel and the Ben Shemen Jewelers' Community" in Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Art and Artisans, Roots and Boundaries'' (2003, Tel Aviv Faculty of the Arts)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the art school, within its different tracks, studios opened for the production of [[jewelry]], tapestries, paintings and Jewish ceremonial objects that were sold in Jerusalem shops.  Schatz's vision included the idea of cross pollination between the various parts of the institution. "There is a practical side to the study of art", Schatz wrote, "The school always needs new drawings for the rugs and silver artifacts. Thus we need a series of artists who have absorbed the prevailing spirit of the school within their art, having studied with the expert teacher who embodies this spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Granot in Canaan-Kedar (2003), p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

In the art created in Bezalel during this period Jewish and religious motifs dominate, for example, descriptions of the holy places, scenes from the Diaspora, etc. The works are decorative and heavily engraved in the "Eastern" style. The descriptions sought a connection between the Biblical period, the Return to Zion [from the Babylonian exile] and the Hasmonean Kingdom of Israel [140-37 BC], and the Zionist aspirations for the development of a Jewish settlement, driven by ideological and Zionist sentiments. The artists did this by borrowing historical motifs they perceived as "Jewish" motifs and designs they perceived as "Eastern". Typography occupied a central place in their designs. Sometimes the text even became the main element in their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Chaya Benjamin, ''Bezalel of Jerusalem: From the Allen B. Slipka Collection of the Israel Museum'' (2008, Israel Museum, Jerusalem)&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Schatz himself consisted mostly of small-scale sculptures of Jewish subjects, as well as reliefs and memorial plaques in honor of various Zionist leaders. His most famous sculpture is Mattathias (1894), which was influenced by [[Renaissance]] sculpture and in particular by the sculpture of [[Donatello]]. A different spirit entirely brought [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1865–1908), to the institution to join the Bezalel teaching staff. Hirszenberg brought European academic painting to Bezalel, and painted Jewish subjects within this framework. The artist Ze'ev Raban created many graphic works in the spirit of Art Nouveau, also known as "[[Jugendstil]]" ["Youth Style" in [[German language|German]]]. The subjects of these works were "Orientalist" landscapes of the Holy Land and figures from the Bible drawn in the Neoclassical style. Among other well-known artists who taught at Bezalel were [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], [[Meir Gur-Arieh]], [[Arnold Lachovsky|Arnold (Aaron) Lachovsky]], [[Erich Goldberg|Erich (Arie) Goldberg]], [[Adolph (Avraham) Berman]], [[Shmuel Levi]] (Ophel), and others.

Due to financial difficulties and political infighting the school closed in 1929. The museum, which housed many works of art, remained in the Bezalel building. This collection eventually served as the basis for the Art Wing of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.

===Land of Israel modernism movement===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 224 Tel Hai Lion Sculpture פסל הארי השואג בתל חי.JPG|thumb|[[Avraham Melnikov]]&lt;br /&gt;The Roaring Lion, 1928–1934&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Hai]]]]

At the beginning of the 20th century some of the Bezalel students began to rebel against the rigid artistic tradition that was followed in the institution and turned to more "subjective" art. this Period often called The "[[Tower of David Period]]". One of the most prominent of these artists was the sculptor [[Avraham Melnikov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/of-stone-and-schizophrenia-1.360707 Of stone and schizophrenia], ''[[Haaretz]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Melnikov suggested a different formal approach, culled from within the art of the Ancient East. This approach was offered as a replacement for the European art forms that dominated Bezalel during the reign of Schatz and Lilien.

The monument "The Roaring Lion" which Melnikov erected at [[Tel Hai]], designed in the "Assyrian-Mesopotamian" style, reflected Melnikov's aesthetic ideal. "For many generations", Melnikov asserted, "the Jews were cut off from the figurative tradition in art; there are many ways to express artistic taste, but the taste that was in fashion was European art based on Greek and Roman culture, and as long as Athens was the inspiration for art in Europe, the Jew was instinctively excluded from it".&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 18 December 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Other young artists offered alternative artistic approaches, turning to modern art, of which Schatz and Melnikov strongly disapproved. This showed up also in the exhibitions they organized. In 1920, for example, the "Hebrew Artists Association" was formed; it organized the annual exhibition, and during the years 1923 to 1928 held an "Exhibition of Land of Israel Artists" in the [[Tower of David]] in Jerusalem's Old City, organized by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], [[Shmuel Levi|Shmuel (Ophel) Levy]], Melnikov, and others. In these exhibitions art in the "Bezalel Art" style were exhibited next to art influenced by the European Post-Impressionist and Expressionist styles. Other exhibitions of Modern Art were held in the hut attached to the [[Ohel theater]] in Tel Aviv between 1926 and 1929.

Another organization of Israel artists was called "Egged" (The Amalgamation) and included artists such as [[Arieh (Leo) Lubin]], [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]], [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], Yossef Zaritsky, [[Haim Gliksberg]], [[Reuven Rubin]], [[Arieh Allweil]], and [[Nachum Gutman]]. Some of its members, like Orloff and Tagger, displayed influences from French [[Cubism]] in their works. The group held an exhibition in 1929 in an apartment on [[Allenby Street]] in Tel Aviv, opposite the [[Mograbi Theater]]. Another exhibition of modern art was held in 1930 in the Tel Aviv Museum and was called "The Beginnings of Modernism in Israeli Painting, 1920-1930".

To a significant extent the modern painters began to create a "Hebrew" version of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painting using a palette of light colors, an attraction to expressive brushstrokes, and a tendency toward naïve, flat painting. In addition to traditional subjects such as portraits, many artists depicted the Land of Israel in landscapes that added a romantic perspective to their subjects. This style of these works is sometimes called the "Land of Israel School".

Among the artists identified with this style, the artist Nachum Gutman stands out. Gutman painted many depictions of the city of Tel Aviv, but also of the Land of Israel's Arab citizens, many of whom he met with in Jaffa. His famous painting "Resting at Noon" (1926) depicts Fellahin (Arab farmers) resting in the field from their day's labor. An examination of Gutman's style in these years shows a tendency toward the simplification of forms, in the tradition of expressive painting, and toward the use of strong colors. Some critics feel that this naïve style of painting reveals Gutman's romantic approach towards the landscapes of the Land of Israel and its Arab inhabitants.

This approach is also typical of other artists of this period. Sionah Tagger, for example, created a description of the "Railway Crossing at Herzl Street" (1920) in an expressive style that emphasized the modernity of the new Hebrew city. [[Israel Paldi]] (Feldman) depicted scenes of the half-empty country in a palette of bright shades and colors. Another artist, [[Abel Pann]], expressed this romantic approach by focusing on subjects from the Bible depicted in illustrations that were fantastic in style.

Reuven Rubin also frequently depicted the Jewish existence in the Land of Israel. For example in "Sophie, Bukharin Jewess" (1924) and "Dancers from Miron" (1926) his tendency towards flatness and a decorative style stand out, showing the influence of modern art and even of [[Art Nouveau]]. In "First Fruits" (1923) Rubin presents figures typical of the 1920s, interwoven with a powerful and fantastic element. As in other works of his from this period, in "First Fruits" he shows a worldview that combines Zionism and Orientalism in one basket; thus, he depicts Jews and Arabs, pioneer couples and immigrants from Yemen and Bedouin shepherds in their native dress holding round fruit: a pomegranate, oranges, a watermelon, and bunch of bananas. And next to them local animals: goats and a camel.

In spite of his distance from the center of artistic activity in the Land of Israel, the works of [[Hermann Struck]], who immigrated to Israel in 1922, when he was already a mature artist with a worldwide reputation, also display some of the iconographic characteristics of visual art in the young Land of Israel. Palm trees and empty landscapes are central themes of his work. Along with paintings of the city of Jerusalem and its residents the special Land of Israel light, which so preoccupied its young artists, is translated in his prints into a sharp contrast which emphasizes the dark images on the light background.

===Armenian ceramic art===
[[File:Rockefeller Museum fountain2.jpg|thumb|[[Rockefeller Museum]]]]

In 1919 the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government extended an invitation to a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] artists, survivors of the Armenian genocide, to renovate the tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. This experiment reflected the British interest in traditional art in the spirit of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] Movement. Armenian [[ceramic art]] began in the 15th century in the Turkish cities of [[Iznik]] and [[Kutahya]], but the encounter with ancient Land of Israel art and with Christian motifs gave rise to a unique artistic synthesis.

The central artist during these first years was [[David Ohannessian]] (1884–1953), who specialized in decorative ceramics for structures and monuments, many of them at the invitation of the British government. Among the principal works Ohannessian created in Jerusalem were: tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain base for [[St. John's Ophthalmic Hospital]], the domed entry of the [[Rockefeller Museum]], etc. Among the motifs appearing in his decorations are cypress trees, tulips, and grapevines, all of which are typical of traditional [[Ottoman art]].&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Armenian Ceramics in Jerusalem'' (Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 2002), pp.29-52&lt;/ref&gt; As he transplanted his art to Jerusalem and continued to develop it, he added images inspired by the local traditions and Armenian illuminated manuscripts—frequently using the Bird Mosaic in objects and tile panels.

The artists [[Megherdich Karakashian]] and [[Neshan Balian]], who in 1922 left Ohannessian's studio and founded a joint workshop, developed an independent style in which figurative images foreign to traditional Turkish art appeared. For example the two of them used imagery from ancient mosaics found in the Land of Israel, such as the Bird Mosaic from a 6th-century Armenian chapel or the mosaic from [[Khirbat al Mafjar]]. Often these images were imbued with a Christian theological interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Kenaan-Kedar (2002), pp.53–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Their joint workshop remained active until 1964, when [[Stepan Karakashian]] and [[Marie Balian]], the heirs of the founding artists, set up two independent workshops that both used designs that had been developed in the past and created some new ones of their own.

The return of Jewish artists from Europe in the 1930s to Mandatory Palestine gave rise to a variety of influences from modern art on art in the Land of Israel. At the same time it should be noted that these influences did not motivate the artists toward [[Avant garde]] and abstract art in their painting and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;For a distinction between avant garde in an artistic and in a political sense, see Peter Berger, '''Theory of the Avant Garde''' (Rasling, Tel Aviv).&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the strongest influences were French art and German art. Gideon Efrat claimed that these influences created two different trends in the plastic arts. While the "Parisian" influence was expressed in a "dynamic softness that melts heavy structures", German art and the "[[New Objectivity]]" (Neue Sachlichkeit) which brought with it a static and sculptured monumentality.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Efrat, "Anorexia Artistica" in ''Washington Crosses the Jordan'' (Sifria Zionit, Jerusalem, 2008), p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most typical influence of the European avant garde is evident in international architectural styles in the Land of Israel, brought by architects who were graduates of the "[[Bauhaus]]". The considerable influence of [[French realism]] can also be found in the works of a group of artists who were influenced by the trend towards realism of French sculptors of the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], and others. This symbolic message in content and form appears also in the works of artists of the Land of Israel group, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Rafael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied at some point in France.

One sculptor who was influenced by Cubism was [[Zeev Ben Zvi]] who, in 1928, after completing his studies at Bezalel, went to study in France. Upon his return he served for a short period as a teacher of sculptor at Bezalel, and at the "New Bezalel". In 1932 Ben Zvi had his first exhibit at the national antiquities museum, "Bezalel", and a year later he had an exhibit at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Haim Gimzu, ''Ben-Zvi the Sculptor'' (Hazvi, Tel Aviv, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of making use of [[Cubism]] as a means of subverting the artistic object, Ben Zvi's sculptures use Cubism as a means of intensifying the feeling of monumentality of the image. In the work of artists such as [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Shalom Sebba]] as well, the Cubist language in which they shaped their works did not lead them to abandon the realism and the boundaries of traditional representation. In his well-known work, "The Fleece" (1947), for example, Sebba used the Cubist language to intensify the monumentality of his images, while using angles of observation inspired by photography.

Even more striking avant garde trends began to appear in the work of the Jewish photographers, most of whom were influenced by the German avant garde and the expressionists of the 1920s and 1930s. Photography in the land of Israel developed under the encouragement and guidance of the Zionist establishment, under the auspices of groups such as the Jewish National Fund, which commissioned photographs that would spread the Zionist message. Artists such as {{ill|Zoltan Kluger|he|זולטן קלוגר}}, [[Yaakov Rosner|Yaakov (Jack) Rosner]], and others, documented the Zionist enterprise and the Jewish settlement, sometimes using photographic angles, compositions, and views which took their inspiration from Soviet Communism in Russia. Other photographers sought to use these techniques for artistic or commercial photography.

[[Helmar Lerski]] created photographic portraits in typical expressionist style, expressed in his use of light and in the angle of the photograph. In 1936 Larski created 175 photographs of man, which attempted to encompass his personality in its entirety, using a technique called "metamorphosis by means of light"; this technique made use of mirrors, and he even taught it in workshops on the roof of his home in Tel Aviv.
Another artist, [[Alfons Himmelreich]], created advertising photographs which emphasized industrial commercialism by using a distortion of the usual standards, close ups, and light for emphasis, as a designer of commercialism. Among the photographers who worked in a more artistic tradition were Richard Levy (Ereel), who created photomontages of semi-abstract figures; [[Tim (Nahum) Gidal]], and the sisters [[Charlotte Meyer|Charlotte]] and [[Gerda Meyer]], who specialized in architectural photography.&lt;ref&gt;Rona Sela (editor), ''Photography in the Land of Israel in the 1930s and 1940s'' (Kibbutz Hameuchad, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute influenced the works of Arab photographers with a developed political consciousness, such as [[Ali Zaarur]], [[Chalil Rissas]], and others. They acted on their own or as agents of various information agencies, and created photographs in journalistic style. Only from the 1990s did researchers begin to investigate these works as part of historiography, and as the visual representation of the past, with political, ideological, and nationalistic goals in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Sela (2000), pp. 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canaanite movement===
{{Main|Canaanism}}
[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|[[Itzhak Danziger]]&lt;br /&gt;Nimrod, 1939&lt;br /&gt;The [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem Collection]]
[[File:Amos kenan.JPG||thumb|[[Amos kenan]]&lt;br /&gt;Messiah, 1966&lt;br /&gt;Tefen Open Museum]]

In 1943 the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] (1908–1981) published "Epistle to Hebrew Youth", the proclamation, the manifesto, the first written communication of "[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]", a literary and artistic movement that had been active for some time. In this essay Ratosh called on [[Hebrew]] speaking youth to become a buffer against [[Judaism]]. He declared that between the youth that had settled in the Land of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora there was no true connection. This became the characteristic cry of the Caananites, whose members proposed a return to the mythological past, in order to create a Hebrew–speaking nation with an independent identity.

The visual expression of this aspiration was the use of archaic forms and styles, under the influence of Fertile Crescent art. This tendency reflected, to a significant degree, the interest in primitive art and sculpture that was prevalent in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Often this pro-Archaic style was an expression of symbolism.

One of the most significant artists of the "Canaanite" movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]]. He returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and demonstrated a new national outlook in his work which, in contrast to what was acceptable in Europe, was full of sensuality and Eastern exoticism. This art fit the feelings and sense of identity of much of the population of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. The dream of Danziger's contemporaries, writes [[Amos Keinan]] after Danziger's death, was "to unite with the land of Israel and the earth of which it is composed, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and to embed in history the mark of that something special that is us".&lt;ref&gt;Amos Kenan, "Greater Israel", ''Yedioth Aharonot'', 19 August 1977 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to nationalism, his sculptures demonstrated an expressionist-symbolist style similar in spirit to British sculpture of the same period.

Danziger opened a sculpture studio in the yard of his father's hospital in Tel Aviv, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yechiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishing, 1980), p. 134 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his students, his studio became a popular meeting place for artists from other fields as well. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works, the sculptures "[[Nimrod]]" (1939) and "[[Shabazia]]" (1939). When "Nimrod" was unveiled it became the focus of an important dispute in Land of Israel cultural circles; the sculpture depicts the figure of Nimrod, the Biblical hunter according to Jewish religious literature, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, a sword clutched in his hand and a falcon on his shoulder. The sculpture harked back to the earlier cultures of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks, while at the same time it showed similarities to the European sculpture of the time. The sculpture expressed a combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idolatry. This combination was at the center of criticism in religious circles in the Jewish settlement. The criticism against "Nimrod" and the Canaanites was heard not only in religious circles, which objected to the pagan and idolatrous aspects of the work, but also in secular circles among those who objected to the rejection of "Jewishness". To a significant extent "Nimrod" intensified a dispute that had existed prior to its appearance. At the same time other voices called it the new model for the "New Jewish Man".  The newspaper Boker [Morning] wrote in 1942 that "Nimrod is not just a sculpture. It is flesh of our flesh, spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and it is a monument. It is the apotheosis of the vision and daring and youthful rebellion that distinguishes an entire generation…Nimrod will be young forever".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Agrippas vs. Nimrod", Kav, 9, 1999 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the fact that Danziger later had his reservations about "Nimrod" as a model for Israeli culture, many artists adopted the "Canaanite" style and point of view in their sculpture. Figures resembling idols and images in "primitive" style appeared in Israeli art until the 1970s. Furthermore the influence of the Canaanite movement was evident in the art of the "New Horizons" group.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, "The Secret Caananite Character of 'New Horizons'", Art Visits (2005) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avant Garde: the 1950s and 1960s==
In the 1950s and 1960s Israeli artists began exploring the idiom of the Avant-garde current in Europe and the United States. Immigrant artists brought trends to Israel, and influential Israeli artists spent stints in Europe, especially in France. Some of these artists sought a universal style, while others sought to develop a uniquely Israeli avant-garde, in the spirit of nationalistic socialism and Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Horizons===

The germination of the "New Horizons" ("Ofakim Hadashim") movement can be found in a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name "the Group of Eight", But the group crystallized into the dominant artistic movement only after the founding of the state in 1948. Members of the school included [[Arie Aroch]], [[Zvi Meirowitch]], [[Avraham Naton]] (Natanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]]. The work of sculptor [[Dov Feigin]] also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined [[Joseph Zaritsky]] for an exhibit called "The Group of Seven" at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'' (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the group stated that "The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Davar Ha-Shavua'', 12 February 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

For these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the "New Horizons". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Yohanan Simon]], [[Avshalom Okashi]] and [[Moshe Castel]], as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin.

The group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group – Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called "lyrical abstract", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the "Land of Israel" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time.

For example, in his series "Yehiam" (1949–1952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zvi Mairovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment.

Others in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement.

In the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. [[Yechiel Shemi]], Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, [[Itzhak Danziger]], introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism.

Indeed, during the 1950s, the "New Horizons" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, [[Alexander Bogen]], Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'', pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism and Social art===
While the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as "regionalism".&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. [[Mordechai Ardon]], head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, "Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Simon Zabar]], [[Moshe Gat]], and [[Ruth Schloss]] created works that reflected national social tensions, a clearly socialist political slant, and glorification of the worker. Others, like Naftali Bezem and Miron Sima, [[Moshe Bromberg]] (Bar-Am) depicted the dramatic events of the period – World War II and the Holocaust. Their works were explicitly Jewish, while adopting the styles of the European avant-garde of the early 20th century.

The quest for a connection between the artist and society is reflected also in the monumental works on the walls of public buildings that were commissioned beginning in the 1950s. Examples include the mosaics of Mordechai Gumpel on the walls of public buildings in Petach Tikva, Holon and elsewhere, that depict Jewish settlers building the nation, in a style drawing much on the Canaanists; or Yohanan Simon's mural of kibbutz youth at Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], showing youth living the socialist dream.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), pp. 22-23 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

New Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim – his series "Yehiam", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950–1952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Mairovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focousing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced "Wheat Sheaves" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted "Soldiers", "Air raid Alarms" and "Maabarot" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the "Center for Advanced Culture" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement "[[Hashomer Hatzair]]".&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village [[Ein Hod]] by a group of artists headed by Marcel Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia.

Mordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. For example, his painting "Gate of Light" (1953), shows the tree of life, a symbol of great Biblical and Kabbalistic meaning, within a surrealistic landscape reminiscent of the work of Paul Klee and others.

Ever since, surrealism has played a significant role in Israeli art, and some of its most gifted and influential proponents include artists like [[Zeev Kun]], [[Samuel Bak]], [[Baruch Elron]], Joel Tal-Mor, as well as [[Yosl Bergner]].

===Abstract art after New Horizons===
During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the work of the [[New Horizons group]] influenced new artistic trends in Israel. Some artists, like [[Yechiel Shemi]] and [[Aviva Uri]], continued the work of the group after it dissolved, mostly working in a non-objective abstract mode.

New Horizons' last exhibit was in 1963. A number of young artists joined the exhibit, including [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Moshe Kupferman]] and [[Igael Tumarkin]]. In 1964, a new group of about 30 artists formed, called "Tazpit" ("Outlook"), This group carried the torch of abstract art into the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zvi Mairovich Panda 1971.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich Panda, oil pastel/paper 39 x 39&amp;nbsp;cm 1971]]
One of the artists on the fringe of the "New Horizons" group who developed a new style was [[Arie Aroch]]. In contrast to the ideal of the rest of the group, Aroch's works showed, in addition to lyric abstraction, a tendency toward substantive content. For example, "Red House (How Are Things at Home?)" (1960),&lt;ref&gt;For an iconographic analysis of this painting, see: Gideon Efrat, "The Aftermath of Arie Aroch's 'Red House'", Studio: Journal of Art, 62, May 1995, p. 35 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; "Sarajevo Manuscript" (1966), and others hinted at content of Jewish historical significance along with the influence of the [[Pop Art]] of the time. In his works "The High Commissioner" (1966) and "Agripas Street" (1964), for instance, the many interpretations these works received included widespread perception of them as historical paintings in which Judaism and Jewish tradition are given a place of prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Cf, Sarit Shapiro, Paths of Wandering: Migrations, Journeys, and Transitions in Contemporary Israeli Art (The Israel Museum, 1991), p. 62; David Gintan, "The High Commissioner", Ha-Midrashah, 3, 2000, pp. 200-249 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings in particular, and Aroch's work in general, are generally viewed as the antithesis of the "Caananite" approach seen, for example, in Itzhak Danziger's early works.&lt;ref&gt;See: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Agrippas vs. Nimrod", Kav, 9, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aviva Uri]] created expressive abstract drawings with motifs and images that called to mind birds, circus images, and landscapes. Another artist, Lea Nikel, painted highly colored abstracts in the style of French art of that period. [[Avigdor Arikha]] also painted in Israel during those years according to the principles outlined by the "New Horizons" group. Arikha painted large works in dark colors until he emigrated to Europe, where he began to produce small figurative paintings.
Abstract art merged with conceptual art in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s.

[[Moshe Kupferman]], who had studied painting with [[Chaim Atar]] (Aptaker), Zaritsky,  [[Alexander Bogen]] and others developed an identifiable style characterized by reduced use of color, and by a process of erasing and wiping the drawing over and over until it formed an expressive grid. For many years Kupferman refused to identify his works with any external themes, in spite of critics' attempts to label his paintings a reaction to the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions to this are the works "With beers, beers, and more beers" (1982), influenced by the Sabra and Shatilla Massacre, drawings in memory of Emil Greenzweig (1983), and the group of late works "Fraction and Time", exhibited at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, his works have been described as a phenomenological process: as layers constructed in a dialectical process which accrues "life experience as the layers accumulate".&lt;ref&gt;See: Sara Breitling-Semel, "Painting in a Time of Bankruptcy" (1983), In: Yona Fischer, ''Moshe Kupferman: Paintings, Works on Paper, 1963–1984'' (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1984), p.11 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local Art Between Wars, 1967–1982==
[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|[[Yigal Tumarkin]]&lt;br /&gt;''He Walked through the Fields'', 1967]]

Until the 1970s, mainstream Israeii art dealt with a broad artistic and personal spectrum but, for the most part, ignored political issues. Even artists who portrayed cultural or Jewish content in their works were considered anachronistic by the artistic establishment of the time.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 76 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s American artistic influences began to reach Israel, especially abstract expressionism, pop art, and later, even the art pauvre of conceptual art. In addition to bringing new artistic forms, these influences also introduced a direct engagement with political and social issues. Events of [[The Six-Day War]] and [[The Yom Kippur War]] intensified these influences and led to a variety of politically charged artistic expressions which became the trademark of an entire generation of younger artists. Under the influence of American conceptual art, there even developed among Israeli artists a tendency to emphasize the dimension of artistic creativity, that is, the "ars poetica" discourse, and how it is perceived by the viewer of art within society. In this spirit, artistic activity in Israel was often seen to be part of the country's social-political reality.

===Art of Protest===
Among the first artists who began to express these artistic influences in their works was the sculptor and painter [[Igael Tumarkin]], whose art expressed engagement with burning political issues. At the encouragement of [[Yona Fischer]] and [[Sam Dubiner]], Tumarkin returned to Israel in 1961 from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of [[Berthold Brecht]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf, Yigal Tumarkin, "Danziger in the Eyes of Yigal Tumarkin", in Studio, 76, October–November 1996, pp. 21-23 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; His early works, such as "Panic Over Trousers" (1961) were created as expressive assemblages. His sculpture "Take Me Under Your Wings"(1964–65) (the first line in the well-known poem by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The sculpture's mixture of nationalism, lyricism, and even eroticism became Tumarkin's hallmark in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See Ellen Ginton, "The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique can be seen also in his famous sculpture "He Walked in the Fields" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the "mythological Sabra"; Tumarkin strips off his "skin" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by "[[Earth Art]]", such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.

After the Six-Day War Israeli art started to gravitate away from describing war and its symbolic content.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 78 (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Tumarkin's sculpture still dealt with it, but began to express it in a variety of more abstract ways.

==="Want of Matter"===
[[File:Raffi Lavie~B83 0006.jpg|thumb|[[Raffi Lavie]]&lt;br /&gt;Untitled, 1969&lt;br /&gt;[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]
[[File:Michal Na'aman, Anal, Banal, Canal, (etc.), 1976, photographs and Letraset on plywood, 52.5X40.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Michal Na'aman]]&lt;br /&gt;Anal, Banal, Canal, 1978&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]

In the mid-1960s a group called "[[10+]]" appeared on the scene. This group, led by the artist [[Raffi Lavie]], sought an alternative to the "lyric abstraction" of the New Horizons group. The most important innovations of this school were importing [[pop art]] and avant garde art into Israel, developing an unpolished style, and combining photography, Readymade, and collage. Among the many artists in the group were [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Ziona Shimshi]], [[Pinchas Eshet]], [[Tuvia Beeri]], [[Uri Lifschit]]z, and others. Since it ostensibly lacked a clear ideology, the group focused on organizing a series of exhibits in galleries that tried to emphasize the idea of the blurring of distinctions between different kinds of media in contemporary art. In addition, the group was a pioneering force in the introduction of [[video art]] into Israel. Although "10+" officially disbanded in 1970, the members of the group carried on its spirit and its style, taking their final form from a group that revolved around the art school "The College" (ha-Midrashah). The esthetic principle of this group came to be called "The Want of Matter".

The theoretical underpinning of this group was established by the curator [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], in the exhibit "The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art", which took place in March 1986 in the Tel Aviv Museum. The roots of this style could be found, according to her, in the wide acceptance of European and American art in Israel, especially Pop Art, Art pauvre, and Conceptual Art. These influences were expressed by the use of industrial materials, such as plywood, industrial paint, collages and assemblages, etc. Another element, which in Breitberg-Semel's opinion was no less central, was the "non-aesthetic" approach, the roots of which could allegedly be found in the Jewish tradition of talmudic studies, which places text, and not form, at the center of culture.

According to Breitberg-Semel, "The Want of Matter" began with the painting of the "[[New Horizons]]" group. The members of this group developed a style that came to be called the "lyrical abstract", within the framework of which the painters created an abstracted form of reality with expressionistic overtones. The works of their followers, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used a national aesthetic model called "The Want of Matter", utilizing materials in their art that were compatible with their ascetic outlook and combining abstraction with an implied iconography.

Visually, "[[Want of Matter]]" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.

In an article accompanying "The Want of Matter" exhibition, Breitberg-Semel focuses on Raffi Lavie as a typical representative of this style. Lavie's work "typifies the Tel Aviv spirit", which is European-Zionist modernism mixed with neglect and abandonment. Over the years the image of Raffi Lavie himself, dressed in sloppy short pants and rubber flip-flops, intentionally "native" and "Sabra" in his appearance, was displayed as the expression of this problematic aesthetic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Michal Heiman's photographs documented Lavie in his wanderings around town and presented him in typical situations. The artist Doron Rabina described the national image of the artist: "The end of a summer day. Rafi goes into the cafeteria, sweat is trickling down his temples, and his shirt is so wet it's stuck to his body. I couldn't help thinking, 'There goes a master'"; See: Doron Rabina, "The Drawing Itself". Ha-Midrasha, 1, 1999, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie's paintings, which include "childish" scribble, collages of magazine pictures, posters advertising Tel Aviv cultural events, stickers with the words "head" or "geranium" printed on them, and most recognizably, sawed-off sheets of plywood painted chalky white,&lt;ref&gt;This format became fixed predominantly from the end of the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; came to epitomize "The Want of Matter" style.

In addition to crystallizing a clear visual language, Lavie was careful to keep the discussion of his work on a formalist level. In interviews he consistently avoided all interpretation of his work outside the sphere of its "artistic language" in modernist form. In spite of clear iconographic imagery in his work, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical importance. Furthermore, according to Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, the use of collages and other materials that lacked the "halo" of artistic approval, were meant to undercut and undermine the significance of the visual images.&lt;ref&gt;See: Sarit Shapiro, This Isn't a Cactus, It's a Geranium (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2003), pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie's students continued the formalist approach in their art, consistently relating to the modernist tradition, but in their works visual images began to appear which made it difficult to maintain Lavie's didactic separation of form and "content".&lt;ref&gt;Michal Neeman, "Kindly Don't Read What's Written Here", 2, 1999, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yair Garbuz]]'s connection with Lavie dates from the time he was a very young man. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz's private teacher. [44] Later Garbuz went from being a pupil to being a senior teacher in "The College". Garbuz's work from these years combines characteristics of the Zionist ethos, as reflected in popular culture, with political and social criticism. His two-dimensional works from the 1970s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as "The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly" (1979) and "The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society. In his installation " If not a Giant Then at Least in His Garden" (1981), Garbuz created an environment saturated with photographic images, some of which are enlarged and turned into sculptures in space. Between the images are photographs of new immigrant transit camps and development towns, of a father reading the newspaper Davar to his daughter, etc. In the background a recording of a toy whistle can be heard creating the noise of a "toy forest".&lt;ref&gt;See: Yair Garbuz, In All Probability, the Train Will Pass Through Here Soon (Am Oved Publishing, Tel Aviv, 2000), p. 275. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michal Na'aman]]'s works of the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Na'aman created images which emphasized the inadequacy of descriptive language and vision, and in this way, showed the possibility for different and imaginative interpretations of visual representations. The practical implications of a debate or of an axiomatic phrase demonstrated for her the failure of descriptive language.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Breitling-Semel, "Michal Neeman: What Did She Do Here?", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 48. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Against the background of the visual dimension of "The Want of Matter" Style, texts written in commercial style&lt;ref&gt;Kits of stick-on letters for various graphic uses.&lt;/ref&gt; or in handwriting appeared, reflecting the semiotic collapse of image presentation. Examples of this approach can be found in "The Loyal Fish and the Bird" (1977) or "The Message According to the Bird" (1977), in which Na'aman merges fish and bird images into hybrid monsters. In other works, such as her series "The Blue Retouching" (1975) we see a protest against society's accepted moral and esthetic principles.

In spite of clear feminist connections, in [[Yehudit Levin]]'s works, we see a more personal and less intellectual approach than in the works of other students of Raffi Lavie. Many of Levin's works are made of plywood and were constructed at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. In these works Levin created compositions of sawed and painted plywood, often accompanied by photographs leaning up against the wall. The names of these works, such as "Bicycle" (1977) or "The Princess in the Palace" (1978), suggest a domestic connection. Even though these works are three-dimensional, their main interest lies in the complex connection between the drawing and the visible area of the work. The work "bursts out " of its frame and spreads out into space.

===Post-conceptual art in the 1970s===
[[File:Tel aviv campos 012.JPG|thumb|[[Benni Efrat]]&lt;br /&gt;''Energy'', 1969&lt;br /&gt;[[Tel Aviv University]], Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]

Conceptual Post-Minimalist Installation artists [[Avital Geva]], [[Joshua Neustein]], [[Micha Ullman]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Benni Efrat]], [[Zvi Goldstein]], [[Yochevet Weinfeld]], [[Adina Baron]], [[Nahum Tevet]], [[Or Ner]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Pinhas Cohen Gan]] discarded the conventions of taste, the heroics of authenticity, and provincial narrative. By sheer force and power of evading ‘taste’ while yet remaining in the context of art, art could be redefined, its field expanded and the artist liberated to achieve unique existence and value. (see Clement Greenberg)

The axioms of that 1970s group were indifference to Zionist aesthetics; a general distaste for regionalism, national myths, and individual heroics. Avital Geva’s Exchange of Cultures brought Arab Villagers and Kibbutzniks to exchange books with one another. To define a purpose for art, he moved his activity into the Greenhouse to grow vegetables and fish ponds with resistant students, to make art an educational tool.

Ullman’s Berlin Library created a standard for memorial sculpture. His negative space sculptures were often made by digging under ground. Buky Schwartz made perspective correction and earliest video art in the country. Neustein (in collaboration with Marx and Batlle) made the first environmental work. The Jerusalem River Project 1971 was a sound river at the edge of the Judean desert. Boots at Bet Omanim Jerusalem was an agglomeration –five truck loads- of army boots left by various armies in the region, piled into random heaps.

[[File:NeusteinAshCityBneBrak.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, ''Ash City Bne Brak'', Herzeliyah Museum, 2000]]
Joshua Neustein's five Ash Cities were geographic ambivalences realized in five museums in the USA, Germany, Poland and Israel. The Ash cities were on-the-floor relief maps made with tons of ashes and a chandelier.

Efrat's ''Ararat Express'' 1986 is a procession of horses passed through the streets. Each horse carried a television set on its saddle. A documentary film projected on the television screens showed throngs of people displaced by disaster, famine or war, wandering.

Efrat, Neustein and Gitlin also produced methodical, basic, severe graphics that re-defined the materials, tools and viewer's roles. Efrat's double silks and shadow pieces dealt with the concrete aspect of pictorial surfaces. Neustein's torn paper works, Erased Drawings, Magnetic Fields, Steel Wool, Carbon Copy Drawings adhered to unity and even uniformity of making objects or images. He transformed drawing into a three-dimensional practice Yigal Zalmona, Josef Maschek, Robert Pincus Witten and other international critics called that type of art "epistemic abstraction". Gitlin hacked plywood boards with the strategy devised by Neustein of removal and replacement. Gitlin's sculptures, however, were more architecturally oriented. Nahum Tevet's work summarized by James Trainor: The basic building blocks that comprise Tevet's formal vocabulary of sculptural units, for both his small wall works and the large, sprawling, encyclopedically heroic sculptural installations, are simple, verging on the Platonically archetypal—the table, the chair, the box, the boat hull, the rectilinear plane, the book-like block, the framework armature, etc. As Sarit Shapira wrote: In any possible context, they identify as mutants of a territory, or as agents of de-territorialization. The quasi-modeled arrangement of these works presents what is not a model of a given production mechanism of objects, or what will always distinguish itself from such a model; at most, this is a model-proposal for a mechanism of objects that does not yet exist. For this purpose, Tevet replicates his items in limited series (the number of items replicated in each work is also limited, as is the number of times that Tevet replicates entire works or major parts of them), thus distancing them from any automatic and motoric—that is, obedient and “blind”—reproductive mechanism.

These dozen artists were not an organized movement, there was no manifesto but rather there were strong opinions and an ideology, a timely kinship that found a common desire for a collective agenda. Sometimes they were referred to as Post Minimal, or Conceptual, to elaborate Israeli visual culture and escape hegemony by a single group. Their hallmark public exposures were in five shows: Concept + Information 1971 (Musag + Informazia), Beyond Drawing 1974, The Kibbutz Ashdod exhibition Mikum Kivun 1978, the 1970s Tel Aviv Museum 2008 "Art and Language", 2006 Tel Aviv Museum "Eyes of the Nation" by Ellen Ginton 2008.

[[File:Levitation.JPG|thumb|[[Buky Schwartz]]&lt;br /&gt;Levitation, 1976]]
The perception of "The Want of Matter" as the "center" of Israeli art that grew up in the wake of Breitberg-Semel's influence, pushed many artists to the side of that center. [[Gideon Ofrat]], who in those years was not only an art critic and independent curator, but also a partner in various artistic initiatives, set up in opposition to the "Tel Aviv School", "The New Jerusalem School", a term whose origin lay in a Christian metaphysical interpretation of the city of Jerusalem. The central difference between the definition of this group and the "Tel Aviv School", according to [[Ariella Azoulay]]'s interpretation, lay in the difference in the way they defined the status of art in relation to public space. While the Tel Aviv School tended to create its art within traditional definitions, the "Jerusalem" artists sought to establish an eruv (a ritual enclosure) between art and life.&lt;ref&gt;Ariela Azoulay, Training for Art: A Criticism of Museum Economics (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1999), pp. 163-164. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; A different interpretation, formulated by [[Itamar Levy]], saw in these two approaches two dialectical concepts which opposed "conceptuality" to "picturesqueness", universal abstraction to specific locality.&lt;ref&gt;See: Itamar Levy, "Memories of the Seventies", Studio, 40, January 1993, pp. 12-15. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trait of this artistic school is the influence of conceptual art and innovative media such as the installation and the performance or display. It is worth noting that at this time the boundaries between all these types of media were blurred, and the use of terms like "activity" and "concept", instead of terms like "installation" and "display", which were coined only in 1976, referred more to the intentions of the artist than to the final artistic result. Photography as well, which from the 1970s also began to be a means of expression for artists, was seen as a tool for combining images in conceptual art, and as a means for documenting installations and displays.&lt;ref&gt;See: Rona, Sela (Curator), 90 70 90 (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1994). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, and in distinction from American art of the time, only a small amount of the art created in Israel represented conceptual art that was entirely minimilistic or "concrete, " that is, art the entire reason for being of which was to negate the definition of art as representation or imitation.&lt;ref&gt;See Adi Engelman (Curator), The Michael Adler Collection and Israeli Post-Minimalism in the 1970s and in Contemporary Art (Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, Herzliya, 2008). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artists whose work in part did represent this approach were [[Benni Efrat]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], and others.

Ellen Ginton, in her article "The Eyes of the Nation: Visual Art in a Country Without Boundaries " (1998) presented the art of the 1970s as a response to the political and social problems of Israel during that period. Artistic formalism is perceived not only as a framework for social and political content, but in addition, according to Itamar Levy's formulation, every element in an artistic work is perceived both as a design activity and an ideological concept.&lt;ref&gt;See: Itamar Levy, "Memories of the Seventies", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 13. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Ginton claimed that these political expressions, which increased in intensity after the political and social crisis that followed the Young Kippur War, continued until the 1980s, at which time most artists abandoned these subversive artistic practices and returned to more traditional artistic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Ginton, "The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first projects carried out in Israel under the banner of [[Conceptual Art]] was implemented by the sculptor [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970, Neustein was collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerard Marx]] to create "The Jerusalem River Project". In this installation, in East Jerusalem in the dry wadi in the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood between the St. Clair Monastery and Nachal Kidron (the Kidron Brook), taped water sounds were projected out of speakers. The imaginary river not only created an artistic environment outside the boundaries of the museum, but also hinted ironically at the concept of messianic redemption that appeared after the Six-Day War in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter 14).&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), 26–32. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

This work also can be viewed as an indication of the growing number of artists who could be found out in the middle of the Israeli landscape, under the influence of the American trend toward "[[Land Art]]". Many of these works expressed a dialectical and ambiguous relationship with the Iandscapes of the "Land of Israel" and the "Orient", which in turn expressed increasing political criticism. In many works that included metaphysical and ritual aspects, the development and influence of Caananite sculpture and the abstraction of the "New Horizons" school can be clearly seen.

In the art of [[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose work had been dealing with local landscapes for years, the conceptual aspect of the Israeli variation of "Land Art" was expressed. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. The "repair" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project "The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry", on the northern slopes of the Carmel Mountains. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher, which attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. "Nature should not be returned to its natural state", Danziger contended. "A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept".&lt;ref&gt;In: The Rehabilitation of Nesher Quarry (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1972). (In Hebrew). Yona Fischer, In: Yitzhak Danziger, ''Place'' (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1982). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.

Another example of this kind of experiment was created in 1977 at a ceremony in which 350 [[oak]] saplings were planted in the [[Golan Heights]] to create a space immortalizing the fallen soldiers of the [[Egoz Combat Unit]]. Danziger suggested that the emphasis of this monument be placed on the view itself and on the creation of a site that differed from the functional quality of a memorial. This concept was implemented by using the ideas behind Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites throughout the Land of Israel, sites in which trees are used alongside the graves of revered leaders as a ritual focus and, in Danziger's words, "bright swatches of cloth in blue and green are hung from the branches […] Driven by a spiritual need, people come to hang these pieces of fabric on the branches and to make a wish"&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Barzel, "Landscape As a Work of Art" (an interview with Yitzhak Danziger), ''Haaretz'', 22, 7, 1977. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 a  group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as "Metzer-Messer" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 88–89. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Igael Tumarkin who, at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, "Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks", in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using "impoverished" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as "Earth Crucifixion" (1981) and "Bedouin Crucifixion" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created "crucifixion pillars"&lt;ref&gt;See: Yigal Tsalmona, ''Onward: The East in Israeli Art'' (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1998), p. 82–83. For documentation on the varied sculptural activities of Tumarkin, see: Yigal Tumarkin, ''Wood, Stone, and Cloth in the Wind'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1981). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; for these lands.

Another group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the "Leviathians", presided over by [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Michail Grobman]], and [[Shmuel Ackerman]]. The group combined conceptual art and "land art" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work "Letters of Light" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words "America", "Africa", and "Green card" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See: Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 238–240. Also: Gideon Efrat, ''Beit Avraham Ofek'' (Museum of Art, Ein Harod, 1986), p. 35. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity and the Body===
[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]&lt;br /&gt;Exposure (Installation view), 1975]]

The landscape as a space for [[performance]] and expressions of [[gender]], which occupied center stage in American art of this period, never caught on in Israel as it did in the [[United States]]. [[Ilana Tannenbaum]] claimed that, in contrast to artists worldwide, the works of Israeli artists were restrained in their artistic language and tended to be reductionist with regard to forms.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image – The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006) (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of many Israeli artists, such as [[Moshe Gershuni]], [[Tamar Getter]], and others, the relationship to the body was assimilated into sociopolitical significance. In her work "Letter to Beuys" (1974), for example, Getter wrote a fictitious letter to the artist Joseph Beuys. The letter included three different biographies and asked Beuys to make her a coat and shoes.

In his work "Via Dolorosa" (1973), [[Motti Mizrachi]], who walked on crutches, created a series of photographs documenting his walking along the route of the [[Via Dolorosa]] on crutches while carrying a large portrait of himself on his back. The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, ''"The Heart of Things", Gideon Gechtman, Works, 1971–1986'' (Stavit Publishing House, 1986, unnumbered pages. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; In the exhibition "Exposure" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as "Brushes" (1974–1975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.

===Political art===
After the Yom Kippur War there was a palpable intensifying of protest in Israeli art against everything that was perceived as Israeli militarism or its relationship with the Palestinians, the dominant medium for which was the performance.

One of the leading artists in this protest movement was [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], who created a number of works of a political nature during these years. In his work "Touching the Border" (7 January 1974), four iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In "Performance in a Political Camp in Jericho", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of [[Jericho]] near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time Cohen Gan set up a conversation about "Israel 25 Years Hence", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, "A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland".&lt;ref&gt;See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 141-152. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] ("Gabi and Sharon") gave a number of performances of a political nature and based on current events in public places in Jerusalem. On April 24, 1973 the two of them drew airplanes, tanks, and soldiers on the streets of Jerusalem, accompanied by the caption, "Who needs a parade?" On the same day the two of them showed up at the Medal of Courage and Medal of Valor ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater swathed in bandages and decked out in military medals.

[[Efrat Natan]] created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six-Day War. Among her important works was "Head Sculpture", in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter "T", bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision".&lt;ref&gt;See: Ilana Tannenbaum, "The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image – The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

A blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work "A Gentle Hand" (1975–1978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: "All Her Heart She Gave Him" and the first words of which are "A gentle hand", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904–1914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In another work, "Who Is a Zionist and Who Is Not?" (1979) Gershuni wrote these words on the walls of a gallery with pinkish-red pastels. In these works the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;Irit Segoli, "My Red is Your Precious Blood", Studio, 76, October–November 1996, pp. 38-39. (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1980s in Israeli Art===
[[File:Nahum Tevet, Jemmáin, 1986, Coll. Kunsthalle, Manheim.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Tevet]]&lt;br /&gt;Jemmáin, 1986&lt;br /&gt;Kunsthalle, Manheim]]

Most of the artists who worked in the 1970s as conceptualist artists in a variety of media changed their style in the 1980s and returned for the most part to the medium of painting. This, under the influence of European and American art, was characterized during those years by a mixture of styles all grouped under the accepted esthetic of minimalism, including the American "[[Neo-Geo]]" style, the "Pop Art" style of artists such as [[Jeff Koons]], and the fashionable expressive style, also known as "[[Bad Painting]]", of artists such as [[George Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]], which defined the post modernist spirit in art around the world.

These international trends filtered into Israeli art, which reflected the attempt to undercut the values of contemporary Israeli society. In the art of this decade, especially toward its end, a discourse of identities developed, a discourse that was incompatible with the institutional hegemony; narrative painting returned and regained its status among local artists, intentionally combining the post modernist use of "the high" and "the low" in all aspects of the implementation and themes of works of art.&lt;ref&gt;See Ilana Tannenbaurm, Check-post: The 1980s in Israeli Art (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2008). (In Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

The expressive style in painting was adopted in Israel by a great many artists. [[Michal Na'aman]], who created collages and other conceptual art in the 1970s, moved to large scale paintings with psychological and psychoanalytic overtones. [[Moshe Gershuni]] moved from conceptual and minimalistic sculpture to painting full of [[Impasto]] (thickly laid on paint) in which he combined [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] symbolism with images of soldiers with Jewish associations, such as verses from the Bible and from other Judeo-Christian sources. Another prominent aspect of art in those years was the use of references to the [[Holocaust]] and to Jewish culture in Europe. Gershuni's painting techniques included applying paint with his hands, without using a brush, transforming the act of painting into a sort of solo performance.

In parallel to the expressionist approach, other artists worked in a more formalist approach. The painter [[Diti Almog]] exhibited large paintings with textile motifs, such as buttons, shirt fabrics, etc. The works are abstract and decorative in style. The gap between the calculated, formalist (formal) approach and the use of everyday themes was a result of the feminist approach that derived from it. In the works of painters such as [[Isaac Golombek]] and [[Nahum Tevet]] this preoccupation with deconstructing the personal narrative by dealing in a formalistic way with the relationship between form and content, is also very much in evidence.

If in the 1970s Israeli art is full of social and political messages, art in the 1980s is more concerned with "protest". This attribute is especially evident in the second half of the 1980s, under the influence of events such as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the outbreak of [[First Intifada]]. The painter [[David Reeb]], for example, painted works of a clear political nature, such as "Green Line With Green Eyes" (1987), which showed the borders of Israel without the land that was conquered in the [[Six-Day War]], beyond the green line, combined with portraits of Arabs with their face covered and the coastline of the [[Tel Aviv]] beach. Another painter, [[Tsibi Geva]], created oriental figures, drawn in an expressive-naïve style, combined with captions like "Here is Arara" or "Umm Al-Fahm".

[[Larry Abramson]] presented a critical view of Israeli [[Zionism]] in his series of abstract paintings entitled "Tsoba". from which fragments of the Arab village that sat on the site of Kibbutz Tzuba until the War of Independence peek through. This series was created as a counterpoint to the abstract paintings of the same name by [[Jossef Zaritsky]], in which he "erased", as it were, all remnants of the Arab village.

Artistic photography gained status during this period, emerging from the place it had occupied for many years as a negligible area of art. A large number of artists returned from studying photography in the United States, among them [[Avi Ganor]], [[Oded Yedaya]], [[Yigal Shem Tov]], [[Simcha Shirman]], [[Deganit Berest]], etc. At the Museum of Art [[Ein Harod]] in the mid-1980s, a Biennale of Israeli Photography was held, presenting Israeli photography for the first time in a museum setting on a large scale.

In the press as well photography sometimes acquired a new aspect, as staged photography, in the works of photographers such as [[Micha Kirshner]]. In his portraits, Kirshner used artistic devices such as makeup, lighting, and composition in an attempt to create the desired effect on the way his subjects would be socially perceived. In his portrait of the model Tami Ben-Ami (1982), Kirshner emphasized the artificiality of the public image of the model, and on the gap between this image and the private person.

[[Performance art]] also began to develop. The most important group functioning in this area was named "Shelter 209", after the number of the Tel Aviv bomb shelter in which they performed. Members of this group were Danny Zackheim, Tamar Raban, and Anat Shen. Another group, the "[[Zik Group]]", created images of large-scale cockroaches, which burned up in complex ceremonies that included ritual elements.

===The 1990s and After===
[[File:Adi Ness, Last Supper.jpg|thumb|[[Adi Ness]]&lt;br /&gt;Untitled (The Last Supper), 1999&lt;br /&gt;[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]
[[File:Sigalit Landau the country 5.jpg|thumb|[[Sigalit Landau]]&lt;br /&gt;The Recorder of Days and Fruit, 2002&lt;br /&gt;(from "The Country")]]

The 1990s brought an openness to contemporary trends in international art. Among the elements responsible for this were the monthly journal 'Studio', edited by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which exposed the Israeli public to contemporary international art; the opening of new galleries that displayed Israeli art of the times; the increase in exhibitions featuring collaboration between Israeli artists and foreign artists; and the strengthening of peripheral museums (such as the [[Herzliya Museum]], which changed its policies during these years). This trend was echoed in the official art establishment with the founding of the "[[Art Focus]]" project (1994), which aspired to be a biennale of international art, and in other projects during the 2000s (decade).

As part of the international influence, there was a significant growth in the artistic and commercial importance of various types of media, such as photography, installations, and video performance art. New technologies like online video editing and image file processing in graphic programs, made the use of these media easier for Israeli artists. Another trend of the 1990s was a return to realistic figurative painting, that is, painting created by looking at the object being painted. The painter [[Israel Hershberg]] was the leader of this trend and even opened a painting school in order to train young artists in this kind of painting.

In the works of local sculptors of the 1990s can be seen a tendency towards large and detailed installations. Often they demonstrated a kind of protest against social values by using artistic symbols. Michal Rovner used the medium of video art to create rich and complex textures which were composed of images of people and which produced a primitive-primeval effect. [[Guy Ben-Ner]] created videos whose narratives dismantle the institution of family by using comic, ars poetica effects.

In works such as "Temple Mount" (1995) or "Country" (2002), [[Sigalit Landau]] created environments rich in objects with an expressive appearance that reflected her interest in transitional situations and in social-political criticism. Social criticism can be seen also in the works of [[Ohad Meromi]], who exhibited works that combined "primitive" images with modernist values. In his work "The Clinic" (1999), Meromi presented traditional local architectures and confronted them with primitive or foreign images. In his work "The Boy From South Tel Aviv" (2001), for example, Meromi created a huge statue of a black figure standing in front of what looks like a road block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.htmlOhad|title=Meromi in the online exhibition "Real Time"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the older generation of sculptors turned to historical narrative of a more personal nature and to reflection on the nature of art. [[Philip Rantzer]], for example, created sculptures and installations that recreated his childhood experience of being a new immigrant and a stranger in Israel. [[Penny Yassour]] created works that invoked the memory of the Holocaust, along with other personal experiences. Nahum Tevet created sculptural constructions that strove to reflect viewer perceptions, memory, the object, and the work of art. [[Gideon Gechtman]] emphasized this connection through a variety of means. In his exhibition "Yotam" (1999), Gechtman displayed a series of works connected to the death of his son, within a framework of works relating to post modernist means of replication and reproduction.

In the field of painting as well we see an attempt to criticize society using the language of art. [[Nurit David]] and [[Meira Shemesh]], for example, created figurative paintings reflecting the failed attempt at family perfection and artistic perfection. The artist [[Tal Matzliach]] created decorative paintings the significance of which was to show the lack of sexual adequacy. [[Tsibi Geva]] continued his work from the 1980s with imagery such as "Keffiyah" and "Biladi", which juxtapose American abstract art with local images.

The tendency toward the preoccupation with central symbols can be seen primarily among the artists who thought of themselves as representatives of a minority group within Israeli society. The artist Assam Abu Shakra, for example, made use of the symbol the "Sabra" which Israelis thought of as a Zionist symbol, as part of a process for establishing an Israeli Arab identity. Another artist, Sharif Waked, created in his series "Jericho First" (2002) a metamorphosis of the image of the hunter in the floor mosaic in Khirbat al Mafjar, north of Jericho, as a means of political criticism.

The photographer [[Adi Nes]] used photographs of Israeli soldiers, posed in various existential situations, combining them with images of homoerotic significance and of death. In the untitled photograph (1999) that has come to be known as "The Last Supper", soldiers sit around a table in a tableau reminiscent of "The Last Supper" of Leonardo da Vinci.

In traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]], {{nihongo||[[wikt:侘|侘]][[wikt:寂|寂]]|'''wabi-sabi'''}} is a [[world view]] centered on the acceptance of [[wikt:transience|transience]] and imperfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm|title=What Is Wabi-Sabi?|website=nobleharbor.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete".&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; It is a concept derived from the [[Buddhist]] teaching of the {{nihongo|[[three marks of existence]]|三法印|sanbōin}}, specifically {{nihongo|[[impermanence]]|無常|mujō}}, {{nihongo|[[dukkha|suffering]]|苦|ku}} and {{nihongo|[[śūnyatā|emptiness or absence of self-nature]]|空|kū}}.

Characteristics of the ''wabi-sabi'' aesthetic include [[asymmetry]], roughness, [[simplicity]], economy, austerity, modesty, [[intimacy]], and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.

==Description==
According to [[Leonard Koren]], ''wabi-sabi'' can be defined as "the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of traditional Japanese beauty and it occupies roughly the same position in the Japanese [[wiktionary:pantheon|pantheon]] of aesthetic values as do the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideals of [[beauty]] and perfection in the far West."&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; Whereas  Andrew Juniper notes that "If an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be wabi-sabi."&lt;ref name=Juniper&gt;{{cite book |last=Juniper |first=Andrew |title=Wabi Sabi: The Japanese Art of Impermanence | publisher=Tuttle Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-8048-3482-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Richard Powell, "Wabi-sabi nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect."&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book | author=Powell, Richard R. | title=Wabi Sabi Simple | publisher=Adams Media | year=2004 | isbn=1-59337-178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' do not translate easily. ''Wabi'' originally referred to the loneliness of living in nature, remote from society; ''sabi'' meant "chill", "lean" or "withered". Around the 14th century these meanings began to change, taking on more positive connotations.&lt;ref name=Koren&gt;{{cite book |last=Koren |first=Leonard |title=Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1994 |isbn=1-880656-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wabi'' now connotes rustic simplicity, freshness or quietness, and can be applied to both natural and human-made objects, or understated elegance. It can also refer to quirks and anomalies arising from the process of construction, which add uniqueness and elegance to the object. ''Sabi'' is beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its impermanence are evidenced in its [[patina]] and wear, or in any visible repairs.

After centuries of incorporating artistic and Buddhist influences from China, wabi-sabi eventually evolved into a distinctly Japanese ideal. Over time, the meanings of ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' shifted to become more lighthearted and hopeful. Around 700 years ago, particularly among the Japanese nobility, understanding emptiness and imperfection was honored as tantamount to the first step to [[satori]], or enlightenment. In today's Japan, the meaning of wabi-sabi is often condensed to "wisdom in natural simplicity". In art books, it is typically defined as "flawed beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro. (2004) [[Taro Gold]]'s ''Living Wabi Sabi'' (Kansas City: [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-7407-3960-3}}), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

From an engineering or design point of view, ''wabi'' may be interpreted as the imperfect quality of any object, due to inevitable limitations in design and construction/manufacture especially with respect to unpredictable or changing usage conditions; then ''sabi'' could be interpreted as the aspect of imperfect reliability, or limited mortality of any object, hence the phonological and etymological connection with the Japanese word sabi, {{nihongo|to rust|錆||also pronounced ''sabi''}}. Although the [[kanji]] characters for "rust" is not the same {{nihongo||寂|sabi}} in ''wabi-sabi'', the original spoken word (pre-kanji, ''[[yamato-kotoba]]'') is believed to be one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;錆びをめぐる話題, 井上勝也, 裳華房, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.memenet.or.jp/kinugawa/sabi/00121.htm さびの文字] on the Kinugawa Chain Mfg. Co. Ltd website&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain styles of Japanese pottery. In the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], the pottery items used are often rustic and simple-looking, e.g. [[Hagi ware]], with shapes that are not quite symmetrical, and colors or textures that appear to emphasize an unrefined or simple style. In fact, it is up to the knowledge and observational ability of the participant to notice and discern the hidden signs of a truly excellent design or [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] (akin to the appearance of a diamond in the rough). This may be interpreted as a kind of wabi-sabi aesthetic, further confirmed by the way the colour of glazed items is known to change over time as hot water is repeatedly poured into them (''sabi'') and the fact that tea bowls are often deliberately chipped or nicked at the bottom (''wabi''), which serves as a kind of signature of the ''Hagi-yaki'' style.

''Wabi'' and ''sabi'' both suggest sentiments of desolation and solitude. In the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] view of the universe, these may be viewed as positive characteristics, representing liberation from a material world and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] to a simpler life. Mahayana philosophy itself, however, warns that genuine understanding cannot be achieved through words or language, so accepting wabi-sabi on nonverbal terms may be the most appropriate approach. Simon Brown&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | author=Brown, Simon | title=Practical Wabi Sabi | publisher=Carroll &amp; Brown |year=2007 | isbn=1-904760-55-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that wabi-sabi describes a means whereby students can learn to live life through the senses and better engage in life as it happens, rather than be caught up in unnecessary thoughts. In this sense wabi-sabi is the material representation of Zen Buddhism. The idea is that being surrounded by natural, changing, unique objects helps us connect to our real world and escape potentially stressful distractions.

In one sense wabi-sabi is a training whereby the student of wabi-sabi learns to find the most basic, natural objects interesting, fascinating and beautiful. Fading autumn leaves would be an example. Wabi-sabi can change our perception of the world to the extent that a chip or crack in a vase makes it more interesting and gives the object greater meditative value. Similarly materials that age such as bare wood, paper and fabric become more interesting as they exhibit changes that can be observed over time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The ''wabi'' and ''sabi'' concepts are religious in origin, but actual usage of the words in Japanese is often quite casual because of the [[syncretic]] nature of Japanese belief.

==In Japanese arts==
Many [[Japanese art]]s over the past thousand years have been influenced by [[Zen]] and [[Mahayana]] philosophy, particularly acceptance and contemplation of the imperfection, constant [[flux]] and [[impermanence]] of all things. Such arts can exemplify a wabi-sabi aesthetic. Examples include:
* [[Honkyoku]] (traditional [[shakuhachi]] music of wandering Zen monks)
* [[Ikebana]] (flower arrangement)
* [[Bonsai]] design features such as snags, deadwood and hollow trunks highlight passage of time and natural cycles. Bonsai are often displayed in fall color or after they have shed leaves seasonally, to admire their bare branches.
* [[Japanese garden]]s, [[Zen garden]]s  (tray gardens)
* [[Japanese poetry]]
* [[Japanese pottery]], [[Hagi ware]], [[Raku ware]]
* [[Japanese tea ceremony]]

A contemporary Japanese appraisal of this concept is found in the influential essay ''[[In Praise of Shadows]]'' by [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]].

==Western use==
Designer [[Leonard Koren]] (born 1948) in 1994 published ''Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets &amp; Philosophers''&lt;ref name=Koren/&gt; as an examination of wabi-sabi, contrasting it with Western ideals of beauty. According to Penelope Green, Koren's book subsequently "became a talking point for a wasteful culture intent on penitence and a touchstone for designers of all stripes."&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Penelope|title=An Idiosyncratic Designer, a Serene New Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/garden/23leonard.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) was deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics  and techniques and founded an influential European aesthetic movement which also included Dame [[Lucy Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]].

Some [[haiku in English]] adapt the wabi-sabi aesthetic, with spare, minimalist poems that evoke loneliness and transience,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} such as [[Nick Virgilio]]'s "autumn twilight:/ the wreath on the door/ lifts in the wind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cor van den Heuvel]], editor. ''The Haiku Anthology''. Fireside, 1986. {{ISBN|0671628372}} p285&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of American artist [[John Connell]] (born 1940) is  centered on the idea of wabi.&lt;ref&gt;Hess Art Collection, Hatje Cantz, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Stuckist]] artist and [[remodernist film]]maker [[Jesse Richards]] (born 1975) employs it in nearly all of his work, along with [[mono no aware]].

During the 1990s the concept was borrowed by computer software developers and employed in [[Agile programming]] and [[Wiki]] to describe acceptance of the state of ongoing imperfection that is the product of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 16 March 2009, [[Marcel Theroux]] presented "In Search of Wabi Sabi" on [[BBC Four]] as part of the channel's ''Hidden Japan'' season of programming. Theroux traveled throughout Japan trying to understand the aesthetic tastes of its people, beginning by comically enacting a challenge from the book ''Living Wabi Sabi'' by [[Taro Gold]] to "ask people on a Tokyo street to describe Wabi Sabi." Theroux showed that, just as Gold predicted, "they will likely give you a polite shrug and explain that Wabi Sabi is simply unexplainable." &lt;ref&gt;Gold, Taro.
