'''Fashion in the period 1600–1650''' in [[Western Europe]]an [[clothing]] is characterized by the disappearance of the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] in favour of broad [[lace]] or [[linen]] [[collar (clothing)|collars]]. Waistlines rose through the period for both men and women. Other notable fashions included full, slashed [[sleeve]]s and tall or broad [[hat]]s with brims. For men, [[hose (clothing)|hose]] disappeared in favour of [[breeches]].

[[File:Rubens isabella brant c1610.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The artist [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] with his first wife c. 1610. Her long, rounded stomacher and jacket-like bodice are characteristic [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fashions]]
The silhouette, which was essentially close to the body with tight [[sleeve]]s and a low, pointed waist to around 1615, gradually softened and broadened. Sleeves became very full, and in the 1620s and 1630s were often paned or slashed to show the voluminous sleeves of the [[shirt]] or [[chemise]] beneath.

[[Spain|Spanish]] fashions remained very conservative. The ruff lingered longest in Spain and the [[Netherlands]], but disappeared first for men and later for women in [[France]] and [[England]].

The social tensions leading to the [[English Civil War]] were reflected in English fashion, with the elaborate French styles popular at the courts of [[James I of England|James I]] and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] contrasting with the sober styles in [[sadd colors|sadd colours]] favoured by [[Puritan]]s and exported to the early settlements of [[New England]] ([[#Puritan dress|see below]]).

In the early decades of the century, a trend among poets and artists to adopt a fashionable pose of [[melancholia]] is reflected in fashion, where the characteristic touches are dark colours, open collars, unbuttoned robes or doublets, and a generally disheveled appearance, accompanied in portraits by world-weary poses and sad expressions.

==Fashions influenced by royal courts==

===Fabric and patterns===
[[File:Larkin cary detail.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Scrolling floral embroidery decorates this Englishwoman's dress, petticoat, and linen jacket, accented with blue-tinted reticella collar, cuffs, and headdress, c. 1614–18.]]
Figured silks with elaborate [[pomegranate]] or [[artichoke]] patterns are still seen in this period, especially in Spain, but a lighter style of scrolling floral motifs, woven or [[embroidery|embroidered]], was popular, especially in England.

The great flowering of [[needlelace]] occurred in this period. Geometric [[reticella]] deriving from cutwork was elaborated into true needlelace or ''punto in aria'' (called in England "point lace"), which also reflected the popular scrolling floral designs.{{sfn|Berry|2004}}&lt;ref&gt;
Kliot, Jules and Kaethe: ''The Needle-Made Lace of Reticella''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montupet, Janine, and Ghislaine Schoeller: ''Lace: The Elegant Web''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], embroidered linen silk jackets fastened with ribbon ties were fashionable for both men and women from c. 1600–1620, as was reticella tinted with yellow starch. Overgowns with split sleeves (often trimmed with horizontal rows of braid) were worn by both men and women.

From the 1620s, surface ornament fell out of fashion in favour of solid-colour [[satin]]s, and functional [[ribbon]] bows or points became elaborate masses of rosettes and looped [[trim (sewing)|trim]].

===Portraiture and fantasy===

In England from the 1630s, under the influence of literature and especially court [[masque]]s, [[Anthony van Dyck]] and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or [[pastoral]] dress, or in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to evoke a classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|later 17th century]] for having one's portrait painted in ''undress'', and do not necessarily reflect clothing as it was actually worn.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Gordenker|2001|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}} and {{harvnb|Winkel|2007|pp=70, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's fashions==

[[File:Attributed to Jan Boeckhorst - Portrait of Helena Fourment - WGA20384.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Helena Fourment]] in the hairstyle and neckline of c. 1630]]

===Gowns, bodices, and petticoats===
In the early years of the new century, fashionable [[bodice]]s had high necklines or extremely low, rounded necklines, and short wings at the shoulders. Separate closed cartwheel ruffs were sometimes worn, with the standing collar, supported by a small wire frame or ''[[supportasse]]'' used for more casual wear and becoming more common later. Long sleeves were worn with deep cuffs to match the ruff. The cartwheel ruff disappeared in fashionable England by 1613.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.bergercollection.org/artwork_detail.php?i=35 Costume notes to portrait of Mary Radclyffe, Denver Museum of Art] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211194649/http://www.bergercollection.org/artwork_detail.php?i=35 |date=2006-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were discarded in favor of wired collars which were called ''rebatos'' in continental Europe and, later, wide, flat collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by [[kerchief]]s similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.

Bodices were long-waisted at the beginning of the century, but waistlines rose steadily to the mid-1630s before beginning to drop again. In the second decade of the 17th century, short tabs developed attached to the bottom of the bodice covering the ''bum-roll'' which supported the skirts. These tabs grew longer during the 1620s and were worn with a [[stomacher]] which filled the gap between the two front edges of the bodice. By 1640, the long tabs had almost disappeared and a longer, smoother figure became fashionable: The waist returned to normal height at the back and sides with a low point at the front.

The long, tight sleeves of the early 17th century grew shorter, fuller, and looser. A common style of the 1620s and 1630s was the [[virago sleeve]], a full, slashed sleeve gathered into two puffs by a ribbon or other trim above the elbow.

In France and England, lightweight bright or pastel-coloured satins replaced dark, heavy fabrics. As in other periods, painters tended to avoid the difficulty of painting striped fabrics; it is clear from inventories that these were common.&lt;ref&gt;Marieke de Winkel in:Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p.73, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Short strings of pearls were fashionable.

Unfitted [[gown]]s (called ''nightgowns'' in England) with long hanging sleeves, short open sleeves, or no sleeves at all were worn over the bodice and skirt and tied with a ribbon sash at the waist. In England of the 1610s and 1620s, a loose nightgown was often worn over an embroidered jacket called a ''waistcoat'' and a contrasting embroidered [[petticoat]], without a [[farthingale]].&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;See Aileen Ribeiro, ''Fashion and Fiction: Dress in Art and Literature in Stuart England''&lt;/ref&gt; Black gowns were worn for the most formal occasions; they fell out of fashion in England in the 1630s in favour of gowns to match the bodice and petticoat, but remained an important item of clothing on the Continent.

At least in the [[Netherlands]] the open-fronted overgown or ''vlieger'' was strictly reserved for married women. Before marriage the ''bouwen'', "a dress with a fitted bodice and a skirt that was closed all round" was worn instead; it was known in England as a "Dutch" or "round gown".&lt;ref&gt;Marieke de Winkel in:Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p.67, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skirt]]s might be open in front to reveal an underskirt or petticoat until about 1630, or closed all around; closed skirts were sometimes carried or worn looped up to reveal a petticoat.

[[Corset]]s were shorter to suit the new bodices, and might have a very stiff ''busk'' in the center front extending to the depth of the [[stomacher]]. Skirts were held in the proper shape by a padded roll or ''French farthingale'' holding the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. The drum or wheel farthingale was worn at the English court until the death of [[Anne of Denmark]] in 1619.

===Hairstyles and headdresses===

To about 1613, [[hair]] was worn feathered high over the forehead. Married women wore their hair in a linen [[coif]] or cap, often with lace trim. Tall hats like those worn by men were adopted for outdoor wear.

In a characteristic style of 1625–1650, hair was worn in loose waves to the shoulders on the sides, with the rest of the hair gathered or braided into a high [[Bun (hairstyle)|bun]] at the back of the head. A short [[Bangs (hair)|fringe or bangs]] might be worn with this style. Very fashionable married women abandoned the linen cap and wore their hair uncovered or with a hat.

==Men's fashions==

[[File:GeorgeVilliers.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|The Duke of Buckingham]] wears a wired collar with lace trim and a slashed doublet and sleeves. His hair falls in loose curls to his collar. C. 1625]]

[[Linen]] [[shirt]]s had deep [[cuff]]s. Shirt sleeves became fuller throughout the period. To the 1620s, a collar wired to stick out horizontally, called a ''whisk'', was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular ''falling band'' lying on the shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter [[Anthony van Dyck]], were fashionable, and men often grew a large, wide moustache, as well.
[[doublet (clothing)|Doublets]] were pointed and fitted close to the body, with tight sleeves, to about 1615. Gradually waistlines rose and sleeves became fuller, and both body and upper sleeves might be slashed to show the shirt beneath. By 1640, doublets were full and unfitted, and might be open at the front below the high waist to show the shirt.

Sleeveless leather [[jerkin (garment)|jerkins]] were worn by soldiers and are seen in portraits, but otherwise the jerkin rapidly fell out of fashion for indoor wear.

===Hose and breeches===
G
''Paned'' or ''pansied'' ''trunk hose'' or ''round hose'', padded hose with strips of fabric (''panes'') over a full inner layer or [[lining (sewing)|lining]], were worn early in the period, over ''cannions'', fitted hose that
ended above the knee. Trunk hose were longer than in the [[1550–1600 in fashion|previous period]], and were pear-shaped, with less fullness at the waist and more at mid-thigh.

''Slops'' or ''galligaskins'', loose hose reaching just below the knee, replaced all other styles of hose by the 1620s, and were now generally called [[breeches]]. Breeches might be fastened up the outer leg with buttons or buckles over a full lining.

From 1600 to c. 1630, hose or breeches were fastened to doublets by means of ties or ''points'', short laces or ribbons pulled through matching sets of worked [[eyelet]]s. Points were tied in bows at the waist and became more elaborate until they disappeared with the very short waisted doublets of the late 1630s. Decorated metal tips on points were called [[aiguillette]]s or aiglets, and those of the wealthy were made of precious metals set with [[pearl]]s and other [[gemstone]]s.&lt;ref name="Jewel"&gt;Scarisbrick, Diana, ''Tudor and Jacobean Jewellery'', pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish breeches]], rather stiff ungathered breeches, were also popular throughout the era.

===Outerwear===

[[Gown]]s were worn early in the period, but fell out of fashion in the 1620s.

Short [[cloak]]s or [[cape]]s, usually hip-length, often with [[sleeve]]s, were worn by fashionable men, usually slung artistically over the left shoulder, even indoors; a fashion of the 1630s matched the cape fabric to the breeches and its lining to the doublet. Long cloaks were worn for inclement weather.

===Hairstyles and Headgear===

Early in the period, hair was worn collar-length and brushed back from the forehead; very fashionable men wore a single long strand of hair called a [[lovelock (hairstyle)|lovelock]] over one shoulder. Hairstyles grew longer through the period, and long curls were fashionable by the late 1630s and 1640s, pointing toward the ascendance of the [[Wig (hair)|wig]] in the [[1650–1700 in fashion|1660s]].

Pointed [[beard]]s and wide [[mustache]]s were fashionable.

To about 1620, the fashionable [[hat]] was the [[capotain]], with a tall conical crown rounded at the top and a narrow brim. By the 1630s, the crown was shorter and the brim was wider, often worn ''cocked'' or pinned up on one side and decorated with a mass of [[ostrich]] [[feather|plumes]].

Close-fitting caps called [[coif]]s or ''biggins'' were worn only by young children and old men under their hats or alone indoors.

Flat [[shoes]] were worn to around 1610, when a low heel became popular. The ribbon tie over the instep that had appeared on late [[1550–1600 in fashion#Footwear|sixteenth century shoes]] grew into elaborate lace or ribbon rosettes called ''shoe roses'' that were worn by the most fashionable men and women.

Backless slippers called ''pantofles'' were worn indoors.

By the 1620s, heeled [[boot]]s became popular for indoor as well as outdoor wear.
The boots themselves were usually turned down below the knee; boot tops became wider until the "bucket-top" boot associated with ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' appeared in the 1630s. [[Spur]]s straps featured decorative butterfly-shaped ''spur leathers'' over the instep.

Wooden [[clog (shoe)|clogs]] or [[pattens]] were worn outdoors over shoes and boots to keep the high heels from sinking into soft dirt.

[[Stockings]] had elaborate ''clocks'' or embroidery at the ankles early in the period. ''[[Boothose]]'' of stout linen were worn under boots to protect fine knitted stockings; these could be trimmed with lace.

==Children's fashion==
Toddler boys wore gowns or skirts and doublets until they were ''[[Breeching (boys)|breeched]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Simplicity of dress==

In [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] countries, attempts were made to simplify and reform the extravagances of dress. [[Louis XIII of France]] issued [[sumptuary law]]s in 1629 and 1633 that prohibited lace, gold trim and lavish embroidery for all but the highest nobility and restricting puffs, slashes and bunches of ribbon.&lt;ref&gt;Kõhler, Carl: ''A History of Costume'', p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of this reform effort are depicted in a series of popular engravings by [[Abraham Bosse]].&lt;ref&gt;Lefébure, Ernest: ''Embroidery and Lace: Their Manufacture and History from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Day'', p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puritan dress===
[[File:George-Henry-Boughton-Pilgrims-Going-To-Church.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Pilgrims Going to Church]]'' by [[George Henry Boughton]] (1867)]]
[[Puritan]]s advocated a conservative form of fashionable attire, characterized by [[sadd colors]] and modest cuts. Gowns with low necklines were filled in with high-necked smocks and wide collars. Married women covered their hair with a linen cap, over which they might wear a tall black hat. Men and women avoided bright colours, shiny fabrics and over-ornamentation.

Contrary to popular belief, most Puritans and [[Calvinist]]s did not wear black for everyday, especially in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[colonial America]]. Black dye was expensive, faded quickly and black clothing was reserved for the most formal occasions (including having one's portrait painted), for elders in a community and for those of higher rank. Richer puritans, like their Dutch [[Calvinist]] contemporaries, probably did wear it often but in silk, often patterned. Typical colours for most were [[brown]], [[murrey]] ([[mulberry]], a brownish-maroon), dull greens and tawny colours. Wool and linen were preferred over silks and satins, though Puritan women of rank wore modest amounts of lace and embroidery as appropriate to their station, believing that the various ranks of society were divinely ordained and should be reflected even in the most modest dress. [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] wrote "...that apparel is necessary for Scholar, the Tradesman, the Countryman, the Gentleman; which serveth not only to defend their bodies from cold, but which belongs also to the place, degree, calling, and condition of them all" (''Cases of Conscience'', 1616).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.covenanter.org/Attire/perkinsapparel.htm ''Cases of Conscience'', 1616] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716153809/http://www.covenanter.org/Attire/perkinsapparel.htm |date=2006-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Puritans rejected the long, curled hair as effeminate and favoured a shorter fashion which led to the nickname [[Roundhead]]s for adherents of the English Parliamentary party but the taste for lavish or simple dress cut across both parties in the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Ribeiro"&gt;Ribeiro, Aileen: ''Dress and Morality'', Berg Publishers 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-782-X}}, pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Great Wall''''' is a 1986 [[comedy-drama]] film written, directed and starring [[Peter Wang]]. It was the first American feature film shot in the [[People's Republic of China]] and was [[Kelvin Han Yee]]'s first film.

==Plot==
When a [[Silicon Valley]] [[Chinese American]] executive goes back to his homeland of China for the first time in 30 years, he and his family encounter many culture clashes between the lives that they lead in the United States and the lives of their relatives in China. The finale of the movie includes an exciting table tennis match involving the Chinese-American son played by [[Kelvin Han Yee]].

==Reception==
The film was met with critical acclaim. The film has a score of 80% with a certified "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 5 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/great_wall/|title=A Great Wall (Beijing Story)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acclaimed film critic [[Roger Ebert]] from the ''Chicago-Sun Times'' awarded the film with 3 out of 4 stars and wrote of the film saying "A Great Wall is a human comedy about a Chinese-American family that goes to visit relatives in Peking, and within that simple premise are so many inspirations that the movie is interesting even when it's just looking at things." and went on to say "The chief pleasure of "A Great Wall" is its observation of the different attitudes toward the daily process of living in China and the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-great-wall-1986|title=A Great Wall, Roger Ebert Review|date=18 July 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''African literature''' is [[literature]] of or from [[Africa]].

As George Joseph notes in his chapter on African literature in ''Understanding Contemporary Africa'', whereas European views of literature often stressed a separation of art and content, African awareness is inclusive:

:"Literature" can also simply mean an artistic use of words for the sake of art alone. [...]Traditionally, Africans do not radically separate art from teaching. Rather than write or sing for beauty in itself, African writers, taking their cue from oral literature, use beauty to help communicate important truths and information to society. Indeed, an object is considered beautiful because of the truths it reveals and the communities it helps to build.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1996), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precolonial literature ==
Examples of [[Precolonialism|pre-colonial]] African literature are numerous. In [[Ethiopia]], there is a substantial literature written in [[Ge'ez#History and literature|Ge'ez]] going back at least to the fourth century AD; the best-known work in this tradition is the ''[[Kebra Negast]]'', or "Book of Kings." One popular form of traditional African folktale is the "trickster" story, in which a small animal uses its wits to survive encounters with larger creatures. Examples of animal tricksters include [[Anansi]], a spider in the folklore of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] people of [[Ghana]]; [[Ijàpá]], a [[tortoise]] in [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] folklore of [[Nigeria]]; and [[Sungura]], a [[hare]] found in central and East African folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=African Literature - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555353/African_Literature.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDV5p8Q?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555353/African_Literature.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=April 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works in written form are abundant, namely in north Africa, the [[Sahel]] regions of west Africa and on the [[Swahili coast]]. From [[Timbuktu]] alone, there are an estimated 300,000 or more manuscripts tucked away in various libraries and private collections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sum.uio.no/research/mali/timbuktu/project/timanus.pdf |title=Timbuktu Manuscripts Project Description |work=uio.no |format=PDF |date=January 1, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505134134/http://www.sum.uio.no/research/mali/timbuktu/project/timanus.pdf |archivedate=May 5, 2006 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] but some in the native languages (namely [[Fula language|Fula]] and [[Songhai languages|Songhai]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,569560,00.html |title=The Rush to Save Timbuktu's Crumbling Manuscripts |work=spiegel.de |date=August 1, 2008 |author=Matthias Schulz and Anwen Roberts |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were written at the famous [[University of Timbuktu]]. The material covers a wide array of topics, including astronomy, poetry, law, history, faith, politics, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mali/ |title=Ancient Manuscripts from the Desert Libraries of Timbuktu &amp;#124; Exhibitions - Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date=July 27, 2010 |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swahili literature]] similarly, draws inspiration from Islamic teachings but developed under indigenous circumstances. One of the most renowned and earliest pieces of Swahili literature being ''[[Utendi wa Tambuka]]'' or "The Story of Tambuka".

In Islamic times, North Africans such as [[Ibn Khaldun]] attained great distinction within [[Arabic literature]]. Medieval north Africa boasted universities such as those of [[Fes]] and [[Cairo]], with copious amounts of literature to supplement them.

== Colonial African literature ==
The African works best known in the West from the periods of colonization and the slave trade are primarily [[slave narratives]], such as [[Olaudah Equiano]]'s ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano]]'' ([[1789 in literature|1789]]).

In the colonial period, Africans exposed to Western languages began to write in those tongues. In [[1911 in literature|1911]], [[J. E. Casely Hayford|Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford]] (also known as Ekra-Agiman) of the [[Gold Coast (Africa)|Gold Coast]] (now Ghana) published what is probably the first African novel written in English, ''[[Ethiopia Unbound|Ethiopia Unbound: Studies in Race Emancipation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Newell, ''Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: 'How to Play the Game of Life' '', Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 2002, p. 135, ch. 7, "Ethical Fiction: J.E. Casely Hayford's ''Ethiopia Unbound''".&lt;/ref&gt; Although the work moves between fiction and political advocacy, its publication and positive reviews in the Western press mark a watershed moment in African literature.

During this period, African [[Play (theatre)|plays]] written in English began to emerge. [[Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo]] of [[South Africa]] published the first English-language African play, ''[[The Girl Who Killed to Save: Nongqawuse the Liberator]]'' in [[1935 in literature|1935]].  In [[1962 in literature|1962]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] of [[Kenya]] wrote the first East African drama, ''[[The Black Hermit]]'', a cautionary tale about "[[tribalism]]" ([[discrimination]] between African tribes).

Among the first pieces of African literature to receive significant worldwide critical acclaim was ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', by [[Chinua Achebe]]. Published in 1958, late in the colonial era, ''Things Fall Apart'' analyzed the effect of colonialism on traditional African society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elizabeth |first=Marie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2013/03/22/humble-beginnings-of-chinua-achebes-things-fall-apart/ |title=Humble beginnings of Chinua Achebe’s ‘Things Fall Apart’ |publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African literature in the late colonial period (between the end of [[World War I]] and independence) increasingly showed themes of [[liberty|liberation]], independence, and (among Africans in French-controlled territories) [[négritude]].  One of the leaders of the négritude movement, the poet and eventual President of [[Senegal]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], published in [[1948 in literature|1948]] the first anthology of French-language poetry written by Africans, ''Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache de langue française'' (''Anthology of the New Black and Malagasy Poetry in the French Language''), featuring a preface by the French [[existentialist]] writer [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Leopold Senghor - MSN Encarta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761579258/Leopold_Senghor.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDVhgpr?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761579258/Leopold_Senghor.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many writers this emphasis was not restricted to their publishing. Many, indeed, suffered deeply and directly: censured for casting aside his artistic responsibilities in order to participate actively in warfare, [[Christopher Okigbo]] was killed in battle for [[Biafra]] against the Nigerian movement of the 1960s' [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war]]; [[Mongane Wally Serote]] was detained under South Africa's [[Terrorism Act No 83 of 1967]] between 1969 and 1970, and subsequently released without ever having stood trial; in [[London]] in 1970, his countryman [[Arthur Norje]] committed suicide; [[Malawi]]'s [[Jack Mapanje]] was incarcerated with neither charge nor trial because of an off-hand remark at a university pub; and, in 1995, [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] was hanged by the Nigerian junta.

== Postcolonial African literature ==
With liberation and increased literacy since most African nations gained their independence in the 1950s and 1960s, African literature has grown dramatically in quantity and in recognition, with numerous African works appearing in Western academic curricula and on "best of" lists compiled at the end of the 20th century.  African writers in this period wrote both in Western languages (notably [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) and in traditional African languages such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]].

[[Ali A. Mazrui]] and others mention seven conflicts as themes: the clash between Africa's past and present, between tradition and modernity, between indigenous and foreign, between individualism and community, between socialism and capitalism, between development and self-reliance and between Africanity and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali A. Mazrui]] et al. "The development of modern literature since 1935" as ch. 19 of [[UNESCO]]'s ''[[General History of Africa]]'', vol. VIII, pp. 564f. Collaborating with Ali A. Mazrui on this chapter were [[Mario Pinto de Andrade]], M'hamed Alaoui Abdalaoui, Daniel P. Kunene and [[Jan Vansina]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other themes in this period include social problems such as corruption, the economic disparities in newly independent countries, and the rights and roles of women.  Female writers are today far better represented in published African literature than they were prior to independence.

In [[1986 in literature|1986]], [[Wole Soyinka]] became the first post-independence African writer to win the [[Nobel Prize]] in literature. Previously, [[Algeria]]n-born [[Albert Camus]] had been awarded the 1957 prize.

== Contemporary developments ==
There is a lot of literary production in [[Africa]] since the beginning of the current decade (2010), even though readers do not always follow in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;"La littérature africaine est en mouvement" (African literature is on the move): [http://africultures.com/tribune-litterature-africaine-ne-manque-de-genies-de-critiques-14104/ Africultures.com]&lt;/ref&gt; One can also notice the appearance of certain writings that break with the [[academic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;This article compares the "rebellious" style of a young author (Eric Mendi) with the more classical style of Alain Mabanckou: [http://www.jeuneafrique.com/452019/culture/theorie-de-leau-de-javel-alain-mabanckou-eric-mendi/ Jeuneafrique.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the shortage of literary critics can be explored on the continent nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;African Literature: Between Genuises Affluence and Criticism Shortage: [http://www.camer.be/60400/11:1/belgique-african-literature-between-geniuses-affluence-and-criticism-shortage-belgium.html Camer.be]&lt;/ref&gt; Literary events seem to be very fashionable, including [[literary awards]], some of which can be distinguished by their original concepts. The case of the [[Grand Prix of Literary Associations]] is quite illustrative.&lt;ref&gt;This prize receives books in three languages (Spanish, English and French), the books are proposed to the Jury by literary associations: [https://www.bellanaija.com/2017/09/grand-prix-of-literary-associations-2017/ Bellanaija.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature published in Africa ==
Inaugurated in 1980 and running till 2009, the [[Noma Award for Publishing in Africa]] was presented for the outstanding work of the year published in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jay, [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/abpr.2006.32.issue-2/abpr.2006.116/abpr.2006.116.xml "25 Years of the Noma Award for Publishing in Africa: an historic overview"], ''The African Book Publishing Record'', Volume 32, Issue 2, pp. 116–118, ISSN (Print) 0306-0322, DOI: 10.1515/ABPR.2006.116, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bombardementd alger-1830.jpg|thumb|250px|''Algiers attack by Wed, July 3, 1830'', oil on canvas]]
'''Antoine Léon Morel-Fatio''' (born 1810 in [[Rouen]] − d. 1871 in Paris) was a French naval painter, [[peintre officiel de la Marine]], curator of the naval and ethnographic museum of the [[Louvre]], and mayor of the [[20th arrondissement of Paris]].

== Biography ==
Morel-Fatio was born to the Morel family, of small nobility. He attended [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] before being expelled in 1824 for making practical jokes, and finished his studies at the [[Lycée Condorcet|collège Bourbon]].

In 1827, he joined the British commerce Navy to learn navigation, before joining the family bank, and later the bank  of [[Jean-Charles Davillier]].

Morel-Fatio traveled in Italy and Orient, learning painting. In 1830, he was with the French fleet during the [[Expédition d'Alger]]. He produced a corpus of drawings and paintings that earned him some success at the Salon in 1833. In 1836, Louis-Philippe ordered a painting illustrating the capture of Alger for the historical museum in Versaille.

In 1838, Morel-Fatio was selected by [[Horace Vernet]] to paint the [[Battle of San Juan de Ulúa (1838)|Battle of San Juan de Ulúa]]. The next year, Morel-Fatio  sailed with the fleet under Admiral [[Julien Pierre Anne Lalande|Lalande]]. In 1840, he painted the returns of the ashes a Napoléon to France.

Morel-Fatio was made assistant curator of the naval collections of the Louvre (which at the time harboured the [[Musée national de la Marine]]), and rose to curator in 1852. In 1850, he created an ethnographical annex to the museum, and a Chinese museum.

Morel-Fatio was made a [[Peintre de la Marine]] in 1853.

From 1860 to 1869, he was mayor of the [[20th arrondissement of Paris]].

Morel-Fatio died of a heart attack on 2 March 1871, allegedly when seeing Prussian soldiers storm the museum.

[[File:AB Portrait.jpg|thumb|Arnold Berleant]]
Arnold Berleant was born in Buffalo, New York&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  He received his advanced musical education at the Eastman School of Music and his doctorate in philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo.  He is Professor of Philosophy (Emeritus) at Long Island University, former Secretary-General and Past President of the International Association of Aesthetics, and former Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society for Aesthetics.  His books and articles in philosophy focus on aesthetics, environmental aesthetics, and ethics.  Arnold Berleant is the founding editor of ''Contemporary Aesthetics'', an international on-line journal of contemporary aesthetic theory, research, and application.

==Life and work==

As a philosopher Berleant has written on important aspects of both aesthetic theory and the arts.  These include ontological and metaphysical issues, basic theoretical questions such as appreciation and aesthetic experience, and explorations of music, architecture, painting and literature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Renee Conroy, “Berleant Review,” (Philadelphia, PA:  American Society for Aesthetics, Eastern Division, April 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  His first book, ''The Aesthetic Field:  A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience'' (1970), established the concept of the aesthetic field as a contextual framework within which questions in aesthetics and the arts can be most fully illuminated.  Much of his subsequent work has focused on environmental aesthetics, attending both to general issues and to specific kinds of environment.  The aesthetics of environment is a theme that he has elaborated and extended in much of his writing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Cheng Xiangzhan, “Environmental Aesthetics and Ecological Aesthetics:  Arnold Berleant’s Impact on Ecological Aesthetics in China,” Sztuka i Filozofia-Special Issue (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In Art and Engagement'' (1991), Berleant exemplified the usefulness of the concept of the aesthetic field by applying it to a range of arts – landscape painting, architecture and environmental design, literature, music, dance, and film.&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Aesthetics, Summer 1991.  p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging from these original studies was the recognition that the different arts evoke experiences with their own claims to reality.  Moreover, these experiences exhibit an intense, active perceptual involvement that he calls “aesthetic engagement,” which belies the traditional claim of aesthetic disinterestedness.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The innovative concept of engagement leads to new perspectives on a variety of traditional esthetic topics, including metaphorical language, urban design, music, and metaphysics, and opens less traditional topics, such as virtual reality and social interaction to aesthetic analysis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;
The body of Berleant’s work challenges the traditional view of philosophical aesthetics, which posits “disinterestedness” as foundational in aesthetic experience.  Berleant draws upon both phenomenology and pragmatism for an opposing theory of aesthetic perception based on the notion of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;M. Feder-Marcus, Choice (American Library Association,  December, 1991), p. 255)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ars.moriendi.pride.a.jpg|thumb|[[Pride]] of the spirit is one of the five temptations of the dying man, according to '''''Ars moriendi'''''. Here, [[Demons#In Christian myth and legend|demons]] tempt the dying man with crowns (a [[medieval allegory]] to earthly pride) under the disapproving gaze of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Christ]] and God. Woodblock seven (4a) of eleven, [[Netherlands]], circa 1460.]]

The '''''Ars moriendi''''' ("The Art of Dying") are two related [[Latin]] texts dating from about 1415 and 1450 which offer advice on the protocols and procedures of a good [[death]], explaining how to "die well" according to [[Christianity|Christian]] precepts of the [[late Middle Ages]]. It was written within the historical context of the effects of the macabre horrors of the [[Black Death]] 60 years earlier and consequent [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|social upheavals of the 15th century]]. It was very popular, translated into most West European languages, and was the first in a western literary tradition of guides to death and dying. About 50,000 copies were printed in the ''incunabula'' period before 1501.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There was originally a "long version" and a later "short version" containing eleven [[woodcut]] pictures as instructive images which could be easily explained and memorized.

The authors of the two texts are unknown, but assumed to be Dominican churchmen, as they echo Jean de Gerson's publication, the ''Opusculum Tripartitu'', containing a section named ''De arte Moriendi''. Gerson may have been influenced by earlier references in 'compendia of faith' dating back to the thirteenth century, but the content was uniquely his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul|first1=Kathryn|title=The Ars Moriendi: A Practical Approach To Dying Well|journal=Modern Believing|date=2015|volume=56|issue=2|page=213|doi=10.3828/mb.2015.19|publisher=ATLASerials|language=English|issn=1353-1425}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Long version ==
The original "long version", called ''Tractatus'' (or ''[[Speculum literature|Speculum]]'') ''artis bene moriendi'', was composed in 1415 by an anonymous [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, probably at the request of the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418, Germany).&lt;ref name=blake&gt;N.F. Blake (1982). "Ars Moriendi". ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''. v.1, pp547-8. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely read and translated into most West European languages, and was very popular in England, where a tradition of consolatory death literature survived until the 17th century. Works in the English tradition include ''[[The Way of Dying Well]]'' and ''[[The Sick Mannes Salve]]''. In 1650, ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]'' became the "artistic climax" of the tradition that had begun with ''Ars moriendi''.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Beaty (1970). ''The Craft of Dying: A Study of the Literary Traditions of the Ars Moriendi in England''. {{ISBN|0-300-01336-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ars Moriendi'' was also among the first books printed with movable type and was widely circulated in nearly 100 editions before 1500, in particular in Germany. The long version survives in about 300 manuscript versions, only one illustrated.

''Ars moriendi'' consists of six chapters:&lt;ref name=blake /&gt;

# The first chapter explains that dying has a good side, and serves to console the dying man that death is not something to be afraid of.
# The second chapter outlines the five temptations that beset a dying man, and how to avoid them. These are [[faith|lack of faith]], [[wikt:despair|despair]], [[patience|impatience]], [[pride|spiritual pride]] and [[avarice]].
# The third chapter lists the seven questions to ask a dying man, along with consolation available to him through the redemptive powers of [[Christ]]'s love.
# The fourth chapter expresses the need to imitate Christ's life.
# The fifth chapter addresses the friends and family, outlining the general rules of behavior at the deathbed.
# The sixth chapter includes appropriate [[prayer]]s to be said for a dying man.

== Short version ==
The "short version", whose appearance shortly precedes the introduction in the 1460s of [[Woodblock printing|block books]] (books printed from carved blocks of wood, both text and images on the same block), first dates to around 1450, from the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=blake /&gt; It is mostly an adaptation of the second chapter of the "long version", and contains eleven woodcut pictures. The first ten woodcuts are divided into 5 pairs, with each set showing a picture of [[Christian teaching about the Devil|the devil]] presenting one of the 5 temptations, and the second picture showing the proper remedy for that temptation. The last woodcut shows the dying man, presumably having successfully navigated the maze of temptations, being accepted into [[heaven]], and the devils going back to [[Hell in Christian beliefs|hell]] in confusion.

The "short version" was as popular as the "long version", but there was no English translation, perhaps because educated English people at the time were expected to understand several European languages. There are six extant manuscripts of the short version, most not illustrated, and over twenty extant blockbook illustrated editions, using 13 different sets of blocks.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor (1971), ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, numbers 23-25.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ars moriendi (Meister E.S.), L.175.png|thumb|''Temptation of lack of Faith''; engraving by [[Master E. S.]], circa 1450]]

== The images ==
As well as the eleven different sets of [[blockbook]] [[woodcut]]s, there is a set by [[Master E. S.]] in [[engraving]]. The lengthy controversy over their respective dating and priority is now resolved by the discovery by [[Fritz Saxl]] of an earlier illuminated manuscript, of well before 1450, from whose tradition all the images in the printed versions clearly derive. Studies of the [[watermark]]s of the blockbooks by Allen Stevenson at the [[British Museum]] in the 1960s confirmed that none of them predated the 1460s, so Master E. S.' engravings are the earliest printed versions, dating from around 1450. The images remain largely the same in all media for the rest of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Shestack (1967). ''Master E. S.'', exhibition catalogue, Philadelphia Museum of Art, exhibit numbers 4-15&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the exceptional number of about seventy [[incunabulum]] editions, in a variety of languages, from Catalan to Dutch, the earliest from about 1474 from [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://138.253.81.72/~cheshire/cgi-bin/istc/istcsearch.cgi?squery=search++(topicWord+%5C%5B5%3D100%5C%5D+%7B+ars+moriendi+%7D+)+resultsetid+SearchResults&amp;recno=1&amp;sorttype1=attr&amp;sortfield1=istcnum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006210256/http://138.253.81.72/~cheshire/cgi-bin/istc/istcsearch.cgi?squery=search++%28topicWord+%5C%5B5%3D100%5C%5D+%7B+ars+moriendi+%7D+%29+resultsetid+SearchResults&amp;recno=1&amp;sorttype1=attr&amp;sortfield1=istcnum |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-06 |title=ISTC, British Library |publisher=138.253.81.72 |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2013-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegorically the images depicted the contest between angels and demons over the fate of the dying man. In his dying agony his soul emerges from his mouth to be received by one of a band of angels.
Common themes portrayed by illustrators include skeletons, the Last Judgement, corpses, and the forces of good and evil battling over souls.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Martyn Lyons (2011). ''Books: A Living History''. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-083-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended tradition ==
The popularity of the ''Ars moriendi'' texts developed into a broader tradition of writing on the good death. Jeremy Taylor's books ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]'', published in 1650 and 1651, exemplify that tradition. It developed in both Protestant and Catholic veins and continued in various forms through the nineteenth century.

The '''''Codex coemeterium''''' (sb423 National Library, [[Clementinum]], [[Prague]]) is a 16th-century [[grimoire]] manuscript. The text, composed in [[Latin]], is largely concerned with [[demonology]] and [[necromancy]]. The book falls into [[A.E.

'''Cookie Bear''', otherwise known as '''CB''', is a familiar character in [[New Zealand]] originally associated with Hudsons and now Griffins biscuits. Cookie Bear's popularity grew with New Zealand children through the '''Cookie Bear Club''', their shared love of '''Chocolate Chippies''' and his famous catchphrase '''Dum-de-doo'''.

==Early years==
The New Zealand biscuit company Hudson was bought by [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]] in the 1930s. In the early 1970s Don Donovan, a director of advertising agency Carlton-Carruthers du Chateau Ltd., suggested developing the Cookie Bear character for a couple of television advertisements. The black and white advertisements featured Cookie Bear (a man dressed in a bear suit) as a lover of biscuits who thought Hudson's brand was the best.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://don-donovan.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-admit-it-i-am-cookie-bears-father.html|title=Don Donovan creates Cookie Bear|accessdate=2009-08-29|work=Don Donovan's World: I Admit It, I Am Cookie Bear’s Father}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cookie Bear Brand==
Cookie Bear's immediate popularity resulted in an increase in his use as a mascot for Hudson's biscuits, with eventual heavy use of his image in advertisements, on packaging and on a growing number of promotional items.&lt;ref name="Last Century"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itssolastcentury.co.uk/truck/Cookie_Bear|title=The Cookie Bear Brand|date=12 May 2011|accessdate=2011-02-13|work=It's So Last Century: Cookie Bear}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cookie Bear became particularly associated with '''Chocolate Chippies''', a hard round biscuit with chocolate chips.&lt;ref name="chippies"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com/biscuits/previous.php3?item=43|title='''Chocolate Chippies''' are biscuit of the week|accessdate=2008-02-22|work=Biscuit of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of Cookie Bear's popularity in 1975, John Berry wrote and published an illustrated children's book called ''The Adventures of Cookie Bear''.

When Hudsons was incorporated into [[Griffin's Foods]] (Hudson's main market rivals) in 1989,&lt;ref name="Griffin's"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.griffins.co.nz/about-griffins/the-griffins-story/1970s|title=Hudsons incorporated into Griffins|accessdate=2008-02-22|work=Griffins Foods Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; the copyright for Cookie Bear was also transferred; however, while Griffins continues to use the Cookie Bear Brand on some of its products and in a few advertisements, Cookie Bear is now a less familiar [[New Zealand]] cultural icon.&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt;

==The Cookie Bear Club==
Cookie Bear's fame and popularity escalated through the '''Cookie Bear Club''', which had a regular monthly page in the ''[[New Zealand Woman's Weekly]]'' magazine. Children throughout New Zealand joined the club, reaching a peak of 180,000 children, or 1 in 4 New Zealand children under the age of 12.&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt;  Members of the club received postcards on their birthday. Today's Cookie Bear Club has moved online to the official Cookie Bear Club website.&lt;ref name="Website"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cookiebear.co.nz/|title=The Cookie Bear Club|accessdate=2008-02-22|work=Griffin's Cookie Bear Club House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cutup''' is a group of London-based artists, whose work mainly revolves around the manipulation of [[billboard]] [[advertisements]]. Their first works consisted of removing a billboard, painstakingly cutting it up into roughly 4000 small rectangles, each one in essence a [[pixel]], and then reassembling the billboard.

More recently, Cutup have started other projects, such as replacing small bus-shelter advertisements with a drilled sheet of wood. The illuminating back lights that turn on at dusk reveal an image, as the many holes light up against the dark background.

Although they mainly deal with art on the street, the group have also created installations, including setting 96 different alarm clocks one a minute apart and sound installations, made up of 94 speakers, mini disks and circuit boards.

'''''Diana''''' &amp;ndash; also known as '''''Diana of the Tower''''' &amp;ndash; is an [[Cultural icon|iconic]] statue by sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]].  Once a famous New York City landmark, the second version stood atop the tower of [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] from 1893 to 1925. Since 1932, it has been in the collection of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

The statue represents the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].

==First version (1891-1892)==
''Diana'' was commissioned by architect [[Stanford White]] as a [[weather vane]] for the tower of Madison Square Garden, a theater-and-dining complex at [[26th Street (Manhattan)|26th Street]] and [[Madison Avenue]] in Manhattan. He talked his friend Saint-Gaudens into creating it at no charge, and picked up the cost of materials.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"The Architect of Desire: Beauty and Danger in the Stanford White Family," Suzanna Lessard&lt;/ref&gt; Model Julia "Dudie" Baird posed for the body of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgnhs.org/Augustus%20SGaudens%20CD-HTML/Models/Dudie.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Its face is that of Davida Johnson Clark, Saint-Gaudens's long-time model and mother of his illegitimate son Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/17571 Davida Johnson Clark], from Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version &amp;ndash; built by the [[W. H. Mullins Manufacturing Company]] in [[Salem, Ohio]] &amp;ndash; was {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and weighed {{convert|1800|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgnhs.org/Augustus%20SGaudens%20CD-HTML/Monuments/Ideal/Diana1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Gaudens's design specified that the figure appear to delicately balance on its left toe atop a ball. However, the Ohio metal shop was unable to pass the rotating rod through the toe, so the design was altered and the figure instead was poised (less-gracefully) on its heel.

''Diana'' was unveiled atop Madison Square Garden's tower on September 29, 1891. The 304-foot (92.66 m) building had been completed a year earlier, and was the second-tallest in New York City. But the addition of the statue made it the city's tallest, by 13 feet (3.96 m).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JVzYO1TyZ6AC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=madison+square+garden+tower+height&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yk6wC1Fcyd&amp;sig=mHLM8zLgVHCygH_8JP3I35PvQak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBmoVChMIy-ydxsf5yAIVCmg-Ch26cwHp#v=onepage&amp;q=madison%20square%20garden%20tower%20height&amp;f=false Joseph J. Korum, ''The American Skyscraper, 1850&amp;ndash;1940'' (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; The figure's billowing copper [[foulard]] (scarf) was intended to catch the wind, but the statue did not rotate smoothly because of its weight. ''Diana''{{'}}s nudity offended [[morality|moral crusader]] [[Anthony Comstock]] and his [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9l5TIzarCUC&amp;pg=PT61&amp;dq=american+eve+the+statue&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iYm5TtDtMaOQsALkvejZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=American Eve: Evelyn Nesbit, Stanford White, the Birth of the "It" Girl, and the Crime of the Century | author= Paula Uruburu| publisher= Penguin| year= 2009| isbn= 978-1-59448-369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To placate Comstock and to increase the likelihood of its catching the wind, Saint-Gaudens draped the figure in cloth, but the cloth blew away.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project. ''New York City Guide''. New York: Random House, 1939 {{ISBN|0-403-02921-X}} (Reprinted by Scholarly Press, 1976; often referred to as WPA Guide to New York City), pp.330–333&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Soon after installation, both White and Saint-Gaudens concluded that the figure was too large for the building, and decided to create a smaller, lighter replacement. Following less than a year atop the tower, the statue was removed and shipped to Chicago to be exhibited at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. New Yorker W. T. Henderson wrote a [[tongue-in-cheek]] poetic tribute &amp;ndash; "Diana Off the Tower" &amp;ndash; a play on both the statue's name and situation.&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Henderson, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/09/18/106890362.pdf "Diana Off the Tower" (PDF),] ''The New York Times'', September 18, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint-Gaudens served as head of the Chicago exposition's sculpture committee. His initial plan had been to place ''Diana'' atop the Women's Pavilion, but the city's [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] protested and insisted that the controversial nude figure be clothed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Instead, it was placed atop the Agricultural Building.

The original ''Diana'' does not survive. In June 1894, eight months after the exposition's closing, a major fire tore through its buildings. The lower half of the statue was destroyed; the upper half survived the fire, but was later lost or discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jssgallery.org/other_artists/augustus_saint-gaudens/diana_of_the_tower.html|title=Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Diana of the Tower|first=|last=Natasha|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second version (1893-present)==
[[File:Madison Square Garden Diana.jpg|thumb|right|Second version of ''Diana'' with her copper foulard.]]
''Diana'' was completely redesigned by Saint-Gaudens &amp;ndash; with a more elegant pose, a different thrust to the body, a thinner figure, smaller breasts and a more graceful angle to the leg.  To better fit the proportions of Madison Square Garden's tower, the statue's height was scaled down to 14.5 feet (4.4 m).&lt;ref&gt;The Philadelphia Museum of Art's website lists the height of the figure as 13 ft 1 in (398.8 cm), and the height of the ball as 17 in (43 cm).[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/44513.html?mulR=241195760|1]&lt;/ref&gt; The second version was made of hollowed copper, and weighed 700&amp;nbsp;lb (318&amp;nbsp;kg) &amp;ndash; more than 60% less than the first version &amp;ndash; light enough to rotate with the wind. As Saint-Gaudens originally envisioned, the figure was balanced on its left toe atop a ball. The statue was hoisted to the top of the tower on November 18, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/11/18/109733483.pdf| title=New Diana of the Tower| work=The New York Times| date=November 18, 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the day, the gilded figure caught the sun and could be seen from all over the city and as far away as New Jersey.  Electric lights, then a novelty, illuminated it at night; it was the first statue in history to be lit by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgnhs.org/Augustus%20SGaudens%20CD-HTML/Monuments/Ideal/Diana2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison Square Garden was slated to be demolished in 1925, to make way for construction of the [[New York Life Building]]. Prior to the building's demolition, ''Diana'' was removed and put in storage. The intention was for the statue to remain in New York City, however a seven year search to find a place to display it proved futile.  In 1932, the [[New York Life Insurance Company]] presented ''Diana'' to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] as a gift. It remains there today, displayed on the balcony of the museum's Great Stair Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/44513.html?mulR=967189961|8 Object record] in the Philadelphia Museum of Art's online collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
[[File:Diana of the Tower Philadelphia Museum of Art cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Second version of ''Diana'' (restored, 2013-14), Philadelphia Museum of Art.]]
When ''Diana'' was removed from Madison Square Garden in 1925, much of its gilded exterior was gone, having eroded away over three decades of exposure to the elements. The Philadelphia Museum of Art cleaned and repaired the statue in 1932, but the gold leaf was not replaced.

In 2013, scaffolding was constructed around the statue in the museum's Great Stair Hall for a year-long restoration.  Conservators carefully cleaned its copper surface with chemicals and steam, removing nearly a century of dirt and grime.  Samples of the small patches of remaining gold leaf on the statue were taken in an effort to match the carat, weight and color with its replacement.  The statue's surface was then repaired and regilded with 180 square feet of gold leaf.  Because it was known from contemporary sources that Saint-Gaudens did not like the look of bright gold at eye level, the conservators matted the gilding to reduce the glare and museum lighting designers adjusted the display lights for the interior display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/21.html|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Research  :  Conservation|first=Philadelphia Museum of|last=Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2014, the restored statue was unveiled and rededicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2687882/Philadelphia-museums-golden-goddess-glows-again.html#ixzz3mOfi0n9r|title=Philadelphia museum's golden goddess glows again|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural references===

In the popular 1975 novel ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'', author [[E.L. Doctorow]] suggests in a single line that showgirl [[Evelyn Nesbitt]] had posed for the second version of the ''Diana'' statue.  Having grown up poor in the streets of a Pennsylvania coal town, Nesbitt had risen up to become “the Gaudens statue Stanny White had put at the top of the tower of Madison Square Garden, a glorious bronze nude Diana, her bow drawn, her face in the skies.”

The 1981 film version of [[Ragtime (film)|''Ragtime'']] expanded upon this incident as the cause of a major conflict between Stanford White and Nesbitt's millionaire husband [[Harry K. Thaw]].  In the film, Thaw demands that the statue be taken down from the top of the Garden as it is an embarrassment to him.  The character is seen glaring angrily at the statue before shooting White to death at the Rooftop Theatre at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] on June 25, 1906.

Both situations are completely fictional.  The second version of ''Diana'' was placed atop the tower in 1893, when Nesbitt was only about nine years old, and eight years before she was introduced to White.

===Half-sized statues===
[[File:Swanson4715.jpg|thumb|Half-sized ''Diana'' (1928), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]
[[Stanford White]] was so pleased with the 1893 second version that he asked Saint-Gaudens to create a half-sized copy in cement. This was installed in 1894 in the garden of White's Long Island estate, [[Box Hill Estate|Box Hill]], where it stood for many years. For the half-sized copy, Saint-Gaudens poised the figure on a half-ball. White's cement statue later was used to produce two bronze casts in 1928, and six bronze casts in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Dryfhout, ''The Works of Augustus Saint-Gaudens'' (UPNE, 2008), cat. 154, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The cement statue is now in the collection of the [[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/33417 Diana], from Princeton University Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] owns a bronze statuette of Saint-Gaudens's first version of ''Diana''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=14467JO08361U.605&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!293600~!11&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Saint-Gaudens&amp;index=.AW&amp;uindex=&amp;oper=&amp;term=Diana&amp;index=.TW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1 ''Diana'' (first version)], from SIRIS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on the popularity of the second version, Saint-Gaudens modeled statuettes in two sizes: 31 inches (78&amp;nbsp;cm), with the figure poised on a half-ball, and 21 inches (53&amp;nbsp;cm), with the figure poised on a full ball. These were cast in bronze beginning in 1899, and vary in the configuration of bow, arrow, string, hair, patination, and base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1985.353|title=Diana - Augustus Saint-Gaudens - 1985.353 - Work of Art - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death at age 25 in 1365, Duke [[Rudolf IV of Austria|Rudolf IV]]{{Bioxref|3}} had ordered a crypt to be built for his remains in the new cathedral he commissioned, and it has sheltered those remains for over 650 years. He also ordered a [[cenotaph]] for himself to be placed upstairs above the crypt, in front of the high altar. That [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202420/http://www.deca-forum.net/deca-cgi/query.pl?DEF=c%3A%5Cdata%5Cdeca%5Chida&amp;DATEN=C%3A%5Cdata%5Cdeca%5Cdata&amp;THE=C%3A%5Cdata%5Cdeca%5Cidx&amp;USER=bild&amp;BAG=20&amp;POS=0&amp;DOK_TPL=deca_doc.tpl&amp;LIST_TPL=deca_list.tpl&amp;FCT=q&amp;iftxt=rudolfsgrab&amp;N_ftxt=0&amp;R_ftxt=%3D&amp;ikufo=&amp;N_kufo=1&amp;R_kufo=%3D&amp;i024=wien&amp;N_024=2&amp;R_024=%3D&amp;i031=&amp;N_031=3&amp;R_031=%3D&amp;i029=&amp;N_029=4&amp;R_029=%3D&amp;iauen=&amp;N_auen=5&amp;R_auen=%3D&amp;i039=&amp;N_039=6&amp;R_039=%3D&amp; symbolic tomb] was later moved to the north choir and his [[epitaph]] written in secret symbols was placed on the wall of that choir.

The family of the [[Habsburg#Dukes of Austria|ruling line of Austrian dukes]] was buried here after Rudolf IV, but after the dynasty became emperors they were buried in various cities (Vienna was not yet the settled seat of the emperor). After the [[Imperial Crypt]] at the [[Kapuzinerkirche]] opened in 1633, it became the new dynastic burial place.

[[Image:StephansdomCatacombsLabeledPlan-en.png|left|thumb|The Ducal Crypt (red letters) is one of several burial locations beneath Stephansdom. The bones of over 11,000 persons from cemeteries formerly around the church are stored in the Catacombs.]]
Embalmers have known since the time of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians that it is necessary to remove the internal organs if the rest of the body is to be preserved. The containers with those organs were usually put in the coffin, but when the heir to the Imperial Throne, [[Ferdinand IV of Germany|King Ferdinand IV of the Romans]], died in 1654, he specified in his will that the container with his heart be placed in the [[Augustinian Church, Vienna|Augustinerkirche]], his body in the [[Imperial Crypt|Imperial Crypt in the Kapuzinerkirche]], and the urn with his viscera in the crypt at the [[Stephansdom]]. His instructions resulted in the foundation of the [[Herzgruft]] at the Augustinerkirche. His younger brother, Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], pursued a tradition imitating that distribution of remains, and also enlarged the Imperial Crypt to make it large enough for additional future burials. The urns with viscera were thereafter regularly deposited in the Ducal Crypt in the Stephansdom. There are now 33 persons who are each buried in all three places.

By 1754 the small rectangular Ducal Crypt was overcrowded with 12 sarcophagi and 39 urns, so the area was expanded with an oval chamber being added (directly beneath the present location of the [[Throne#Ecclesiastical thrones|Archbishop's Throne]]) beyond the east end of the rectangular one. New sarcophagi were made for some of the bodies.

In 1956 the crypt was renovated and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071009144156/http://www.deca-forum.net/deca-cgi/getdoc.pl?DEF=c%3A%5Cdata%5Cdeca%5Chida%3BDATEN%3DC%3A%5Cdata%5Cdeca%5Cdata%3BTHE%3DC%3A%5Cdata%5Cdeca%5Cidx%3BUSER%3Dbild%3BDOK_TPL%3Ddeca_doc.tpl%3BLIST_TPL%3Ddeca_list.tpl%3BFCT%3Dg%3Biftxt%3Dherzogsgruft%3BN_ftxt%3D0%3BR_ftxt%3D%3D%3Bikufo%3D%3BN_kufo%3D1%3BR_kufo%3D%3D%3Bi024%3Dwien%3BN_024%3D2%3BR_024%3D%3D%3Bi031%3D%3BN_031%3D3%3BR_031%3D%3D%3Bi029%3D%3BN_029%3D4%3BR_029%3D%3D%3Biauen%3D%3BN_auen%3D5%3BR_auen%3D%3D%3Bi039%3D%3BN_039%3D6%3BR_039%3D%3D&amp;KEY=fot%20w0008329 contents] were rearranged. The [[sarcophagi]] of Duke Rudolf IV{{Bioxref|3}} and his wife{{Bioxref|4}} were placed upon a pedestal and the 62 urns containing organs were moved from the two rows of shelves around the new section to cabinets in the original chamber.

Deposition in the crypt has not always been permanent. Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] lay here for only 20 years after his death, until his magnificent tomb upstairs in the south choir was ready. The body of his brother, Archduke [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albert VI]], was removed after 300 years.

[[Image:Stephansdom Ducal Vault Orientation 1758.png|thumb|The old and new chambers of the crypt are adjacent, with a tunnel for daylight at the east (left) end, and stairs descending to the crypt's old chamber from the west.]]
The greatest influx, other that the regular arrival of visceral urns, came as a result of the Austrian version of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution of the English Monasteries]] under Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1782. When the religious institutions holding bodies of some of the members of the dynasty were closed, they needed to be moved. The Imperial Crypt at that time had only half the space it has today, and already held 57 bodies. The emperor ordered that the bodies of two persons{{Bioxref|1}} {{Bioxref|14}} who had died before the Imperial Crypt opened be brought to the Ducal Crypt instead. Another person, Empress Eleanor,{{Bioxref|16}} would normally have been entitled to space in the Imperial Crypt, but because her husband{{Bioxref|19}} was not buried there either, her body was sent to the Ducal Crypt.

It is probably around this time that the body of Duke [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albert VI]] was removed to make room for others, and that the body{{Bioxref|15}} whose sarcophagus is inscribed with only the year and name of the parents arrived. Identified through other evidence as one-year-old Anna of Lorraine, it is known that her brother [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine]] married Archduchess [[Eleanora Maria of Austria|Eleanora Maria Josepha]] (1653–1697) (widowed Queen of Poland and daughter of Emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]]){{Bioxref|21}} in 1678, and that marriage may have some connection with this non-Habsburg being brought here, but the exact reason is unclear.

The last item interred here is the urn with the viscera of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Karl of Austria|Franz Karl]]{{Bioxref|78}}, father of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], in 1878.

The armorial flag of Adelaide was approved on August 2, 1982. It replaced the de facto decoration of the coat of arms on a white background which had been flown outside of the town hall and was used during special occasions prior to the replacement. The new flag was prepared by College of Arms and took its symbols from the city's coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidecitycouncil.com/your-council/role-of-council/175-years-of-council/history-of-council History of Council - The Armorial Flag], City of Adelaide website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au-sa-ad.html The Armorial Flag], Description of the armorial flag of Adelaide&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag contains a navy blue background divided into four quarters by a [[Saint George's Cross]] outlined in [[gold]] overlain with the Arms of the City of [[Adelaide]]. The flag is bordered on three sides by diagonal blue and gold stripes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Council|url=http://www.adelaidecitycouncil.com/your-council/role-of-council/175-years-of-council/history-of-council/|publisher=Adelaide City Council|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au-sa-ad.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flaming June''''' is a painting by Sir [[Frederic Leighton]], produced in 1895. Painted with [[oil paint]]s on a {{convert|47|x|47|in|adj=on}} square canvas, it is widely considered to be Leighton's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], showing his [[Classicism|classicist]] nature. It is thought that the woman portrayed alludes to the figures of sleeping [[nymph]]s and [[naiad]]s the [[Ancient Greek art|Greeks]] often sculpted.

''Flaming June'' disappeared from view in the early 1900s and was rediscovered only in the 1960s. It was auctioned shortly after, during a period of time known to be difficult for selling Victorian era paintings, where it failed to sell for its low reserve price of US$140 (the equivalent of $1,126 in modern prices). After the auction, it was promptly purchased by the [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]], where it currently resides.

==Appraisal==
''Flaming June'' was first begun as a motif to adorn a marble bath in one of Leighton's other works, ''Summer Slumber''. He became so attached to the design that he decided to create it as a painting in its own right.
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The funereal solemnity of Michelangelo's monumental nude has been considerably warmed up, by the Victorian painter, in the act of appropriating and adapting it. Leighton has arranged matters in such a way that, although clothed, his somnolent girl's many charms are alluringly displayed for the delectation of the viewer – who is implicitly put in the position of a voyeur... Her cheeks are flushed, reddened with a blush suggesting that somehow she knows she is being watched, even though she is sleeping.&lt;ref name=AGD&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Graham-Dixon|title= ITP 266: Flaming June by Frederic Leighton |date=5 June 2005|work= Sunday Telegraph|authorlink=Andrew Graham-Dixon|url=http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/itp-266-flaming-june-by-frederic-leighton.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to art historian [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]] "her pose is loosely modelled on that of Michelangelo's famous statue of ''[[Night (Michelangelo)|Night]]'', in the Medici Tombs in Florence, which Leighton regarded as one of the supreme achievements of Western art."&lt;ref name=AGD/&gt;
The position of the sleeping woman gave Leighton a great deal of trouble. He made several preliminary sketches to determine the way in which she should lie; in particular he had difficulty making the angle of her right arm look natural. His studies show that the picture went through at least four evolutionary sketches before Leighton came to the end result. Out of these studies, four are nude and one is draped.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. T. Barringer &amp; [[Elizabeth Prettejohn|E. Prettejohn]], ''Frederic Leighton: Antiquity, Renaissance, Modernity'', Yale University Press (1999), ''s.v.'' "Flaming June".&lt;/ref&gt; The draped figure looks the least lifelike, demonstrating Leighton's need to draw from a naked model to achieve a fidelity to nature.

The toxic [[oleander]] branch in the top right possibly symbolizes the fragile link between sleep and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/leighton-frederic-flaming-june-1895-814972.html|title= Leighton, Frederic: ''Flaming June'' (1895)|work= The Independent|date=25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Flaming June'' has become Leighton's most recognisable picture. [[Samuel Courtauld (industrialist)|Samuel Courtauld]], founder of the [[Courtauld Institute]], called it “the most wonderful painting in existence”.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; The realism of the transparent material worn by the sleeping woman, the stunningly rich colours and the perfectly recreated marble surround are characteristic of Leighton's work, as is his use of natural light.  He allows the sunset in the background to appear as molten gold.&lt;ref&gt;A. Weidinger, ''Magnificent Extravagance – Frederic, Lord Leighton's Flaming June 1894–95'', [[Belvedere, Vienna|Belvedere]] (2010), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting's first owners, ''[[The Graphic]]'' magazine, bought it to create a high-quality reproduction which was given away as a Christmas gift in 1895. When Leighton died in January 1896 it was put in their office window which was passed by the funeral procession.
It was loaned to the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in early 1900s, its whereabouts after this are unknown; it was rediscovered in a Battersea home in the early 1960s, boxed in over a chimney. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] saw it soon afterwards in a shop on the Kings Road, but his grandmother refused to lend him the £50 asking price, stating: "I will not have Victorian junk in my flat".&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/20/flaming-june-frederic-lord-leighton-house-museum|work=Guardian|title= Leighton's Flaming June to go on display in studio where it was painted |date=20 June 2016|author=Maev Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 [[Luis A. Ferré]]{{snd}}the noted Puerto Rican [[industrialist]] and politician, who would be elected [[governor of Puerto Rico|governor]] five years later{{snd}}was on a trip around Europe, engaged in purchasing paintings and sculptures for the [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] in Puerto Rico, which he had founded. Passing by The Maas Gallery, London in 1963, Ferré was enthralled by the work, and offered to pay £2,000 for the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Featured Picture Details|url = http://www.maasgallery.co.uk/component/content/article/68|website = www.maasgallery.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-08-20|last = Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio Luis Ferré, the industrialist's son, many years later related that his father spent a sleepless night worried that, in the final stages of the transaction, [[Jeremy Maas]], then owner of The Maas Gallery and ''Flaming June'', would retract his offer and sell it to another buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Luis Ferré, article in ''[[El Nuevo Día]]'', 22 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferré prevailed, and ''Flaming June'' was taken to the Museo de Arte de Ponce and prominently displayed. With the renewed interest in Victorian art, it was also loaned to important exhibitions around the world. ''Flaming June'' was on display at the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid in 2008, the [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]] in Germany in 2009 and in the [[Frick Collection]] in 2015.

In 2015 an original pencil and chalk study for the painting{{snd}}the model's head{{snd}}was found on the back of a bedroom door in the mansion inherited by [[Bamber Gascoigne]] after the death of his great aunt [[Mary Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 May 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/01/pre-raphaelite-study-discovered-behind-door-in-english-mansion |title=Pre-Raphaelite study behind door in English mansion |accessdate=3 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YFK52aZ3?url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/01/pre-raphaelite-study-discovered-behind-door-in-english-mansion |archivedate=3 May 2015 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the painting was loaned to the [[Leighton House Museum]] in Kensington, and was displayed in the studio where it was created.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/arts/jimmy-page-welcomes-flaming-june-painting-back-to-kensington-a3385021.html|title=Jimmy Page welcomes Flaming June painting back to Kensington|date=2 November 2016|publisher=''Evening Standard''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/flaming-june-will-brighten-the-darkness-vfm7vfkrx|title=Flaming June will brighten the darkness|publisher=''The Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
While the body of the woman remains a mystery, there is speculation that the face is that of either of Leighton’s two favourite models in the 1890s, [[Dorothy Dene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/06/flaming-june-identity-frederic-lord-leighton-dorothy-dene|title=The Strange Journey of One of the World’s Most Famous Paintings|first=Patrick|last=Monahan|publisher=''Vanity Fair''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/11236508/Dorothy-Dene-Lord-Leightons-secret-lover.html|title=Dorothy Dene: Lord Leighton's secret lover?|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Mary Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Berk Jiminez|title=Dictionary of Artists' Models|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogFYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA593|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-95914-2|pages=593–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claphamsociety.com/Articles/Article2/original/LHS_2_PIC_9.html ''Apollo Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Lloyd was the daughter of an impoverished country squire. She came to London and established a highly successful career as an artist's model, posing only for the head and hands, and not nude – an important distinction. She started posing for Leighton in about 1892, was requested to come to pose in January 1895 for Leighton’s ''Lachrymae'' (1894–1895). She is probably also the model for his ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Twixt Hope and Fear'' (c. 1895).

'''''Flower still life with a watch''''' is a 1663 floral painting by [[Willem van Aelst]]. It is in the collection of the [[Mauritshuis]] and exhibited at the [[Prince William V Gallery|Gallery Prince Willem V]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/explore/images/7326
|title=Flower still life with a watch, 1663 gedateerd|publisher=[[RKD]]|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
This work was painted in Amsterdam where it was signed and dated ''Guill.mo van Aelst. 1663.'' Van Aelst had recently returned from Italy and thus signed as  "Guillelmo" rather than Willem. He remained in Amsterdam until his death and was a strong influence on other Amsterdam flower painters, including Rachel Ruysch.

==Description and interpretation==
The work shows a watch with a blue ribbon attached. It is not clear which watchmaker designed it. The bouquet shows [[Rosa gallica]], [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]], [[Pieris (butterfly)|Pieris]], [[Myosotis]], Gentiana, [[Viburnum opulus]], [[Tagetes lucida]], [[Tagetes patula]], [[butterfly]], [[Southern hawker|Southern Hawker]], and [[Calliphoridae]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;
The vase itself is an object created by [[Johannes Lutma]] in the [[auricular style]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

The painting follows in a tradition of Dutch and Flemish flower still life paintings showing a pocket watch attached to a blue ribbon with a wind-up key. This is one of many recurring symbols of the [[Vanitas]] genre that Van Aelst and others used:

File:Willem van Aelst - Bloemenstilleven met horloge.jpg|Willem van Aelst, 1663
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later history and influence==
The painting is one of many from the Dutch Royal collection at [[Het Loo Palace]], Apeldoorn. It is registered there as early as 1757. [[William V, Prince of Orange]] took it to The Hague for his new 1774 gallery. It was in the gallery when its contents were taken to Paris as war booty during the French occupation. It was on show in the [[Louvre]] from 1795 until 1815, whereupon it was returned.

''Hatfield Fountain'' was designed by Tom Hardy, [[Lawrence Halprin]], and Scott Stickney.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; It is named after Antoinette and [[Mark Hatfield]], a former Oregon senator and [[Willamette University]] alumnus,&lt;ref name=WU&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Tour: Hatfield Fountain|url=http://www.willamette.edu/virtual_tour/outdoors/locations/hatfield_fountain.html|publisher=[[Willamette University]]|accessdate=September 28, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012404/http://www.willamette.edu/virtual_tour/outdoors/locations/hatfield_fountain.html|archivedate=June 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was dedicated on October 13, 1989.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;  According to Willamette University, the fountain serves as a popular reference point for campus gatherings.&lt;ref name=WU/&gt; 

The ''Hatfield Fountain'' is administered by Willamette University.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; In July 1993, the fountain was surveyed and deemed as "well maintained" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program. 

== Description ==

The work features two birds set on a fountain consisting of large stones arranged in two stacks, all set in a round basin.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The concrete-and-stone fountain measures approximately {{Convert|13|ft|m}} tall and has a diameter of {{Convert|23|ft|m}}. One bird sits atop each stack; the bird on the shorter stack is set in a [[bird nest]] of rods and carrying a twig in its mouth, and the bird on the taller stack has its wings spread.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The birds are made of steel rods and cut bronze or steel sheet; one measures approximately {{Convert|3|ft|m}} x {{Convert|2|ft|m}} x {{Convert|3|ft|m}}, and another measures approximately {{Convert|5|ft|m}} x {{Convert|2|ft|m}} x {{Convert|3|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; Water flows from one of the stacks into the basin. A nearby plaque reads: {{Small|THE ANTOINETTE AND MARK O. HATFIELD / FOUNTAIN / GENEROUS GIFT / OF / CHARLES E. AND DOROTHY L.

'''Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KG|}}  (6 October 1573&amp;nbsp;– 10 November 1624), (pronunciation uncertain: {{IPAc-en|'|r|ɛ|z|l|i}} "Rezley",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stopes|1922|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|z|l|i}} "Rizely" (archaic),&lt;ref name=pms&gt;{{Harvnb|Montague-Smith|1977|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|t|s|l|i}} (present-day)&lt;ref name=pms/&gt; and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|ə|θ|s|l|i}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been suggested), was the only son of [[Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton]], and [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Mary Browne]], daughter of [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]]. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] two narrative poems, ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', were dedicated to Southampton, who is frequently identified as the [[Fair Youth]] of [[Shakespeare's Sonnets]].

==Family==
Henry Wriothesley, born 6 October 1573 at [[Cowdray House]], Sussex, was the only son of [[Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton]], by [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Mary Browne]], the only daughter of [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]]e, and his first wife, [[Jane Browne, Viscountess Montague|Jane Radcliffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had two sisters, Jane, who died before 1573, and Mary (c.1567&amp;nbsp;– 1607), who in June 1585 married [[Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=12, 27}}; {{Harvnb|Elzinga|2004}};.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father's death, Southampton's mother married firstly, on 2 May 1595, as his second wife, [[Thomas Heneage|Sir Thomas Heneage]] (d. 17 October 1595), [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household]], and secondly, between 5 November 1598 and 31 January 1599, [[William Hervey, 1st Baron Hervey|Sir William Hervey]]. She died in November 1607.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=127}}; {{Harvnb|Elzinga|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
When his father died on 4 October 1581 Southampton inherited the earldom and landed income valued at £1097 6s per annum. His wardship and marriage were sold by the [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] to her kinsman, [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham]], for £1000. According to Akrigg, Howard then "entered into some further agreement, of which no documentation can now be found, which transferred to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] personally the custody and marriage of the young Earl, but left Howard holding his lands", and late in 1581 or early in 1582 Southampton, then eight years of age, came to live at [[Cecil House]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=21–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1585, at age twelve, Southampton entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne states that he matriculated 11 December 1585.&lt;/ref&gt; graduating M.A. on 6 June 1589.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WRTY585H|name=Wriothesley, Henry, 4th Earl of Southampton}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=28, 30}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His name was entered at the [[Gray's Inn]] legal society before he left the university, and he was admitted on 29 February 1588.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=30}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1953|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Southampton's 16th birthday, 6 October 1589, Lord Burghley noted Southampton's age in his diary, and by 1590 Burghley was negotiating with Southampton's grandfather, [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu]]e, and Southampton's mother, [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Mary]], for a marriage between Southampton and Lord Burghley's eldest granddaughter, [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth Vere]], daughter of Burghley's daughter, [[Anne Cecil]], and [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].{{sfn|Honan|2012}} However the match was not to Southampton's liking, and in a letter written in November 1594, about six weeks after Southampton had turned 21, the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet]] reported the rumour that "The young Erle of Southampton refusing the Lady Veere payeth £5000 of present payment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=31–2, 39}}; {{Harvnb|Stopes|1922|pp=35–8, 86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1591 Lord Burghley's Clerk in Chancery, [[John Clapham (historian and poet)|John Clapham]], dedicated to Southampton a poem in Latin, ''Narcissus'', recounting the Greek legend of a beautiful young man who perishes through self-love. According to Akrigg, Southampton was now spending much of his time at court. He was in attendance when Queen Elizabeth visited [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in late September 1592, and was praised fulsomely in the Latin poem written by John Sandford to commemorate the Queen's visit. In October 1592 Southampton's grandfather, [[Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu|Viscount Montague]], died. Montague had been a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]], and on 3 May 1593 Philip Gawdy of [[Clifford's Inn]] (a law school and [[Inn of Chancery]]) wrote to his brother, [[Bassingbourne Gawdy (died 1606)|Bassingbourne Gawdy]], that Southampton had been nominated to the Order, together with the [[John Puckering|Lord Keeper]], [[Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh|Lord Burgh]], and [[Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Lord Willoughby de Eresby]]. Shortly thereafter, in his ''Honour of the Garter'' dated 26 June 1593, [[George Peele]] referred to him as "Gentle Wriothesley, Southampton's star", claiming erroneously that an Earl of Southampton had been among the founding Knights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=33–6}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Romilly|1879|pp=521–2}}; {{Harvnb|Dyce|1829|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However it was not until 1603 that Southampton was invested in the Order under [[James VI and I|King James]].

==Southampton and Shakespeare==
[[File:Miniature of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, 1594. (Fitzwilliam Museum) cropped.png|thumb|160px|left|Henry Wriothesley at 21]]
[[File:Dedication page of The Rape of Lucrece by William Shakespeare 1594.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Dedication (publishing)|dedication]] to Southampton of ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'', 1594]]
In 1593 [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] dedicated his narrative poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' to Southampton, followed in 1594 by ''The Rape of Lucrece''. Although the dedication to ''Venus and Adonis'' is more restrained, the dedication to ''The Rape of Lucrece'' is couched in extravagant terms: "The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end ... What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours." This type of vaunting language was not particularly unusual though, because other dedications of the day always excessively praised any noble person sponsoring the author's work &amp;ndash; mainly for political, and above all financial, reasons.

[[Nathan Drake (essayist and physician)|Nathan Drake]], in ''Shakespeare and his Times'', was the first to suggest that Southampton was not only the dedicatee of Shakespeare's two long narrative poems, but also the "Fair Youth" of the ''Sonnets''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drake|1817|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The title page refers to the "onlie begetter of these {{Not a typo|in|suing}} [[Shakespeare's Sonnets|sonnets]] Mr W.H.," and it had earlier been inferred that the ''Sonnets'' were addressed to "Mr. W.H.". Drake, however, adopting [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|Chalmers']] suggestion that one meaning of "beget" is "bring forth", argued that Mr. W.H. was merely the procurer of the manuscript rather than the "Fair Youth" addressed in the poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drake|1817|pp=58–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other adherents of the theory that Southampton was the addressee of the ''Sonnets'' have suggested that his initials, H.W. (Henry Wriothesley), were simply reversed by the publisher to conceal his identity.{{sfn|Honan|1998|p=361}} However Honan argues that although Southampton "may be involved in Shakespeare's sonnets", "there is no real likelihood that he traduced him by drawing his portrait as the fickle, treacherous Young Man of the sonnets, who is implicitly 'lascivious' (sonnet 95), 'sensual' to a 'fault' or to his 'shame' (sonnets 34, 35), and ridden with vices".{{sfn|Honan|2012}}

Despite extensive archival research, no documents have been found concerning their relationship apart from the dedications to Shakespeare's two long narrative poems. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], on the authority of poet and playwright [[William Davenant]] (1606 &amp;ndash; 7&amp;nbsp;April 1668), stated in his ''Life of Shakespeare'' that Southampton once gave Shakespeare £1000 to "go through with a purchase,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowe|first1=Nicholas|title=Some Account of the Life, &amp;c. of Mr. William Shakespear|date=1709|publisher=Jacob Tonson|location=London|page=x [i.e., Roman numeral 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Honan terms this a myth.{{sfn|Honan|2012}}

==The 1590s==
Southampton received dedications from other writers in the 1590s. On 27 June 1593 [[Thomas Nashe]] completed his [[picaresque novel]], ''[[The Unfortunate Traveller]]'', and dedicated it to Southampton,&lt;ref&gt;The dedication was withdrawn from the second edition.&lt;/ref&gt; terming him "a dere lover and cherisher . . . as well of the lovers of Poets, as of Poets themselves",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKerrow|1958|pp=252, 255}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=37–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1593 [[Barnabe Barnes]] published ''Parthenophil and Parthenope'' with a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1595 [[Gervase Markham]] included a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton in ''The Most Honorable Tragedy of Richard Grinvile, Knight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steggle|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 1596 [[Giovanni Florio|John Florio's]] Italian/English dictionary was entered in the Stationers' Register.&lt;ref&gt;It was not published until 1598.&lt;/ref&gt; In his dedication, Florio, who was for some years in the Earl's "pay and patronage", complimented Southampton on his fluency in Italian, saying he "had become so complete a master of Italian as to have no need of travel abroad to perfect his mastery of that tongue".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1597 [[Henry Lok]] included a sonnet to Southampton among the sixty dedicatory sonnets in his ''Sundry Christian Passions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=53–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton]] dedicated to him a translation of [[Achilles Tatius]]'s, ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon|Clitophon and Leucippe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 1594 Southampton's friend, [[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Sir Henry Danvers]], shot Henry Long, brother of Sir Walter Long, in the course of a local feud between the Danvers and Long families. Sir Henry and his elder brother, [[Charles Danvers|Sir Charles Danvers]], fled to [[Titchfield]], where Southampton sheltered them. The brothers were outlawed, and eventually escaped to the continent where they took refuge at the court of [[Henri IV of France|King Henri IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=41–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 1595, Southampton [[jousting|jousted]] in Queen Elizabeth's [[Accession Day tilt|accession day tournament]], earning a mention in George Peele's ''Anglorum Feriae'' as "gentle and debonaire". However, according to Akrigg, "Gentle and debonair he may have been, but we never again hear of Southampton being high in the graces of Queen Elizabeth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 1596 the Queen specifically instructed [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], not to take either Southampton or the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]],&lt;ref&gt;According to Akrigg, Southampton and Derby were "rather close friends at this period"; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with him on an expedition for the [[Siege of Calais (1596)|Relief of Calais]], and it also appears that Southampton did not accompany Essex on the [[Capture of Cádiz|Cadiz Expedition]] that summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=56–9}}; Honan states that Southampton did go with Essex to Cadiz; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1597 Southampton challenged the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] to a duel with rapiers, requiring intervention by the Queen and Privy Council, and on 1 March stood godfather at the christening of [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Sir Robert Sidney's]] daughter, Bridget. Later that year Southampton was with Essex on his "inglorious" [[Islands Voyage|Voyage to the Azores]], where according to Rowland Whyte, "My Lord of Southampton fought with one of the [[Philip II of Spain|Kings]] great Men of Warre, and suncke her". On his return he made his first appearance in the [[House of Lords]] on 5 November, and was put on several committees, but became a "chronic absentee". By this time he was in serious financial difficulties, and had turned over administration of his estates to two trustees, who by the end of the year had sold some of his lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=58, 67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598 Southampton was involved in a brawl at court with [[Ambrose Willoughby]],&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Willoughby, second son of [[Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham]], is also mentioned in a letter of 17 June 1602 from [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] to [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Sir Dudley Carleton]]: "[[Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos|Gray Bridges]] hath hurt Ambrose Willoughby in the heade and body, for abusing his father and himself at a conference of arbiterment twixt them and Mistris Bridges"; {{Harvnb|McClure|1939|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the Queen's [[esquires of the body]], who had ordered him to leave the presence chamber where he was playing at [[primero]] after the Queen had retired for the evening. Southampton struck Willoughby, and "Willoughby puld of some of his locke", for which the Queen gave Willoughby thanks, saying "he had done better yf he had sent hym to the porters lodge, to see who durst have fetcht hym out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=68}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a suggestion that underlying the altercation was something Willoughby had said which caused trouble between Southampton and his mistress, [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]], one of the Queen's [[Maid of Honour|Maids of Honour]]. The Queen forbade Southampton to present himself at court, although he was soon allowed back. Nonetheless it was reported by Rowland Whyte at the beginning of February that "My Lord of Southampton is much troubled at her Majesties straungest Usage of hym". Faced with his financial difficulties and the Queen's disfavour, Southampton determined to live abroad for a time, and seized the opportunity of accompanying [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] on an embassy to [[Henri IV of France]]. On 6 February Southampton was granted licence to travel abroad for two years, and by March he and Cecil were in [[Angers]], where on 7 March Southampton was presented to the French King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=68–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Cecil returned to England from his failed mission in April, Southampton remained at the French court, planning to travel to Italy with [[Charles Danvers|Sir Charles Danvers]] and [[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Sir Henry Danvers]], whom he had helped to escape from England in 1594 after the murder of Henry Long. At that juncture the Queen decided to pardon the Danvers brothers, and they were back in England on 30 August 1598, at which time Southampton also returned in secret, and married his pregnant mistress, [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]]. He left for the continent almost immediately, but by 3 September the Queen had learned of the marriage and consigned Elizabeth Vernon, one of her chief ladies-in-waiting, to the [[Fleet Prison]] for marrying without royal permission.

The Queen ordered Southampton to return to England forthwith, but he remained in Paris for two months, losing large sums in gambling. By the beginning of November he was back in England, also lodged in the Fleet, where he remained for a month, during which time Elizabeth Vernon gave birth to a daughter, Penelope. To add to his difficulties, Southampton was at this time involved in a dispute with his mother, the [[Mary Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Dowager Countess]], over her prospective marriage to [[William Hervey, 1st Baron Hervey|Sir William Hervey]]. [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Lord Henry Howard]] was brought in to smooth matters between mother and son, and the Countess and Hervey were wed in early January 1599.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=41–6, 69–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1599, during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1595–1603), Southampton went to [[Essex in Ireland|Ireland with Essex]], who made him General of the Horse, but the Queen insisted that the appointment be cancelled. Southampton remained on in personal attendance upon the Earl, rather than as an officer. However, Southampton was active during the campaign and prevented a defeat at the hands of the Irish rebels when his cavalry drove off an attack at [[Arklow]] in [[County Wicklow]]. Shortly after the [[Essex's Rebellion]] in February 1601, William Reynolds, a soldier who had served with Essex in Ireland in 1599, mentioned Southampton in a letter to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]]. Speaking of certain men involved in the Essex rebellion who had not yet been arrested, Reynolds wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|pp=181–2}}; {{Harvnb|Duncan-Jones|1993|pp=484–6}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Duncan-Jones, Reynolds' letter hints that 'rewards could be obtained from either or both of the two Earls in return for sexual favours'. On the other hand, Duncan-Jones concludes that Reynolds may have been a paranoid schizophrenic, and that by his own statement he had written over 200 letters to the Queen, Privy Council, and members of the clergy wherein he had "complaynid of al the abewses and vilent oppresseones &amp; sodometicall sines over flowing this land".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Duncan-Jones|1993|pp=481, 482, 484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return from Ireland, Southampton attracted notice as a playgoer. "My Lord Southampton and Lord Rutland," wrote [[Rowland Whyte]] to [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester|Sir Robert Sydney]] in 1599, "come not to the court: the one doth but very seldom. They pass away the time in London merely in going to plays every day".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1844|p=clxxiii}}; {{Harvnb|Akrigg|1968|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southampton was deeply involved in the [[Essex's Rebellion]] of 1601, and in February of that year he was sentenced to death. Cecil, who urged the Queen to show the greatest possible degree of clemency,  obtained the [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] of his penalty to [[life imprisonment]].

==Life under King James==
[[Image:HenryWriothesley 1594.jpg|thumb|200px|Southampton c.1600]]
On the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] Southampton resumed his place at court and received numerous honours from the new king. On the eve of the abortive rebellion of Essex he had induced the players at the [[Globe Theatre]] to revive ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and on his release from prison in 1603 he resumed his connection with the stage. In January 1605 he entertained [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] with a performance of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' by [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and his company, to which Shakespeare belonged, at Southampton House.&lt;ref&gt;HMC: ''Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House'', vol.16, p.415, letter of Walter Cope to Robert Cecil about Burbage.&lt;/ref&gt;

He seems to have been a born fighter, and engaged in more than one serious quarrel at court, being imprisoned for a short time in 1603 following a heated argument with Lord Grey of Wilton in front of Queen Anne. Grey, an implacable opponent of the Essex faction, was later implicated in the [[Main Plot]] and [[Bye Plot]]. Southampton was in more serious disgrace in 1621 for his determined opposition to [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]]. He was a volunteer on the [[Protestant]] side in Germany in 1614, and in 1617 he proposed to fit out an expedition against the [[Barbary pirates]].

Southampton was a leader among the Jacobean aristocrats who turned to modern investment practices&amp;nbsp;— "in industry, in modernizing their estates and in overseas trade and colonization."&lt;ref&gt;Margot Heinemann, "Rebel Lords, Popular Playwrights, and Political Culture: Notes on the Jacobean Patronage of the Earl of Southampton," in Brown;  p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He financed the first tinplate mill in the country, and founded an ironworks at [[Titchfield]]. He developed his properties in London, in [[Bloomsbury]] and [[Holborn]]; he revamped his country estates, participated in the efforts of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] and the [[New England Company]], and backed [[Henry Hudson]]'s search for the [[Northwest Passage]].

A significant artistic patron in the Jacobean as well as the Elizabethan era, Southampton promoted the work of [[George Chapman]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Thomas Heywood]], and the composer [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger]]. Heywood's popular, expansionist dramas were compatible with Southampton's maritime and colonial interests.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Heywood's ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', ''[[Fortune by Land and Sea]]'', and ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]''; Heinemann, pp. 142–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virginia Company==
[[File:Henry Wriothesley 3rd Earl of Southampton after Daniel Mytens.jpg|left|thumb|The Earl of Southampton c.1618, after a portrait by [[Daniel Mytens]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]
Henry Wriothesley, whose name is included in the 1605 panel of the [[New World Tapestry]], took a considerable share in promoting the colonial enterprises of the time, and was an active member of the [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company]]'s governing council. Although profits proved elusive, his other visions for the Colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] were eventually accomplished. He was part of a faction within the company with Sir [[Edwin Sandys (died 1629)|Edwin Sandys]], who eventually became the Treasurer, and worked tirelessly to support the struggling venture. In addition to profits, Southampton's faction sought a permanent colony which would enlarge British territory, relieve the nation's overpopulation, and expand the market for English goods. Although profits largely eluded the Virginia Company, and it was dissolved in 1624, the other goals were accomplished.

His name is thought by many to be the origin of the naming of the harbour of [[Hampton Roads]], and the [[Hampton River]]. Although named at later dates, similar attribution may involve the town (and later city) of [[Hampton, Virginia]], as well as [[Southampton County, Virginia]] and [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]]. However, the name [[Southampton]] was not uncommon in England, including an important port city and an entire region along the southern coast, which was originally part of [[Hampshire]]. There are also variations applied in other areas of the English colonies which were not part of the Virginia Company of London's efforts, making the origin of the word and derivations of it as applied in Virginia even more debatable.

==Later life and death==
In 1624 Southampton was one of four Englishmen appointed to command troops fighting in the [[Low Countries]] against the [[Spain|Spanish]]. Shortly after their arrival the earl's eldest son, [[James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley|James Wriothesley]], succumbed to a fever at Rosendael. Five days later, on 10&amp;nbsp;November 1624, Southampton died of the same cause at [[Bergen-op-Zoom]], aged&amp;nbsp;51. Both were buried in the parish church of [[Titchfield]], [[Hampshire]].

==Marriage and issue==
[[Image:Elizabeth Vernon Countess of Southampton c 1618.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elizabeth, Countess of Southampton c.&amp;nbsp;1618]]
In August&amp;nbsp;1598 Southampton secretly married [[Elizabeth Wriothesley, Countess of Southampton|Elizabeth Vernon]], the daughter of John Vernon of [[Hodnet]], Shropshire, by his wife Elizabeth Devereux. Elizabeth Devereux's grandfathers were the Viscount Hereford and the Earl of Huntingdon; on her father John's side, Elizabeth's family were more obscure.

They had several children, including:
*Penelope Wriothesley, who married [[William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton]].
*[[James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley]] (1&amp;nbsp;March 1605 &amp;ndash; 5 November 1624), who died five days before his father, of the same illness.
*[[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton]] (10&amp;nbsp;March 1607 &amp;ndash; 16&amp;nbsp;May 1667).
*Anne Wriothesley, who married [[Robert Wallop]] (20&amp;nbsp;July 1601 &amp;ndash; 19&amp;nbsp;November 1667) of Farley Wallop.

==Portraits==
There exist numerous portraits of Southampton, in which he is depicted with dark auburn hair and blue eyes, compatible with Shakespeare's description of "a man right fair." [[John Beaumont (poet)|Sir John Beaumont]] wrote a well-known elegy in his praise, and Gervase Markham wrote of him in a tract entitled ''Honor in his Perfection, or a Treatise in Commendation of ... Henry, Earl of Oxenford, Henry, Earle of Southampton, Robert, Earl of Essex'' (1624).

In 2002 a portrait in the Cobbe collection was identified as a portrait of the youthful Earl. Showing him as an androgynous-looking young man, it is now known as the Cobbe [[Cobbe portrait#Cobbe portrait of Southampton|portrait of Southampton]].&lt;ref name = "sou"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/21/artsandhumanities.highereducation| author=Anthony Holden| title= That's no lady, that's...| publisher=[[The Observer]]| date=21 April 2002| accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, a further portrait believed to be of Southampton, hidden beneath a portrait of his wife Elizabeth Vernon, was discovered when the work was X-rayed in preparation for an exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | title = X-rays uncover 'hidden portrait'  | publisher = BBC News  | date = 29 April 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7372629.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Earl has been played on screen by several different actors:
*[[Peter Egan]] in the [[BBC]] mini-series ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', 1971.
*[[Nicholas Clay]] in the TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Life of Shakespeare]]'', 1978.
*[[Eddie Redmayne]] in the [[Channel 4]] mini-series ''[[Elizabeth I (2005 miniseries)|Elizabeth I]]'', 2005.
*[[Shaun Evans]] in the mini-series ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]'', 2006.
*[[Xavier Samuel]] in the feature film ''[[Anonymous (film)|Anonymous]]'', 2011.
*Adam Harley in the sitcom ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', 2016.

'''''L'Absinthe''''' (English: '''''The Absinthe Drinker''''' or '''''Glass of Absinthe''''') is a painting by [[Edgar Degas]], painted between 1875 and 1876.&lt;ref name="Musee"&gt;{{cite web | title=Edgar Degas: In a Café | website=[[Musée d'Orsay]] | date=19 January 2016 | url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/dans-un-cafe-167.html?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=18c0b5fa01 | access-date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original title was '''''Dans un Café''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=House|first1=John|title=Impressionism: Paint and Politics|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300102402|page=124|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=vgfPzsWEVg4C&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;ots=DnW3HUY-PT&amp;dq=l'absinthe%20original%20titles&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q=l'absinthe%20original%20titles&amp;f=false|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a name often used today.&lt;ref name="Lanier2016"/&gt;

Other early titles were '''''A sketch of a French Café''''' and '''''Figures at Café'''''. Then, when exhibited in London in 1893, the title was changed to ''L'Absinthe'', the name by which the painting is now commonly known. It is in the permanent collection of the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]].

==Description==
Painted in 1875–76, the work portrays a woman and man&lt;ref name="Musee"/&gt; sitting side-by-side, drinking a glass of [[absinthe]]. They appear lethargic and lonely.&lt;ref name="Lanier2016"/&gt; The man, wearing a hat, looks to the right off the edge of the canvas, while the woman, dressed more formally in fashionable dress and hat, stares vacantly downward. A glass filled with absinthe is on the table in front of her. The models used in the painting are [[Ellen Andrée]], an actress who also appeared in [[Édouard Manet]]'s paintings ''[[Chez le père Lathuille]]'' and ''[[The Plum]]'', and [[Marcellin Desboutin]],&lt;ref name="Lanier2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lanier |title=Absinthe—The Cocaine of the Nineteenth Century: A History of the Hallucinogenic Drug and Its Effect on Artists and Writers in Europe and the United States |publisher=McFarland |year=2016 |isbn=9781476628257 |first=Doris |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FNywDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT109 |p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; a painter and engraver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ogFYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155 |p=155 |year=2013 |title=Dictionary of Artists' Models |author=Jill Berk Jiminez |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The café where they are taking their refreshment is the [[Nouvelle Athènes|Café de la Nouvelle-Athènes]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Lanier2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lanier|first=Doris|title=Absinthe--The Cocaine of the Nineteenth Century: A History of the Hallucinogenic Drug and Its Effect on Artists and Writers in Europe and the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYjNXXX_h_AC&amp;pg=PA106|date=1 January 2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786419678|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
At its first showing in 1876, the picture was panned by critics, who called it ugly and disgusting.&lt;ref name="Lanier2004"/&gt; It was put into storage until being exhibited again in 1892, but was again treated with derision.&lt;ref name="Lanier2004"/&gt; The painting was shown again at the [[Grafton Gallery]] in England in 1893, this time entitled ''L'Absinthe'', where it sparked even greater controversy.&lt;ref name="Lanier2016"/&gt; The people and the absinthe represented in the painting were considered by English critics to be shockingly degraded and uncouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/degas-sickert-and-toulouse-lautrec/degas-sickert-and-toulouse-8 |work=[[Tate Britain]] |title=L'Absinthe in focus: London and Paris 1870–1910 |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many regarded the painting as a blow to morality; this was the general view of such Victorians as Sir [[William Blake Richmond]] and [[Walter Crane]] when shown the painting in London. That reaction was typical of the age, revealing the deep suspicion with which Victorian England had regarded art in France since the early days of the [[Barbizon School]], and the desire to find a morally uplifting lesson in works of art. Many English critics viewed the picture as a warning lesson against absinthe, and the French in general. The comment by [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] on the woman depicted was: "What a [[whore]]!" He added, "the tale is not a pleasant one, but it is a lesson". However, in his book ''Modern Painting'', Moore regretted assigning a moral lesson to the work, claiming that "the picture is merely a work of art, and has nothing to do with drink or sociology."&lt;ref&gt;George Moore, ''Modern Painting'' (London: Walter Scott Publishing, 1898), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''macaroni''' (or formerly '''maccaroni''')&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]''; Compare [[fop]].&lt;/ref&gt; in mid-18th-century England was a fashionable fellow who dressed and even spoke in an outlandishly affected and [[epicene]] manner. The term pejoratively referred to a man who "exceeded the ordinary bounds of fashion"&lt;ref&gt;''The Macaroni and Theatrical Magazine'', inaugural issue, 1772, quoted in Amelia Rauser, "Hair, Authenticity, and the Self-Made Macaroni", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' '''38'''.1 (2004:101-117) ([http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/eighteenth-century_studies/v038/38.1rauser.html on-line abstract]).&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of clothes, fastidious eating, and gambling. He mixed Continental affectations with his English nature, like a practitioner of [[macaronic verse]] (which mixed English and Latin to comic effect), laying himself open to satire:
{{quote|There is indeed a kind of animal, neither male nor female, a thing of the neuter gender, lately [1770] started up among us. It is called a macaroni. It talks without meaning, it smiles without pleasantry, it eats without appetite, it rides without exercise, it wenches without passion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'', 1770, quoted in  Joseph Twadell Shipley, ''The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'' (JHU Press) 1984:143.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The macaronis were precursor to the [[dandy|dandies]], who came as a more masculine reaction to the excesses of the macaroni, far from their present connotation of effeminacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/02.htm |title=Tuxedo Style &amp; Etiquette |publisher=The Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and etymology ==

Young men who had been to Italy on the [[Grand Tour]] had developed a taste for ''maccaroni'', a type of [[pasta]] little known in England then, and so they were said to belong to the ''Macaroni Club''.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web| title= Macaroni| work= Oxford English Dictionary | accessdate=2011-01-18  | url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/111762}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would refer to anything that was fashionable or ''à la mode'' as "very maccaroni". &lt;ref&gt;Rauser 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] wrote to a friend in 1764 of "the Macaroni Club, which is composed of all the traveled young men who wear long curls and spying-glasses". {{cit|date=April 2015}} The "club" was not a formal one; the expression was particularly used to characterize [[fop]]s who dressed in high fashion with tall, powdered [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] with a [[chapeau|chapeau bras]] on top that could only be removed on the point of a sword.

The shop of engravers and printsellers [[Mary and Matthew Darly]] in the fashionable [[West End of London]] sold their sets of satirical "macaroni" caricature prints, published between 1771 and 1773. The new Darly shop became known as "the Macaroni Print-Shop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/eighteenth-century_studies/v038/38.1rauser.html |title=Amelia Faye Rauser, "Hair, Authenticity, and the Self-Made Macaroni" '&amp;#39;Eighteenth-Century Studies'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'38'&amp;#39;':1 |doi=10.1353/ecs.2004.0063 |publisher=muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian term ''maccherone'', figuratively meaning  "blockhead, fool", was not related to this British usage.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

==Examples of usage==
In 1773, [[James Boswell]] was on tour in Scotland with the stout and serious-minded essayist and lexicographer Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]], the least dandified of Londoners. Johnson was awkward in the saddle, and Boswell ribbed him: "You are a delicate Londoner; you are a maccaroni; you can't ride."&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides'', 1785, chapter 7 [http://www.gutenkarte.org/section/6018/7 available on-line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311060500/http://www.gutenkarte.org/section/6018/7 |date=2007-03-11 }}; he liked it well enough to repeat it in his ''Life of Dr. Johnson.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1773), a misunderstanding is discovered and young Marlow finds that he has been mistaken; he cries out, "So then, all's out, and I have been damnably imposed on. O, confound my stupid head, I shall be laughed at over the whole town. I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the print-shops. The Dullissimo Maccaroni. To mistake this house of all others for an inn, and my father's old friend for an innkeeper!"

The song "[[Yankee Doodle]]" from the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]] mentions a man who "stuck a feather in his hat and called it macaroni." Dr. Richard Shuckburgh was a British surgeon and also the author of the song's lyrics; the joke which he was making was that the Yankees were naive enough to believe that a feather in the hat was a sufficient mark of a macaroni. Whether or not these were alternative lyrics sung in the British army, they were enthusiastically taken up by the [[Yankee]]s themselves.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Yankee Doodle#Variations and parodies|Yankee Doodle variations and parodies]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Men at Birth''''' is an award-winning book from [[Australian]] writer [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]].

The book is an edited [[anthology]] of [[childbirth|birth]] experiences, written by men.  The experiences described are diverse, ranging from [[caesarean]] births and [[Vaginal Birth After Caesarean|VBAC]] births, to births that take place at [[homebirth|home]] and in a [[birth centre]] or [[labour ward]].

[[Steve Biddulph]] stated:

:: ''On a big journey into the unknown, you need people who have been there, who know the practicalities, as well as the emotions, new and strange, that go with it.  This book of men telling the stories of their children's births is a gift; an unbelievable resource with more trust, honesty and helpful information than you might find in a hundred years of conversations.''

The book has caused some controversy with its view that men who are poorly prepared for birth should not attend the birth of their child, as it may make the birth more difficult for the woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Dads at Delivery'', in "Pregnancy and Birth", July/Aug 2007, p33, E-Map Publishing, Sydney, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.women24.com/Fairlady/Display/FLYArticleTease/0,,806_18735,00.html ''Should Dads be in the Delivery Room?'' in ''Fairlady'' May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/stories/s2299142.htm ''Unleashed - Men at Birth'' - ABC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2007 ''Men at Birth'' was the winner of the [[ACT Writing and Publishing Awards]] for Best Non-fiction Book of the Year. The award was made by [[Jon Stanhope]].&lt;ref&gt;''Canberra Times'', 14 Dec 2007, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Noite na Taverna''''' (in {{lang-en|A Night in the Tavern}}) is a [[short story]] collection written by [[Brazil]]ian [[Ultra-Romanticism|Ultra-Romantic]] author [[Álvares de Azevedo]] under the pen name '''Job Stern'''. It was published posthumously, in [[1855 in literature|1855]]; three years after Azevedo's death. The book is structured as a frame story containing five tales (as well as a prologue and an epilogue, thus totaling seven chapters) told by a group of five men sheltering in a [[tavern]]. It is one of the most popular and influential works of [[Gothic fiction]] in Brazilian literature.

It is said that the book was largely inspired by [[Spain|Spanish]] author [[José Cadalso]]'s 1790 work ''Noches lúgubres''.

==Plot==

===Chapter 1: "Uma Noite do Século"===
The first chapter of the book, "Uma Noite do Século" ("A Night of the Century"), introduces its setting – a tavern in an undisclosed location filled with prostitutes, drunkards and libertines. At a nearby table, influenced by the alcohol, a group of five friends – Solfieri, Bertram, Gennaro, Claudius Hermann and Johann – decide to share with each other certain events of their lives. The five tales have, in common, aspects such as unsuccessful love stories, [[cannibalism]], [[murder]]s, [[sexual violence]], [[Alcoholism|heavy drinking]], among others.

===Chapter 2: "Solfieri"===
When in [[Rome]], on a rainy night, Solfieri sees a shadow crying over a window. He realizes it is a beautiful woman. She leaves the house and Solfieri decides to follow her, and they ultimately arrive at a nearby cemetery. There, the woman cries, kneeling before a headstone, as Solfieri falls asleep watching her from afar.

One year later, Solfieri, wandering the streets of Rome after taking part in an [[orgy]], ends into a church inadvertently. He sees a coffin and, after listening to breathing noises inside, opens it, and sees the cemetery lady he met the year before inside it. After realizing that she is still alive (but in a [[catalepsy|catalepsic]] state), he carries her through the city. Arriving at his home, the woman dies two days later, of a very high fever. Solfieri buries her under the floorboards of his bedroom and pays a sculptor for a statuette built in the woman's likeness.

===Chapter 3: "Bertram"===
Bertram tells the story of his ill-fated love for a [[Spain|Spanish]] woman from [[Cádiz]], named Angela. Amidst their romance, Bertram's sick father, living in [[Denmark]], calls for him. He goes, returning two years later; however, during the time he was away, Angela marries another man, having a son with him. Despite this, Bertram tries to maintain his affair with her, but Angela's husband finds out everything. Before her husband kills her, she kills him and her child, and flees with Bertram.

One day, without further explanations, she leaves him. Bertram sinks into despair as he tries to forget Angela; subdued by woe, he faints in the middle of a street and is run over by a chariot. The passengers of the chariot, an old man and his 18-year-old daughter, help him and take him to their mansion so he can recover. Bertram gets in love with the lady and they flee together, but he ultimately gets bored with her and sells the lady to a pirate in a card game. Later, he would learn that the girl poisoned the pirate and threw herself in the sea.

Having moved to [[Italy]], Bertram decides to kill himself there, but when he is about to do it, he is saved by a sailor whom he kills unintentionally. Bertram spends some time in the sailor's ship (a [[corvette]]), where he gets in love with the [[Captain (naval)|captain]]'s wife, being requited.

In the midst of this affair, the ship is attacked by pirates and sinks, but not without making the other one sink too. The captain, his wife, Bertram and two other unnamed sailors are able to save themselves in a [[raft]]. Some time later, with no water or food, the two unnamed sailors being washed out by the sea, the three lot in order to discover who will be killed and serve as food for the others. The chosen one is the captain, but he does not accept his fate and fights for his life. He loses the fight however, and Bertram and the woman are obligated to eat him because of the lack of food, maintaining themselves for two days.

Arriving at a beach, both already weakened by hunger, the woman asks Bertram for a last moment of love before her death. Afraid of dying, Bertram strangles her and lives at the beach in complete solitude until he is found by a British [[brig]] that rescues him.

===Chapter 4: "Gennaro"===
The painter Gennaro reminisces of when he was the young apprentice of the famous Godofredo Walsh. Walsh had a young, beautiful wife named Nauza (whom Gennaro loved) and a young, beautiful daughter named Laura (who loved Gennaro). One day, Laura gets pregnant of Gennaro, but when she proposes marriage to him, he declines. Displeased, she gradually sinks into [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and dies, taking the baby with her.

The old painter, not knowing anything, visits his daughter's bedroom every night and, because of this, Gennaro starts sleeping with his wife. However, the painter is able to make Gennaro confess everything in a certain night. Days later, Godofredo takes Gennaro to a cliff and tries to kill him; however, he survives the fall and decides to return to Godofredo's house – initially planning to apologize, but later he changes his mind and decides to take his revenge on the painter and murder him. However, when he arrives at the painter's house, he finds both Nauza and Godofredo dead.

===Chapter 5: "Claudius Hermann"===
Claudius Hermann, an assiduous [[gambling|gambler]], spots the beautiful Duchess Eleonora at a [[horse racing|horse race]] and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets her once more in a [[theatre]] later on, and during an entire week he [[stalking|stalks]] her.

In a certain night, he [[bribery|bribes]] one of the duchess' lackeys for permission to enter her house for an hour, and also obtains a copy of her bedroom's keys. He puts [[sedative]] in the duchess' wine and has sex with her, returning for many nights.

One day, however, her husband, [[Duke]] Maffio, inadvertently drinks some of the sedative as well. Desperate and afraid of being caught, Claudius plans to kill him, but changes his mind and kidnaps Eleonora instead while she is still sleeping. Arriving in an [[inn]], she wakes up, and Claudius tells her everything, forcing her to stay with him. Optionless, she accepts.

Some days later, Claudius has to leave in order to take care of some affairs; when he returns home, he finds the duchess and her husband dead.

===Chapter 6: "Johann"===
Johann's story begins in a different tavern, located in [[Paris]]. He was playing a game of [[Carom billiards|carambole]] with a blond-haired man named Arthur. Johann was losing the game, while Arthur only needed to score one point to win. When it is Johann's turn to play, Arthur bumps into the table (accidentally or not), detouring Johann's ball, thus making him lose the game. Infuriated, he defies Arthur to a duel, which he accepts. They stop at a [[hotel]] to get the guns, and the blond man writes two letters. They head to a deserted and dark street. In there, they choose their guns – but only one is loaded.

They shoot. It is revealed that Johann's gun was the loaded one, and Arthur, before supposedly dying, hands Johann the letters he wrote. The first letter is addressed to Arthur's mother, and the other one is addressed to his girlfriend; he also hands Johann her address and an engagement ring. Pretending to be Arthur, Johann then decides to steal his girlfriend.

In the morning after they sleep together, Johann is attacked by a mysterious man. After a short struggle, he kills the man. However, after a close inspection, he discovers that the man he killed was his own brother, and Arthur's girlfriend was his sister.

===Chapter 7: "Último Beijo de Amor"===
In the last chapter, "Último Beijo de Amor" ("Last Love Kiss"), the orgy ends; everyone is sleeping. A mysterious hooded figure walks into the tavern and kills Johann, and then heads toward a man named Arnold.

The figure is revealed to be Giorgia, Johann's sister, and Arnold is actually Arthur (who was saved by a passerby after the duel) under a false name. Giorgia reveals to Arthur that she wanted to get her revenge on Johann, and having done so, the honor Johann stole from her when they slept together is finally restored.

After exchanging some love words with Arthur, both decide to commit suicide.

==Adaptations==

{{Literature}}
A '''novel''' is a relatively long work of [[narrative]] [[fiction]], normally in [[prose]], which is typically published as a [[book]].

The entire [[genre]] has been seen as having "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years",&lt;ref name="The True Story of the Novel"&gt;Margaret Anne Doody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBYU6jyA3MUC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The True Story of the Novel'']. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996, rept. 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with its origins in classical [[Classical Greece|Greece]] and [[Classical Rome|Rome]], in [[medieval]] and early [[Modern history|modern]] [[Chivalric romance|romance]], and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance [[novella]]. (Since the 18th century, the term "novella", or "novelle" in German, has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long [[short story]] or a short novel.)

Murasaki Shikibu's ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' (1010) has been described as the world's first novel. Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of [[Four Great Classical Novels|classical Chinese novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). Parallel European developments occurred after the [[Spread of the printing press|invention of the printing press]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes]], author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European [[novelist]] of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1995"&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature''.  Kathleen Kuiper, ed. 1995. Merriam-Webster, Springfield, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957), suggested that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century.

[[Walter Scott]] made a distinction between the novel, in which (as he saw it) "events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society" and the '''romance''', which he defined as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.&amp;nbsp;129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;xxv. Romance should not be confused with [[Harlequin Romance]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, many such romances, including the [[Historical novel|historical romances]] of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning, pp.&amp;nbsp;xxv–xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''&lt;ref name="Moers, Ellen 1978"&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers''[1976] (London: The Women’s Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick] Robert McCrum, "The Hundred best novels: Moby Dick", ''The Observer'', Sunday 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". This sort of romance is in turn different from the [[genre fiction]] love romance or [[romance novel]]. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''."&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining the genre==
[[File:Madame de Pompadour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Madame de Pompadour]] spending her afternoon with a book ([[François Boucher]], 1756)]]
A novel is a long, fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences. The novel in the [[modern era]] usually makes use of a literary prose style. The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in [[printing]], and the introduction of cheap paper in the 15th century.

The present English (and Spanish) word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''novella'' for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the [[Latin]] ''novella'', a singular noun use of the neuter plural of ''novellus'', diminutive of ''novus'', meaning "new".&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Online Encyclopedia'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110453/novel] accessed 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most European languages use the word "romance" (as in French, Dutch, Russian, Slovene, [[Serbo-Croatian]], Romanian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian "roman"; Finnish "romaani"; German "Roman"; Portuguese "romance" and Italian "romanzo") for extended narratives.
* A fictional narrative
[[Fiction]]ality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from [[historiography]]. However this can be a problematic criterion. Throughout the [[early modern period]] authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion. Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history.
* Literary prose
While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel, the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of southern France, especially those by [[Chrétien de Troyes]] (late 12th century), and in [[Middle English]] ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s (c. 1343 – 1400) ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Doody (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;18–3, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 19th century, fictional narratives in verse, such as [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1824), [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin|Yevgeniy Onegin]]'' (1833), and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856), competed with prose novels. [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[The Golden Gate (Vikram Seth novel)|The Golden Gate]]'' (1986), composed of 590 [[Onegin stanza]]s, is a more recent example of the verse novel.&lt;ref&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Content: intimate experience
Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe, prose fiction created intimate reading situations. On the other hand, verse epics, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]'', had been recited to a select audiences, though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters. A new world of individualistic fashion, personal views, intimate feelings, secret anxieties, "conduct", and "gallantry" spread with novels and the associated prose-romance.
* Length
The novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the [[novella]]. However, in the 17th century, critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible.The requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the "totality of life."&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]] ''The Theory of the Novel. A historico-philosophical essay on the forms of great epic literature'' [first German edition 1920], transl. by Anna Bostock (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early novels==

[[File:Tosa Mitsuoki—Portrait of Murasaki Shikibu.jpg|thumb|Paper as the essential carrier: [[Murasaki Shikibu]] writing her ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' in the early 11th century, 17th-century depiction]]
Although early forms of the novel are to be found in a number of places, including [[classical Rome]], 10th– and 11th-century Japan, and [[Elizabethan England]], the European novel is often said to have begun with ''[[Don Quixote]]'' in 1605.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1995" /&gt;

Early works of extended fictional prose, or novels, include works in [[Latin]] like the ''[[Satyricon]]'' by [[Petronius Arbiter|Petronius]] (c. 50 AD), and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] (c. 150 AD), works in [[Ancient Greek]] such as ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Longus]] (c. late second century AD), works in [[Sanskrit]] such as the 6th– or 7th-century ''[[Daśakumāracarita]]'' by [[Daṇḍin]], and in the 7th-century ''[[Kadambari]]'' by [[Banabhatta]], [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s 11th-century Japanese work ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', the 12th-century ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (or ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the 17th-century Latin title) by [[Ibn Tufail]], who wrote in [[Arabic]], the 13th-century ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'' by [[Ibn al-Nafis]], another Arabic novelist, and ''[[Blanquerna]]'', written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] by [[Ramon Llull]] (1283), and the 14th-century Chinese ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Jeffrey|title=Longus: Daphnis and Chloe; Xenophon of Ephesus: Anthia and Habrocomes|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press: Loeb Classical Library|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674996335|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murasaki Shikibu's ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' (1010) has been described as the world's first novel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581365/The-Tale-of-Genji "The Tale of Genji"]  Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Japanese''. Reischauer, Edwin O. Belknap Press.  Cambridge, MA 1980. p.&amp;nbsp;49. {{ISBN|0674471784}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and shows essentially all the qualities for which [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]]'s novel ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'' (1678) has been praised: individuality of perception, an interest in character development, and psychological observation.&lt;ref&gt;''Identity in Asian Literature'' edited by Lisbeth Littrup. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization and the spread of printed books in [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) China led to the evolution of oral storytelling into fictional [[Four Great Classical Novels|novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). Parallel European developments did not occur until after the invention of the printing press by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1439, and the rise of the publishing industry over a century later allowed for similar opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/printing-press | title=Printing press &amp;#124; History &amp; Types}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Ibn Tufail's ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'' and Ibn al-Nafis' ''Theologus Autodidactus'' are works of didactic philosophy and theology. In this sense, ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'' would be considered an early example of a [[philosophical novel]],&lt;ref name=Jon&gt;Jon Mcginnis, ''Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources'', p.&amp;nbsp;284, [[Hackett Publishing Company]], {{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Attar&gt;[[Samar Attar]], ''The Vital Roots of European Enlightenment: Ibn Tufayl's Influence on Modern Western Thought'', Lexington Books, {{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Theologus Autodidactus'' would be considered an early theological novel.&lt;ref name=Meyerhof&gt;[[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1974), "''The Theologus Autodidactus of Ibn at-Nafis'' by Max Meyerhof, Joseph Schacht", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''94''' (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34. {{doi|10.2307/600915}}. {{JSTOR|600915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'', with its story of a human outcast surviving on an island, is also likely to have influenced [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), because the work was available in an English edition in 1711.&lt;ref&gt;''The Improvement of Human Reason, exhibited in the life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan: written in Arabic above 500 Years ago, by Abu Jaafar Ebn Tophail'' [...] ''newly translated from the original Arabick, by Simon Ockley'' (London: W. Bray, 1711).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epic poetry]] exhibits some similarities with the novel, and the Western tradition of the novel reaches back into the field of verse epics, though again not in an unbroken tradition. The epics of Asia, such as the [[Sumer]]ian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (1300–1000 BC), and [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' (400 BCE and 200 CE), and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (4th century BC) were as unknown in [[early modern Europe]] as was the [[Anglo-Saxon]] epic of ''[[Beowulf]]'' (c. 750–1000 AD), which was rediscovered in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Other non-European works, such as the [[Torah]], the [[Koran]], and the [[Bible]], are full of stories, and thus have also had a significant influence on the development of prose narratives, and therefore the novel. Then at the beginning of the 18th century, French prose translations brought Homer's works to a wider public, who accepted them as forerunners of the novel.

Classical Greek and Roman prose narratives&lt;ref name="Morgan &amp; Stoneman"&gt;John Robert Morgan, Richard Stoneman, ''Greek fiction: the Greek novel in context'' (Routledge, 1994), Gareth L. Schmeling, and Tim Whitmarsh (hrsg.) ''The Cambridge companion to the Greek and Roman novel'' (Cambridge University Press 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; included a didactic strand, with the philosopher [[Plato]]'s (c. 425 – c. 348 BC) dialogues; a satirical dimension with [[Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]''; the incredible stories of [[Lucian of Samosata]]; and [[Lucius Apuleius]]' proto-[[picaresque]] ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', as well as the heroic romances of the Greeks [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]] and [[Longus]]. Longus is the author of the Greek novel, ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' (2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="Morgan &amp; Stoneman" /&gt;

==Medieval period 1100–1500==

===Chivalric Romances===
{{Main|Chivalric romance}}
[[File:Chaucer Troilus frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] reciting ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'': early-15th-century manuscript of the work at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]]]
Romance or chivalric romance is a type of [[narrative]] in [[prose]] or [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] popular in the aristocratic circles of [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]]. They were marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[knight-errant]] with [[hero]]ic qualities, who undertakes a [[quest]], yet it is "the emphasis on heterosexual love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and other kinds of [[epic poetry|epic]], which involve heroism."&lt;ref&gt;"Chivalric romance", in Chris Baldick, ed., ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]].

Originally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose.

The shift from verse to prose dates from the early 13th century. The ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' or ''Vulgate Cycle'' includes passages from that period. This collection indirectly led to [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' of the early 1470s. Prose became increasingly attractive because it enabled writers to associate popular stories with serious histories traditionally composed in prose, and could also be more easily translated.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Caxton]]'s preface to his 1485 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[Satire|satiric]] or [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history, but by about 1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously [[burlesque]]d them in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605). Still, [[Medievalism|the modern image of medieval]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word "medieval" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and such tropes.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;9 {{ISBN|0521477352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1800, the connotations of "romance" was modified with the development [[Gothic fiction]].

===The novella===
{{Main|Novella}}

The term "novel" originates from the production of short stories, or [[novella]] that remained part of a European oral culture of storytelling into the late 19th century. Fairy tales, jokes, and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation, and the [[exemplum]] a priest would insert in a sermon belong into this tradition. Written collections of such stories circulated in a wide range of products from practical compilations of examples designed for the use of clerics to compilations of various stories such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (1386–1400). The ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) was a compilation of one hundred [[novelle]] told by ten people—seven women and three men—fleeing the [[Black Death]] by escaping from [[Florence]] to the Fiesole hills, in 1348.

==Renaissance period: 1500–1700==

The modern distinction between history and fiction did not exist in the early sixteenth century and the grossest improbabilities pervade many historical accounts found in the early modern print market. [[William Caxton]]'s 1485 edition of [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (1471) was sold as a true history, though the story unfolded in a series of magical incidents and historical improbabilities. [[Sir John Mandeville]]'s ''Voyages'', written in the 14th century, but circulated in printed editions throughout the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;The [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] notes 29 editions published between 1496 and 1785 [http://estc.bl.uk/F/YMU7APITB3P8CLP4R6J16RSRKXTRGRN9HE79F36U1UPQP8QVU9-05108?func=short-sort&amp;set_number=093136&amp;sort_option=01---A02---A ESTC search result]&lt;/ref&gt; was filled with natural wonders, which were accepted as fact, like the one-footed Ethiopians who use their extremity as an umbrella against the desert sun. Both works eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction.

In the 16th and 17th centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction. The invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of [[chapbooks]]. The more elegant production of this genre by 17th- and 18th-century authors were ''[[belles lettres]]—''that is, a market that would be neither low nor academic. The second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction, the Spanish ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', by García Montalvo. However, it was not accepted as an example of ''belles lettres''. The ''Amadis'' eventually became the archetypical romance, in contrast with the modern novel which began to be developed in the 17th century.

===Chapbooks===
{{Main|Chapbook}}
A chapbook is an early type of [[popular literature]] printed in [[early modern Europe]]. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]]. The tradition arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries and Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tracts]].&lt;ref name=mit.edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapbooks: Definition and Origins|url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.418/www/nhausman/chap1.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chapbook" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are ''[[bibliothèque bleue]]'' (blue book) and ''[[Volksbuch]]'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[chapmen]]'', chap, a variety of [[peddler]], which folks circulated such literature as part of their stock.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Margaret Spufford|last=Spufford|first=Margaret |date=1984|title= The Great Reclothing of Rural England|publisher= Hambledon Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0907628477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Leitch, R. |date=1990|title='Here Chapman Billies Take Their Stand': A Pilot Study of Scottish Chapmen, Packmen and Pedlars|work=Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquarians 120|pages= 173–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal historical subject matter of chapbooks was abridgements of ancient historians, popular medieval histories of knights, stories of comical heroes, religious legends, and collections of jests and fables.&lt;ref&gt;See Rainer Schöwerling, ''Chapbooks. Zur Literaturgeschichte des einfachen Lesers. Englische Konsumliteratur 1680–1840'' (Frankfurt, 1980), [[Margaret Spufford]], ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories. Pleasant Fiction and its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (London, 1981) and Tessa Watt, ''Cheap Print and Popular Piety 1550–1640'' (Cambridge, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The new printed books reached the households of urban citizens and country merchants who visited the cities as traders. Cheap printed histories were, in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially popular among apprentices and younger urban readers of both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;See Johann Friedrich Riederer German satire on the widespread reading of novels and romances: "Satyra von den Liebes-Romanen", in: ''Die abentheuerliche Welt in einer Pickelheerings-Kappe'', vol. 2 (Nürnberg, 1718). [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1718-liebes-romane.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early modern market, from the 1530s and 1540s, divided into low [[chapbooks]] and high market expensive, fashionable, elegant [[belles lettres]]. The ''[[Amadis]]'' and [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' were important publications with respect to this divide. Both books specifically addressed the new customers of popular histories, rather than readers of ''belles lettres''. The Amadis was a multi–volume fictional history of style, that aroused a debate about style and elegance as it became the first best-seller of popular fiction. On the other hand, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', while it adopted the form of modern popular history, in fact satirized that genre's stylistic achievements. The division, between low and high literature, became especially visible with books that appeared on both the popular and ''belles lettres'' markets in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries: low  chapbooks included abridgments of books such as [[Miguel Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605/1615)

The term "chapbook" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"/&gt;

===Heroic romances===
{{main|Heroic romances|17th-century French literature}}
Heroic Romance is a genre of imaginative literature, which flourished in the 17th century, principally in France.

The beginnings of modern fiction in France took a pseudo-[[bucolic]] form, and the celebrated ''[[L'Astrée]]'', (1610) of [[Honore d'Urfe]] (1568–1625), which is the earliest French novel, is properly styled a [[pastoral]]. Although its action was, in the main, languid and sentimental, there was a side of the Astree which encouraged that extravagant love of glory, that spirit of " panache", which was now rising to its height in France. That spirit it was which animated [[Marin le Roy de Gomberville]] (1603–1674), who was the inventor of what have since been known as the Heroical Romances. In these there was experienced a violent recrudescence of the old medieval elements of romance, the impossible valour devoted to a pursuit of the impossible beauty, but the whole clothed in the language and feeling and atmosphere of the age in which the books were written. In order to give point to the [[chivalrous]] actions of the heroes, it was always hinted that they were well-known public characters of the day in a romantic disguise.

===Satirical romances===
[[File:Richard Head 1666.png|left|thumb|[[Richard Head]], ''The English Rogue'' (1665)]]
Stories of witty cheats were an integral part of the European novella with its tradition of [[fabliaux]]. Significant examples include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' (1510), ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' (1554), [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]'s ''[[Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus|Simplicissimus Teutsch]]'' (1666–1668) and in England [[Richard Head]]'s ''The English Rogue'' (1665). The tradition that developed with these titles focused on a hero and his life. The adventures led to satirical encounters with the real world with the hero either becoming the pitiable victim or the rogue who exploited the vices of those he met.

A second tradition of satirical romances can be traced back to [[Heinrich Wittenwiler]]'s ''Ring'' (c. 1410) and to [[François Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532–1564), which parodied and satirized heroic romances, and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque. Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1606/1615) modified the satire of romances: its hero lost contact with reality by reading too many romances in the Amadisian tradition.

Other important works of the tradition are [[Paul Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (1651–57), the anonymous French ''Rozelli'' with its satire on Europe's religions, [[Alain-René Lesage]]'s ''[[Gil Blas]]'' (1715–1735), [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), and [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' (1773, printed posthumously in 1796).&lt;ref&gt;Compare also: Günter Berger, ''Der komisch-satirische Roman und seine Leser. Poetik, Funktion und Rezeption einer niederen Gattung im Frankreich des 17. Jahrhunderts'' (Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitätsverlag, 1984), Ellen Turner Gutiérrez ''The reception of the picaresque in the French, English, and German traditions'' (P. Lang, 1995), and Frank Palmeri, ''Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815'' (University of Delaware Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Histories===
[[File:1719-heathcot-robinson-crusoe.png|thumb|1719 newspaper reprint of ''Robinson Crusoe'']]
A market of literature in the modern sense of the word, that is a separate market for fiction and poetry, did not exist until the late seventeenth century. All books were sold under the rubric of "History and politicks" in the early 18th century, including [[pamphlet]]s, [[memoir]]s, [[travel literature]], political analysis, serious histories, romances, poetry, and novels.

That fictional histories shared the same space with academic histories and modern journalism had been criticized by historians since the end of the Middle Ages: fictions were "lies" and therefore hardly justifiable at all. The climate, however, changed in the 1670s.

The romance format of the quasi–historical works of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], [[César Vichard de Saint-Réal]],&lt;ref&gt;See his ''Dom Carlos, nouvelle histoire'' (Amsterdam, 1672) and the recent dissertation by Chantal Carasco, ''Saint-Réal, romancier de l'histoire: une cohérence esthéthique et morale'' (Nantes, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Lombard, ''Courtilz de Sandras et la crise du roman à la fin du Grand Siècle'' (Paris: PUF, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]], allowed the publication of histories that dared not risk an unambiguous assertion of their truth. The literary market-place of the late 17th and early 18th century employed a simple pattern of options whereby fictions could reach out into the sphere of true histories. This permitted its authors to claim they had published fiction, not truth, if they ever faced allegations of libel.

Prefaces and title pages of 17th– and early 18th-century fiction acknowledged this pattern: histories could claim to be romances, but threaten to relate true events, as in the ''[[Roman à clef]]''. Other works could, conversely, claim to be factual histories, yet earn the suspicion that they were wholly invented. A further differentiation was made between private and public history: [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' was, within this pattern, neither a "romance" nor a "novel". It smelled of romance, yet the preface stated that it should most certainly be read as a true private history.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe, [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1719-robinson-crusoe/p-iii.html ''Robinson Crusoe''] (London: W. Taylor, 1719)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cervantes and the modern novel===
{{See also|Picaresque novel}}

The rise of the novel as an alternative to the romance began with the publication of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Novelas ejemplares|Novelas Exemplares]]'' (1613). It continued with [[Paul Scarron|Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (the first part of which appeared in 1651), whose heroes noted the rivalry between French romances and the new Spanish genre.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Scarron, ''The Comical Romance'', Chapter XXI. "Which perhaps will not be found very Entertaining" (London, 1700) with its call for the new genre. [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/library/e-1700-0002.html#c21 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 17th-century critics looked back on the history of prose fiction, proud of the generic shift that had taken place, leading towards the modern novel/novella.&lt;ref&gt;See [Du Sieur,] "Sentimens sur l'histoire" in: ''Sentimens sur les lettres et sur l'histoire, avec des scruples sur le stile'' (Paris: C. Blageart, 1680) [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1683-1712-novels.html online edition] and Camille Esmein's ''Poétiques du roman. Scudéry, Huet, Du Plaisir et autres textes théoriques et critiques du XVIIe siècle sur le genre romanesque'' (Paris, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The first perfect works in French were those of Scarron and [[Madame de La Fayette]]'s "Spanish history" ''Zayde'' (1670). The development finally led to her ''[[La Princesse de Clèves|Princesse de Clèves]]'' (1678), the first novel with what would become characteristic French subject matter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Europe witnessed the generic shift in the titles of works in French published in Holland, which supplied the international market and English publishers exploited the novel/romance controversy in the 1670s and 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Robert Letellier|Robert Ignatius Letellier]], ''The English novel, 1660–1700: an annotated bibliography'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary critics listed the advantages of the new genre: brevity, a lack of ambition to produce epic poetry in prose; the style was fresh and plain; the focus was on modern life, and on heroes who were neither good nor bad.&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to ''The Secret History of Queen Zarah'' (Albigion, 1705)– the English version of Abbe Bellegarde, "Lettre à une Dame de la Cour, qui lui avoit demandé quelques Reflexions sur l'Histoire" in: ''Lettres curieuses de littérature et de morale'' (La Haye: Adrian Moetjens, 1702) [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1683-1712-novels.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel's potential to become the medium of urban gossip and scandal fuelled the rise of the novel/novella. Stories were offered as allegedly true recent histories, not for the sake of scandal but strictly for the moral lessons they gave. To prove this, fictionalized names were used with the true names in a separate key. The ''[[Mercure Gallant]]'' set the fashion in the 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;DeJean, Joan. ''The Essence of Style: How the French Invented Fashion, Fine Food, Chic Cafés, Style, Sophistication, and Glamour'' (New York: Free Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Collections of letters and memoirs appeared, and were filled with the intriguing new subject matter and the [[epistolary novel]] grew from this and led to the first full blown example of scandalous fiction in [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' (1684/ 1685/ 1687). Before the rise of the literary novel, reading novels had only been a form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, William B.

However, one of the earliest English novels, [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), has elements of the romance, unlike these novels, because of its exotic setting and story of survival in isolation. ''Crusoe'' lacks almost all of the elements found in these new novels: wit, a fast narration evolving around a group of young fashionable urban heroes, along with their intrigues, a scandalous moral, gallant talk to be imitated, and a brief, conciseness plot.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The new developments did, however, lead to [[Eliza Haywood]]'s epic length novel, ''Love in Excess'' (1719/20) and to [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1741).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some literary historians date the beginning of the English novel with Richardson's ''Pamela'', rather than ''Crusoe.''&lt;ref name="asj.upd.edu.ph"&gt;Cevasco, George A.

==18th century novels==
{{main|Augustan prose}}

The idea of the "rise of the novel" in the 18th century is especially associated with [[Ian Watt]]'s influential study ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Watt's, ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'' (London, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2018}} In Watt's conception, a rise in fictional realism during the 18th century came to distinguish the novel from earlier prose narratives.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Novel'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1963), p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1769 Laurence Sterne Tristram Shandy v6 p70.jpg|thumb|[[Laurence Sterne]], ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', vol.6, pp.&amp;nbsp;70–71 (1769)]]

===Philosophical novel===
{{main|Philosophical fiction}}
The rising status of the novel in 18th-century can be seen in the development of philosophical&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jonathan Israel|Jonathan Irvine Israel]], ''Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;591–599, Roger Pearson, ''The fables of reason: a study of Voltaire's "Contes philosophiques"'' (Oxford University Press 1993), Dena Goodman, ''Criticism in action: Enlightenment experiments in political writing'' ([[Cornell University Press]] 1989), Robert Francis O'Reilly, ''The Artistry of Montesquieu's Narrative Tales'' (University of Wisconsin., 1967), and René Pomeau and Jean Ehrard, ''De Fénelon à Voltaire'' (Flammarion, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[experimental novel]]s.

Philosophical fiction was not exactly new. [[Plato]]'s dialogues were embedded in fictional narratives and his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is an early example of a [[Utopia]]. The tradition of works of fiction that were also philosophical texts continued with [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) and [[Tommaso Campanella]]'s ''[[The City of the Sun|City of the Sun]]'' (1602). However, the actual tradition of the [[philosophical novel]] came into being in the 1740s with new editions of More's work under the title ''Utopia: or the happy republic; a philosophical romance'' (1743).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Voltaire]] wrote in this genre in ''[[Micromégas|Micromegas: a comic romance, which is a biting satire on philosophy, ignorance, and the self-conceit of mankind]]'' (1752, English 1753). His ''[[Zadig]]'' (1747) and ''[[Candide]]'' (1759) became central texts of the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and of the modern novel.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

An example of the [[experimental novel]] is [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759–1767), with its rejection of continuous narration.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tristram-Shandy].&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author not only addresses readers in his preface but speaks directly to them in his fictional narrative. In addition to Sterne's narrative experiments, there has visual experiments, such as a marbled page, a black page to express sorrow, and a page of lines to show the plot lines of the book. The novel as a whole focuses on the problems of language, with constant regard to [[John Locke]]'s theories in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=griffin&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Robert J. |year=1961 |title=Tristram Shandy and Language |journal=College English |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=108–12|jstor=372959 |doi=10.2307/372959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The romance genre in the 18th century===
[[File:Richardson pamela 1741.jpg|left|thumb|[[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' (1741)]]

The rise of the word novel at the cost of its rival, the romance, remained a Spanish and English phenomenon, and though readers all over Western Europe had welcomed the novel(la) or short history as an alternative in the second half of the 17th century, only the English and the Spanish had, however, openly discredited the romance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

But the change of taste was brief and [[François Fénelon|Fénelon's]] ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) already exploited a nostalgia for the old romances with their heroism and professed virtue. [[Jane Barker]] explicitly advertised her ''Exilius'' as "A new Romance", "written after the Manner of Telemachus", in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to her [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1715-exilius.html ''Exilius''] (London: E. Curll, 1715)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robinson Crusoe]] spoke of his own story as a "romance", though in the preface to the third volume, published in 1720, Defoe attacks all who said "that [...] the Story is feign'd, that the Names are borrow'd, and that it is all a Romance; that there never were any such Man or Place".

The late 18th century brought an answer with the [[romanticism|Romantic]] Movement's readiness to reclaim the word romance, with the [[gothic romance]], and the [[historical novel]]s of [[Walter Scott]]. ''Robinson Crusoe'' now became a "novel" in this period, that is a work of the new realistic fiction created in the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===The sentimental novel===
{{main|Sentimental novel}}
Sentimental novels relied on emotional responses, and feature scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot is arranged to advance emotions rather than action. The result is a valorization of "fine feeling", displaying the characters as models of refined, sensitive emotional effect. The ability to display such feelings was thought at this time to show character and experience, and to help shape positive social life and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Maxwell and Katie Trumpener, eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Fiction in the Romantic Period'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this genre is [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740), composed "to cultivate the Principles of Virtue and Religion in the Minds of the Youth of Both Sexes", which focuses on a potential victim, a heroine that has all the modern virtues and who is vulnerable because her low social status and her occupation as servant of a libertine who falls in love with her. She, however, ends in reforming her antagonist.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Male heroes adopted the new [[sentimental novel|sentimental]] character traits in the 1760s. [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[Yorick]], the hero of the ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy|Sentimental Journey]]'' (1768) did so with an enormous amount of humour. [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield|Vicar of Wakefield]]'' (1766) and [[Henry Mackenzie]]'s ''Man of Feeling'' (1771) produced the far more serious role models.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Thees works inspired a [[Subculture|sub]]- and [[counterculture]] of [[pornography|pornographic]] novels, for which Greek and Latin authors in  translations had provided elegant models from the last century.&lt;ref&gt;The elegant and clearly fashionable edition of ''The Works of [[Lucian]]'' (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1711), would thus include the story of "Lucian's Ass", vol.1 pp.&amp;nbsp;114–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography includes [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1748), which offered an almost exact reversals of the plot of novel's that emphasised virtue. The prostitute Fanny Hill learns to enjoy her work and establishes herself as a free and economically independent individual, in editions one could only expect to buy under the counter.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Darnton, ''The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France'' (New York: Norton, 1995), Lynn Hunt, ''The Invention of Pornography: Obscenity and the Origins of Modernity, 1500–1800'' (New York: Zone, 1996), Inger Leemans, ''Het woord is aan de onderkant: radicale ideeën in Nederlandse pornografische romans 1670–1700'' (Nijmegen: Vantilt, 2002), and Lisa Z. Sigel, ''Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815–1914'' (January: Scholarly Book Services Inc, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Less virtuous protagonists can also be found in satirical novels, like [[Richard Head]]'s ''English Rogue'' (1665), that feature brothels, while women authors like [[Aphra Behn]] had offered their heroines alternative careers as precursors of the 19th-century [[femme fatale|femmes fatales]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' (1684/ 1685/ 1687)&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

The genre evolves in the 1770s with, for example, Werther in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774) realising that it is impossible for him to integrate into the new conformist society, and [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]] in ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (1782) showing a group of aristocrats playing games of intrigue and amorality.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

===The social context of the 18th century novel===

====Changing cultural status====
By around 1700, fiction was no longer a predominantly aristocratic entertainment, and printed books had soon gained the power to reach readers of almost all classes, though the reading habits differed and to follow fashions remained a privilege. Spain was a trendsetter into the 1630s but French authors superseded [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Francisco de Quevedo|de Quevedo]], and [[Mateo Alemán|Alemán]] in the 1640s. As [[Pierre Daniel Huet|Huet]] was to note in 1670, the change was one of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Daniel Huet, ''The History of Romances'', transl. by Stephen Lewis (London: J. Hooke/ T. Caldecott, 1715), pp.&amp;nbsp;138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; The new French works taught a new, on the surface freer, gallant exchange between the sexes as the essence of life at the French court.

The situation changed again from 1660s into the 1690s when works by French authors were published in Holland out of the reach of French censors.&lt;ref&gt;See for the following: Christiane Berkvens-Stevelinck, H. Bots, P.G. Hoftijzer (eds.), ''Le Magasin de L'univers: The Dutch Republic as the Centre of the European Book Trade: Papers Presented at the International Colloquium, Held at Wassenaar, 5–7 July 1990'' (Leiden/ Boston, MA: Brill, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch publishing houses pirated of fashionable books from France and created a new market of political and scandalous fiction. This led to a market of European rather than French fashions in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See also the article on [[Pierre Marteau]] for a profile of the European production of (not only) political scandal.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1711 The Court and City Vagaries.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|Intimate short stories: ''The Court and City Vagaries'' (1711).]]

By the 1680s fashionable political European novels had inspired a second wave of private scandalous publications and generated new productions of local importance. Women authors reported on politics and on their private love affairs in The Hague and in London. German students imitated them to boast of their private amours in fiction.&lt;ref&gt;See ''George Ernst Reinwalds Academien- und Studenten-Spiegel'' (Berlin: J.A. Rüdiger, 1720), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–427 and the novels written by such "authors" as Celander, Sarcander, and Adamantes at the beginning of the 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt; The London, the anonymous international market of the Netherlands, publishers in Hamburg and Leipzig generated new public spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry Into a Category of the Bourgeois Society'' [1962], translated by Thomas Burger (MIT Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Once private individuals, such as students in university towns and daughters of London's upper class began write novels based on questionable reputations, the public began to call for a reformation of manners.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Entertainments'' pp.&amp;nbsp;74–77, Jane Barker's preface to her [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1715-exilius.html ''Exilius''] (London: E. Curll, 1715), and ''George Ernst Reinwalds Academien- und Studenten-Spiegel'' (Berlin: J.A. Rüdiger, 1720), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important development in Britain, at the beginning of the century, was that new journals like ''[[Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' and ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' reviewed novels. In Germany [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''Briefe, die neuste Literatur betreffend'' (1758) appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction. By the 1780s such reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public.

Influenced by the new journals, reform became the main goal of the second generation of 18th-century novelists. ''The Spectator'' Number 10 had stated that the aim was now "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality […] to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses"). Constructive criticism of novels had until then been rare.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugh Barr Nisbet, Claude Rawson (eds.), ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism'', vol. IV (Cambridge University Press 1997); and Ernst Weber, ''Texte zur Romantheorie: (1626–1781)'', 2 vols. (München: Fink, 1974/ 1981) and the individual volumes of Dennis Poupard (et al.), ''Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800: '' (Detroit, Mich.: Gale Research Co, 1984 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; The first treatise on the history of the novel was a preface to Marie de La Fayette's  novel ''Zayde'' (1670).

A much later development was the introduction of novels into school and later university curricula.{{when|date=July 2018}}

====The acceptance of novels as literature====

The French churchman and scholar [[Pierre Daniel Huet]]'s ''[[Traitté de l'origine des romans]]'' (1670) laid the ground for a greater acceptance of the novel as literature, that is comparable to the [[classics]], in the early 18th century. The theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty. Furthermore, readers of  novels and romances could gain insight not only into their own culture, but also that of distant, exotic countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When the decades around 1700 saw the appearance of new editions of the classical authors [[Petronius]], [[Lucian]], and [[Heliodorus of Emesa]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of T. Petronius Arbiter'' [...] ''second edition'' [...] (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1710); ''The Works of Lucian,'', 2 vols. (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1711). See ''The Adventures of Theagenes and Chariclia'' [...]'', 2 vols. (London: W. Taylor/ E. Curll/ R. Gosling/ J. Hooke/ J. Browne/ J. Osborn, 1717),&lt;/ref&gt; the publishers equipped them with prefaces that referred to Huet's treatise. and the [[Western canon|canon]] it had established. Also exotic works of Middle Eastern fiction entered the market that gave insight into Islamic culture. ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' was first published in Europe from 1704 to 1715 in French, and then translated immediately into English and German, and was seen as a contribution to Huet's history of romances.&lt;ref&gt;August Bohse's (alias Talander) "Preface" to the German edition. (Leipzig: J.L. Gleditsch/ M.G. Weidmann, 1710).&lt;/ref&gt;

The English, ''Select Collection of Novels in six volumes'' (1720–22), is a milestone in this development of the novel's prestige. It included Huet's ''Treatise'', along with the European tradition of the modern novel of the day: that is, novella from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s to [[Marie de La Fayette]]'s masterpieces. [[Aphra Behn]]'s novels had appeared in the 1680s but became classics when reprinted in collections. [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) became a classic three years after its publication. New authors entering the market were now ready to use their personal names rather than pseudonyms, including [[Eliza Haywood]], who in 1719 following in the footsteps of Aphra Behn used her name with unprecedented pride.

==19th century novels==

===Romanticism===
{{main|Romanticism}}
{{See also|Newgate novel}}
[[File:Walter Scott Waverley illustration (Pettie-Huth).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Image from a Victorian edition of [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'']]
The very word [[romanticism]] is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century, with [[gothic fiction]], that began in 1746 with English author [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', subtitled (in its second edition) "A Gothic Story". Other important works are [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794) and [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]]'s ''[[The Monk]]'' (1795).

The new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] depictions of life, and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and popular fiction. Gothic romances exploited the [[grotesque]],&lt;ref&gt;See Geoffrey Galt Harpham,'' On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature'', 2nd ed. (Davies Group, Publishers, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of [[Arthurian romance|Arthurian knighthood]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gerald Ernest Paul Gillespie, Manfred Engel, and Bernard Dieterle, ''Romantic prose fiction'' (John Benjamin's Publishing Company, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of this new type of fiction were accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill, arouse, or horrify their audience. These new [[romanticism|romantic]] novelists, however, claimed that they were exploring  the entire realm of fictionality. And psychological interpreters, in the early 19th century, read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination: this included sexuality, [[Angst|anxieties]], and insatiable [[desire (emotion)|desires]]. Under such readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal what had not previously been openly visible.

The romances of [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom|Les 120 Journées de Sodome]]'' (1785), [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' (1840), [[Mary Shelley]], ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], ''[[Die Elixiere des Teufels]]'' (1815), would later attract 20th-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for 20th- and 21st-century horror films, [[romance novel|love romances]], [[fantasy]] novels, [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] computer games, and the [[surrealism|surrealists]].

The [[historical romance]] was also important at this time. But, while earlier writers of these romances paid little attention to historical reality, [[Walter Scott]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814) broke with this tradition, and he invented "the true historical novel".&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885"&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;885.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was influenced by [[gothic romance]], and had collaborated in 1801 with [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]] on ''Tales of Wonder''.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885" /&gt; With his [[Waverley novels]] Scott "hoped to do for the Scottish border" what [[Goethe]] and other German poets "had done for the [[Middle Ages]], "and make its past live again in modern romance".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis, p.&amp;nbsp;884.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's novels "are in the mode he himself defined as romance, 'the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents'".&lt;ref name=norton&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol.2, 7th edition, ed. M.H. Abrams. New York: Norton, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; He used his imagination to re-evaluate history by rendering things, incidents and protagonists in the way only the novelist could do. His work remained historical fiction, yet it questioned existing historical perceptions. The use of historical research was an important tool: Scott, the novelist, resorted to documentary sources as any historian would have done, but as a romantic he gave his subject a deeper imaginative and emotional significance.&lt;ref name=norton/&gt; By combining research with "marvelous and uncommon incidents", Scott attracted a far wider market than any historian could, and was the most famous novelist of his generation, throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885" /&gt;

In the 19th century the relationship between authors, publishers, and readers, changed. Authors originally had only received payment for their manuscript, however, changes in [[History of copyright law|copyright laws]], which began in 18th and continued into 19th century&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Rose, ''Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright'' 3rd ed. (Harvard University Press, 1993) and Joseph Lowenstein, ''The Author's Due: Printing and the Prehistory of Copyright'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; promised royalties on all future editions. Another change in the 19th century was that novelists began to read their works in theaters, halls, and bookshops.&lt;ref&gt;See Susan Esmann, "Die Autorenlesung&amp;nbsp;– eine Form der Literaturvermittlung", ''Kritische Ausgabe'' 1/2007 [http://kritische-ausgabe.de/hefte/werkstatt/esmann.pdf PDF; 0,8 MB].&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the nineteenth century the market for [[popular fiction]] grew, and competed with works of literature. New institutions like the [[circulating library]] created a new market with a mass reading public.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Altick and Jonathan Rose, ''The English Common Reader: A Social History of the Mass Reading Public, 1800–1900'', 2nd ed. (Ohio State University Press, 1998) and William St. Clair, ''The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference was that novels began to deal with more difficult subjects, including current political and social issues, that were being discussed in newspapers and magazines. The idea of social responsibility became a key subject, whether of the citizen, or of the artist, with the theoretical debate concentrating on questions around the moral soundness of the modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;See: James Engell, ''The committed word: Literature and Public Values'' (Penn State Press, 1999) and Edwin M. Eigner, George John Worth (ed.), ''Victorian criticism of the novel'' (Cambridge: CUP Archive, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about artistic integrity, as well as [[aestheticism|aesthetics]], including, for example. the idea of "[[art for art's sake]]", proposed by writers like [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], were also important.&lt;ref&gt;Gene H. Bell-Villada, ''Art for Art's Sake &amp; Literary Life: How Politics and Markets Helped Shape the Ideology &amp; Culture of Aestheticism, 1790–1990'' (University of Nebraska Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Major British writers such as [[Charles Dickens]]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Benson, "Charles Dickens". ''The North American Review'', Vol. 195, No. 676 (Mar., 1912), pp.&amp;nbsp;381–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Jane Millgate, "Two Versions of Regional Romance: Scott's ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' and Hardy's ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles''. ''Studies in English Literature'', 1500–1900, Vol. 17, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;729–38.&lt;/ref&gt; were influenced by the romance genre tradition of the novel, which had been revitalized during the Romantic period. The [[Brontë sisters]] were notable mid-19th-century authors in this tradition, with [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucasta Miller, ''The Brontë Myth''. London: Vintage, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Publishing at the very end of the 19th century, [[Joseph Conrad]] has been called, "a supreme 'romancer'".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory'', ed. J.A. Cuddon, 4th ed., revised C.E. Preston (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;761.&lt;/ref&gt; In America "the romance ... proved to be a serious, flexible, and successful medium for the exploration of philosophical ideas and attitudes." Notable examples include [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref name="Literary Terms 1995 p.450"&gt;''A Handbook of Literary Terms'', 7th edition, ed. Harmon and Holman (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;450.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of European novelists were similarly influenced influenced during this period by the earlier romance tradition, along with the [[Romantic Movemennticism|Romanticism]], including [[Victor Hugo]], with novels like ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831) and ''[[Les Misérables]]'' (1862), and [[Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov]] with ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'' (1840).

[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852)]]

Many 19th-century authors dealt with significant social matters.&lt;ref&gt;For the wider context of 19th-century encounters with history see: [[Hayden White]], ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University]], 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]]'s novels depicted the world of the [[working class]]es, which [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'s non-fiction explores. In the United States slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract. [[Charles Dickens]]' novels led his readers into contemporary [[workhouses]], and provided first-hand accounts of [[child labor]]. The treatment of the subject of war changed with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1868/69), where he questions the facts provided by historians. Similarly the treatment of crime is very different in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), where the point of view is that of a criminal. Women authors had dominated fiction from the 1640s into the early 18th century, but few before [[George Eliot]] so openly questioned the role, education, and status of women in society, as she did.

As the novel became a platform of modern debate, [[nationalist|national literatures]] were developed that link the present with the past in the form of the [[historical novel]]. [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' (1827) did this for Italy, while novelists in Russia and the surrounding Slavonic countries, as well as [[Scandinavia]], did likewise.

Along with this new appreciation of history, the future also became a topic for fiction. This had been done earlier in works like [[Samuel Madden]]'s ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1733) and [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague. [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) and [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) were concerned with technological and biological developments. [[Industrialization]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] and Marx's theory of [[social class|class]] divisions shaped these works and turned historical processes into a subject of wide debate. Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' became the second best-selling book of the 19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Scott Donaldson and Ann Massa ''American Literature: Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (David &amp; Charles, 1978), p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Parfait, ''The Publishing History of Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852–2002'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular [[science fiction]] as the 20th century approached.

[[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) had a major influence on modern novelists, in the way that it replaced the 18th- and 19th-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts, or a "[[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]". This term was first used by [[William James]] in 1890 and is used (or the related [[interior monologue]]) by [[modernists]] like [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Marcel Proust]], as well as, later [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[William Faulkner]].&lt;ref&gt;See Erwin R. Steinberg (ed.) ''The Stream-of-consciousness technique in the modern novel'' (Port Washington, N.Y: Kennikat Press, 1979). On the extra-European usage of the technique see also: Elly Hagenaar/ Eide, Elisabeth, "Stream of consciousness and free indirect discourse in modern Chinese literature", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', 56 (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;621 and P.M. Nayak (ed.), ''The voyage inward: stream of consciousness in Indian English fiction'' (New Delhi: Bahri Publications, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1920s [[expressionist]] [[Alfred Döblin]] went in a different direction with ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (1929), where interspersed non-fictional text fragments exist alongside the fictional material to create another new form of realism, which differs from that of stream-of-consciousness.

Later works like [[Samuel Beckett]]'s trilogy ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1953), as well as [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963) and [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (1973) all make use of the stream-of-consciousness technique. On the other hand, [[Robert Coover]] is an example of those authors who, in the 1960s,  fragmented their stories and challenged time and sequentiality as fundamental structural concepts.
[[File:Chinua Achebe - Buffalo 25Sep2008.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Chinua Achebe]], Buffalo, 2008]]
The 20th century novels deals with a wide range of subject matter. [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1928) focusses on young German's experiences of [[World War I]]. The [[Jazz Age]] is explored by American [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], and the [[Great Depression]] by fellow American [[John Steinbeck]]. The rise of [[totalitarian]] states is the subject of British writer [[George Orwell]]. France's existentialism is the subject of French writers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' (1938) and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942). The [[counterculture of the 1960s]] led to revived interest in [[Hermann Hesse]]'s ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'' (1927), and produced such iconic works of its own like [[Ken Kesey]]'s ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' and [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''. Novelist have also been interested in the subject of racial and [[gender identity]] in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Susan Hopkins, ''Girl Heroes: The New Force In Popular Culture'' (Annandale NSW:, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Kavadlo of [[Maryville University]] of St. Louis has described [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (1996) as "a closeted [[Feminism|feminist]] critique".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavadlo|first=Jesse|date=Fall/Winter 2005|title=The Fiction of Self-destruction: Chuck Palahniuk, Closet Moralist|url=|journal=Stirrings Still: The International Journal of Existential Literature|volume=2|issue=2|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]] were feminist voices during this period.

Furthermore, the major political and military confrontations of the 20th and 21st centuries have also influenced novelists. The events of [[World War II]], from a German perspective, are dealt with by [[Günter Grass]]' ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' (1959) and an American by [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961). The subsequent [[Cold War]] influenced popular [[spy fiction|spy novels]]. Latin American self-awareness in the wake of the (failing) left revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a "[[Latin American Boom]]", linked to with the names of novelists [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Carlos Fuentes]] and [[Gabriel García Márquez]], along with the invention of a special brand of postmodern [[magic realism]].

Another major 20th-century social events, the so-called [[sexual revolution]] is reflected in the modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Charles Irving Glicksberg, ''The Sexual Revolution in Modern American Literature'' (Nijhoff, 1971) and his ''The Sexual Revolution in Modern English Literature'' (Martinus Nijhoff, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' had to be published in Italy in 1928; British censorship lifted its ban as late as 1960. [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' (1934) created the comparable US scandal. Transgressive fiction from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'' (1955) to [[Michel Houellebecq]]'s ''[[Les Particules élémentaires]]'' (1998) entered a literary field that eventually led to more pornographic works such as [[Anne Desclos]]' ''[[Story of O]]'' (1954) to [[Anaïs Nin]]'s ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' (1978).

In the second half of the 20th century, [[postmodernism|Postmodern]] authors subverted serious debate with playfulness, claiming that art could never be original, that it always plays with existing materials.&lt;ref&gt;See for a first survey [[Brian McHale]], ''Postmodernist Fiction'' (Routledge, 1987) and John Docker, ''Postmodernism and popular culture: a cultural history'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that language is self-referential was already an  accepted truth in the world of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]. A postmodernist re-reads popular literature as an essential cultural production. Novels from [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' (1966), to [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980) and ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' (1989) made use of [[intertextuality|intertextual]] references.&lt;ref&gt;See Gérard Genette, ''Palimpsests'', trans.

While the reader of so-called [[Classic book|serious literature]] will follow public discussions of novels, popular fiction production employs more direct and short-term marketing strategies by openly declarating of the work's genre. Popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name. e.g. the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]

Popular literature holds a larger market share. [[Romance fiction]] had an estimated $1.375&amp;nbsp;billion share in the US book market in 2007. [[Inspirational literature]]/religious literature followed with $819&amp;nbsp;million, [[science fiction]]/[[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] with $700&amp;nbsp;million, [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] with $650&amp;nbsp;million and then classic literary fiction with $466&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

Genre literature might be seen as the successor of the early modern [[chapbook]]. Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Richetti ''Popular Fiction before Richardson. Narrative Patterns 1700–1739'' (Oxford: OUP, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century love romance is a successor of the novels [[Madeleine de Scudéry]], [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]], [[Aphra Behn]], and [[Eliza Haywood]] wrote from the 1640s into the 1740s. The modern [[adventure novel]] goes back to [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and its immediate successors. Modern [[pornography]] has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and hedonistic belles lettres, of works like [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1749) and similar eighteenth century novels. [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[James Bond]]'' is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs with his political missions in ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (1707). [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' is influenced by [[Tolkien]], as well as [[Arthurian literature]], including its 19th-century successors. Modern [[horror fiction]] also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early-19th-century [[Romantic literature]]. Modern popular science fiction has an even shorter history, from the 1860s.

The authors of popular fiction tend to advertise that they have exploited a controversial topic and this is a major difference between them and so-called elitist literature. [[Dan Brown]], for example, discusses, on his website, the question whether his ''Da Vinci Code'' is an anti-Christian novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brown on his [http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html website] visited February 3, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116181432/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |date=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And because authors of popular fiction have a fan community to serve, they can risk offending [[literary critic]]. However, the boundaries between popular and serious literature have blurred in recent years, with [[postmodernism]] and [[poststructuralism]], as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film and television industries.

Crime became a major subject of 20th and 21st century genre novelists and [[crime fiction]] reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies. Crime is both a personal and public subject: criminals each have their personal motivations; detectives, see their moral codes challenged. [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[psychological thriller|thrillers]] became a medium of new psychological explorations. [[Paul Auster]]'s ''[[The New York Trilogy|New York Trilogy]]'' (1985–1986) is an example of experimental [[postmodern]]ist literature based on this genre.

[[Fantasy]] is another major area of commercial fiction, and a major example is [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954/55), a work originally written for young readers that became a major cultural artefact. Tolkien in fact  revived the tradition of European [[epic (genre)|epic]] literature in the tradition of [[Beowulf]], the North Germanic [[Edda]] and the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Cycles]].

[[Science fiction]], is another important type of genre fiction and it has developed in a variety of ways, ranging from the early, technological adventure [[Jules Verne]] had made fashionable in the 1860s, to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) about Western [[consumerism]] and technology. [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) deals with [[totalitarianism]] and [[surveillance]], among other matters, while [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines. The surreal novels of [[Philip K Dick]] such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' explore the nature of reality, reflecting the widespread recreational experimentation with drugs and cold-war paranoia of the 60's and 70's. Writers such as [[Ursula le Guin]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] explore feminist and broader social issues in their works. [[William Gibson]], author of the cult classic ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984), is one of a new wave of authors who explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and [[virtual reality]].

The '''Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg''' (Strasbourg Philharmonic Orchestra) is a French orchestra based in [[Strasbourg]].  It is one of the two permanent orchestras of the [[Opéra national du Rhin]] (the other being the [[Orchestre symphonique de Mulhouse]]). The orchestra's current principal venue is the [[Palais de la musique et des congrès]] 'Pierre Pflimlin ' (PMC Pierre-Pflimlin, or PMC).

The orchestra was founded in 1855.  Between 1871 and 1918, and 1940 and 1944, the orchestra had been a [[Germany|German]] one, resulting from conflicts between France and Germany over the [[Alsace]] region.  In 1994, the orchestra acquired the official title of ''Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg – orchestre national''.  The orchestra currently holds 110 permanent musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orchestre philharmonique de Strasbourg - orchestre national|url=http://www.philharmonique-strasbourg.com/biographies/ops_vGB.pdf|publisher=philharmonique-strasbourg.com|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Composers-in-residence included the French composers [[Jean-Louis Agobet]] and [[Philippe Manoury]], the Finnish composer [[Kaija Saariaho]] and the American composer [[John Corigliano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les compositeurs en résidence|url=http://www.philharmonique-strasbourg.com/compositeurs-residence.php|website=philharmonique-strasbourg.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past music directors and chief conductors have included [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Hans Rosbaud]], [[Ernest Bour]], [[Jan Latham-Koenig]], [[Charles Bruck]] and [[Alain Lombard]].  [[Marc Albrecht]] became artistic advisor of the orchestra in 2005, and music director in 2008.  Albrecht and the orchestra have recorded commercially for [[PentaTone Classics|PENTATONE]], including orchestral lieder of [[Alban Berg]], and piano concertos by [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Clements | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/04/schumann-dvorak-piano-concerto | title=Schumann: Piano Concerto; Dvorák: Piano Concerto: Helmchen/Strasbourg PO/Albrecht | work=The Guardian | date=2009-12-04 | accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Albrecht concluded his tenure in 2011.

A '''pard''' is a legendary animal that is listed in Medieval [[bestiary|bestiaries]]. They were felines with spotted coats and were extremely fast (reminiscent of a [[cheetah]]). They were believed to mate with [[lion]]s to produce [[leopard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast116.htm|title=Pard|accessdate=2008-12-28|work=The Medieval Bestiary}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were believed to have white or pale spots. These spots were thought to symbolize sins, as the pard was taken to be a symbol of the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94opjX2vfjQC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=pard+bestiary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tXnJRgYIh_&amp;sig=JOfEq2RMrZgiIT_6ZsrMSIiciXY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjO8e74ovveAhVCWqwKHVzSBdUQ6AEwA3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pard%20bestiary&amp;f=false|title=Pard|accessdate=2018-11-29|work=Bestiary: Being an English Version of the Bodleian Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
The English noun ''pard'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''parde'', from [[Old French]] via [[Latin]] ''pardus'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πάρδος}} ''párdos'' ("male panther"). The word ''pard'' is probably of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] origin; akin to [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] ''purdhank''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pard ''The Free Dictionary'' - Pard]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Persian language|Persian]] پلنگ ''Palang''.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
In England's [[Lake District]], [[Peter Rabbit]], his cousin [[Benjamin Bunny]], and Peter's triplet sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, spend most of their days picking on Mr. Joe McGregor and stealing vegetables from his garden. They are friends with a local woman named Bea who spends her time painting pictures of the rabbits as well as the surrounding nature. Bea takes on a mother-like relationship with the rabbits due to the death of their parents, who were killed by McGregor. One day, Peter is forced to leave his jacket in McGregor's garden and goes back to retrieve it. McGregor spots and catches him, but suddenly dies of a heart attack due to decades of unhealthy eating habits. Enthralled, Peter invites all of the local animals and takes over McGregor's manor.

Meanwhile in [[London]], McGregor's great-nephew Thomas McGregor, an uptight, controlling workaholic, works at the toy department of [[Harrods]] department store where he waits for a promotion to associate general manager. He indifferently accepts the news about his great-uncle's death, someone he was completely unaware of, but is infuriated over losing the promotion to a lazy nephew of the managing director and is fired for losing his temper. His now-former manager encourages him to get a hobby and spend some time in the country.

When Thomas learns that his great-uncle's manor is valuable and that he's inherited it, he decides to appraise and prepare it for resale in order to start his own toy store to get even with his former employers. He kicks out Peter and his friends and begins to upgrade the security of the garden wall and gates, despite Bea's objections. When Peter and Benjamin sneak back into the garden, Thomas catches the latter and attempts to drown Benjamin in a river. His cousins rescue him; Thomas instead accidentally drops a prized set of binoculars that Bea had given him earlier, forcing him to retrieve it.

Thomas and Peter start a war with each other by setting up traps and other offensive nuisances. Thomas and Bea end up falling in love with each other, which causes Peter to become jealous and wanting to separate them more. This all culminates when Peter rewires an electric fence set up by Thomas, prompting Thomas to throw dynamite at Peter's burrow. Thomas then attacks Peter in the garden, telling Peter that his antics caused him to become aggressive. When Peter detonates the dynamite to prove to Bea that Thomas was using it, he ends up knocking down the tree on top of the burrow, which crushes Bea's art studio. Bea, ignoring Thomas’s explanation of his quarrel with the rabbits, breaks up with him, and he goes back to London to work at Harrods again.

Peter feels bad for what he has done, and upon learning that Bea intends to leave the neighborhood, he and Benjamin head to London to find Thomas at Harrods. Tricking Thomas into believing he was imagining the rabbits’ ability to communicate, Peter apologizes for his part of the conflict and convinces Thomas to follow his heart. They rush back to the country, where Peter shows Bea the detonator and presses it for her to see, confirming Thomas’s previous claims that the rabbits were responsible for the explosion. Peter and Thomas apologize and convince Bea not to leave her home.

Wishing to remain with Bea, Thomas no longer wants to sell the manor but discovers that an unpleasant wealthy couple had already bought the house and finalized the sale. Peter and his friends use their tricks to force the couple out of the house, allowing Thomas to move back in. Thomas and Bea resume their relationship, and he permits the wildlife to freely take food from the garden as long as it's within reason. Peter and his family restore the burrow with Bea and Thomas’s help. Thomas sets up his own toy shop in the village, where Bea showcases her illustrations of the rabbits.

==Release==
''Peter Rabbit'' was originally scheduled to be released on March 23, 2018,&lt;ref name="Dec2015CS" /&gt; but it was moved up to February 9, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Rabbit|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movie/peter-rabbit-2018|work=ComingSoon.net|publisher=[[CraveOnline Media]]|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trailer criticism===
The first trailer received negative feedback from critics and fans of the character, many of whom labelled the film as being too modern and insulting to Beatrix Potter's works. [[Collider (website)|Collider]] called the trailer "garbage" and a "low brow 'comedy' cringe fest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Trombore|title=First ‘Peter Rabbit’ Trailer Gives Us Another Reason to Be Mad at James Corden|url=http://collider.com/peter-rabbit-trailer|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=Complex Media|date=September 21, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Heritage from ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that "the ''Peter Rabbit'' film looks like the result of some blisteringly inept manhandling [...] there's something genuinely harrowing about the sight of ''Peter Rabbit'' – gentle, Edwardian Peter Rabbit – thoughtlessly injuring some birds, or grabbing a pile of lettuce leaves and making it rain like a banker in a strip club, or literally twerking" and argued "there is no way on Earth that [Beatrix Potter would] have ever given the green light to a slow motion car crash like this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stuart|last=Heritage|title=James Corden's Peter Rabbit: another kids' classic wrecked forever|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/sep/25/peter-rabbit-film-trailer-beatrix-potter-james-corden|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' writer James Baldock found that the trailer was "so gut wrenchingly bad" and that "if the movie lives up to its two minute preview – [it] is set to be the greatest abomination to grace the big screen since ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''." He finished by writing "Listen carefully, and you can just about hear the sound of Beatrix Potter, turning furiously in her grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Baldock|title=Here’s the trailer for the new Peter Rabbit movie – and it’s a total disaster|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/25/heres-the-trailer-for-the-new-peter-rabbit-movie-and-its-a-total-disaster-6954943/|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=September 25, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, a new trailer for the United Kingdom was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Katharine|last=Cowdrey|title=Sony launches trailer for upcoming Peter Rabbit film|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/sony-launches-trailer-upcoming-peter-rabbit-film-669466|website=[[The Bookseller]]|publisher=Bookseller Media|location=London, England|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website's critical consensus reads, "''Peter Rabbit'' updates Beatrix Potter's classic characters with colorfully agreeable results that should entertain younger viewers while admittedly risking the wrath of purists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Rabbit (2018)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/peter_rabbit_2018|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 51 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/peter-rabbit|title=Peter Rabbit Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="Cinemascore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Peter Rabbit|publisher=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In the first week after the film's release, groups in multiple countries criticized it for "allergy bullying" and called for an apology from Sony. The accusations focused on a scene where Thomas McGregor — whose character has a known severe allergy to [[blackberries]] — is pelted with the berries until one enters his mouth, causing him to enter [[anaphylactic shock]] and grab for his [[Epipen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/11/peter-rabbit-film-criticised-for-depicting-allergy-bullying |title=Peter Rabbit film criticised for depicting allergy bullying |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|date=February 11, 2018 |author=Guardian staff|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-11/peter-rabbit-calls-sony-pictures-apologise-food-allergy-scene/9420102 |title=Peter Rabbit: Calls for Sony Pictures to apologise after food allergy bullying scene in new movie |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|first1=Edwina|last1=Seselja|first2=Samantha|last2=Dawes|date=February 11, 2018|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/11/peter-rabbit-film-accused-food-bullying-rabbits-pelt-allergic|title=Peter Rabbit film accused of food bullying as rabbits pelt allergic man with blackberries |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=February 11, 2018 |last=Ward |first=Victoria|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Sony published a statement saying "We sincerely regret not being more aware and sensitive to this issue, and we truly apologize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43027764|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Peter Rabbit film producers apologise over allergy scene|date=February 12, 2018 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Materia Medica (Arabic translation, leaf).jpg|thumb|''Physician Preparing an Elixir'']]
The '''''Physician Preparing an Elixir''''' is a miniature on a folio from an illustrated manuscript copy, now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York of ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'', a large [[herbal]] or work on the (mostly) medical uses of plants originally written by the ancient Greco-Roman physician, [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], in the first century AD. This page of the manuscript, dated 1224 AD, is made from paper, sized 24.8&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 33.2&amp;nbsp;cm long, and is decorated by opaque watercolor, ink, and gold detailing. It is visually split into three horizontal portions from the top of the page to the bottom; the top of the page is dominated by two lines of Arabic script, followed by the image and then five more lines of text in Arabic. The writing below the image is predominantly black with the exception of one line, which is written in red ink and is therefore highlighted to the viewer. The page is usually not on display.

Experts believe that the image was made in Iraq, Northern Jazira or Baghdad. Its Middle Eastern origin is corroborated with the physician’s appearance. In the image, he is wearing a headscarf, his clothing is quite colorful and it is detailed with gold decorations. Additionally, the Arabic text is a further indication that this specific page was formed in a Middle Eastern context.  In this digital representation, the page looks to be in great condition and has minimal wear and tear.

==Brief History of the Materia Medica==

The term Materia Medica refers to both a specific text and a genre of texts, a complication illustrated by the diverse history of the original book. Pedanius Dioscorides was a Greek physician, the word here used in the medieval sense, born in 40 A.D. who spent multiple years traveling with the Roman Emperor Nero’s army. During these travels, Dioscorides gathered herbal samples and collected knowledge on the practical health uses of plants, amassing notes on over one thousand medicinal substances.  In 70 A.D., Dioscorides published De Materia Medica or “On Medicinal Substances” in his native language, Greek. The Materia Medica detailed “plant names, synonyms and illustrations; plant habitat and botanical descriptions; properties, actions and uses of the drug; negative side effects, if any; administration and dosage recommendations; directions on harvesting, preparation and storage of herbs or drugs; possible adulterations and how they're detected; and the veterinary uses of the drug or herb, if any.”   The text was published in five volumes and was eventually translated into multiple languages, including Latin and Arabic. This text went on to serve as a central source for knowledge on herbs and similar medical substances. As it traveled to new areas and was handed down through different leaders and dynasties, it was modified, rearranged and added to with the knowledge of those places. Therefore, this page in this Materia Medica is not identical to the original by Dioscoride or other surviving copies.

==History of the specific object==
[[File:Pedanius Dioscorides - Folio from an Arabic translation of the Materia Medica by Dioscorides - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|A man bitten by a [[rabies|rabid]] dog, another page from the same manuscript]]
In 1913, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, New York received the folio came to the MMA after a history of European ownership. As far as the records show, this page of the manuscript was first collected by F. R. Martin of Stockholm in 1910. F.R. Martin also originally possessed additional folios that came from other copies of Dioscorides’ Materia Medica such as the image titled “Men Stepping on Grapes” which is now also at the MMA.  The central folio page, “Physician Preparing an Elixir,” was then moved to the care of Georges. J. Demotte in Paris until 1913 when it was officially acquired by the museum. Demotte was a Belgian-born Parisian art dealer of the late 19th to early 20th century who also gave many different art and archaeological finds to the Metropolitan Museum. Demotte has become known for his acquisition of the Islamic “Book of Kings” or the Shahnameh, which he sold page by page to different interested parties.

The fact that this page is from a highly translated text, De Materia Medica, may distort some of our analysis due to the great changes a literary work undergoes during translation.  As the Materia Medica became widely spread and translated into multiple languages, this page and others may have traveled with physicians or along trade routes to reach new destinations and communities. Therefore, this text, as illustrated by its aesthetic and geographical origins in the Middle East, could display a very different side of the Materia Medica genre. It is possible that this page was an addition, performed by Middle Eastern physicians, in the 13th century and did not exist as a part of the early Materia Medica’s during the time of Dioscoride. Additionally, though the original five-volume text was an assemblage of information, perhaps for the aim of practical instruction, this page seems to diverge from that initial focus. It is esthetically pleasing, apparently quite valuable as shown by the gold detailing, and overall, seems to have been a precious object as shown by the minimal wear and tear depicted on its page on the MMA website. Therefore, one can assume that at least this page was not a highly circulated text within the Middle Eastern community. Perhaps this text was kept among scholars and through this seclusion in academic society, remained in good condition.

==Context==
The physician is surrounded by multiple different tools, perhaps signifying the importance of such inventions during the time this manuscript page was created. The physician is sitting on a stool and is making an elixir in a medium-sized pot using a mixing tool. He is seated in front of a medieval contraption that could have been used for filtering or other processes. To the far left of the image, on the other side of the potential filtering tool, there is a large blue jug. The prominence of these tools, perhaps important to the physician’s preparation of the elixir, are highlighted by their placement and coloring on the page.

Additionally, the depiction of the physician in this text could illustrate the place of physicians in society in the Middle East during this time period. As previously explained, this text could have been an object of Middle Eastern academic society. Physicians in the 13th century were highly respected members of society as they were viewed as learned men. They were taught in the intricacies of humoral theory and were charged with the health of many communities. The physician in this image, demonstrated by the elaborate coloring of his shirt and its implications for his high social class, could be the depiction of an ideal. This man could be a representation of the  “ideal Middle Eastern 13th century physician,” a man of ingenuity with his tools, knowledge of plants and herbs, and high social status. Yet, internal to this interpretation is a contradiction as the high society physician would also not be found working in such an outdoor environment. This physician would instead be found in a more scholarly/academic environment for this time period as the physicians of the 13th century were more invested in humoral theory than in herbs and plants. Therefore, the "physician" in this text could represent the work of an herbalist of this time period as opposed to a physician.  In this way, the page “Physician Preparing an Elixir” may display not only the great herbal and medical knowledge dating back to Dioscoride’s trips with [[Nero]], but also the changing depiction of medical and societal ideals, all found within the same, diverse manuscript.

The '''Praemium Imperiale''' (lit. "World Culture Prize in Memory of His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu", {{lang-ja|高松宮殿下記念世界文化賞}}, ''Takamatsu no miya denka kinen sekai bunka-shō'') is an international art prize awarded since 1989 by the [[Imperial family of Japan]] on behalf of the Japan Art Association in the fields of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[film|theatre/film]].&lt;ref name="Goldberger"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|title=In 1994, What Draws Eyes?

The prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions to the development, promotion and progress of the arts.

==Information==

The Praemium Imperiale is awarded in the memory of His Imperial Highness [[Prince Takamatsu]] (1905–1987), younger brother of [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]] who reigned from 1926 through 1989. Prince Takamatsu was famous for his longtime support of the development, promotion and progress of arts in the world.

The laureates are announced each September; the prize presentation ceremony and related events are held in [[Tokyo, Japan]], each November. The prize presentation ceremony is held in the presence of His Imperial Highness [[Prince Hitachi]], President of the Japan Art Association, at the [http://www.meijikinenkan.gr.jp Meiji Kinenkan] in Tokyo. Prince Hitachi presents the prizes to the selected laureates. The prize consists of a gold medal and 15 million Japanese yen, and was created by the [[Fujisankei Communications Group]], which pays the expenses of around $3 million per year.&lt;ref name="select" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberger" /&gt;

The laureates are annually recommended by international advisers, and decided by an anonymous committee of the Japan Art Association.&lt;ref name="Goldberger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisors|publisher=Official website|url=http://www.praemiumimperiale.org/eg/aboutus/advisors.html|accessdate=January 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020306122558/http://www.praemiumimperiale.org/eg/aboutus/advisors.html|archivedate=March 6, 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advisers include [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], [[William H.

The '''Professional Publishers Association''' ('''PPA'''), formerly known as the '''Periodical Publishers Association''', is a [[publishing]] [[Industry trade group|industry body]] which promotes companies involved in the production of media in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Operations==
Much of the PPA's work is carried out through groups and committees. These include PPA Marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/ppa-marketing |title=PPA Marketing |publisher=Professional Publishers Association |date= |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides insight into the consumer magazine sector; PPA Business, which represents the interests of business media and data publishers; and the Independent Publishers Network (IPN). The PPA has a branch in [[Scotland]] to cater specifically for publishing businesses in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/scotland/ |title=PPA Scotland |publisher=Professional Publishers Association |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PPA is the umbrella body for the [[Periodicals Training Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/about/activities/people-training-careers/ |title=About: Activities: People, Training &amp; Careers |publisher=Professional Publishers Association |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which runs courses and accredits some university journalism and publishing programmes. 

The CEO of the PPA is [[Barry McIlheney]].

The PPA is one of the seventeen Gatekeepers of the United Kingdom Press Card Association.{{what|date=June 2015}}{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Contest==
In 2008, the PPA sponsored a contest, "The Great Cover Debate", to determine the best British magazine covers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magazineweek.net/cover-debate/ |title=The Great Cover Debate |accessdate=2008-10-01 |work=Magazine Week |publisher=Periodical Publishers Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrants were chosen by magazine editors, and a shortlist of 16 covers was selected by an industry panel.  In a public Internet vote, a ''[[Radio Times]]'' cover from May 2005, depicting [[Dalek]]s crossing [[Westminster Bridge]], was chosen as the best cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicole |last=Martin |title=Vote Dalek image voted best magazine cover of all time |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3102812/Vote-Dalek-image-voted-best-magazine-cover-of-all-time.html |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2008-10-01 | location=London | date=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rachael |last=Gallagher |title=Radio Times voted most iconic cover |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=42126&amp;c=1 |work=[[Press Gazette]] |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2008-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards programmes==
The '''PPA Awards''' are presented annually by the Professional Publishers Association (PPA) to recognise and reward members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/events/events/2010/june/the-ppa-awards-2010/ |title=The PPA Awards 2010 |publisher=PPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/536969.php |title=PPA Magazine Awards open to entries for 2010 |publisher=Journalism.co.uk |author=Attiq Sadiq |date=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Periodicals Training council runs two annual awards events, the [[Magazine Academy awards]] and the [[PTC New Talent Awards]].
The Magazine Academy awards judge magazines and digital concepts submitted by students on accredited courses. The overall 2010 winner was Munchkin, a children's food magazine submitted by students from the [[University of Central Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/press-and-media/press-releases/2010/october/ptc-rewards-top-industry-talent-at-magazine-academy/ |title=The Periodical Publishers Association |accessdate=2011-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PTC New Journalist of the Year award focuses on writing, and awards prizes across eight categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/ptc-new-journalist-of-the-year-awards-shortlist/s2/a541106/ |title=journalism.co.uk |accessdate=2011-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8087">'''Psychic distance''' is a perceived difference or distance between objects. The concept is used in [[aesthetics]], [[international business]] and marketing, and computer science.

Psychic distance is made up of the Greek word "psychikos – ψυχικός", an adjective referring to an individual's mind and [[soul]],&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Weiner 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "distance" which implies differences between two subjects or objects. Some therefore argue that the concept exists in the mind's eye of the individual and it is their subjective perception that uniquely determines "psychic distance".&lt;ref&gt;Sousa and Bradley 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As a result it is often viewed as a humanistic reflection of individual acuity and not a collective, organisational or societal perspective. However, in the international business context, psychic distance is frequently measured in terms of national averages&lt;ref&gt;Haakanson &amp; Ambos, Journal of International Management, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of the national-level differences that influence those perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Dow &amp; Karunaratna, Journal of International Business Studies, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, King refers to his preference to use the term "aesthetic distance" rather than psychic distance, as he feels the latter term has misleading connotations in current usage.&lt;ref&gt;[1] Jerry P. King, ''The Art of Mathematics'', New York: Plenum, 1992, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==

In 1912 [[Cambridge University|Cambridge's]] [[Edward Bullough]] wrote of it in a long paper entitled, ''Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle'' which appeared in the British Journal of Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bullough, ''Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle'', British Journal of Psychology: 5 (1912), p87-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he set down in a reasonably complete manner the concept as it applied to the arts.

Evidently, he successfully influenced thinkers 50 years later. Donald Sherburne, for example, says, "Edward Bullough's psychical distance has become "a classic doctrine of aesthetic thinking."&lt;ref name=Sherburne&gt;Donald Sherburne, ''A Whiteheadean Aesthetic'', New York: Yale, 1961, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;  And James L. Jarrett writes of Bullough's ideas, "Perhaps no more influential idea has been introduced into modern aesthetics than that of psychical distance."&lt;ref name=Jarrett&gt;James L. Jarrett, ''The Quest for Beauty'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1957, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical distance construct has been used as an intercultural theme by the arts in the study of creative [[Emotional detachment|detachment]] between East and West.&lt;ref&gt;Odin 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such cameo appearances in other fields, the concept has been essentially "operationalised" by business with the marketing function acting as the chief curator.

==International business and marketing==

In international business (IB) and marketing settings, psychic distance is based on ''perceived'' differences between a home country and a "foreign" country regardless of physical time and space factors which differ across diverse cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Usunier and Lee ''Marketing across Cultures'', Essex, UK: Pearson Education, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subjective type of distance ("perceived differences") unlike the distances forming the CAGE framework, for instance &lt;ref&gt;Ghemawat (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;. This makes psychic distance very difficult to measure, and often times fallacious proxies are used to estimate it (e.g., Kogut &amp; Singh (1988) index using Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions). More accurate approaches rely on asking decision-makers their perceptions towards different host countries (e.g., Hakanson &amp; Ambos, 2010), or using its antecedents to estimate it (psychic distance stimuli: Dow &amp; Karunaratna, 2006). 

The business origins of the "psychic distance" idiom can be traced back to research conducted by Beckerman (1956) and Linnemann (1966). As a fully formed concept Vahlne and Wiedersheim-Paul (1973) as cited by Nordstrom and Vahlne (1992) described psychic distance as "factors preventing or disturbing the flow of information between potential or actual suppliers and customers." These factors are associated with country-based diversities and dissimilarities and can be grouped into four clear areas:

#Linguistic differences and translation difficulty.
#Cultural factors – societal norms, level of individualism or collectivism, values and customs.
#Economic situation – existing trading links, infrastructure, local conditions, competition and investor confidence.
#Political and legal system – government stability and risk of instability, import tariffs, legal protection and taxation levels.

Although the concept was fully formed by the early 1970s, it was the study of [[Norway|Nordic]] [[multinational corporation|multinationals]] by Johanson and Vahlne (1977) which followed on from two earlier studies in 1975 and 1976, that is generally accepted as the concept's real genesis.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa and Bradley 2005b&lt;/ref&gt; The studies concluded that a firm's international activities relate directly to psychic distance and that further international expansion progresses into markets with successively greater psychic distance.

In summary, companies tend to initially export to countries that they understand; then build on their acquired experience to explore opportunities further afield. In other words, firms enter new markets where they are able to identify opportunities with low market uncertainty then enter markets at successively greater psychic distance.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson and Vahlne, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, contemporary literature on the internationalisation process cites psychic distance as a key variable and determinant for expansion into foreign markets.

The psychic distance has also on occasion been measured through formative indicators such as strong commercial relations, close political relations, historic ties, geographic ties, social ties, country information stock, level of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Psychic distance and Australian export market selection|last = Brewer|first = Paul|date = 2007|journal = Australian Journal of Management|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These indicators are deeply analyzed for the international market selection. The measurement of these indicators is best accomplished through an index construction. However, the formative indicators are very context dependent. If they were applied to different industries, countries and entry modes, the indicators would have shifted dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Developing a multidimesional instrument to measure psychic distance stimuli|last = Dow &amp; Karunaratna|first = |date = 2006|journal = Journal of International Business Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==

More recently, Gairola and Chong&lt;ref name=gairolachong&gt;Dhruv Gairola and Siang Yew Chong, "An Economics-Inspired Noise Model in Spatial Games with Reputation", Advances in Intelligent Modelling and Simulation: Artificial Intelligence-based Models and Techniques in Scalable Computing, Studies in Computational Intelligence, Springer Berlin/Heidelberg, vol. 422, pp. 271-293 (2012)  [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d6kj4p2348k01148/]&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated psychic distance to simulate more realistic noise models in spatial games, leading to interesting results, including a manifestation of the psychic distance paradox.

'''Scour Inc.''' was a [[multimedia]] [[Internet search engine]], and provided '''Scour Exchange''', an early [[peer-to-peer]] file exchange service.

==History==
Scour was founded by five students (Vince Busam, Michael Todd, [[Dan Rodrigues]], Jason Droege and Kevin Smilak) from the Computer Science Department of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] ([[UCLA]]) in December 1997. By mid-1998 Ilya Haykinson and [[Travis Kalanick]], also Computer Science students at UCLA joined the founding team. It moved into the spotlight a year later when in June 1998, Scour received its first investment from former Disney president [[Michael Ovitz]] and Ron Burkle of Yucaipa companies.

The company's early products were an [[Server message block|SMB]] search engine and '''Scour Media Agent''', a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] application to download files from SMB shares. The search engine would probe IP addresses for publicly shared files and then index them for download by other users.

&lt;!-- commented out deleted image [[File:sma.jpg|thumb|right|Scour Media Agent]] --&gt;
In 1998, the company developed a [[web search engine]] as well, [[Web crawler|crawling]] the [[World Wide Web]] for links to multimedia audio, video and images.

In 1999 Scour received an investment from [[Michael Ovitz]] and the [[Yucaipa Company]], an investment arm of the billionaire [[Ronald Burkle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB928970934179363266|title=Ovitz, Yucaipa Buy Majority Stake In Entertainment Search Engine|last=Orwall|first=Bruce|date=June 10, 1999|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the total investment represented a controlling share in the company. After the investment, Scour expanded in terms of product offerings and personnel. The company launched a software product named [[MyCaster]] which allowed users to stream audio over the network, optionally mixing microphone input with an [[MP3]] audio file in real time.

Faced with the increasing popularity of [[Napster]], Scour developed a competing peer-to-peer service named Scour Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E2D9113AF931A15756C0A9669C8B63|title=Agent's Role In Music Site May Be Shift In Rights War|last=Richtel|first=Matt|date=May 22, 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Napster, the Scour software supported video and images in addition to just audio files, and integrated all users into one network. The company also tied its web site promotional materials to the Scour Exchange software and attempted to leverage its web and SMB indexes in providing additional search results inside the Scour Exchange application.

In the summer of 2000 the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[National Music Publishers Association]] (NMPA) brought a lawsuit against Scour, alleging copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E7DF173AF932A15754C0A9669C8B63|title=Movie and Record Companies Sue a Film Trading Site|last=Richtel|first=Matt|date=July 21, 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Scour's declarations of innocence, the company was not able to raise money to continue operations.  They laid off most of its staff in September of that year and filed for bankruptcy protection, to protect the company from the lawsuit, shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Well-scrubbed-business-plan-not-enough-for-Scour/2100-1023_3-245445.html|title=Well-scrubbed business plan not enough for Scour|last=Borland|first=John|date=September 7, 2000|work=[[CNET Networks|CNET]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's assets went up for auction and, following a bidding war, all assets were purchased by [[Centerspan Communications]] of [[Portland, Oregon]] in late December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/13/business/fi-64827|title=Scour’s Assets Go to Rival for $9 Million|last=Huffstutter|first=P. J.|date=December 13, 2000|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scour metasearch engine==

Scour has since relaunched in early 2008 as a [[metasearch engine]] combining the three most used search engines—[[Google]], [[Yahoo!]] and [[Live Search]]—into a single [[aggregate data|aggregated]] search page with [[social software|social concepts]]. Scour rewards users with a point for each unique search conducted through the Scour Toolbar or at the website, as well as for commenting or rating a result (to a maximum of three points per search). Points can also be acquired through use of its [[affiliate program]], with a matching 25% commission given to the host of the referral. Once users have accumulated a certain amount of points they can be redeemed for a [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] [[gift card]] or [[PayPal]] [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]]&lt;ref&gt;http://scour.com/learnmore/&lt;/ref&gt; at an implied [[exchange rate]] of approximately [[United States Dollar|USD$]]0.004 ({{frac|2|5}}¢) a point&lt;!-- The FAQ lists three options. The lowest denomination is slightly less; they rounded to 6500 instead of using 6250. --&gt;. The rate for those not in its target [[demographic]], however, is significantly less—only [[United States Dollar|USD$]]0.0001 per point.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scour.com/faq/#16&lt;/ref&gt; The program was cancelled in the summer of 2009.

==Scour redirect virus==
Since as early as 2009 a web browsing virus related to Scour surfaced.&lt;ref name="dave2012"&gt;Dave, Vacha; Saikat, Guha; Zhang, Yin (2012).

Other websites have been reported to be redirected to as well with Scour being the primary one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4151">'''Syndell Studio''' was an [[art gallery]] located in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], California, between 1954 and 1956.

==History==
Syndell Studio was founded in 1954 by [[Walter Hopps]] and [[Jim Newman (television producer)|Jim Newman]], with Michael Scoles, poet Ben Bartosh and his wife Betty Brunt. It was located at 11756 Gorham Avenue, Brentwood, in a (no longer extant) building constructed from used pier pilings and remnants from a demolished [[Santa Monica]] beach club.&lt;ref name=brad&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradnock|first1=Lucy|title=Walter Hopps's Los Angeles Pastoral|journal=Art Journal|date=2012|volume=71|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to oral history interviews with Hopps, Newman, and artist [[Edward Kienholz]], the gallery was named after Maurice Sindel, a Midwestern farmer who died on the highway in Ohio on 6 June 1953.&lt;ref name=Peabody&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peabody|first1=Rebecca et al. (eds)|title=Pacific Standard Time: Los Angeles Art, 1945-80|date=2011|publisher=Getty|location=Los Angeles|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohio Department of Health|title=Certificate of Death|journal=Ohio Historical Society|pages=state file no. 42714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident was witnessed by Newman as he drove from [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]] to Los Angeles. Hopps stated, "It's just too absurd, that this man dies in obscurity. We're going to make him an artist. We're going to create work for him. We're going to put him in group shows. We're going to name our place after him, as though it had been his studio".&lt;ref name=brad/&gt;

The gallery's business cards were created by poet and printmaker Robert Alexander. Alexander and [[Wallace Berman]] designed invitations to exhibitions.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Exhibitions==
On 21 October 1956, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art critic [[Jules Langsner]]  wrote, "For a glimpse of avant-garde art in Los Angeles, the place to go is Syndell Studios".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Langsner|first1=Jules|authorlink=Jules Langser|title=Association Opens Show of 'Human Figure in Art'|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 21, 1956|page=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Syndell Studio co-organised with Gallery 6, San Francisco, the exhibition ''Action'' of abstract painting, which was held at the merry-go-round building on [[Santa Monica Pier]].&lt;ref&gt;Peabody (2011), pp. 63-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndell also co-organised the follow-up ''Action2'' (''Action Squared'') exhibition, held in 1956 at Edward Kienholz's [[Now Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allan|first1=Ken|title=Creating an avant-garde in 1950s Los Angeles: Robert Alexander's hand-printed gallery brochure in the Archives of American Art|journal=Archives of American Art Journal|date=2002|volume=42|issue=3-4|pages=21–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Syndell Studio was featured in the Los Angeles All-City Outdoor Art Festival at [[Barnsdall Art Park|Barnsdall Park]].

'''''The Scoutmaster''''' is a 1956 painting by American illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]]. It was originally created by Rockwell for the 1956 [[Brown &amp; Bigelow]] Boy Scout Calendar. Since then, it has become one of the most collected images that Rockwell created for the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref name="NSM"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Scoutmaster by Norman Rockwell|url = http://www.bsamuseum.org/Exhibitions/CellPhoneTour.aspx|website = National Scouting Museum|publisher = Boy Scouts of America|accessdate = June 3, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131204060437/http://www.bsamuseum.org/Exhibitions/CellPhoneTour.aspx|archivedate = December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Rockwell set out to create a painting dedicated to the Scoutmasters of the United States.&lt;ref name=Scouting78/&gt;  In 1953, he visited the 4th [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|National Scout jamboree]] at [[Irvine Ranch]].&lt;ref name=Oakland&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oakland Area Council|title=The Scoutmaster by Norman Rockwell|url=http://www.sfbac-history.org/OAC_History2.html|publisher=San Francisco Bay Area Council|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell, who used photographs as a source for his paintings, was staging a [[photo shoot]] at the jamboree. He approached a Scoutmaster from Oakland and asked him for four boys to pose for a photo. One of the four chosen was [[Howard Lincoln]] who would become the chairman of [[Nintendo of America]] and later the CEO of the [[Seattle Mariners]]. The four Scouts set up tents and built a fire in the middle of a {{convert|90|F|C}} day.&lt;ref name=Seattle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Payne|first1=Patti|title=M's' Lincoln relives Norman Rockwell moment|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2005/03/07/newscolumn2.html|publisher=American City Business Journals|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell found a professional Scouter at the jamboree headquarters to pose as the Scoutmaster for the all-day photo shoot.&lt;ref name=Scouting78&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillcourt|first1=Bill|title=Norman Rockwell|journal=Scouting|date=1978|volume=66|issue=3|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Lincoln and the other three Scouts each received a $25 check and a letter from Rockwell asking them to sign a release.&lt;ref name=Seattle /&gt; Over the course of the next three years, Rockwell turned the daytime pictures into a nighttime painting. The tents in the painting were modified to be civilian tents with guylines and sidewalls instead of military-style [[Tent#Older tent styles|pup tents]]. It debuted as the 1956 Boy Scout Calendar published by Brown &amp; Bigelow.&lt;ref name=Scouting78/&gt;

==Composition==
The painting is a late night scene that features a [[Scoutmaster]], in full uniform, looking into the dying remains of a campfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rockwell and Csatari: A tour de force|journal=Scouting|date=2008|volume=96|issue=2|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cookware for that night's dinner is still visible. In the background four Scouts are asleep in two [[tent]]s. Lincoln is in a white shirt directly to the right of the Scoutmaster; his face is visible.&lt;ref name=Seattle /&gt;

==Later uses==
The painting was utilized by the Boy Scouts of America as the cover art for the 1960 edition of the ''Scoutmaster's Handbook'' and an issue of the magazine ''[[Boys' Life]]''.&lt;ref name=Scouting78/&gt;

'''''The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock''''' ({{lang-nl|De onderwerping van Diepo Negoro aan luitenant-generaal baron De Kock}}) is an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] painted by [[Nicolaas Pieneman]] between 1830 and 1835. It depicts, from a victorious [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial]]  perspective, the capture of Prince [[Diponegoro]] in 1830, which signaled the end of the [[Java War]] (1825–1830).

==Description==
The painting depicts the capture of Prince [[Diponegoro]], a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] noble and major leader in the [[Java War]], by Lieutenant General [[Hendrik Merkus de Kock]] on 28 March 1830. The arrest is portrayed from a Dutch colonial perspective, with Diponegoro abandoning his followers and submitting peacefully to a confident De Kock as the Dutch flag flies high above the lieutenant general's home.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}} Diponegoro stands a step below De Kock, who is pointing towards the carriage which will take the guerrilla leader into exile.{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=282}}{{sfn|Rajaram|2014|p=155}}

Diponegoro's soldiers leave their weapons on the ground, following their leader's submission;{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}} some throw themselves to the ground in front of him.{{Sfn|Levie|1978|p=190}} All appear submissive to the Dutch power, in what the art historian Werner Krauss describes as recognition that "de Kock's stern action is for the best of the Javanese, and that poor General de Kock had no choice but to send Pangeran Diponegoro away, just like a loving father has to send a misguided son away in order to teach him a valuable lesson".{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=282}}{{sfn|Rajaram|2014|p=155}}

This [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] measures {{convert|77|by|100|cm}}.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}}

==History==
Diponegoro (1785–1855), a descendant of the [[Sultan of Yogyakarta|Sultans of Yogyakarta]], was passed over several times for ascension to the throne.{{sfn|Encarta}} In 1825, after declaring himself [[Ratu Adil]] and his enemies infidels for their lax practice of Islam, he began a war against the reigning sultan and the Dutch colonial government. In the five-year struggle that followed, which was waged over much of central [[Java]], over 200,000 [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and 15,000 Dutch soldiers were killed.{{Sfn|Protschky|2011|p=74}} On 28 March 1830, with most other guerrilla leaders captured, Diponegoro was invited to come to Lieutenant General De Kock's home in [[Magelang]] to negotiate an end of hostilities and guaranteed safety of passage. There, after three hours, Diponegoro was arrested.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}} He was exiled to [[Makassar]], [[Sulawesi]], where he remained until his death.{{sfn|Encarta}}

''The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro'' was commissioned by De Kock{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=279}} or his family.{{Sfn|Levie|1978|p=190}} The artist, [[Nicolaas Pieneman]], never went to the Dutch colony in the Indies, and thus it is unclear upon what he based his depictions of the area around De Kock's home, or the faces and other physical features of those depicted.{{Sfn|Levie|1978|p=190}}
Indeed, the Javanese soldiers appear more Arabian than [[pribumi|indigene]].{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=282}} It is possible that Pieneman was inspired by sketches by De Kock or his adjunct, Major Francois Victor Henri Antoine Ridder de Stuer.{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=282}}{{Sfn|Levie|1978|p=190}}

[[File:Raden Saleh - Diponegoro arrest.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro]]'', by [[Raden Saleh]]]]
This painting was held by the De Kock family, until it was donated to the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam on 29 January 1907 by F.L.W. de Kock. Between 1 December 1993 and 31 March 1994, it was part of an exhibition of colonial art in [[Harderwijk]]. In 2014, it was on display in Room 1.17 of the Rijksmuseum.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum}}

Diponegoro's capture is the subject of another painting, ''[[The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro]]'' by the Javanese nobleman [[Raden Saleh]], which was completed in 1857 and presented to [[William III of the Netherlands|King William III]].{{Sfn|Protschky|2011|p=74}} Opposed to the submissive and beaten Diponegoro of Pieneman's painting, Saleh depicts him as an angry and defiant man who is struggling to control his emotions, on par with or even having more power than De Kock, who is positioned on the left or "female" side.{{Sfn|Protschky|2011|p=74}}{{Sfn|Krauss|2005|p=284}} The author Susie Protschky describes both Pieneman and Saleh's works as "two of the best known history paintings from the Indies".{{Sfn|Protschky|2011|p=74}}

[[File:Reynard-the-fox.jpg|thumb|The trickster figure [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] as depicted in an 1869 children's book by [[Michel Rodange]]]]
In [[mythology]], and in the study of [[folklore]] and [[religion]], a '''trickster''' is a character in a story ([[God (male deity)|god]], [[goddess]], [[spiritual being|spirit]], [[man]], [[woman]], or [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]]), which exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge, and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behaviour.

==Mythology==
Tricksters are [[archetype|archetypal]] characters who appear in the myths of many different cultures. [[Lewis Hyde]] describes the trickster as a "boundary-crosser".&lt;ref name=Hyde&gt;Hyde, Lewis. ''Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The trickster crosses and often breaks both physical and societal rules. Tricksters "...violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis."&lt;ref name=Mattick&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/reviews/980215.15mattict.html|last=Mattick|first=Paul|title=Hotfoots of the Gods|work=New York Times|date=February 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the bending/breaking of rules takes the form of tricks or thievery. Tricksters can be [[wikt:cunning|cunning]] or foolish or both. The trickster openly questions and mocks authority. They are usually male characters, and are fond of breaking rules, boasting, and playing tricks on both humans and gods.

All cultures have tales of the trickster, a crafty creature who uses cunning to get food, steal precious possessions, or simply cause mischief. In some Greek myths [[Hermes]] plays the trickster. He is the patron of thieves and the inventor of lying, a gift he passed on to [[Autolycus]], who in turn passed it on to [[Odysseus]].&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;  In [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] folktales, the trickster and the [[culture hero]] are often combined.

[[File:How loki wrought mischief in Asgard by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|[[Loki]] cuts the hair of the goddess [[Sif]].]]

Frequently the trickster figure exhibits gender and [[shapeshifting|form]] variability. In [[Norse mythology]] the mischief-maker is [[Loki]], who is also a shape shifter. Loki also exhibits gender variability, in one case even becoming pregnant. He [[Loki#Gylfaginning|becomes a mare]] who later gives birth to Odin's eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].

British scholar Evan Brown suggested that [[Jacob]] in the Bible has many of the characteristics of the trickster:&lt;blockquote&gt;The tricks Jacob plays on his twin brother [[Esau]], his father [[Isaac]] and his father-in-law [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] are immoral by conventional standards, designed to cheat other people and gain material and social advantages he is not entitled to. Nevertheless, the Biblical narrative clearly takes Jacob's side and the reader is invited to laugh and admire Jacob's ingenuity–as is the case with the tricksters of other cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Evan. ''The Bible in the Context of World Culture'', Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a wide variety of African language communities, the rabbit, or hare, is the trickster. In West Africa (and thence into the Caribbean via the slave trade), the spider ([[Anansi]]) is often the trickster.

==Archetype==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Remember11]] --&gt;
{{Further|List of fictional tricksters}}
The trickster or clown is an example of a [[Jungian archetype]].  In modern literature the trickster survives as a character archetype, not necessarily supernatural or divine, sometimes no more than a [[stock character]].  Often too, the trickster is distinct in a story by his acting as a sort of catalyst, in that his antics are the cause of other characters' discomfiture, but he himself is left untouched.  A once-famous example of this was the character [[Froggy the Gremlin]] on the early children's television show "Andy's Gang".  A cigar-puffing puppet, Froggy induced the adult humans around him to engage in ridiculous and self-destructive hi-jinks.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, R. L. "[http://home.earthlink.net/~christmascamel/id5.html Remembering Andy Devine]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In later folklore, the trickster/clown is incarnated as a clever, mischievous man or creature, who tries to survive the dangers and challenges of the world using trickery and deceit as a defense.  He also is known for entertaining people as a clown does. For example, many typical [[fairy tale]]s have the king who wants to find the best groom for his daughter by ordering several trials.  No brave and valiant prince or knight manages to win them, until a poor and simple peasant comes.  With the help of his wits and cleverness, instead of fighting, he evades or fools monsters and villains and dangers with unorthodox manners.  Therefore, the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the reward.  More modern and obvious examples of that type include [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Pippi Longstocking]].

==Role in African American literature==
Modern African American literary criticism has turned the trickster figure into an example of how it is possible to overcome a system of oppression from within. For years, [[African American literature]] was discounted by the greater community of American literary criticism while its authors were still obligated to use the language and the rhetoric of the very system that relegated African Americans and other minorities to the ostracized position of the cultural "other." The central question became one of how to overcome this system when the only words available were created and defined by the oppressors. As [[Audre Lorde]] explained, the problem was that "the master's tools [would] never dismantle the master's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorde|first=Audre|chapter=Age, Race, Class, and Sex|title=Literary Theory: An Anthology|editor1-first=Julie|editor1-last=Rivkin|editor2-first=Michael|editor2-last=Ryan|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|page=859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his writings of the late 1980s, [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] presents the concept of [[Signifyin']]. Wound up in this theory is the idea that the "master's house" can be "dismantled" using his "tools" if the tools are used in a new or unconventional way. To demonstrate this process, Gates cites the interactions found in African American narrative poetry between the trickster, [[the Signifying Monkey]], and his oppressor, the Lion.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=990}} According to Gates, the "Signifying Monkey" is the "New World figuration" and "functional equivalent" of the Eshu trickster figure of African Yoruba mythology.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|pp=988–989}} The Lion functions as the authoritative figure in his classical role of "King of the Jungle."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} He is the one who commands the Signifying Monkey's movements. Yet the Monkey is able to outwit the Lion continually in these narratives through his usage of figurative language. According to Gates, "[T]he Signifying Monkey is able to signify upon the Lion because the Lion does not understand the Monkey's discourse…The monkey speaks figuratively, in a symbolic code; the lion interprets or reads literally and suffers the consequences of his folly..."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} In this way, the Monkey uses the same language as the Lion, but he uses it on a level that the Lion cannot comprehend. This usually leads to the Lion's "trounc[ing]" at the hands of a third party, the Elephant.{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=990}} The net effect of all of this is "the reversal of [the Lion's] status as the King of the Jungle."{{sfnp|Gates|2004|p=991}} In this way, the "master's house" is dismantled when his own tools are turned against him.

[[File:Br'er Rabbit and Tar-Baby.jpg|thumb|left|[[Br'er Rabbit]] is a trickster character who succeeds through his wits rather than through strength.]]
Following in this tradition, critics since Gates have come to assert that another popular African American folk trickster, [[Br'er Rabbit]] (a contraction of "Brother Rabbit"), uses clever language to perform the same kind of rebellious societal deconstruction as the Signifying Monkey. Brer Rabbit is the "creative way that the slave community responded to the oppressor's failure to address them as human beings created in the image of God."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=131}} The figurative representative of this slave community, Brer Rabbit is the hero with a "fragile body but a deceptively strong mind" that allows him to "create [his] own symbols in defiance of the perverted logic of the oppressor."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=131}} By twisting language to create these symbols, Brer Rabbit not only was the "personification of the ethic of self-preservation" for the slave community, but also "an alternative response to their oppressor's false doctrine of anthropology."{{sfnp|Earl|1993|p=158}} Through his language of trickery, Brer Rabbit outwits his oppressors, deconstructing, in small ways, the hierarchy of subjugation to which his weak body forces him to physically conform.

Before Gates, there was some precedent for the analysis of African American folk heroes as destructive agents of an oppressive hierarchical system. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]] engaged in an epistolary correspondence.&lt;ref name=North77&gt;North, Michael, ''The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century Literature'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers signed the letters with pseudonyms adopted from the [[Uncle Remus]] tales; Eliot was "[[Virginia opossum|Possum]];" Pound was "[[Tar Baby]]." Pound and Eliot wrote in the same "African slave" dialect of the tales. Pound, writing later of the series of letters, distinguished the language from "the Queen's English, the language of public propriety."&lt;ref name=North77 /&gt; This rebellion against proper language came as part of "collaboration" between Pound and Eliot "against the London literary establishment and the language that it used."&lt;ref name=North77 /&gt; Although Pound and Eliot were not attempting to overthrow an establishment as expansive as the one oppressing the African American slave community, they were actively trying to establish for themselves a new kind of literary freedom. In their usage of the [[Uncle Remus]] trickster figures' names and dialects, they display an early understanding of the way in which cleverly manipulated language can dismantle a restrictive hierarchy.

African American literary criticism and folktales are not the only place in the American literary tradition that tricksters are to be found combating subjugation from within an oppressive system. In ''When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote'', the argument is posited that the Brer Rabbit stories were derived from a mixture of African and [[Native American mythology]], thus attributing part of the credit for the formation of the tales and wiles of Brer Rabbit to "Indian captivity narratives" and the rabbit trickster found in [[Cherokee mythology]].&lt;ref name="Brennan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brennan|first=Jonathan|chapter=Introduction: Recognition of the African-Native American Literary Tradition|title=When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote: African–Native American Literature|editor-last=Brennan|editor-first=Jonathan|location=Urbana and Chicago|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baringer|first=Sandra K.|chapter=Brer Rabbit and His Cherokee Cousin: Moving Beyond the Appropriation Paradigm|title=When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote: African–Native American Literature|editor-last=Brennan|editor-first=Jonathan|location=Urbana and Chicago|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing for a merged "African–Native American folklore", the idea is forwarded that certain shared "cultural affinities" between African Americans and Native Americans allowed both groups "through the trickster tales…survive[d] European American cultural and political domination."&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt;

==In Native American tradition==
While the trickster crosses various cultural traditions, there are significant differences between tricksters in the traditions of different parts of the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many native traditions held [[clown]]s and tricksters as essential to any contact with the [[sacred]]. People could not pray until they had laughed, because [[laughter]] opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to have tricksters within the most sacred [[ceremonies]] for fear that they forget the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most native traditions is essential to creation, to birth.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd Gibbens, Professor of English at [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]; quoted [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] in ''[[Napalm and Silly Putty]]'' by George Carlin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Native American tricksters should not be confused with the European fictional [[picaro]].  One of the most important distinctions is that "we can see in the Native American trickster an openness to life's multiplicity and paradoxes largely missing in the modern Euro-American moral tradition".{{sfnp|Ballinger|1991|p=21}} In some stories the Native American trickster is foolish and other times wise. He can be a hero in one tale and a villain in the next.

In many Native American and First Nations mythologies, the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote spirit]] ([[Southwestern United States]]) or [[Raven (mythology)|Raven spirit]] ([[Pacific Northwest]]) stole fire from the gods ([[star]]s, [[moon]], and/or [[sun]]). Both are usually seen as jokesters and pranksters. In Native American creation stories, when Coyote teaches humans how to catch salmon, he makes the first fish weir out of logs and branches.&lt;ref name=Hyde/&gt;

Wakdjunga in [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] mythology is an example of the trickster archetype.

===Coyote===
{{Main article|Coyote (mythology)}}
[[File:Coyoteinacanoe.png|thumb|left|upright|Coyote often has the role of trickster as well as a clown in traditional stories.]]
The Coyote mythos is one of the most popular among western Native American cultures, especially among [[indigenous peoples of California]] and [[indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|the Great Basin]].

According to [[Crow religion|Crow]] (and other Plains) tradition, Old Man Coyote impersonates the Creator: "Old Man Coyote took up a handful of mud and out of it made people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumca.org/goldrush/fever04-ci.html "Gold Fever California on the Eve- California Indians", Oakland Museum of California]&lt;/ref&gt; He also bestowed names on buffalo, deer, elk, antelopes, and bear. According to A. Hultkranz, the impersonation of Coyote as Creator is a result of a taboo, a mythic substitute to the religious notion of the Great Spirit whose name was too dangerous and/or sacred to use apart from at special ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[Chelan (tribe)|Chelan]] myths, Coyote belongs to the animal people but he is at the same time "a power just like the Creator, the head of all the creatures." while still being a subject of the Creator who can punish him or remove his powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voices of the Winds: Native American Legends|last1=Edmonds|last2=Clark|first1=Margot|first2=Ella E.|publisher=Castle Books|year=2003|isbn=0785817166|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pacific Northwest tradition, Coyote is mostly mentioned as a messenger, or minor power.

As the culture hero, Coyote appears in various mythic traditions, but generally with the same magical powers of transformation, resurrection, and "medicine". He is engaged in changing the ways of rivers, creating new landscapes and getting sacred things for people. Of mention is the tradition of Coyote fighting against monsters. According to Wasco tradition, Coyote was the hero to fight and kill [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]], the killer of people, but he could do that not because of his personal power, but due to the help of the Spirit Chief. In some stories, Multnomah Falls came to be by Coyote's efforts; in others, it is done by Raven.

More often than not Coyote is a trickster, but always different. In some stories, he is a noble trickster: "Coyote takes water from the Frog people... because it is not right that one people have all the water." In others, he is malicious: "Coyote determined to bring harm to Duck. He took Duck's wife and children, whom he treated badly."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==In Internet and multimedia studies==
In online environments there has been a link between the trickster and [[Internet trolling]]. Some have said that a trickster is a type of online community character.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. &amp; Greenhill, A. (2002). "Tribalism, Conflict and Shape-shifting Identities in Online Communities." In the Proceedings of the 13th Australasia Conference on Information Systems, Melbourne Australia, 7–9 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. and Greenhill, A. (2009). "[http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2235/ Conflict and Identity Shape Shifting in an Online Financial Community]", ''Information Systems Journal'', (19:5), pp. 461–478. {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2008.00301.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8140">'''Visual literacy in education''' develops a student's [[visual literacy]] – their ability to comprehend, make meaning of, and communicate through visual means, usually in the form of [[image]]s or [[multimedia]].

==History==
Images have always been involved in learning with pictures and artwork to help define history or literary works. There is also a long tradition of using texts as educational images that reaches back to the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|year=2014|volume=26|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, visual literacy in education is becoming a much broader and extensive body of learning and comprehension. This is due to the integration of images and visual presentations in the curriculum as technology and the increasing availability of computers.&lt;ref name=Stokes2002&gt;Stokes, Suzanne. [http://ejite.isu.edu/Volume1No1/pdfs/stokes.pdf "Visual Literacy in Teaching and Learning: A Literature Perspective."] ''[http://ejite.isu.edu/ Electronic Journal for the Integration of Technology in Education]'', [[Idaho State University]]. Volume 1, No. 1, Spring 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, in education in particular, the conventional approach was that young learners acquired conventions of print which made each student a discursive learner. As we have recognized that there are multiple learning
styles which better suit some students, some are text oriented, others are visual, kinesthetic, auditory, or a combination of two or more, developers of educational materials have adapted and made use of new media and technology. In 1989, there was a call for new curriculum in social studies, which was uniquely suited to bringing visual information to educational programs by introducing map reading skills, charts and graphs for analyzing data, primary source visuals from the period ephemera, and paintings, sculpture, architecture, objects of daily use, and other evidence of material culture that is the archive from which historians draw their information about past and present cultures. Materials that were embraced for their visual energy, authenticity, and characteristic interest to engage students were prepared by a research and development group named Ligature, whose design director, Josef Godlewski (July 3, 1948 – April 8, 2013), a teacher of graphic design at The Rhode Island School of Design, brought to what is now the accepted integration of visuals with text that we see in print and media board learning programs.

==Advancements of multimedia==
[[Multimedia]] advancements have redefined what it means to teach literacy in the classroom. Today, students must be able to present and decode written and visual images, presenting educators with the task of teaching visual literacy in the classroom. Students today are using [[PowerPoint]], [[PhotoStory]], [[MovieMaker]] and other tools to create presentations in the classroom. This presents a challenge to educators as they seek to empower their students with the necessary tools to thrive in a media driven environment.&lt;ref&gt;Riesland, Erin. [http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/literacy/riesland.htm "Visual Literacy and the Classroom."] ''NewHorizons.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators now understand that students lack the skills to accurately decipher and make ethical decisions based on that image. According to Susan Metros of the [[University of Southern California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/SusanEMetros/41090 Susan E. Metros biography], Associate Vice Provost/Deputy CIO/Professor, [[University of Southern California]]&lt;/ref&gt; students find themselves able to view pictures, read a map and input data, but are unable to create an image, map data and understand why one chart is better than another. To better prepare students, school districts are taking it upon themselves to add a technology component to their [[curriculum]]. For example, instead of submitting papers, students can create short films or interactive essays. This promotes a hands-on approach to multimedia for students to learn new tools.&lt;ref&gt;Metros, Susan E. "[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ791201&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ791201 The Educator's Role in Preparing Visually Literate Learners]", ''Theory Into Practice'' 47.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching visual literacy==
Teaching [[visual literacy]] in the classroom means many things from film, dance, and mime through the use of diagrams, maps and graphs to children's picture books. Visual texts can be found in books, the internet, environmental signage, TV, tablet devices and touch-screen machines like ATMs. It includes teaching students to critically analyze the images presented to them through advertising and other media. It also entails equipping students with the tools to create presentations that effectively communicate content. Today teachers are using classroom [[blogs]] and [[wikis]] to keep their students up to date with class requirements and to encourage collaborative class discussions. More and more students are relying on technology to enhance their learning environments.&lt;ref name=Stokes2002/&gt; As technology continues to advance, their availability and capability  will create more tools for teachers to utilize.

An attempt to observe children reading and writing visual texts was made by twenty US and Australian teachers in 1990-94, and followed up in 2011. The results were published in Steve Moline, [http://www.k-8visual.info ''I See What You Mean; Visual literacy K-8''] (Stenhouse, 1995, [http://www.stenhouse.com rev. ed. 2011]). The visual texts studied were limited to those used in information books, e-books, and websites, such as diagrams, maps, storyboards, flowcharts, time lines, webs, trees and tables. Moline claims that the strategy he calls recomposing assists in essay planning and comprehension. Recomposing is described &lt;ref&gt;Steve Moline, ''I See What You Mean'', Stenhouse, 2nd ed., 2011, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; as reading information in a lexical format (such as a paragraph of sentences) and summarizing it in a visual format (such as a flowchart or table). The visual text then forms the framework for the child when writing her/his essay on the topic.

==Benefits==
Computers have become a major part of society. People must learn to communicate through images, as [[technology]] continues to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Burmark, Lynell (2002). "Visual Literacy: Learn to See, See to Learn." Virginia: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in higher education===
As technology advances, so too do the tools that teachers gain in teaching visual literacy skills to students. Scientific [[virtual model]]s and figures, [[digital mapping]], and other computer-based visual programs are all tools available as resources for higher education in schools. These tools can be used to "promote students' capabilities and skills" and create a new understanding of writing and learning in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Felten, Peter. [http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/November-December%202008/abstract-visual-literacy.html Visual Literacy]", ''[[Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning]]'', 40.6 (November/December 2008): 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Volcano School''' refers to a group of non-native Hawaiian artists who painted dramatic nocturnal scenes of Hawaii's erupting volcanoes.  Some of the artists also produced watercolors, which, by the nature of the medium, tended to be diurnal.  At their best, these paintings exemplify a fusion of the European Sublime aesthetic, [[Romanticism|Romantic landscapes]], and the American landscape traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Healoha, "[[Charles Furneaux]] and the Sublime" in ''Honolulu Museum of Art'', Sept-Oct-Nov, 2016, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Two volcanoes on [[Hawaii (island)|the Island of Hawaii]], [[Kilauea]] and [[Mauna Loa]], were intermittently active during the 1880s and 1890s, when interest in Volcano School paintings peaked. Getting to Kilauea, the more frequently painted volcano required an arduous two- or three-day roundtrip journey on horseback.  

Printmaker and art educator [[Huc-Mazelet Luquiens]] called this period "a little Hawaiian renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;Luquiens, Huc-Mazelet, "[[Jules Tavernier (painter)|Jules Tavernier]]" in ''Honolulu Academy of Arts Annual Bulletin'', Vol. 2, 1940, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
[[Jules Tavernier (painter)|Jules Tavernier]] (French 1844–1889) was arguably the most important Volcano School painter.  Other artists include [[Ernst William Christmas]] (Australian 1863–1918), [[Constance Gordon-Cumming|Constance Fredericka Gordon Cumming]] (Scottish 1837–1924), [[Charles Furneaux]] (American 1835–1913), [[D. Howard Hitchcock]] (American 1861–1943), [[Ogura Yonesuke Itoh]] (Japanese 1870–1940), [[Ambrose McCarthy Patterson]] (Australian 1877–1966), [[Titian Peale|Titian Ramsey Peale]] (American 1799–1885), [[Louis Pohl]] (American 1915–1999), [[Eduardo Lefebvre Scovell]] (British 1864–1918), [[William Pinkney Toler]] (American 1826–1899), [[William Twigg-Smith]] (New Zealander 1883–1950), [[Joseph Dwight Strong]] (American 1852–1899) and [[Lionel Walden]] (American 1861–1933).

A selection of Volcano School paintings is usually on display at the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]].

==Related work==
Although the American landscape painter [[Frederic Edwin Church]] produced similar paintings of Ecuador’s [[Cotopaxi|Cotopaxi Volcano]] during and after visits in 1853 and 1857, he is not considered a member of this group and he never visited the Hawaiian Islands.

The Conservancy also removes [[Graffiti]], assists in extinguishing illegal camp fires and cooking fires, and performs whatever other tasks that the [[United States Forest Service]] requests of the organization.

The Forest Service provides the organization with annual safety training and safety oversight, assisting the Conservancy with some of the needed materials and equipment needed to collect, haul, and remove tonnes of garbage left within the West Fork canyon along the river, however the Conservancy volunteers themselves rely upon donations from the general public and upon the charitable purchasing of materials from their own members.

The Conservancy adds a "uniformed presence" which increases compliance for serious safety threats to the forest (such as agreeing to extinguish illegal ground fires and refraining from killing wildlife) by wearing the U. S. Forest Service volunteer uniform which assists to show the recreating public that the public lands remanded to the Forest Service for administration are being maintained despite a decade of extensive budget cuts&lt;ref&gt;Forest Service budget cuts [http://missoulian.com/news/local/usfs-budget-cuts-likely-to-affect-fire-forest-management/article_5784b01a-854a-11e2-a03b-001a4bcf887a.html] Accessed 2013-06-26&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The West Fork Conservancy was created in 2009 by local citizens who liked to do [[Fly fishing]] within the West Fork of the San Gabriel River and found a growing need for unpaid volunteers to lend a hand cleaning up and removing the increasing amounts of pollution and addressing other serious problems caused by over 22.6 million citizens&lt;ref&gt;[[Southern California#Populace|Southern California Population]]&lt;/ref&gt; who live within [[Southern California]], over 1.6 million of which&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/nvum/ Angeles National Forest Visitor Counts]&lt;/ref&gt; recreate in the Angeles National Forest.

== Education Efforts ==

The West Fork Conservancy also provides children and adults with environmental education&lt;ref&gt;Fishing Academy [http://westforksgrc.org/NexGenAcademy.html] Accessed 2013-06-26&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the Conservancy's commitment to improving the health of the West Fork and for the health of the drinking water which deposits in to the San Gabriel Watershed&lt;ref&gt;San Gabriel Watershed [http://www.nps.gov/pwro/sangabriel/] Accessed 2013-06-26&lt;/ref&gt; which millions of citizens in [[Southern California]] rely upon for drinking, irrigation of farm lands, and for industry.

As part of the Conservancy's patrol&lt;ref&gt;Conservancy Patrols [http://westforksgrc.org/Patrols.html] Accessed 2013-06-26&lt;/ref&gt; along the West Fork of the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] the organization engages the general public, discussing environmental issues, safety issues, in addition to assisting the recreating public when there are medical issues, [[Domestic violence]], [[inebriation]], and other safety problems that adversely impact individuals as well as impact the health and safety of the forest and its watershed.
