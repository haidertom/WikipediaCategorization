'''Alexander Seropian''' (born 1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=6&amp;ti=1,6&amp;Search_Arg=Operation%20%3A%20Desert%20Storm&amp;Search_Code=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=HSGyqup0-h60mInWxilDd-XWaE&amp;SEQ=20110507164024&amp;SID=14|title=Copyright Catalog: Operation : Desert Storm|publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]]|date=1991-06-17|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[video game developer]], one of the initial founders and later president of [[Bungie]], the developer of the ''[[Marathon (video game)|Marathon]]'', ''[[Myth (series)|Myth]]'', and ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game series. Seropian became interested in computer programming in college and teamed up with fellow student [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] to publish Jones's game ''[[Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete]]''. The two became partners, and Bungie grew to become the best-known [[Apple Macintosh]] game developer before being bought by Microsoft in 2001.

In 2004, Seropian left Bungie and created [[Wideload Games]], with the goal of streamlining game development. Wideload's small core development team worked with outside contractors to produce ''[[Stubbs the Zombie]]'' and ''[[Hail to the Chimp]]''. Wideload was acquired by Disney in 2009. As part of the deal Seropian became vice president of game development for [[Disney Interactive Studios]]. In 2012 he left the position to start [[Industrial Toys]], a company focusing on mobile games.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Alex Seropian attended the [[University of Chicago]], and joined the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity, where he met one of his future colleagues [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]]. Interested in [[computer programming]], Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree with a concentration in computer science as the Department of Computer Science did not offer undergraduate degrees at the time. He graduated in 1991 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics. Before graduating, Seropian was living with his father, sleeping on his couch, and debating whether to get a job or create his own video game company. Seropian's father advised him to take a job to get experience, but the next day Seropian decided to found his own company. "My dad is a master of reverse psychology", Seropian said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Recchie, Benjamin|date=Fall–Winter 2008|url=http://thecore.uchicago.edu/fallwinter08/got_game.shtml|title=They've Got Game; Tom Kang, AB'88, and Alex Seropian, SB'91, take video gaming beyond swordplay and shoot-'em-up|work=The Core|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bungie===
Seropian's first game was a self-published ''[[Pong]]''-clone called ''[[Gnop!]]'' for [[Apple Macintosh]]. The game was free, although a few customers paid $15 for the game's source code. In 1991 he founded Bungie and published his first commercial game, ''[[Operation Desert Storm (video game)|Operation Desert Storm]]''. Seropian sold 2,500 copies of the game, assembling the game boxes and mailing them out from his bedroom.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"&gt;{{cite web|author=Xbox World 360 |date=2007-10-08 |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-history-of-halo/a-2007100812649684036 |title=The History of Halo; How two students went from Pong clones to the biggest game of all time |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |pages=1–4 |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123041945/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-history-of-halo/a-2007100812649684036 |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian partnered with his Artificial Intelligence classmate [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] to publish Jones's nearly complete ''[[Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete]]''; the game sold around 2,500 copies—it required a then-rare modem for network play&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"/&gt;—it developed a devoted following. After publishing ''Minotaur'', the two formed a partnership.&lt;ref name="bungie-primordial soup gnop"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |date= |url=http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=HistoryOfBungie_p1 |title=Bungie History: Primordial Soup—Gnop! |publisher=[[Bungie]] |accessdate=2009-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929043305/http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=HistoryOfBungie_p1 |archivedate=2009-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next Bungie title, 1993's ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]'', Seropian hired a third team member for graphics work. The game was the first three-dimensional [[texture mapping|texture-mapped]] game on the Mac and the first true [[first-person shooter]].&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"/&gt; By 1994 Bungie had grown to a staff of six and had moved into a rundown Chicago office&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"/&gt;—a converted former religious school located in front of a [[crack house]].&lt;ref name="bungie-pathways"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |date= |url=http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=pathways |title=Bungie History: Primordial Soup—Pathways |publisher=[[Bungie]] |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426200338/http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=pathways |archivedate=2008-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their next title, ''[[Marathon (video game)|Marathon]]'', began development as a sequel to ''Pathways'' but grew larger. On release it won several awards and established Bungie as the top Mac game developer.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"/&gt;

For ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', Seropian noted that the company had to incorporate new features such as surround sound and cinematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/features/view.php?ID=93|title=Interview: Bungie's Alexander Seropian|publisher=[[Inside Mac Games]]|date=2001-12-10|accessdate=2008-04-26|first=Tuncer |last=Deniz| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501062839/http://www.insidemacgames.com/features/view.php?ID=93| archivedate= 1 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Halo'' went on to sell more than 4&amp;nbsp;million units by 2004 and founded a media franchise encompassing sequels, books, and music. Seropian left Bungie in 2002 to spend time with his new family, but also due to frustrations with the game development process.&lt;ref name="cnn-return of innovation"&gt;{{cite news|author=Morris, Chris|date=2004-09-26|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/23/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/|title=The return of innovation? Wave of veteran game developers launch their own studio|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wideload Games===
Seropian founded his own studio in 2004 called [[Wideload Games]], intended to be more streamlined than most video game studios. Calling the method of game development "broken", Wideload began with a staff of 10, with the plan to outsource the lion's share of development, to stay within budget.&lt;ref name="gamesindustry.biz-wideload creation"&gt;{{cite web|author=Fahey, Rob|date=2004-04-26|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/bungie-founder-creates-new-studio-starts-work-on-pcxbox-title|title=Bungie founder creates new studio, starts work on PC/Xbox title|publisher=[[Gamesindustry.biz]]|accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian said that the idea came from figuring out that his decade-old assumptions about how to make games did not necessarily apply to the future.&lt;ref name="ign-wideload interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/509/509117p1.html|title=Wideload Interview|publisher=IGN|date=2004-04-26|accessdate=2008-04-26|first=Steve |last=Butts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian turned to the film industry for cues, saying that it helped to look at an older industry that had been solving the same types of problems for a longer period than video games.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-why seropian sold"/&gt; The external development model allowed Wideload to focus on the creative aspect of a project and added flexibility in what types of projects the team could take on.&lt;ref name="ign-wideload interview"/&gt; Wideload produced two games, 2005's ''[[Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse]]'' and 2008's ''[[Hail to the Chimp]]''.

On September 8, 2009 [[Disney]] acquired Wideload. Seropian joined Disney to head its in-house game development team,&lt;ref name="gamesindustry.biz-wideload acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin, Matt|date=2009-09-08|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/disney-adds-bungie-co-founder-wideload-to-games-team|title=Disney adds Bungie co-founder, Wideload to games team|publisher=[[Gamesindustry.biz]]|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disney Interactive Studios]]. The sale of Wideload was not originally planned: Wideload and Disney began working on a title together, and as conversations turned to a "broader scope and vision", the two companies "discovered [they] had a lot in common," Seropian said.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-why seropian sold"&gt;{{cite web|author=Graft, Kris|date=2009-09-09|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25049|title=Interview: Why Alex Seropian Sold To Disney|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2009-10-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112113653/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25049| archivedate= 12 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian left Disney in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Pligge, Zachary.

===Industrial Toys===
In 2012, Seropian founded a studio named [[Industrial Toys]]. The company plans to develop mobile games for core gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/02/23/halo-co-creator-alex-seropian-founds-industrial-toys-focused-on/|title=Halo co-creator Alex Seropian founds Industrial Toys, focused on mobile|publisher=Joystiq|first=Mike|last=Schramm|date=2012-02-23|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first title by Industrial Toys, ''[[Midnight Star (video game)|Midnight Star]]'', was announced to be a sci-fi shooter designed with touch-based mobile platforms in mind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2012/12/11/halo-creator-alex-seropian-explains-how-hes-changing-mobile-games-with-shooter-morning-star/|title=Halo Creator Alex Seropian Explains How He's Changing Mobile Games With Shooter Morning Star|publisher=[[Forbes]]|first=John|last=Gaudiosi|date=2012-12-11|accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Grigoryevich Abramov''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Григорьевич Абрамов}}, born 1959) is a Russian former scientist who became an industrial magnate as one of the two heads of [[Evraz]], Russia's largest steel producer. Beginning in 1998, at one point he had amassed the largest steel and iron empire in Russia, which employed 125,000 people, controlling about 22 percent of the country's total steel output with an annual turnover of $20&amp;nbsp;billion. A business partner and ally of [[Aleksandr Frolov (businessman)|Aleksandr Frolov]] and [[Roman Abramovich]], Abramov was in March 2015 listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' as having an estimated net worth of $4.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

==Education==
He graduated from the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bio.fizteh.ru/graduate/years/1982.html DMCP graduates]. [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] Class of 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
EvrazHolding is a product of Russia's growth since the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 financial crisis]] and Abramov is representative of the second wave of Russian magnates who went into business after the best assets had been taken. Unlike the first wave of politically connected oligarchs, such as [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] and [[Vladimir Potanin]], Abramov had neither political leverage nor financial resources to help him benefit from Russia's chaotic [[privatisation]] of the 1990s.

In recent years Evraz-Holding has emerged as one of the most aggressive vertically integrated business groups in Russia. Its assets include three large steel mills, three coal mines and several ore-enriching plants, as well as a large commercial port, [[Nakhodka]], in the east of the country.

==Commercial entrepreneurship==
===Trading===
He used his contacts with Russia's steel mills, which used high-temperature technologies, and offered his services not as a scientist but as a metal trader. Trading was a popular and quick way to make money in Russia in the early 1990s. The economy was shrinking, non-payment was a chronic problem and any offer of cash from a trader was welcomed by factories. By 1997, trading was less profitable and many trading companies, including Abramov's, were owed large sums by producers. Abramov began buying factories and [[debt restructuring|swapped debt for equity]] in the [[Nizhny Tagil]] steel mill, while also buying stakes in its rail-producing plant from other shareholders.

===Acquisitions, monopolies and factories===
While the first wave of Russian oligarchs grabbed whatever assets they could, Mr Abramov acquired them in a much more focused way. He decided to build a monopoly for [[Rail tracks#Railway rail|rail]] and steel construction products and looked for factories that would give him synergies. The only other big factories making these products were in the industrial region of [[Kemerovo]], also home to Russia's largest coalmines. Using his old trading contacts with coalmine bosses, Abramov was introduced to [[Aman Tuleev]], populist governor of the region.

===Pitching job creation in the vacuum of bankrupt factories===
The two factories Abramov was interested in were in bankruptcy in 1998. Salaries had not been paid for up to eight months and strikes were breaking out.

====The deal: managers for factories====
Tuleev needed good managers. Abramov needed the two factories and soon a deal was made.

As a state creditor, Tuleev would help appoint external managers loyal to EvrazHolding to run the steel mills. Abramov would pay salaries and taxes, guarantee jobs and support Tuleev's social projects.

====Competition against Alfa Group====
This pitched Abramov against [[Alfa Group]], one of the most influential [[oligarchy|oligarch]] groups, which controlled one of the factories. While groups such as Alfa were shedding non-core assets, Abramov and his like were building empires.&lt;ref&gt;The science of forging a steel empire, Financial Times (UK), 27 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005 EvrazHolding was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Five months later, Abramov resigned as group president but remains a member of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of directors|url=https://www.evraz.com/governance/directors/|website=Evraz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acquisitions====
He has made numerous strategic business [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. For example, in 2007 Abramov acquired [[Oregon Steel Mills]] and [[Claymont Steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Abramov |url=http://www.russiancapitalistwiki.com/wiki/Alexander_Abramov |publisher=Russian Capitalist Wiki |accessdate=11 November 2013 |author=Russian Capitalist Wiki contributors |date=8 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111192421/http://www.russiancapitalistwiki.com/wiki/Alexander_Abramov |archivedate=11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Zscore.JPG|thumb|Example of an [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] spreadsheet that uses Altman Z-score to predict the [[probability]] that a firm will go into [[bankruptcy]] within two years ]]
The '''Z-score formula for predicting bankruptcy''' was published in 1968 by [[Edward I. Altman]], who was, at the time, an Assistant Professor of Finance at [[New York University]]. The formula may be used to predict the probability that a firm will go into [[bankruptcy]] within two years.  Z-scores are used to predict corporate defaults and an easy-to-calculate control measure for the [[financial distress]] status of companies in academic studies.  The Z-score uses multiple corporate income and balance sheet values to measure the financial health of a company.

==The formula==
The Z-score is a [[linear combination]] of four or five common business ratios, weighted by coefficients.  The coefficients were estimated by identifying a set of firms which had declared bankruptcy and then collecting a [[pair-matched sample|matched sample]] of firms which had survived, with matching by industry and approximate size (assets).

Altman applied the statistical method of [[discriminant analysis]] to a dataset of publicly held manufacturers. The estimation was originally based on data from publicly held manufacturers, but has since been re-estimated based on other datasets for private manufacturing, non-manufacturing and service companies.

The original data sample consisted of 66 firms, half of which had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.  All businesses in the database were manufacturers, and small firms with assets of &lt;&amp;nbsp;$1 million were eliminated.

The original Z-score formula was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;realequityresearch.dk/Documents/Z-Score_Altman_1968.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Z'' = 1.2''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.4''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3.3''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.6''X''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.0''X''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = working capital / total assets.  Measures liquid assets in relation to the size of the company.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = retained earnings / total assets.  Measures profitability that reflects the company's age and earning power.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = earnings before interest and taxes  / total assets. Measures operating efficiency apart from tax and leveraging factors.  It recognizes operating earnings as being important to long-term viability.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = market value of equity / book value of total liabilities. Adds market dimension that can show up security price fluctuation as a possible red flag.

: ''X''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = sales / total assets.  Standard measure for total asset turnover (varies greatly from industry to industry).

Altman found that the ratio profile for the bankrupt group fell at −0.25 avg, and for the non-bankrupt group at +4.48 avg.

==Precedents==
Altman's work built upon research by accounting researcher [[William Beaver]] and others.  In the 1930s and on, Mervyn and others had collected matched samples and assessed that various accounting ratios appeared to be valuable in predicting bankruptcy. Altman's Z-score is a customized version of the discriminant analysis technique of [[R. A. Fisher]] (1936).

William Beaver's work, published in 1966 and 1968, was the first to apply a statistical method, [[t-tests]] to predict bankruptcy for a pair-matched sample of firms.  Beaver applied this method to evaluate the importance of each of several accounting ratios based on univariate analysis, using each accounting ratio one at a time.  Altman's primary improvement was to apply a statistical method, discriminant analysis, which could take into account multiple variables simultaneously.

==Accuracy and effectiveness==
In its initial test, the Altman Z-Score was found to be 72% accurate in predicting bankruptcy two years before the event, with a Type II error (false negatives) of 6% (Altman, 1968). In a series of subsequent tests covering three periods over the next 31 years (up until 1999), the model was found to be approximately 80%–90% accurate in predicting bankruptcy one year before the event, with a Type II error (classifying the firm as bankrupt when it does not go bankrupt) of approximately 15%–20% (Altman, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ealtman/Zscores.pdf Predicting Financial Distress of Companies: Revisiting the Z-SCORE and ZETA Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1985 onwards, the Z-scores gained wide acceptance by auditors, management accountants, courts, and database systems used for loan evaluation (Eidleman). The formula's approach has been used in a variety of contexts and countries, although it was designed originally for publicly held manufacturing companies with assets of more than $1 million. Later variations by Altman were designed to be applicable to privately held companies (the Altman Z'-Score) and non-manufacturing companies (the Altman Z"-Score).

Neither the Altman models nor other balance sheet-based models are recommended for use with financial companies. This is because of the opacity of financial companies' balance sheets and their frequent use of off-balance sheet items. There are market-based formulas used to predict the default of financial firms (such as the [[Merton Model]]), but these have limited predictive value because they rely on market data (fluctuations of share and options prices to imply fluctuations in asset values) to predict a market event (default, i.e., the decline in asset values below the value of a firm's liabilities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ealtman/Zscores.pdf Predicting Financial Distress of Companies:Revisiting the Z-SCORE and ZETA Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">The '''articles of organization''' are a document similar to the [[articles of incorporation]], outlining the initial statements required to form a [[limited liability company]] (LLC) in many [[U.S. state]]s. Some states refer to articles of organization as a certificate of organization or a certificate of formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLC filing forms all 50 states |url=https://www.llcuniversity.com/llc-filing-forms-by-state/|website=LLCUniversity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once filed and approved by the Secretary of State, or other [[List of company registers|company registrar]], the articles of organization legally create the LLC as a registered business entity within the state.

For terms of similar meaning in other countries, see [[Articles of association]].
==United States==
The articles of organization outline the governance of an LLC along with the [[operating agreement]] and the corporate [[Statute|statutes]] in the state where articles of organization are filed.

The articles of organization document typically includes the name of the LLC, the type of legal structure (e.g. limited liability company, professional limited liability company, series LLC), the [[registered agent]], whether the LLC is managed by members or managers, the effective date, the duration (perpetual by default in most states), and the names and signatures of the organizer(s).

Most secretaries of state provide fill-in-the-blank [[PDF]] templates to file with the state. Some people use the services of an attorney to draft articles of organization. Articles must be drafted to meet the state requirements to form a LLC.

The state fee to file articles of organization to form a traditional LLC range from $40 - $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entity formation fees |url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/entity-formation-fees|website=Harbor Compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of what the Articles promulgate, the LLC is bound by the specific state laws that it is formed under. A common misconception is that LLCs formed by improper articles of organization do not have the [[Limited liability|limitation of liability protection]] allowed by the state. If the state statute allows for limitation of the members' and managers' liability, the said members and managers are covered under that protection regardless of what articles of organization state.

[[File:Bayes' Theorem MMB 01.jpg|thumb|alt=text|Bayes' Theorem]]
In [[marketing]], [[Bayesian inference]] allows for decision making and [[market research]] evaluation under uncertainty and with limited data.

==Introduction==
[[Bayes’ theorem]] is fundamental to [[Bayesian inference]]. It is a subset of [[statistics]], providing a mathematical framework for forming [[inferences]] through the concept of [[probability]], in which evidence about the true state of the world is expressed in terms of degrees of belief through subjectively assessed numerical probabilities. Such a probability is known as a [[Bayesian probability]]. The fundamental ideas and concepts behind Bayes' theorem, and its use within Bayesian inference, have been developed and added to over the past centuries by [[Thomas Bayes]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]] as well as numerous other mathematicians, statisticians and scientists.&lt;ref name=x&gt;McGrayne, S. B. (2011). ''The Theory that Would Not Die'', New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayesian inference has experienced spikes in popularity as it has been seen as vague and controversial by rival [[Frequentist probability|frequentist]] statisticians.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Green, P. E. and Frank, R. E. (1966). “Bayesian Statistics and Marketing Research”, [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C]] 15 (3): 173-190. {{jstor|2985299}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few decades Bayesian inference has become widespread in many scientific and social science fields such as [[marketing]]. Bayesian inference allows for decision making and market research evaluation under uncertainty and limited data.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Olshausen B. A. (2004) “Bayesian Probability Theory” http://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/npb163/bayes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bayes’ theorem==
Bayesian probability specifies that there is some [[prior probability]]. Bayesian statisticians can use both an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] approach when interpreting the prior probability, which is then updated in light of new relevant information. The concept is a manipulation of [[conditional probabilities]]:&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(AB)=P(A|B)P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, a more simple understanding of the formula may be reached by substituting the events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to become respectively the hypothesis &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[data]] &lt;math&gt;(D)&lt;/math&gt;.  The rule allows for a judgment of the relative truth of the hypothesis given the data.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

This is done through the calculation shown below, where &lt;math&gt;P(D|H)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[likelihood function]]. This assesses the probability of the observed data &lt;math&gt;(D)&lt;/math&gt; arising from the hypothesis &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;P(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the assigned prior probability or initial belief about the hypothesis; the denominator &lt;math&gt;P(D)&lt;/math&gt; is formed by the integrating or summing of &lt;math&gt;P(D|H)P(H)&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;P(H|D)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Posterior probability|posterior]] which is the recalculated probability, or updated belief about the hypothesis. It is a result of the prior beliefs as well as sample information. The posterior is a conditional distribution as the result of collecting or in consideration of new relevant data.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(H|D)=\frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D)}&lt;/math&gt;

To sum up this formula: the posterior probability of the hypothesis is equal to the prior probability of the hypothesis multiplied by the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the new evidence.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Paulos, J. A. (2011) “The Mathematics of Changing your Mind” Book review, New York Times. (August 5th p14 sunday book review)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in marketing==

===History===
While the concepts of Bayesian statistics are thought to date back to 1763, marketers' exposure to the concepts are relatively recent, dating from 1959.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;  Subsequently, many books&lt;ref name=d&gt;Chernoff, H. and Moses, L. E.  (1959). Elementary Decision Theory. New York: Wiley; London: Chapman &amp; Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e&gt;Schlaifer, R. (1959). Probability and Statistics for Business Decisions, New York: McGraw Hill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f&gt;Rossi, P. E., Allenby, G. M. and McCulloch, R. (2005). ''Bayesian Statistics and Marketing'', New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; and articles&lt;ref name=g&gt;Roberts, H. V. (1960). “The New Business Statistics”, ''Journal of Business'' 33 (1): 21-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h&gt;Pratt, J. W., Raiffa, H. and Schlaifer, R. (1964). ”The Foundations of Decision Under Uncertainty: An Elementary Exposition”, ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'' 59 (306): 353- 375&lt;/ref&gt; have been written about the application of Bayesian statistics to marketing decision-making and [[market research]]. It was predicted that the Bayesian approach would be used widely in the marketing field but up until the mid-1980s the methods were considered impractical.&lt;ref name=i&gt;Rossi, P.E., Allenby. G. M (2003) "Bayesian Statistics and Marketing" ''Marketing Science'' 22 (3): 304-328&lt;/ref&gt; The resurgence in the use of Bayesian methods is largely due to the developments over the last few decades in computational methods; and expanded availability of detailed marketplace data - primarily due to the birth of the [[world wide web]] and explosion of the [[internet]].

===Application in marketing===
Bayesian decision theory can be applied to all four areas of the [[marketing mix]].&lt;ref name=j&gt;Alderson, W., Green, P. E. (1964) ''Planning and Problem Solving in Marketing''. Richard D. Irwin Inc Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; Assessments are made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The decision maker can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, but it should be noted that in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a [[weighted mean]] of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The decision maker can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed [[Numerical data|quantitatively]] in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.

====New product development====

{{Main|New product development}}

The use of Bayesian [[decision theory]] in new product development allows for the use of subjective prior information.  Bayes in new product development allows for the comparison of additional review project costs with the value of additional information in order to reduce the costs of uncertainty. The methodology used for this analysis is in the form of [[decision trees]] and ‘stop’/‘go’ procedures. If the predicted payoff (the posterior) is acceptable for the organisation the project should go ahead, if not, development should stop. By reviewing the posterior (which then becomes the new prior) on regular intervals throughout the development stage managers are able to make the best possible decision with the information available at hand. Although the review process may delay further development and increase costs, it can help greatly to reduce uncertainty in high risk decisions.

====Pricing decisions====

{{Main|Pricing}}

[[Bayesian decision theory]] can be used in looking at pricing decisions. Field information such as retail and wholesale prices as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies. This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies does have its limitations as it requires a number of assumptions to be made about the market place in which an organisation operates. As markets are dynamic environments it is often difficult to fully apply Bayesian decision theory to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.

====Promotional campaigns====

{{Main|Promotion (marketing)}}

When dealing with promotion a marketing manager must account for all the market complexities that are involved in a decision. As it is difficult to account for all aspects of the market, a manager should look to incorporate both experienced judgements from senior executives as well modifying these judgements in light of economically justifiable information gathering. An example of the application of Bayesian decision theory for promotional purposes could be the use of a test sample in order to assess the effectiveness of a promotion prior to a full scale rollout. By combining prior subjective data about the occurrence of possible events with experimental empirical evidence gained through a test market, the resultant data can be used to make decisions under risk.

====Channel decisions and the logistics of distribution====

{{Main|Logistics}}

Bayesian decision analysis can also be applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. Prior information can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a [[normal distribution]]. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model that helps to assess the ramifications of change in distribution method. Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.

==Strengths==

The Bayesian approach is superior to use in decision making when there is a high level of uncertainty or limited information in which to base decisions on and where expert opinion or historical knowledge is available. Bayes is also useful when explaining the findings in a probability- sense to people who are less familiar and comfortable with comprehending statistics. It is in this sense that Bayesian methods are thought of as having created a bridge between business judgments and statistics for the purpose of decision-making.&lt;ref name=k&gt;Roberts, H. V. (1963). “Bayesian Statistics in Marketing” Journal of Marketing 27 (1):1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The three principle strengths of Bayes' theorem that have been identified by scholars are that it is prescriptive, complete and coherent.&lt;ref name=l&gt;Little, R.(2006). “Calibrated Bayes: A Bayes/ Frequentist Roadmap”, The American Statistician 60 (3): 213-233&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive in that it is the theorem that is the simple prescription to the conclusions reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning for the consistent decision maker.
It is complete because the solution is often clear and unambiguous, for a given choice of model and prior distribution. It allows for the incorporation of prior information when available to increase the robustness of the solutions, as well as taking into consideration the costs and risks that are associated with choosing alternative decisions.&lt;ref name=m&gt;Wald, A.(1950). “Statistical Decision Functions”, in: Kotz, S. And Johnson, N. L. (Eds.) (1992). Breakthroughs in Statistics: Foundations and Basic Theory, New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;
Lastly Bayes theorem is coherent. It is considered the most appropriate way to update beliefs by welcoming the incorporation of new information, as is seen through the [[probability distributions]] (see Savage&lt;ref name=n&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954). The Foundations of Statistics, New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; and De Finetti&lt;ref name=o&gt;De Finetti, B. (1974). The Theory of Probability, New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;). This is further complemented by the fact that Bayes inference satisfies the likelihood principle,&lt;ref name =p&gt;Birnbaum, A. (1962). “On the Foundations of Statistical Inference”, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 57 (298), 269- 306. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2281640&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which states that models or inferences for datasets leading to the same likelihood function should generate the same statistical information.
Bayes methods are more cost effective than the traditional frequentist take on marketing research and subsequent decision making. The probability can be assessed from a degree of belief before and after accounting for evidence, instead of calculating the probabilities of a certain decision by carrying out a large number of trials with each one producing an outcome from a set of possible outcomes. The planning and implementation of trials to see how a decision impacts in the ‘field’ e.g. observing consumers reaction to a relabeling of a product, is time consuming and costly, a method many firms cannot afford. In place of taking the frequentist route in aiming for a universally acceptable conclusion through [[iteration]],&lt;ref name=q&gt;Bradley, E(2005). “Bayesians, Frequentists, and Scientists”, Journal of the American Statistical Association 100 (469):1- 5. http://search.proquest.com/docview/274829688&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes more effective to take advantage of all the information available to the firm to work out the ‘best’ decision at the time, and then subsequently when new knowledge is obtained, revise the posterior distribution to be then used as the prior, thus the inferences continue to [[logic]]ally contribute to one another based on Bayes theorem.&lt;ref name=r&gt;[https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/PDF/default/statug.pdf SAS Institute Inc. (2009). SAS/STAT® 9.2 User’s Guide, Second Edition, Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaknesses==
In marketing situations, it is important that the prior probability is (1) chosen correctly, and (2) is understood.  A disadvantage to using Bayesian analysis is that there is no ‘correct’ way to choose a prior, therefore the inferences require a thorough analysis to translate the subjective prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior to ensure that the results will not be misleading and consequently lead to the disproportionate analysis of preposteriors.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; The subjective definition of probability and the selection and use of the priors have led to statisticians critiquing this subjective definition of probability that underlies the Bayesian approach.&lt;ref name=l/&gt;
Bayesian probability is often found to be difficult when analysing and assessing probabilities due to its initial [[counter intuitive]] nature. Often when deciding between [[strategy|strategies]] based on a decision, they are interpreted as:  where there is evidence X that shows condition A might hold true, is misread by judging A's likelihood by how well the evidence X matches A, but crucially without considering the prior frequency of A.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt; In alignment with [[falsifiability|Falsification]], which aims to question and falsify instead of prove hypotheses, where there is very strong evidence X, it does not necessarily mean there is a very high probability that A leads to B, but in fact should be interpreted as a very low probability of A not leading to B.
In the field of marketing, behavioural experiments which have dealt with managerial decision- making,&lt;ref name=s&gt;Green, P. E., Peters, W. S. and Robinson, P. J. (1966). “A Behavioural Experiment in Decision- Making under Uncertainty”, Journal of Purchasing, 2: 18-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t&gt;Starbuck, W. H. and Bass, F. M. (1965). An Experimental Study of Risk-taking and the Value of Information in a New Product Context. Institute Paper No. 117. Herman C. Krannert Graduate School of Industrial Administration, Perdue University&lt;/ref&gt; and [[risk perception]],&lt;ref name=u&gt;Baur, R. A. (1960). “Consumer Behaviour as Risk Taking”, Proc. 43rd National Conference American Marketing Association., 389-398. Chicago: American Marketing Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=v&gt;Cox, D. F. and Rich, S. (1964). “Perceived Risk and Consumer Decision-making- The Case of Telephone Shopping”, Journal of Marketing Research, 1 (4): 32-39&lt;/ref&gt; in consumer decisions have utilised the Bayesian model, or similar models, but found that it may not be relevant quantitatively in predicting human information processing behaviour. Instead the model has been proven as useful as a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] means of describing how individuals combine new evidence with their predetermined judgements. Therefore, “the model may have some value as a first approximation to the development of descriptive choice theory” in consumer and managerial instances.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

==Example==
An [[advertising]] manager is deciding whether or not to increase the advertising for a product in a particular [[Market (economics)|market]]. The Bayes approach to this decision suggests: 1) These alternative courses of action for which the consequences are uncertain are a necessary condition in order to apply Bayes';  2) The advertising manager will pick the course of action which allows him to achieve some objective i.e. a maximum return on his advertising investment in the form of profit; 3) He must determine the possible consequences of each action into some measure of success (or loss) with which a certain objective is achieved.

This 3 component example explains how the payoffs are conditional upon which outcomes occur. The advertising manager can characterize the outcomes based on past experience and knowledge and devise some possible events that are more likely to occur than others. He can then assign to these events prior probabilities, which would be in the form of numerical weights.&lt;ref name=w&gt;Green, P. E. (1962) “Bayesian Decision Theory in Advertising”. Journal of Advertising 33-42&lt;/ref&gt;

He can test out his predictions (prior probabilities) through an [[experiment]]. For example, he can run a test campaign to decide if the total level of advertising should be in fact increased. Based on the outcome of the experiment he can re-evaluate his prior probability and make a decision on whether to go ahead with increasing the advertising in the market or not.  However gathering this additional data is costly, time consuming and may not lead to perfectly reliable results. As a decision makers he has to deal with experimental and [[systematic error]] and this is where Bayes' comes in.

It approaches the experimental problem by asking; is additional data required? If so, how much needs to be collected and by what means and finally, how does the decision maker revise his prior judgment in light of the results of the new experimental evidence? In this example the advertising manager can use the Bayesian approach to deal with his dilemma and update his prior judgments in light of new information he gains.  He needs to take into account the profit (utility) attached to the alternative acts under different events and the value versus cost of information in order to make his optimal decision on how to proceed.

==Bayes in computational models==
[[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) is a flexible procedure designed to fit a variety of Bayesian models. It is the underlying method used in [[computer simulation|computational]] software such as the [[LaplacesDemon]] [[R (programming language)|R]] Package and [[WinBUGS]].  The advancements and developments of these types of statistical software have allowed for the growth of Bayes by offering ease of calculation. This is achieved by the generation of samples from the posterior distributions, which are then used to produce a range of options or strategies which are allocated numerical weights. MCMC obtains these samples and produces summary and diagnostic statistics while also saving the posterior samples in the output. The decision maker can then assess the results from the output data set and choose the best option to proceed.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6902">A '''chief web officer''' ('''CWO''') is the highest-ranking [[Corporate title|corporate officer]] ([[Senior management|executive]]) in charge of an organisation's Web presence, including all internet and intranet sites. As a corporate officer position, the CWO reports directly to the [[CEO]]. A CWO will generally be very skilled with [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[Javascript]], [[PHP]], ASP, [[SQL]], et cetera. It is not as common a role as the growing [[chief digital officer]]. 

A CWO should have a great understanding of [[computers]], [[systems]], and [[Computer programming|programming]]. Not only does this position require knowledge of various programming languages, it may also include skill and ability in digital graphics, design, and creative writing. Modern CWOs have tasks greater than being a [[webmaster]] or a [[web developer]], instead they are taken to an extent of controlling the entire online presence for their company. Overall, a CWO position is the most prestigious title for a web developer to achieve.

Many companies don't have CWOs because the position requires an individual who has knowledge in numerous fields; Instead companies may split their web presence in different titles: [[Front End Development|Front-End Developers]], [[Back-end database|Back-End Developers]], [[Server-side scripting|Server Programmers]], Webmasters, [[Web Designer|Web Designers]] and [[Graphic artist|Graphic Artists]]. Typically, a CWO is fluent in all titles listed above and has many responsibilities.

==Genesis of the CWO role==
A 1999 CIO magazine cover story asked the question: Is it time for corporations to create a new executive position—Chief Web Officer—to "oversee the strategies of company intranets, extranets and Web sites?"&lt;ref name="Jahnke1999"&gt;
{{Cite journal
  | last = Jahnke  | first = Art
  | title = The Powers That May Be: Executive Offices: Some CIOs think it's time for corporate America to anoint the Chief Web Officer
  | journal = CIO, Section 2, WebBusiness
  | volume = 12
  | issue = 12
  | pages = 28–37
  | publisher = CIO
  | location = USA
  | date = 1 April 1999
  | issn = 0894-9301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The six experts interviewed for the article were split in their viewpoints. Some argued that the tasks associated with any new position should be handled by IT staff already within the company or guided directly by the [[CEO]]. Others said that, because a typical [[Chief information officer|CIO]] was too focused on technology issues, there should be a new position created "to coordinate all Web-based activities and to put resources, both people and capital, into his or her organisation."&lt;ref name="Jahnke1999"/&gt;

The earliest creation of the CWO role by a [[Fortune 500]] company may have been in 1999, by [[Colgate-Palmolive]].&lt;ref name="Thompson1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.colgate.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=96893 |title=Colgate-Palmolive Names Jack Haber Chief Web Officer |first=Bina |last=Thompson |date=August 1999 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "Chief Web Officers Take Charge" in the March 20, 2000 issue of 'Inter@ctive Week' explored the roles and responsibilities of CWOs through interviews and a survey of Web professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Chief Web Officers Take Charge | journal = Inter@ctive Week | date = 2000-03-20 | first = Todd | last = Sprangler | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 70–76| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 2005, more writers began calling attention to the need to create a CWO position.&lt;ref name="Cherian2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articleslash.net/Home-Based-Business/38295__One-Simple-Strategy-to-Organize-Your-Online-Business.html |title=One Simple Strategy to Organize Your Online Business |first=Abe |last=Cherian |date=September 2005 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingmon2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brainfuel.tv/this-company-wasted-200000-on-a-junk-web-site-or-why-its-time-for-a-cwo |title=It's Time for a Chief Web Officer |first=Chris |last=Tingmon |date=April 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stopforth2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brainfuel.tv/this-company-wasted-200000-on-a-junk-web-site-or-why-its-time-for-a-cwo |title=Where Does the Web Fit? |first=Mike |last=Stopforth |date=November 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlind2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/does-your-company-need-a-chief-web-officer/3982 |title=Does your company need a Chief Web Officer? |first=David |last=Berlind |date=November 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors pointed to the need for an organization to have an executive at the [[Corporate title|C-level]] focused on coordinating and directing all Web-related activities. Cherian posed the need for the CWO position within an enterprise with the simple question: "Do you have a central internet group (CIG) directed by a chief Web officer and composed of dedicated staff for each business function?"&lt;ref name="Cherian2005"/&gt;

==Contrast with CIO and CTO==
The position of CWO has emerged distinctly from the positions of Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) because of the need to focus on and coordinate an organisation's entire Web environment and presence. A CIO typically focuses on IT planning, procurement, and architecture for the enterprise; a [[Chief technical officer#Contrast with Chief Information Officer .28CIO.29|CTO]] "is principally overseeing development of new technologies."

==Responsibilities==
Responsibilities of the CWO position vary among enterprises, depending on the needs and goals of the [[business]]. A CWO should have a deep and broad understanding of the Web and [[website governance]] issues. Some of the issues within the CWO jurisdiction could include [[Web strategy|online strategy]], [[budget]]ing, systems and software administration, [[Web hosting service|hosting]], online [[Internet marketing|marketing]] and [[communications]], [[e-commerce]], [[customer service]], [[business development]], [[online community]] and [[social media]], [[web content development]] and [[workflow]]s, [[Web graphic design|website graphic design]], [[user experience]] (analysis/design), [[Information architecture|information/data architecture]], [[Web analytics|website analytics]], [[Internet security|security]], [[Archiving#Web archiving|archiving]], [[Accessibility#Telecommunications and IT access|accessibility]], legal issues (for example, [[copyright]], [[Digital rights management|DRM]], [[trademark]], and [[privacy]]), and [[training]], among others.

'''Comminution''' is the reduction of [[solid]] [[material]]s from one average [[particle size]] to a smaller average particle size, by [[Crusher|crushing]], [[Mill (grinding)|grinding]], [[cutting]], [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrating]], or other processes.&lt;ref name="Gupty 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gupty|first=Chiranjib Kumar|title=Chemical Metallurgy|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag|year=2003|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PAarkWieIQC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=comminution&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q4txTMGGKMah4Qb0j5DeCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=comminution&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanda and Kotake 2007"/&gt; In [[geology]], it occurs naturally during [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] in the upper part of the [[crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]].&lt;ref name="Sibson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sibson|first=R.H.|year=1986|title=Earthquakes and rock deformation in crustal fault zones|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=14|page=156|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.14.050186.001053|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?db_key=AST&amp;bibcode=1986AREPS..14..149S&amp;letter=0&amp;classic=YES&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;page=149&amp;epage=149&amp;send=Send+PDF&amp;filetype=.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2011|bibcode=1986AREPS..14..149S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[industry]], it is an important [[unit operation]] in [[mineral processing]], [[ceramic]]s, [[electronics]], and other fields, accomplished with many types of [[mill (grinding)|mill]]. In [[dentistry]], it is the result of [[mastication]] of food. In general medicine, it is one of the most traumatic forms of [[bone fracture]].

Within industrial uses, the purpose of comminution is to reduce the size and to increase the surface area of solids. It is also used to free useful materials from [[matrix (geology)|matrix]] materials in which they are embedded, and to concentrate minerals.&lt;ref name="Kanda and Kotake 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kanda|first1=Yoshiteru|last2=Kotake|first2=Naoya|section=Chapter 12: Comminution Energy and Evaluation in Fine Grinding|editor1-last=Salman|editor1-first=Agba D.|editor2-last=Hounslow|editor2-first=Michael J.|title=Handbook of Powder Technology, Volume 12: Particle breakage|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|pages=529–551|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPk0OhP_brIC&amp;pg=PA530&amp;dq=comminution&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bfhtTJSdK8Hc4AbW9uW9Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=comminution&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy requirements ==
The comminution of solid materials consumes energy, which is being used to break up the solid into smaller pieces. The comminution energy can be estimated by:

*[[Peter von Rittinger|Rittinger's law]], which assumes that the energy consumed is proportional to the newly generated surface area;&lt;ref name="Jankovic_et_al_2010"&gt;{{Citation |last=Jankovic |first=A. |last2=Dundar |first2=H. |last3=Mehta |first3=R. |date=March 2010 |title=Relationships between comminution energy and product size for a magnetite ore |journal=Journal of the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy |volume=110 |pages=141–146 |url=http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/mct_service.nsf/WebWID/WTB-120106-22576-209D0/$File/021.pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kick's law]], which related the energy to the sizes of the feed particles and the product particles;&lt;ref&gt;Kick, F.M. Das Gesetz der proportionalen Widerstände und seine anwendung felix. Leipzig, Germany. 1885.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Fred Chester Bond|Bond's law]], which assumes that the total work useful in breakage is inversely proportional to the square root of the diameter of the product particles, [implying] theoretically that the work input varies as the length of the new cracks made in breakage.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Fred C. (1975) ''It Happened to Me'', Ch. 130. Amazon.com. Retrieved May 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bond, F.C. The third theory of comminution.Trans. AIME, vol. 193, 1952.
pp. 484–494.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Holmes's law]], which modifies Bond's law by substituting the square root with an exponent that depends on the material.&lt;ref name="Kanda and Kotake 2007"/&gt;

== Forces ==
There are three forces which typically are used to effect the comminution of particles: [[Impact (mechanics)|impact]], [[Shear stress|shear]], and [[Compression (physical)|compression]].

== Methods ==
There are several methods of comminution. Comminution of solid materials requires different types of [[crusher]]s and [[mill (grinding)|mills]] depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance. The most common machines for the comminution of coarse feed material are the jaw crusher (1m &gt; P&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 100&amp;nbsp;mm), cone crusher (P&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 20&amp;nbsp;mm) and hammer crusher. Primary jaw crusher product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm &gt; P80 &gt; 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or SAG) mills depending on feed properties and application requirements. For comminution of finer particle size ranges  (20mm &gt; P&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, roller press or high compression roller mill, vibration mill, jet mill and others are used. For yet finer grind sizes (sometimes referred to as "ultrafine grinding"), specialist mills such as the [[IsaMill]]&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; are used.

[[Trituration]], for instance, is comminution (or substance breakdown) by rubbing.  Trituration can further be described as levigation (trituration of a powder with a non-solvent liquid), or pulverization by intervention, which is trituration with a solvent that can be easily removed after the substance has been broken down.

'''Compulsory arbitration''' is [[arbitration]] of [[labour (economics)|labor disputes]] which [[law]]s of some communities force the two sides, labor and [[management]], to undergo. These laws mostly apply when the possibility of a [[Strike action|strike]] seriously affects the [[public interest]]. Some labor [[contract]]s make specific provisions for compulsory arbitration should the two sides fail to reach agreement through the regular system of [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/SuperiorCourt/CivilDepartment/Arbitration/index.asp Arbitration Guide]. The Superior Court of Maricopa. Accessed March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compulsory arbitration in Australia==
The [[Australia]]n [[Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904]] introduced the rule of law in industrial relations for Australia by establishing the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]].

Since 1906 Australia has enforced a system of compulsory arbitration between employers and employees.  This statutory system of arbitration, the Industrial Relations Court or Commission, and the [[Harvester Judgment|Harvester]] court case underpin the Australian industrial relations system.

This system has been amended since 1983. The former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] government, led by [[John Howard]], sought to further modify it through [[WorkChoices]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/432094/organized-labour/66938/Compulsory-arbitration-and-union-growth-in-Australasia Organized Labor in Australia]. Britannica Online. Accessed March 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The former Labor government, during the Rudd-Gillard era, sought to re-establish regulation surrounding compulsory arbitration of Australia's industrial relations regime through other means.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In [[business]], '''entrepreneurial networks''' are [[social organization]]s offering different types of [[resource (project management)|resources]] to start or improve [[entrepreneurial]] projects.  Having adequate [[human resources]] is a key factor for entrepreneurial achievements. Combined with [[leadership]], the entrepreneurial network is a social network not only necessary to properly run the business or project, but also to differentiate the business from similar projects. 

==Purpose==
The goal of most entrepreneurial networks is to bring together a broad selection of professionals and resources that complement each other's endeavors.  Initially, a priority is to aid successful [[business launch]]es.  Subsequently, to provide motivation, direction and increase access to [[business opportunity|opportunities]] and other skill sets.  Promotion of each member's talents and services both within the network and out in the broader market increases opportunities for all participants.

One of the key needs of any startup is [[Capital (economics)|capital]], and often entrepreneurial networks focus on providing such financial resources, particularly tailored to their membership [[demographic]].

Entrepreneurial networks may also become community involved, [[advocacy|endorsing]] reforms, [[legislation]] or other municipal drives that accommodate their organization's goals.

==Membership composition==

*scientists
*engineers 
*[[architect]]s
*contractors/construction [[manager]]s

'''''Franchise Times''''' is a national business publication with the tagline, "The news and information source for franchising."  Its coverage combines the news of the numerous industries that make up franchising, as well as the trends and legal issues that influence franchising as a way of doing business both in the U.S. and internationally. Popular features include franchisor and franchisee success stories, family business matters and interviews with celebrities who are involved in franchising—such as Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]] (June/July 2014) and rapper Pitbull (February 2013).

== History ==
''Franchise Times'' was founded by Crain Communications as a business publication targeting prospective franchisees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9408292043/crain-launch-franchise-buyer|title=Crain to launch Franchise Buyer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first copy of '''''Franchise Buyer''''', its original name, was published in 1994. The name was changed in 1996 to ''Franchise Times'' to reflect its wider appeal to readers already doing business in franchising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9512040900/franchise-times-greets-new-year|title='Franchise Times' greets new year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crain is known for its city publications, such as ''Crain's Chicago Business'', ''Autoweek'' and ''Advertising Age''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crain.com/about/index.html|title=Crain Communications Inc - About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hamburger, owner of Restaurant Finance Corp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://franchiselendingconference.com/ga2013/speakers/john-hamburger-franchise-times-corp/|title=John Hamburger, Franchise Times Corp.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, purchased the rights to the trademark in September 1998 and the first issue under his ownership was published in January 1999. Included in the agreement were the trademark, subscription and advertiser lists, copyright, web domain name and copies of back issues.

Hamburger founded Restaurant Finance Corp. in 1987 as a consulting business to the restaurant industry. The company began offering prospective clients the ''Restaurant Finance Monitor'', a monthly newsletter that focuses on finance information for multi-unit restaurants businesses, as a marketing strategy. From the popularity of the newsletter, Hamburger created the successful Restaurant Finance &amp; Development Conference in 1990.&lt;ref name="nrn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrn.com/restaurant-finance-development-conference|title=Restaurant Finance &amp; Development Conference|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburger bought ''Franchise Times'' when it became available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/19971220/ISSUE01/10003781?template=printart|title=Subscription Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he saw restaurant chains were moving into the franchise arena and wanted to expand his restaurant coverage to that growing trend.

He teamed up with Janet Sparks, publisher of ''Continental Franchise Review'' (''CFR'') based in Denver, when he bought ''CFR'' in 1998 and rolled its coverage into the revamped ''Franchise Times''. ''CFR'', as it was known, was a newsletter that covered franchise developments, before it was on the radar of business publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluemaumau.org/user/janet_sparks|title=Janet Sparks|work=Blue MauMau franchise news for the franchisee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Murphy, the founder of ''CFR'', was a notable consultant in franchising and his feisty personality colored the editorial approach of the bi-weekly publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluemaumau.org/remembering_pioneer_tom_murphy_continental_franchise_review|title=Remembering Pioneer Tom Murphy of Continental Franchise Review|work=Blue MauMau franchise news for the franchisee}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hamburger bought the publication, he hired the publisher, Sparks, to write editorials under the ''CFR'' trademark. She then moved to writing a monthly column until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluemaumau.org/10925/reporter_janet_sparks_leaves_franchise_times|title=Reporter Janet Sparks Leaves Franchise Times|work=Blue MauMau franchise news for the franchisee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Jo Larson, who was the publisher/editor of the ''Restaurant Finance Monitor'' became the first publisher of the magazine under Hamburger's ownership. She also served as the first editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifxsuppliersummit.com/speakers/mary-jo-larson-franchise-times|title=Mary Jo Larson, Franchise Times - IFX Franchise Supplier Summit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ''Franchise Times'' published its first ranking of the Franchise Times Top 200 franchise companies based on worldwide sales and locations. The list also included the next 100 "up and comers." ''Franchise Times''{{'}} list was different from others in that it did not include rankings based on subjective data, only sales and unit counts. It has since expanded its list to the top 500 companies, under the trademark of the Top 200+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/giants-stumble-for-first-time-in-exclusive-franchise-times-ranking-300152665.html| title =Giants stumble for first time in exclusive Franchise Times ranking | last1 = | first1 = | author-link1 = | last2 = | first2 = | author-link2 = | date =2015-10-01 | year = | website = | publisher =Franchise Times via [[PR Newswire]] | archive-url = | archive-date = | access-date =2016-01-14 | subscription = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
''Franchise Times'' publishes the Top 200+, a ranking of the 500 largest franchises based on worldwide sales in its October issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franchise.org/mr-appliance%C2%AE-ranked-among-franchise-times-top-200|title=Mr. Appliance® ranked among Franchise Times Top 200|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data—which also includes other data points such as number of units, both franchised and company-owned, and international units—is used by Franchise Times and others to track franchise growth and analyze trends in the various franchise segments in news stories.

== Japanese edition ==
John Hamburger signed an agreement with franchise business consultant Roy Fujita in 2003 to produce a Japanese edition of ''Franchise Times'', which uses content from the U.S. publication, but sells its own advertising around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fctimes.jp|title=フランチャイズタイムズ日本版 - 日本とアメリカのフランチャイズ（ＦＣ）ビジネス情報 (Franchise Times English version - Japan and the United States of the franchise (FC) business information)|website=Fctimes.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==
''Franchise Times'' hosts a yearly conference in Las Vegas, the Franchise Finance &amp; Growth Conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcasual.com/news/arbys-uncle-maddios-sonic-ceos-among-speakers-at-franchise-finance-growth-conference/|title=Arby's, Uncle Maddio's, Sonic CEOs among speakers at Franchise Finance &amp; Growth Conference|work=www.fastcasual.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which invites CEOs and CFOs to talk about their brands in front of an audience of lenders, franchisors and multi-unit franchisees. In addition to education and networking, the event also awards Franchise Times Dealmakers of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwyergroup.com/press-center/news/2015/the-dwyer-group-wins-2015-franchise-times-dealma/|title=The Dwyer Group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinction to franchise companies and executives who have done the boldest, most significant deals of the year. Dealmakers is also a popular editorial feature in the April issue of the magazine.

Although the Restaurant Finance &amp; Development Conference&lt;ref name="nrn.com"/&gt; is hosted by the ''Restaurant Finance Monitor'', ''Franchise Times'' is very involved with it. It is known as the dealmakers' conference, where networking between multi-unit franchisees, franchisors and lenders is as much on the agenda as educational sessions.

== Trade missions ==
''Franchise Times'' teamed up with the U.S. Commercial Service and International Franchise Association to sponsor trade missions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://export.gov/industry/franchising/index.asp?EventID=32131 | title =Detailed Event Information For Franchise Times and IFA Franchise Trade Mission to Vietnam and Indonesia | last1 = | first1 = | author-link1 = | last2 = | first2 = | author-link2 = | date =2016-01-11 | year = | website = Export.gov| publisher = | archive-url = | archive-date = | access-date =2016-01-14 | subscription = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which brings U.S. franchisors to international destinations that have been deemed hot spots for franchising. The first trade mission was in 2012 to Vietnam and Indonesia. Other sponsored trade missions have been to the Middle East, Central America and China.

The '''HAF601''' is a regulation in the [[People's Republic of China]] dealing with the manufacture of safety class equipment for the [[Nuclear power in China|Chinese nuclear power]] market. All domestic Chinese firms manufacturing mechanical equipment of Safety Class 1, 2, or 3, or electrical equipment of safety Class 1E, must obtain HAF601 registration before supplying such equipment to a Chinese nuclear power plant&lt;ref&gt;http://2016.export.gov/china/build/groups/public/@eg_cn/documents/webcontent/eg_cn_067072.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. This regulation also applies to international (i.e. non-Chinese) firms producing equipment from a factory within China. For equipment manufactured outside of China and imported into the country, a [[HAF 604]] certificate is required instead. HAF stands for "he anquan fagui" (核安全法) and means "nuclear safety laws" in Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicobargroup.com/certification-advisory-haf604-en/|title=HAF604 Certification Information - Imported Nuclear Safety Equipment|author=|date=|website=Nicobar Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The HAF system has been applied in the China nuclear industry since 2007 and has gradually replaced use of the [[ASME]] Stamp system. 

The HAF601 is governed and administered by the Chinese nuclear safety regulatory authority, the [[National Nuclear Safety Administration]] (NNSA). This should not be confused with the United States' [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] which shares the same acronym.

As the founder of MNC Group, he oversees and develops the strategy of the holding company and its subsidiaries, bringing them to be prominent companies in their respective areas.

In the media sector, he has served as President Director of PT Global Mediacom Tbk since 2002, President Commissioner of PT MNC Sky Vision Tbk since 2006, and as President Director of [[RCTI]] since 2010, previously serving this last position between 2003 and 2008.

In addition to his role as a speaker at national and international media events, he lectures in post-graduate programs at several universities in the fields of corporate finance, investment and management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnc-corporation.com/aboutus/read/23/board-of-directors/en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315051144/http://mnc-corporation.com/aboutus/read/23/board-of-directors/en |archivedate=15 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hary was born in [[Surabaya]], East Java, Indonesia, on 26 September 1965, the son of local businessman Mr. Tanoesoedibjo. He is the youngest of six siblings. After finishing high school, he studied at Carleton University with his siblings and cousins in [[Canada]]. In 1988, he gained a bachelor of commerce, then master's of business administration, completed in 1989 at the University of Ottawa. Hary married [[:id:Liliana Tanaja Tanoesoedibjo|Liliana Tanaja]] and they have five children, the only son being Warren Haryputra Tanoesoedibjo.

==Business Empire==
Hary established PT.[[MNC Investama]] in [[Surabaya]] on 2 November 1989 and moved its headquarters to [[Jakarta]] in 1990. It has become one of Indonesia's leading investment companies with a scope of operations spanning media, financial services, energy and natural resources as well as portfolio investments.

The company was initially named PT Bhakti Investments (later changed to PT Bhakti Investama Tbk) and focused primarily on capital market-related activities. The Indonesian government, which was in the 1980s and early 1990s still pursuing a deregulation policy, provided a number of facilities to boost Indonesia’s capital market.

The company’s relocation to Jakarta in February 1990 brought greater opportunities to develop the business in line with the evolving capital market. In 1994, the company expanded the scope of its business to include securities trading and brokerage, investment management, underwriting, origination and syndication, financial advisory and research services, as well as mergers and acquisitions, followed by the launch of mutual fund products. The company listed its stock on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (later merged into the Indonesia Stock Exchange) through an Initial Public Offering in 1997.

After becoming a public company, PT Bhakti Investama Tbk underwent vast development. To strengthen the company’s position as one of Indonesia’s leading investment companies, it undertook a number of corporate actions, including restructuring, mergers, acquisitions and direct placement. With regard to portfolio investment, the company’s approach covered both securities and equity investments. For short-term investments, the company targeted marketable securities and developed partnerships with strategic investors to pursue its long-term investment agenda of acquisitions of companies with healthy cash flow to sustain long-term growth.

With more diversified products and services, ranging from media, financial services, energy and natural resources to infrastructure, the company added value for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders. This made the company even more confident of its ability to attract a more diversified investment profile, from pension funds, banking and insurance to fund management.
PT Bhakti Investama Tbk changed its name to PT MNC Investama Tbk at a general meeting of shareholders on 2 May 2013 and the change was approved by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights on 23 August 2013. The stock code remained unchanged as BHIT. The changing of the name was expected to enhance the company's profile and solidify synergies within MNC Group.

Over the decades, Hary's business empire has expanded to many sectors such as television, radio, newspapers, advertising, a talent agency, music production, online sites, telecommunications, investment, property (MNC Land) and mining with more than 50 companies. In 2011, Hary launched [[JKT48]], an all-girl idol singing group, with [[Yasushi Akimoto]] in MNC Tower Headquarters.

He was listed by [[Forbes]] as the 29th richest Indonesian in 2016 with wealth of $1.15 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia's 50 Richest|url=https://www.forbes.com/indonesia-billionaires/list/#tab:overall|accessdate=29 January 2017|newspaper=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In August 2011, Hary joined [[Nasdem Party]] (Partai Nasional Demokrat), an Indonesian political party founded by [[Surya Paloh]] (CEO of Metro TV). This was Hary's first venture into politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hary joins Nasdem party|url=http://news.detik.com/read/2011/10/12/134616/1742348/10/hary-tanoesoedibjo-gabung-partai-nasdem|website=News.detik.com|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2012, there were rumors of a power struggle between Hary and Surya over the leadership of Nasdem Party. On 17 February 2013, Hary announced he had quit Nasdem Party due to his disappointment over Surya's changes to the party's strategy. In mid-2013, Hary joined the [[People's Conscience Party]] (Hati Nurani Rakyat, Hanura) of former military commander [[Wiranto]]. Hary said Hanura had a better vision and mission for Indonesia, whereas Nasdem had lost its idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hary's reasons for joining Hanura party|url=http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2013/02/25/078463493/Alasan-Hary-Tanoe-Keluar-NasDem-dan-Pilih-Hanura|website=Tempo.co|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 July 2013, Hanura Party named Wiranto and Hary as its candidates for the presidency and vice presidency for [[Indonesian presidential election, 2014|Indonesia's 2014 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hanura declaration of President candidate|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/tribunners/2013/07/05/banyak-yang-gemetar-usai-deklarasi-wiranto-hary-tanoesoedibjo|website=Tribunnews.com|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanura won only 2.86% of votes in [[Indonesian legislative election, 2014|Indonesia's 2014 general election]], below a required threshold to field its own presidential candidate. Instead, Hanura joined a coalition of parties backing [[Joko Widodo]], who won the election. The decision to support Jokowi prompted Hary to quit from the party in May 2014, as he supported former general [[Prabowo Subianto]] for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Media battle begins after MNC boss joins Prabowo|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/05/24/media-battle-begins-after-mnc-boss-joins-prabowo.html|accessdate=29 January 2017|newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Hary declared his own new party called [[Perindo|Partai Perindo]], which stands for Persatuan Indonesia Party (Indonesian Unity Party). As a business partner of US President [[Donald Trump]], Hary said he felt inspired by him and may try to run for president in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Adam|title=Donald Trump's Indonesian business partner Hary Tanoe 'may try to run for president'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-02/donald-trump-indonesian-business-partner-wants-run-for-president/8156716|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=ABC|date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hary and his wife attended the 20 January 2017 inauguration of Trump and met with members of the US president's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald Trump's Foreign Business Partners Got VIP Treatment During the Inauguration|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-foreign-business-partners-attended-inauguration-vips|website=Mother Jones|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MNC's corporate secretary Arya Sinulingga earlier said that Hary and his wife would have business meetings including with Trump's two oldest sons. "He will meet his business partners ahead of the inauguration to bolster some business deals," Sinulingga said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump's Indonesian business partner to attend inauguration|url=http://www.latimes.com/sns-bc-as--indonesia-trump-20170113-story,amp.html|accessdate=29 January 2017|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In June 2017, he was barred from leaving the country between June 22 and July 12 after alleging sending a series of threatening text messages&lt;ref name="sms"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bribery, Corruption, Money Laundering: The Many Investigations Into Trump Business Partners|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-business-partners-investigations_us_59540f65e4b05c37bb7bbbdb|agency=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Yulianto, a deputy attorney general for special crimes, who is investigating a tax restitution to telecommunications firm, Mobile-8 in 2009, when Hary's reign was the commissioner of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/tycoon-hary-tanoesoedibjo-banned-travelling-abroad|title=Tycoon Hary Tanoe Barred From Traveling Abroad|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2017, he was questioned for about 8 hours by the Indonesian Police over allegations that he sent threatening text messages to a deputy attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/07/06/indonesia-police-question-trump-partner-over-alleged-threats.html|title=Indonesia police question Trump partner over alleged threats|publisher=Fox News|date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ibrahim was a member of Nigeria's parliament in the early 1960s, before the nation's first military coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emmanuel |last= Bello|title=The Federal Budget In 1960 Was £3m, And It Did Wonders - Isyaku Ibrahim |url= http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=14233&amp;osCsid=b15e02468589ea3e975db95b5c8966e1 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713192656/http://www.leadershipnigeria.com/product_info.php?products_id=14233&amp;osCsid=b15e02468589ea3e975db95b5c8966e1 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2011-07-13 |work=Leadership |publisher=Leadership Newspapers |date= |accessdate=2007-10-14 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrahim was a founding member of the PDP, and remains on its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=etteh/&gt; He initially backed [[Alex Ekwueme]] for the PDP presidential nomination in the 1999 elections, but Ekweume lost out to [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].

'''The Learning and Skills Act 2000''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It made changes in the funding and administration of [[further education]], and of work-based learning (or [[apprenticeship]]s) for young people, within [[England and Wales]]. 

The main changes were:
* Establishment of the [[Learning and Skills Council]] (LSC) to secure the provision of education and training for young people and adults, in England, and to encourage employers and individuals to participate, and the LSC's funding powers.
* Provisions for the appointment of [[governor]]s in the further education sector.
* Other duties and powers of the LSC, including [[equal opportunities]] and the needs of people with [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]], powers to provide information, advice and guidance services and a duty to publish its strategy and annual plans.
* Establishment of local LSCs, including planning and consultation arrangements and the power of the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State]] to make directions to local education authorities in respect of adult and community learning provision.
* Creation of the LSC’s Young People’s and Adult Learning Committees. 
* Creation of [[Academy (English school)|academies]] (originally known as "city academies"), publicly funded schools operating outside of local government control and with a significant degree of autonomy.
* Powers for the Secretary of State to give directions to the LSC, to pay it its annual grant-in-aid and require the LSC to make an annual report.
* Similar arrangements for Wales.

The Act also established arrangements for Inspections of further education in England and Wales, and abolished the [[Further Education Funding Council for England]].

'''Louis Cheskin'''  was a [[Scientific method|scientific]] [[researcher]], [[clinical psychologist]], and important [[marketing]] innovator.  Born in Russian Empire on February 17, 1907, he was a one-time [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) artistic supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;BIOGRAPHY for Karl Gasslander: ...and was a WPA artist under Louis Cheskin..."
http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/biography.aspx?searchtype=BIO&amp;artist=121132&lt;/ref&gt;
He died of a heart attack at Stanford University Hospital on October 10, 1981, age 72.

He observed that people's perceptions of [[Product (business)|products]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] were directly related to [[Applied aesthetics|aesthetic design]], and named this relationship ''sensation transference''.

Cheskin spent most of his life investigating how design elements impacted people's perceptions of [[Value (economics)|value]], [[Taste (sociology)|appeal]], and relevance. He also discovered that most people could not resist transferring their feelings towards the [[packaging]] to the product itself.

Based on consumer feedback, Cheskin recommended changing the colour of [[Jelke]]'s ''Good Luck'' [[margarine]] from traditional white to yellow. Furthermore, he changed the wrapper material from [[waxed paper]] to [[Aluminium foil|foil]] to represent a higher quality product.

==Evolution of marketing==

In the early 20th century, advertisers took a [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] approach to communicating value to customers. Customers were perceived as responding as a part of a group; their decisions were based on unknown psychological forces. This model mirrored [[Sigmund Freud]]'s view of human psychology: interpretation of sensory input, such as a product image, was believed to derive from childhood experience, [[gender]], and [[sexual desire]]s.

In the late 1940s, there were several [[Consultancy|consultants]] using this approach, then called ''motivational research'', for market research based on psychological understanding. The first was probably the [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]], founded by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] in [[New York City]]. Though largely unsuccessful, it began the Institute for Motivation Research, founded by Lazarsfeld's student [[Ernest Dichter]]. Another [[public relations]] firm was [[Bernays &amp; Co.]], founded by [[Edward Bernays]]. These two companies met success with their Freudian approach to marketing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Louis Cheskin had a contrasting approach. In the 1930s, he founded the [[Color Research Institute of America]] in [[Chicago]], renamed [[Louis Cheskin Associates]].&lt;ref&gt;Renamed 'Cheskin Research' after his death.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first marketers to use '''customer-centric''' methods, and to value direct customer input above marketers' expectations or guesses about customers' needs.

An example of this contrasting approach comes from [[cigarette]] advertising. The Freudian approach posited that women smoked more when cigarette advertising showed uplifted, or erect, cigarettes in their hands and mouths because of their inherent [[penis envy]]. Cheskin reasoned that it could also be due to the idea of social acceptance and glamour projected by the advertisement.

Cheskin employed the scientific method in marketing, testing his hypotheses of product acceptance by observing customers, which was a unique approach at the time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} His methods focused on catering to what consumers felt, desired, and needed, rather than trying to directly manipulate those ideas. His methods also advocated frequent updates to the methodology used, as Cheskin's methods were based on ephemeral consumer attitudes rather than on Freudian psychology.

By the 1950s, Cheskin had already implemented the concept that brands, messages, and offerings could be coordinated and delivered through multiple [[Context (language use)|context]]s and media. He relied on [[Scientific method|scientific]] testing procedures and detailed standards, including colour guides. One such standard was ''first'' to understand, ''then'' explain what companies had to offer in a way that customers understood.

==Use of color==

Published in 1951, Louis Cheskin's groundbreaking ''[[Color For Profit]]'' initiated a scientific approach to color and design. Cheskin's philosophy rotates around three core concepts:

1. Good taste has little to do with how well a design sells.

2. Asking customers what they think of a package design is not a useful way to measure effectiveness.
Surveys and polls don't measure unconscious reactions; and what consumers do, not what they say, is what matters. Research shows that most people who claim advertising doesn't affect them tend to buy widely advertised products.

3. Colors have symbolic meanings:
"We associate red with festivity, blue with distinction, purple with dignity, green with nature, yellow with sunshine. Pink is generally associated with health... White is a symbol of purity. Black expresses evil." Preferences for pure colors are often associated with the poor. The rich tend to prefer tints. And while women generally prefer tints and men deep shades, both are attracted to fleshtones."
:From: ''The Louis Cheskin Animal Coloring Book'' by Jack Szwergold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/electronic-publications/stay-free/archives/14/cheskin_coloring_book.html |title=The Louis Cheskin Animal Coloring Book |accessdate=2008-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129135035/http://ibiblio.org/pub/electronic-publications/stay-free/archives/14/cheskin_coloring_book.html |archivedate=2009-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing the face of Ford==

In researching the automobile market in 1957, Cheskin wrote a scathing prediction that the [[Edsel]] motor car would be a market flop because its styling did not portray a coherent aesthetic and reflect the changing trend toward [[modernism]]. Inversely, he predicted the massive success of the [[Ford Thunderbird]]. Experts of the time had made the opposite prediction based on the comparative size of the companies' advertising budgets. Though Henry Ford and the automotive industry initially denounced Cheskin's opinion, Ford subsequently included Cheskin in the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] project after his forecast proved correct. While the Falcon project had progressed too far to make use of his research results, his new insights were incorporated into the [[Ford Mustang]], one of Ford's most successful cars. Cheskin helped rigorously test the Mustang in experiential prototypes.

Based on the success of the Mustang, in 1960 Ford brought Cheskin in to research and develop the [[Lincoln Continental]], the country's first modernist 'luxury' car. Using his research techniques, Cheskin recommended a radically different advertising approach with the Continental's launch. He created the first magazine designed to sell a product for exclusive distribution through [[country club]]s. Driving events at country clubs were also promoted. Initially, this approach relied almost exclusively on [[word of mouth]] and represented an early use of [[guerrilla marketing]].&lt;!-- If it is indeed the first, a reference would be suitable here --&gt;

Cheskin viewed these innovations as part of the process; natural extensions of his understanding of customer experience. In his view, there were no meaningful distinctions between advertising, price, packaging, product use, or the brand promotion. He approached these as an integrated whole.

Ford's close involvement with Cheskin in their product development was also unusual for the times.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Sensation transference==

Most people make unconscious assessments of a product, service, or event not only based on the item itself, but on secondary sensory input associated with the item, which all contribute to one general impression - whether intended or not, accurate or not. Cheskin called this "sensation transference".

Cheskin's innovative insight was that impressions created in customers' minds, based on experiencing products sensorially, transferred directly to concepts of value, price, quality, and emotion. These, in turn, created and fulfilled expectations of satisfaction. Cheskin's research didn't always explain why these associations existed, but he confirmed that they did play an important role in both customer choice and satisfaction.

Cheskin's work was not just focused on appearance. Often his research led to understanding that added value and changed the product or service offering in valuable ways. For example, initially McDonald's operated burger-stands designed for walk-up service. Cheskin's research showed that these configurations were uncomfortable for families, particularly women alone with their children, accounting for low sales to these customers. Cheskin was able to show that tables, chairs, and a semblance of walls helped these customers feel safe and comfortable visiting and eating on-site. Later, this understanding led to the transformation of the burger-stands into restaurants. Research on color use and imagery, too, led to the introduction of Ronald McDonald. It was these kinds of insights that Cheskin's research gave his clients that helped shape companies' strategies.

Some results of Cheskin and his team's research include:{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

* The adoption of the spoon on [[Betty Crocker]] packages (leading to a doubling of sales)
* The consumer flop of the [[Edsel]] automobile was predicted in a legendary article Cheskin wrote before its introduction (triggering [[Henry Ford]] to hire him shortly afterward)
* Uncovering the preference of American consumers for circles over triangles on packaging
* Developing the first successful mainstream margarine ([[Imperial Margarine|Imperial]] for [[Unilever]])
* The basic market research underlying the introduction of the [[Ford Mustang]] and the [[Lincoln Continental]]
* The development of the [[Marlboro Man]] and [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] packaging from what was previously a women's cigarette
* The creation of the [[Gerber Baby]]
* Rounding the corners of the [[Fleishmann's Gin]] label to appeal more to women (who made up nearly 40% of liquor store shoppers)
* The transformation in the mid-1950s of the [[Duncan Hines]] cake mix package toward a more 'colonial' style to reflect American consumers' desire for both newness and tradition
* The retention of the [[Golden Arches]] by McDonald's, which he argued "had Freudian applications to the subconscious mind of the consumer and were great assets in marketing McDonald's food", and likened to "mother McDonald's breasts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53969815.html "Brand iconography - the secret to creating lasting brands?", from ''Brand Strategy'', February 20, 1999, archived and partially paywalled at Highbeam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheskin's approach and successes won respect from corporate leaders at [[McDonald's]], [[Ford]], [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], [[General Mills]], and many others. Henry Ford, [[Walt Disney]], and [[Ray Kroc]] personally engaged Cheskin on the basis of his innovative approach.

One famous Cheskin study involved the testing of identical deodorants in different packages. Samples were mailed to users and told that the formulations were different. However, the only difference between them was their packaging (three different colour schemes). As one might expect from Cheskin's work, the trials showed that customers preferred one over the others. In fact, some perceived one of the samples as so threatening that they reported rashes and trips to dermatologists, yet had no trouble with the same formula in a different package.

==Imperial margarine==

In 1940 margarine wasn't popular in the United States. Consumers were not interested in eating or purchasing it and Cheskin was asked to find out why. At that time, though margarine was common, it was not associated with butter because of its texture and colour; it was white instead of yellow. The obvious solution was to add yellow colouring (where the law allowed), but that didn't mean that consumers would find it acceptable. In a truly innovative approach, Cheskin threw luncheons for housewives (sometimes in their homes), using this new colored margarine instead of butter, but not drawing attention to this fact. The luncheons included speakers and the food was only secondary. He asked the women to fill out questionnaires about the speaker, which also asked them to rate the food. By not drawing attention to the margarine and not conducting a typical focus group (which would do just that), Cheskin was able to test this new approach to margarine in a neutral environment.

The results of this technique showed no real differences between people served butter and those served margarine. This conclusion alone was significant for the margarine industry. However, by conducting research indirectly, in the environment where the product would eventually be used (as opposed to a meeting room typical of focus groups), Cheskin lent credibility to the results. In addition, his multi-sensory and experiential approach of creating a full event around the test was truly innovative for the time.

Further tests found ways of transferring the impression of quality, a known concern with this product. By delivering the margarine in blocks the same size as butter, wrapping them in foil, naming the margarine 'Imperial,' and using a crown logo, he was able to create a total experience, through product and packaging, that connoted quality to housewives of the time. Furthermore, when the company proclaimed 'It tastes just like Butter,' they had scientific 'proof' to back this statement up.

==The Marlboro Man==

Perhaps Cheskin's most famous achievement was turning Marlboro cigarettes into a 'man's' cigarette from its original appeal to women. Because more men than women were smokers, Cheskin convinced Phillip Morris that they would have more success by appealing to men. At the time its unique product differentiation was a red wrapper, to hide lipstick marks. Cheskin's recommendations were to redesign the package to denote masculinity, while keeping the red color. His recommendations underlie everything from the 'Man-Sized Flavor' advertising campaign and the now iconic packaging (resembling a medal), to the masculine and virile [[Marlboro Man]] himself. The Marlboro Man sported tattoos to give him a rugged backstory and often appeared as a cowboy on horseback (the predominant image that has survived today).

==Relevance to marketing today==

Though Cheskin's process was created and perfected in the 1950s and 1960s, it is just as relevant to marketing today as back then - more so, perhaps, with the rise in experiential branding and marketing. Indeed, market tests continue to confirm Cheskin's sensation transference phenomenon.

The current evolution of Louis Cheskin's firm, [http://www.cheskin.com Cheskin Added Value], continues to apply many of his foundational principals of design research and sensation transference to their work. Indeed, Cheskin's approach is enduring and has outlasted those of Dichter and Bernays - at least, theirs are not prominent nor accepted approaches in most marketing environments or business schools.

'''Messe Frankfurt''' (literally "Frankfurt Trade Fair") is the world’s largest trade fair, congress and event organiser with its own exhibition grounds{{cn|date=June 2018}}. The organisation has 2,500 employees at some 30 locations, generating  annual sales of around €661 million. Its services include renting exhibition grounds, trade fair construction and marketing, personnel and food services. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/press/press-releases/2017/messe-frankfurt-record-turnover-press.html Press release Messe Frankfurt plays host to 95,000 exhibitors and sets new sales record]&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in [[Frankfurt am Main]], the company is owned by the City of Frankfurt (60 percent) and the State of Hesse (40 percent).The Board of Management of Messe Frankfurt consists of Wolfgang Marzin (Chairman), Detlef Braun, and Uwe Behm.

Frankfurt has been known for its trade fairs for over 800 years. In the Middle Ages, merchants and businessmen met at the “Römer”, a medieval building in the heart of the city that served as a market place; from 1909 onwards, they met on the grounds of the ''[[Festhalle Frankfurt]]'', to the north of Frankfurt Central Station. The first Frankfurt trade fair to be documented in writing dates back to 11 July 1240, when the Frankfurt Autumn Trade Fair was called into being by Emperor Frederick II, who decreed that merchants travelling to the fair were under his protection. Some ninety years later, on 25 April 1330, the Frankfurt Spring Fair also received its privilege from Emperor Louis IV. And from this time onwards, trade fairs were held in Frankfurt twice a year, in spring and autumn, forming the basic structure for Messe Frankfurt’s modern consumer goods fairs.&lt;ref name="Trade Fair location Frankfurt"&gt;[http://www.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/messe/messe_leitbild/messeplatz.html Trade Fair location Frankfurt]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frankfurt Trade Fair ==

=== Location and size ===
Located at the heart of financial and business centre Frankfurt, the exhibition grounds are among the largest and most modern worldwide with some 367,000 m² of hall area and more than 96,000 m² of free space at its disposal. As well as excellent international transport connections by air, rail and road, the exhibition venue enjoys excellent public transport connections: The S-Bahn suburban train station “Messe” stops in the centre of the exhibition grounds, the U-Bahn underground train station and the Strassenbahn tram station are located directly at the City Entrance/Festhalle.

=== Architecture ===
With their unique designs, architects such as Helmut Jahn, Oswald M. Ungers and Nicolas Grimshaw gave Messe Frankfurt’s exhibition grounds an unmistakable look that dovetails with Frankfurt’s modern cityscape. . With the Congress Center and Kap Europa, the company operates two congress centres as well. The Hall 12 is currently being built in the western section of the exhibition grounds and will be going into operation in autumn 2018.

'''Nanji Kalidas Mehta''', [[M.B.E.|MBE]], [[Rajratna]], (17 November 1887 – 25 August 1969) was an industrialist and philanthropist from [[Gujarat]]. He founded the [[Mehta Group]] of Industries in [[British East Africa]], now having its head office in [[India]].

==Lifesketch==
Mehta was born on 17 November 1887 in Gorana village, near [[Porbandar]] in the [[Princely State of Porbandar]], British India. He was born in a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Hindu]] family of [[Lohana]] caste. He left for East Africa at the age of thirteen in 1900.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mehtagroup.com/founder_profile.html|title=Shri Nanjibhai Kalidas Mehta, the founder of the Mehta Group|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Persistence Amid Adversity: The Growth and Spatial Distribution of the Asian Population of Kenya, 1902–1963 |first=Charles Joseph |last=Bennett |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=1976 |page=182 |quote=Probably the success of the most prominent Lohana families in Uganda, Nanji Kalidas Mehta and Sons, M.

He started his career as a trader and ventured into growing vegetable, cotton and then sugarcane in swamps of Africa. He then turned in sugar manufacturing and tea and coffee plantations in East Africa. He in his later life also started Cement plant, ginneries, textile unit and oil mills in India. He thus founded the [[Mehta Group]] on conglomerate, which is now spread across the globe.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

He was contemporary of some other Gujarati businessman and philanthropist of East Africa like [[Meghji Pethraj Shah]], [[Muljibhai Madhvani]] and others.&lt;ref name=g/&gt; On the original building of Muljibhai Maghvani's office in [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]], Nanjibhai's name still appears as ''DUKA YA KALIDASI'', a mark of their friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EL0366oH3ckC&amp;pg=PA195 ''Entrepreneurship in Africa: a study of successes'']. David S. Fick.&lt;/ref&gt;

He established the present day [[Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited]] under the name Uganda Sugar Factory in 1924 at [[Lugazi]]. He was one of the first exporters of Uganda's cotton to Japan and other places which greatly helped in the establishment of the cotton industry in Uganda.&lt;ref name=w&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugandansatheart.org/2011/05/16/ugandas-legendary-millionaires-revealed/|title=Uganda's Legendary Millionaires Revealed : Mehtas|work=Ugandans-At-Heart|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 he established cotton mill named Maharana Mills in Porbandar, the land for which was given at measly sum by [[Natwarsinhji Bhavsinhji|Maharana Natwarsinhji of Porbandar]], which employed 2500 workers at time of independence. Nanjibhai was an [[Arya Samaji]] and was instrumental in giving [[Dalit]]s the job in spite of protests by [[Brahmin]]s.&lt;ref name=d&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bzj1pyBKZzsC&amp;pg=PA210 ''Journeys to freedom: Dalit narratives''], Fernando Franco, Jyotsna Macwan, Suguna Ramanathan.&lt;/ref&gt; Again it was for breaking the strike in this Maharana Mills, Nanjibhai is said to have employed services of Devu and Karsan Vagher in late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Bapu-s-children-swear-by-guns/Article1-101166.aspx|title=Bapu's children swear by guns|work=hindustantimes.com/|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manvenrakesh.blogspot.com/2011/04/life-of-godmother-comes-to-end.html|title=Life of a God Mother comes to an end.|author=Manven Rakesh|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881''' is an act in India dating from the British colonial rule, that is still in force largely unchanged.

== History ==
The history of the present Act is a long one. The Act was originally drafted in 1866 by the 3rd India Law Commission and introduced  in December, 1867 in the Council and it was referred to a Select Committee. Objections were raised by the mercantile community to the numerous deviations from the English  Law which it contained. The Bill had to be redrafted in 1877. After the lapse of a sufficient period for criticism by the Local Governments,  the High Courts and the chambers of commerce, the Bill was revised by a Select Committee. In spite of this Bill could not  reach the final stage. In 1880 by the Order of the Secretary of State, the Bill had to be referred to a new Law Commission. On the recommendation of  the  new Law Commission the Bill was re-drafted and again it was sent to a Select Committee which adopted most  of the additions recommended by the new Law Commission. The draft thus prepared for the fourth time was introduced in the Council and was passed into law in 1881 being the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (Act No.26 of 1881)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/1-50/Report11.pdf|title=11th Report - Law Commission of India | year= 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important class of Credit Instruments that evolved in India were termed [[Hundi]]. Their use was most widespread in the twelfth century, and has continued till today. In a sense, they represent the oldest surviving form of credit instrument. These were used in trade and credit transactions; they were used as remittance instruments for the purpose of transfer of funds from one place to another. In Modern era [[Hundi]] served as [[traveller's cheques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=155 | title=Reserve Bank of India - Publications | publisher=Reserve Bank of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Section 13 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, "A ''negotiable instrument'' means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer.'&lt;ref name=goiact&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indiacode.nic.in/fullact1.asp?tfnm=188126 |title=Section 13 - Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 - Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in Section 1, it is also described that '''Local extent, Saving of usage relating to hundis, etc., Commencement.''' -It extends to the whole of India but nothing herein contained affects the Indian Paper Currency Act, 1871, Section 2, or affects any local usage relating to any instrument in an oriental language. Provided that such usages may be excluded by any words in the body of the instrument, which indicate and intention that the legal relations of the parties thereto shall be governed by this Act; and it shall come

Main Types of Negotiable Instruments are:

# Inland Instruments
# Foreign Instruments
# Bank

== Modern era ==
We prefer to carry a small piece of paper known as [[Cheque]] rather than carrying the currency worth the value of the [[Cheque]].  Before 1988 there being no provision to restrain the person issuing the [[Cheque]] without having sufficient funds in his account. Of course on [[Dishonoured cheque]] there is a civil liability accrued.  In order to ensure promptitude and remedy against the defaulters of the Negotiable Instrument a criminal remedy of penalty was inserted in Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by amending it with Negotiable Instruments Act, 1988.&lt;ref name=goiact/&gt;

With the insertion of these provisions in the Act the situation certainly improved and the instances of dishonour have relatively come down but on account of application of different interpretative techniques by different High Courts on different provisions of the Act it further compounded and complicated the situation although on dishonour of cheques the trends of the verdicts of the [[Supreme Court of India]]

Parliament enacted the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 (55 of 2002), which is intended to plug the loopholes. This amendment Act inserts five new sections from 143 to 147 touching various limbs of the parent Act and [[Cheque truncation]] through digitally were also included and the amendment Act has been recently brought into force on Feb. 6, 2003.&lt;ref name=goiact/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2054">'''Net Daemons Associates''' ('''NDA''') was a computer system and network administration company that "ran the wave" of the 1990s high tech bubble going from a $900.00 investment to multimillion-dollar revenue, getting purchased by Interliant Corporation right at the start of the economic downturn in 1999.

The company started as a partnership between [[Jennifer Lawton]] and Christopher Caldwell with help from Rudolph Ventresca. It was founded to take care of spin-offs from the bankrupt company [[Stardent Inc.|Stardent]] in 1991 under the name NDI and incorporated in 1992 as Net Daemons Associates (aka NDA). The company grew to 60 people with offices in Massachusetts, California, Colorado, and Utah and $6 million in revenue by 1999. It became one of [[Deloitte and Touche]]'s fast 50 and [[Inc. Magazine]]'s fastest 500 growing corporations in 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was acquired by Interliant, a "roll-up" corporation that went bankrupt in 2002. The consulting group of Interliant was acquired by [http://www.akibia.com Akibia Corporation] in 2002–2003.

NDA's services included performing large scale network administration for [[UNIX]], [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS|Mac]] networks; assisting companies in getting onto the Internet and setting up their [[website]]s; custom programming and network automation through scripting; security audits, [[penetration testing]]; and assisting companies in moving their computer networks.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to marketing:

'''[[Marketing]]''' &amp;ndash; social and managerial processes by which products, services, and value are exchanged in order to fulfill individuals' or groups' needs and wants. These processes include, but are not limited to, [[advertising]], [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]], and [[product management]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Core concepts in marketing==
Marketers may sell goods or services directly to consumers, known as business to customer (B2C marketing); [[Company|commercial organisations]] (known as [[Business-to-business|business to business marketing or B2B]]), [[Business-to-government|to government]]; to not-for-profit organisations ([[Nonprofit organization|Not-for-profit orgnanization (NFP)]]) or some combination of any of these.

===Actors and relationships===

: At the centre of the marketing framework is the [[consumer]] lies the relationship between the '''consumer''' and the '''organisation''' with the implication that marketers must manage the way the organisation presents its public face.

:: '''The [[consumer]]:''' Typically, the consumer refers to the [[end-user]] - but this may be an individual or group such as a [[household]], [[family]] unit or [[organisation]]. In addition, marketers may need to consider the roles of [[Influencer marketing|influencers]] such as [[Opinion leadership|Opinion leader]]s who increasingly use means such as [[social media]] to develop [[customer to customer]] networks of influence.

:: '''The organisation:''' may be represented by many different actors including: various ''sales personnel'': [[Law of agency|Agent]]; [[Broker]]; [[Sales|Sales representative]]; [[Merchant]]; [[Retail]]er; [[Street vendor]] or [[Vendor]]

:''Selling situations &amp; relationships'': Depending on the nature of the business operations, many different types of actors are involved in a variety of selling situations involving a variety of sales personnel, who perform varied sales roles. Sales activities involve many different types of customer relationships - from simple [[Financial transaction|transactional exchange]] through to long-term, enduring [[Customer relationship management|customer relationships]].

===Needs, wants and demands===

Marketers typically begin planning with a detailed understanding of customer needs and wants. 
: A [[need]] is something required for a healthy life (e.g. food, water, shelter); A [[want]] is a desire, wish or aspiration; When needs or wants are backed by [[purchasing power]], they have the potential to become [[demand]]s.

===Nature of exchange===
[[Exchange (economics)|Exchange]], the act of giving or taking one thing of value in return for another is central to marketing activities. Not all exchange involves [[Financial transaction]]s, but may also involve [[barter]], contra dealing or other form of [[trade]]. The object of exchange can include: [[Goods]]; [[Service (economics)|services]] or [[Experiential marketing|experiences]]; [[concept]]s or [[idea]]s; [[Cause marketing|causes]] and may even involve [[Celebrity branding|celebrity marketing]]

===Perceptions of value===
{{See|Customer value proposition}}
: Traditional thinking around the concept of [[Value (marketing)|value]] was that marketers created value through [[innovation]], [[product design]] and manufacture and that [[Utility]] was embedded in products or services offered for sale. In this type of thinking, marketer's objective was to communicate a [[value proposition]] to potential buyers. However, [[Service-dominant logic|recent thinking]] has changed the traditional perspective and now recognises that consumers may participate in the [[Co-creation|co-creation of value]] in a variety of ways. Consumers may derive value through usage and experience, known as [[value-in-use]] or may be involved in product design, known as [[participatory design]].

==Foundation economic concepts==
Given that marketing has its roots in economics, it shares many foundation concepts with that discipline. Most practicing marketers will have a working knowledge of basic economic concepts and theories.

;Competitive advantages &amp; comparative advantages
Businesses seek to compete by achieving [[competitive advantage]]s or [[comparative advantage]]s. Competitive advantages often focus on reducing costs through achieving one or more of the following: [[Economies of scope]]; [[Economies of scale]]; [[Experience curve effects|Experience effects]]; [[First-mover advantage]]s. Alternatively a business may seek to develop develop uniqueness through [[product differentiation]] or developing unique [[Core competency|competencies]] such as market sensing, rapid market response or delivering superior [[Value (economics)|customer value]].
superior value.

;Competition:types
Different types of competitive markets can be identified: [[Duopoly]]; [[Monopoly]]; [[Monopolistic competition]]; [[Imperfect competition]]; [[Oligopoly]]

;Demand
Understanding [[Supply and demand|demand and supply]] is essential for determining market size and market potential as well as in the price-setting function.

: The basic ''mechanics'' of [[Demand|consumer demand]] include:  [[Demand curve]]; [[Demand-led growth]]; [[Demand response]]; [[Law of demand]]; [[Law of supply]]; [[Transaction costs]].
: Different ''types of demand'' functions include: [[Derived demand]]; [[Inverse demand function]].

;Economic systems
In Western economies, the [[Capitalism|capitalist economy]] dominates. However, other types of economic systems such as [[barter]] economies and the [[Sharing economy]] can be identified.

;Markets
*[[Market (economics)|Market]]
*[[Monopsony]]
*[[Oligopsony]]

;Value

==Planning levels and planning tools ==

===Planning levels ===

Marketing planning is just one facet of the overall company's planning. [[Marketing plan]]s must therefore take their guidance from the overall strategic plan or [[business plan]]. Most companies produce both a strategic plan and a managerial plan (also known as an operational plan). The distinction between strategic planning and management planning is that they are two phases with different goals.

: [[Strategic planning]] is fundamentally concerned with the policies that will improve the firm's [[Competitive advantage|competitive position]]. Strategic planning is sometimes called higher-order planning and is usually long-term planning (say 3–7 years) while management planning is short-term and may be carried out for a specific program (e.g. a sales or advertising campaign of a few weeks duration) or carried out annually. Strategic plans typically include a statement of the firm's [[Vision statement|vision]] and [[Mission statement|mission]]. The [[Marketing strategy]] is a plan that shows how the firm's marketing activities will help to achieve the overall strategic goals.

: [[Marketing management]] is focused on developing the marketing program or [[Marketing mix]] (also known as the ''4Ps'') and is concerned with the implementation of specific action plans designed to achieve objective, measurable targets ([[SMART criteria|SMART objectives]]). Marketing management plans are typically prepared on an annual planning cycle, but may be prepared for shorter periods for special events such as a product launch, a new logo, change to corporate livery or a repositioning campaign.

===Strategic planning tools and techniques===

Strategic planning requires sophisticated research and analysis to document the firm's current situation as well as to identify opportunities with the potential to be developed.

====Strategic research methods====
Strategic research is primarily concerned with the identification of new business opportunities and threats, which derive from the external operating environment. Accordingly, strategic analysts rely less on traditional [[market research]] methods. Instead, they use methods such as: [[Environmental scanning]];&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, L., King, W. R. and Narayanan, V. K., "Environmental scanning and forecasting in strategic planning—The state of the art," ''Long Range Planning,'' Vol. 14, No. 1, 1981, pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marketing intelligence]] (also known as [[competitive intelligence]])&lt;ref&gt;Fleisher, C. and Bensoussan, B.

F. and Narver, J. C., "Intelligence Generation and Superior Customer Value," ''Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, pp. 120–128&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Futures studies|Futures research]]&lt;ref&gt;Berkhout, F. and Hertin, J., "Foresight futures scenarios: developing and applying a participative strategic planning tool," ''Greener Management International,'' Spring 2002, pp. 37+; Skumanich, M. and Silbernagel, M., “Background on Foresighting Methods,” Ch. 2 in ''Foresighting Around the World,'' Battelle Seattle Research Centre, 1997, e-text, www.seattle.battelle.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strategic analysis methods====

Marketers draw on a very wide variety of techniques and tools when analysing the market and the broader operating conditions. The technique selected depends on the nature of the situation or problem to be investigated and the analyst's skill and experience. Strategic analysts employ some 200 different quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques including:&lt;ref&gt;Fleitcher, C. and Bensoussan, B., ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis: Methods and Techniques for Analyzing Business Competition,'' Prentice Hall, NJ  Prentice Hall, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation and control ===

[[Implementation and control]] and control is an important feature of the planning process. From time to time, marketers will use appropriate [[Marketing performance measurement|measures of performance]] to gauge whether plans are achieving the desired results. If necessary, corrective action can be taken to get back on track.

== Branches of Marketing ==

The book titled, ''The Marketing Book,'' 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016 edited by Michael J. Baker and Susan Hart identifies the distinct branches of marketing practice as:

* Consumer marketing (general [[Marketing]])
* [[Business marketing]]; also known as [[Business-to-business]] marketing and [[Industrial marketing]] (which also includes [[Business-to-government|Business-to-government marketing]])
* Relationship marketing
* [[Environmental marketing]]; also known as [[Green marketing]] )
* [[International marketing]]; also known as [[Global marketing]])
* [[Services marketing]]; which includes not-for-profit marketing and [[Destination marketing]]) 
* [[Retail]]ing 
* [[Social marketing]] (which includes  [[Cause-related marketing]])

For a more detailed breakdown of the relevant topics for each of these key branches of marketing, see [[Outline of marketing#Branches of Marketing: Detailed topics|Branches of Marketing: Detailed Topics]] on this page. For special applications of marketing including marketing of specific types of products (e.g. agricultural marketing, faith based marketing, pharmaceutical marketing, political marketing, sports marketing, etc.,) or marketing to specific target groups (e.g. marketing to children, marketing to older people, LBGT marketing) see: [[Outline of marketing#Special applications of marketing and promotion|Special applications of marketing practice]]).

==Marketing orientations==

Marketing orientations are the philosophies or mindsets that guide and shape marketing planning and marketing practice. Some marketing historians believe that different [[History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice|philosophies have informed marketing practice]] at different times in marketing's history. Although there is no real agreement amongst scholars about the precise nature or number of distinct marketing orientations, the most commonly cited include:

* [[Marketing orientation]] (See section: [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]])
** [[Marketing concept]]
* [[Production orientation]] (also see sections: [[History of marketing#Production orientation|Production orientation]] or [[Marketing#Production orientation|Production orientation]]) 
*[[Sales orientation]]; also known as the ''Selling orientation'' (also see sections: [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]] or [[Marketing#Sales orientation|Sales orientation]])
* [[Socially responsible marketing|Societal marketing]] (also see section: [[History of marketing#The societal marketing concept|Societal marketing]])
**[[Sustainable market orientation]] 
**[[Corporate social responsibility]]
* [[Relationship marketing|Relationship orientation]]  (also see [[History of marketing#Relationship orientation|Relationship orientation]] section)
** [[Customer relationship management]]

== The marketing management framework==
{{main|Marketing management}}

Marketing planning or the process of developing a marketing program requires a detailed understanding of the marketing framework including [[Consumer behavior]]; [[Market segmentation]] and [[Marketing research]].

*[[Consumerism]]
*[[Customer knowledge]]
*[[Consumer socialization]]
*[[Consumer switching]]
*[[Purchase funnel|Consumer purchase funnel]]

===New product development (NPD)===
{{main|New product development}}

[[Innovation]] and [[New product development]] are an important part of a firm's long term growth strategy.

The steps in a basic new production development process are:

:[[Creativity|Idea generation]] (or [[Ideation (creative process)]]) →Concept screening→ [[Concept testing]] → [[Business analysis]] → [[Design|Product development]] → [[Test market|Market testing]] → [[Commercialization]] and may include a [[Soft launch]]

The NPD process can be applied to:

:Products: [[New product development]]; [[Design]]
:Services: [[Service innovation]]; [[Service design]] 
:Environmental goods or services: [[Eco-innovation]]; [[Ecodesign]]; [[Lean product development]]

A recent trend in NPD is the use of [[participatory design]], also known as co-design or co-operative design, which involves stakeholders such as employees or consumers in the design process.

Sources of new product ideas include: [[Research and development]]; [[User innovation|Consumers or Users]]; distributors, suppliers or [[crowdsourcing]].

'''Types of innovation'''
*[[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
*[[Disruptive innovation]]

NPD represents a high risk activity. It requires substantial investment and a [[list of product failures]] suggests that the probability of failure is relatively high.

'''New product adoption and diffusion'''

In order to develop a superior understanding of how new products are adopted by the market place and the factors that influence adoption rates, marketers often turn to a number of models or theories of the adoption/diffusion process:

*[[Bass diffusion model]]
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] (article)
*[[Diffusion of innovations]] (article) 
**[[Early adopter]] 
**[[Hype cycle]]
*[[Technology acceptance model]] (article)

*[[Quality function deployment]]
*''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'' (Book title)

'''Power harassment''' is [[harassment]] or unwelcome attention of a political nature, often occurring in the environment of a workplace including hospitals, schools and universities. It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious [[abuse]]s which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Power harassment is considered a form of illegal [[discrimination]] and is a form of political and [[psychological abuse]], and [[bullying]].

==By country==
===Japan===
Although the phenomenon power harassment is not uniquely Japanese, since it has occurred in many environments, the term is a Japanese coinage.  It has received significant attention in Japan in recent years as a workplace problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochelle Kopp'' (2012).[http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/news/default.aspx?newsid=167 Power Harassment], ''Japan Intercultural Consulting''&lt;/ref&gt; For many Japanese, the only kind of management style they have ever experienced is one in which subordinates are treated harshly and no complaints are tolerated.  This makes the nightmare boss seem normal, and those who have never had a different role model for management style find themselves falling back on the old methods.  And indeed, many Japanese admire authoritarian bosses, finding them to be strong and admiring their "passion" that may be expressed in angry outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochelle Kopp'' (2014). [http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/news/default.aspx?newsID=292 Power harassment – Japanese workplace bullying]. ''Japan Intercultural Consulting''&lt;/ref&gt;    The term itself was coined by Yasuko Okada in 2002&lt;ref&gt;''Yasuko Okada (岡田康子)'' [https://www.tokyo-jinken.or.jp/publication/tj_15_relay.html 職場で深刻化する「パワー・ハラスメント」]. In TOKYO JINKEN vol. 15. (Published 2002-09-20 by Tokyo Metropolitan Human Rights Promotion Center) (Available only in Japanese). &lt;/ref&gt; and is used mainly in Japan. It is analogous to "[[abuse of authority]]" or [[rankism]] in the workplace. Yuichiro Makiguchi is one of the researchers of power harassment at [[Tokoha Gakuen Junior College]] in Japan.

===South Korea===
{{main|Gabjil}}
The topic of power harassment is known in South Korea as [[Gabjil]], and it has been recently increasingly discussed in Korean media and scholarly works.

==Example==
Many workers are forced by their [[Superior (hierarchy)|superiors]] to perform tasks outside of their job description and [[working time|working hours]]. It is common for workers to be fired or suffer severe repercussions if they do not satisfy their superior's orders, despite there being no justifiable basis for such orders. 
Situations exist where employees are treated in a manner that far oversteps the bounds of what is proper between a boss and his or her workers. Someone in a position of power should never be allowed to exercise the power in a [[workplace bullying|bullying]] or discriminatory fashion. This can create an unhappy and unsafe work environment not just for those being harassed but for the entire work force. 
Typical examples of power harassment include: 
# being scolded in front of other colleagues, rebuked in a loud voice
# [[neglect]]
# false evaluation and demotion.

'''Samuel Pallache'''  ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: 'שמואל פאלאץ, ''Shmuel Palach'') (c. 1550 – February 4, 1616), was a [[Jew]]ish-[[Morocco|Moroccan]]-born merchant, diplomat and pirate of the [[Pallache family]], who, as envoy, concluded a treaty with the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1608.&lt;ref name=three /&gt; He is likely an ancestor of [[Haim Palachi]] of 19th-Century [[Izmir]].

==Background==

Pallache was born in [[Fez, Morocco]]. His father, Isaac Pallache, was a rabbi there, first mentioned in ''[[takkanot]]'' (Jewish community statutes) in 1588.  His brother was [[Joseph Pallache]]. His uncle was Fez's grand rabbi, [[Judah Uziel]]; his son [[Isaac Uziel]] was a rabbi of the Neve Shalom community in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

His family originated from [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]], where his father had served as [[rabbi]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. According to Professor Mercedes García-Arenal, "The  Pallaches were a Sephardi family perhaps descended from the ''Bene Palyāj'' mentioned by the twelfth-century chronicler [[Abraham ibn Daud|Abraham Ibn Da’ud]] as 'the greatest of the families of Cordoba'."&lt;ref name=Pallache-Moroccan&gt;

Sometime in the first half of the 16th Century, following the Christian conquest of Islamic Spain (the ''[[Reconquista]]''), the family fled to Morocco, where Jews, like Christians, were tolerated as long as they accepted [[Islam]] as the official religion. How they arrived is unclear.  One Italian historian states, "''Verso i Paesi Bassi emigra anche la famiglia Pallache, forse dal Portogallo o dalla Spagna, oppure, secundo un'altra ipotesti, dalla nativa Spagna emigra a Fez, dove un Isaac Pallache è rabbino nel 1588''" (translation:  "The Pallache family also emigrated to the Netherlands, perhaps from Portugal or Spain, or, according to another hypothesis, they emigrated [directly] from their native Spain to Fez, where one Isaac Pallache was rabbi in 1588.")&lt;ref&gt;

After a delegation from the [[Dutch Republic]] visited Morocco to discuss a common alliance against [[Spain]] and the [[Barbary pirate]]s, sultan [[Zidan Abu Maali]] in 1608 appointed the merchant Samuel Pallache to be his envoy to the Dutch government in [[The Hague]]. Officially, Pallache served as his "agent", not ambassador.

On June 23, 1608, Pallache met [[stadholder]] [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]] and the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] in The Hague to negotiate an alliance of mutual assistance against Spain. On December 24, 1610, the two nations signed the [[Morocco–Netherlands relations|Treaty of Friendship and Free Commerce]], an agreement recognising free commerce between the Netherlands and Morocco, and allowing the sultan to purchase ships, arms and munitions from the Dutch.&lt;ref name="Moor 127"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pUJkIYXBKGMC&amp;pg=PA127 ''Poetry, politics and polemics'' by Ed de Moor, Otto Zwartjes, G. J. H. van Gelder p.127]&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first official treaties between a European country and a non-Christian nation, after the 16th-Century treaties of the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The story goes that, one day, Pallache's horse-drawn carriage met the carriage of the Spanish ambassador in The Hague. The two carriages were unable to pass one another and, to cheers from onlookers, the Spanish ambassador's carriage had to make way for Pallache's carriage.

Research has shown that Pallache secretly acted as a double agent.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} He maintained close ties with the Spanish court and passed classified information about Dutch-Moroccan relations on to the Spanish. At the same time, he was passing information about Spain back to the Dutch and Moroccans. When this eventually came to light, he fell out of favor with the sultan.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In addition to his diplomatic affairs, Pallache also continued his activities as a merchant, actively trading between the Netherlands and Morocco. He also got permission from Prince Maurice for [[privateer]]ing activities. The goods obtained through these pirating activities were sold along the Moroccan coast.

A heavy storm forced him to seek refuge in an English port where, by request of the Spanish ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned. Eventually, Prince Maurice came to his aid and helped bring him back to the Netherlands. However, he had lost all his money by then and fell ill shortly thereafter.

The record for his grave spells his name as "Palache" and describes him as ''Morokkaans Gezant'' (Moroccan envoy).  It cites a birth place of Fez (Morocco).  It states a burial date in [[Hebrew calendar]] Sebat 16, 5376 (February 4, 1616).  It lists three sons:  Isaac, Moses, and David.&lt;ref name=certificate /&gt;

===Family (Mediterranean rabbis)===

[[File:Abraham palagi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abraham Palacci]].]] Both ''Les noms des juifs du Maroc'' and ''A Man of Three Worlds'' describe several generations of Pallache family members, which forms the basis of the family descent shown below.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;&lt;ref name=laredo /&gt;

Samuel's wife was Reina (Hebrew ''Malca'') (English "Queen").  ''Les noms'' cites two sons, Isaac and Jacob, ''One Man'' cites only Isaac.  Samuel's brother Joseph had five sons:  [[Isaac Pallache|Isaac]], Joshua, [[David Pallache|David]], [[Moses Pallache|Moses]], and Abraham.  ''One Man'' cites Moses (and David) as most influential person after Samuel's death and de facto leader of the family, even before his own (elderly) father Joseph.

19th Century descendants included four grand rabbis, three in Izmir, Turkey ([[Haim Palachi]], [[Abraham Palacci]], and [[Rahamim Nissim Palacci]]) and one in the Netherlands ([[Isaac Juda Palache]])–[[Pallache family#Documented spellings of surname|spellings of the surname varied]] considerably over the centuries).

(Please see [[Pallache family#Family tree]] sub-section of the [[Pallache family]] entry for a regularly updated list of his family.)

==="Rabbi Pirate"===

Publication of ''A Man of Three Worlds: Samuel Pallache, a Moroccan Jew in Catholic and Protestant Europe'' in English (Baltimore:  Johns Hopkins Press:  2003) and originally in Spanish as ''Entre el Islam y Occident: La vida de Samuel Pallache, judío de Fez'' (Madrid: Siglo XXI 1999) has led to some popular emphasis on Pallache as pirate.  A main source of this reputation is Edward Kritzler's book ''Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean'' (2008), which calls Samuel Palache the "Pirate Rabbi" who "was still capturing Spanish ships in his late sixties.".&lt;ref name=Kritzler /&gt;  The book led to reviews with titles like "Sephardi Sea Hawks"&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2419">The term '''shareholder yield''' captures the three ways in which the management of a public company can distribute cash to shareholders: [[cash dividend]]s, [[stock repurchase]]s and [[debt reduction]].

==Overview==
[[Dividends]] are the most obvious form of distributing cash. [[Stock repurchase]]s also increase [[shareholder value]] provided that the shares purchased are cancelled or held in treasury but not used as a device to make up for dilution from option issuances to management and others. [[Debt reduction|Reducing debt]] can also produce a de facto dividend; assuming the value of the firm remains the same, shareholder value is increased as debt is reduced.

To understand how debt reduction increases [[shareholder value]], it is helpful to consider the 1958 paper by Nobel laureates [[Franco Modigliani]] and [[Merton H. Miller]] entitled ''The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment''.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller (June 1958), “The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper proved that a firm’s value is independent of how it is financed, provided that one ignores the tax effect of debt interest. If [[Franco Modigliani|Modigliani]] and [[Merton H. Miller|Miller]] are correct, the use of [[free cash flow]] to repay debt results in a transfer of wealth from the debtor to the shareholder.

==History of term==
The term shareholder yield was coined by William W. Priest of Epoch Investment Partners in a paper in 2005 entitled ''The Case for Shareholder Yield as a Dominant Driver of Future Equity Returns'' as a way to look more holistically at how companies allocate and distribute cash rather than considering dividends in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Priest (December 2005), ''The Case for Shareholder Yield as a Dominant Driver of Future Equity Returns'', Epoch Investment Partners.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was further detailed in the 2007 book, ''Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Yield: New Priorities for the Global Investor'', by William W. Priest and Lindsay H. McClelland.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Priest and Lindsay H. McClelland (2007) ''Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Yield: New Priorities for the Global Investor'', Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-12833-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Commons category|Tomasz Łubieński}}
'''Tomasz Andrzej Adam Łubieński''', comte de Pomian (24 December 1784, [[Szczytniki, Kalisz County|Szczytniki]] near [[Kalisz]] - 27 August 1870, [[Warsaw]]) was a [[brigadier general]] in the Polish army, senator, landowner in Kalisz and businessman. Hoping to liberate Poland, he fought on the French side in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], fighting at [[battle of Essling|Essling]], [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]], [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]], [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]] and [[Battle of Berezina|Berezina]], for which Napoleon made him a [[baron de l'Empire]]. He also later took part in the [[November Uprising]] against Russia.

==Life==
===Early life===
From an old Polish noble family, Tomasz's parents were [[Feliks Łubieński]], count of Pomian and minister of justice in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and [[Tekla Teresa Lubienska|Tekla Teresa Łubieńska]] née Bielińska, herself a poet and author of historical plays. Her main works were ''Wanda, królowa polska'' (1806), (Wanda, Queen of Poland), and ''Karol Wielki i Witykind'' (1807) (Charlemagne and Wedekind). She also translated the works of [[Jean Racine]] and [[Voltaire]] into Polish. Tomasz was the second of their ten children - the eldest sibling was Franciszek, the others being Piotr, Jan, [[Henryk Łubieński|Henryk]], Tadeusz, Józef, Maria, Paulina and Róża.

Aged six, Tomasz entered the Academy of the Royal Cadet Corps (the military cavalry school). His first two years there were spent learning foreign languages, artillery science and fencing. His first rank was as 'Chorąży' (standard bearer). The next five years were spent on military construction and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://aon.edu.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=147&amp;Itemid=118&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 he received further education in [[Vienna]] before moving to [[Warsaw]] under the tutelage his uncle, Antoni Protazy Potocki. He also came under the influence of count [[Wincenty Krasiński]] (1782–1858), a political activist who set up the 'Society of Friends of the Fatherland' but who was later to refuse to join the [[November Uprising]]. In 1805 Tomasz married Konstancja Ossolińska (1783–1868), who brought a major dowry in the form of estates near the town of [[Chełm]]. They had a daughter, Adela, born 1806 and a son, Napoleon Leon, born 1812 .

===1806-1825===
In 1806 the French entered [[Warsaw]], where Napoleon was met by a guard of honour made up of major Polish statesmen. Hoping to liberate Poland from Russia, Łubieński and many other Polish officers fought on the French side. In 1807 the army of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was made up of 31,713 infantrymen, 6,035 cavalrymen and 95 cannon. At the same time the [[Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard]] formed in the camp at [[Mir]]. Its colonel was [[Wincenty Krasinski]] and its four squadrons were commanded by Łubieński, [[Jan Kozietulski]], [[Ignace Stolowski]] and [[Henri Kamienski]].
After [[Battle of Pułtusk|Pułtusk]] Łubieński was awarded the [[Légion d’honneur]] and in 1808 he fought at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]], supporting the final phase of the assault. He and his regiment fought in the [[Peninsular War]] before he returned to Paris in January 1809. On 5 April 1809 he received the cross of a Grand Officer of the Légion d’honneur. In the 1809 campaign he fought at [[Battle of Essling|Essling]] on 22 May and [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]] (6 July) and to reward his courage Napoleon made him a [[Baron de l'Empire]] with a pension of 4,000 francs, later increased to 6,000 francs. In 1810, a few months after retiring to Warsaw, he received the order of [[Virtuti Militari]]. Following a disagreement with the regiment's commander, Krasiński, Łubieński was dismissed. At the start of 1811 he was sent to [[Segan]] with the [[Legion of the Vistula]] (''Legia Nadwislańska''), one of the largest Polish foreign legions of the Napoleonic era, which was renamed the 8th [[Uhlan]] Regiment (''8éme régiment de Uhlans'').&lt;ref&gt;http://les-polonais-sous-l-empire.over-blog.com/article-22585070.htm{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1812 Łubieński led his regiment to [[Berlin]], [[Grudziadz]], [[Chernyakhovsk|Wystruć]], and [[Vilnius]] to fight in various Polish campaigns.

Remaining in reserve with the regiment commanded by marshal [[Nicolas Charles Oudinot]], Łubieński and his men suffered heavy losses guarding the French army at the [[battle of Berezina|crossing of the Berezina]]. At the end of 1812, Łubieński returned to Warsaw to rest and in 1813 fought at [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]], [[Battle of Kulm|Kulm]], [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]]. In January 1814 he was discharged by the French, becoming commander-in-chief of the Polish army. In that post Napoleon put him in charge of allotting salaries and subsidies to Polish soldiers. He received the [[Order of Saint Stanislas]] 2nd class. After the Russian takeover and as he could not agree with [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]], he was relieved of the role of commander-in-chief in 1816.

Łubieński and several of his brothers set up the Łubieński Brothers enterprise, building its first factory in Warsaw in 1827 in the Guzowska Ruda region (now [[Żyrardów]], [[Masovian Voivodeship]]). This became the first industrial factory in a rural area.&lt;ref&gt;Żuchlewska, Teresa (2009). "Henryk Łubieński (1793-1883) i jego działalność gospodarczo-społeczna", Rocznik Żyrardowski, '''7''' / Muzeum Historii Polski, http://mazowsze.hist.pl/29/Rocznik_Zyrardowski/659/2009/23655/  pp. 527-570.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1825 and 1828 he was a justice of the peace for the Chełm district and between 1820 and 1825 a senator in the [[Sejm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Brandys|Brandys, Marian]], (2010). ''Koniec świata szwoleżerów'', Tom 1, ''Czcigodni weterani'', Warszawa: MG. This the first in a hugely popular series, originally published by Iskra in 1972, about members of the light cavalry who had served in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Russian campaign]]. Much of the material in the book is drawn from Tomasz's surviving correspondence to his father and other relatives.&lt;/ref&gt;

===November Uprising===
On 29 November 1830 the Poles began the [[November Uprising]] against their Russian occupiers. On 10 February 1831 Łubieński was made commander of the 2nd Cavalry Corps, made up of 33 battalions and 16 cannon. After the [[First Battle of Wawer]], he and his corps did not fight despite receiving orders do to so, due to what he felt was the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Russian forces. [[Józef Chłopicki]] and [[Ignacy Prądzyński]] accused him of treason and ruining the last chance of a victory by refusing to obey an order to attack with his cavalry at [[Battle of Olszynka Grochowska|Olszynka Grochowska]]. Historians{{who|date=January 2011}} have justified his disobedience as a good decision since sacrificing his cavalry could not have changed the course of the battle.

On 1 June Łubieński was promoted to lieutenant-general and chief-of-staff. This position involved organising and supplying the main Polish towns and cities. On 19 August he put up major resistance to the Russian advance on Warsaw under [[Ivan Paskevich]], successor to marshal Diebitch, field-marshal of the Russian army and lieutenant of the [[Kingdom of Poland (November Uprising)|Kingdom of Poland]], who had died of cholera. At Warsaw, Łubieński was put in charge of resupplying the city without being told of the Russians' numerical superiority. Members of the city's Patriotic Association and others of his political opponents fiercely criticised him and his actions, accusing him of sabotaging the uprising.

Łubieński was diplomatic with his opponents, although on 28 September, he got general [[Maciej Rybiński]] dismissed upon accusations of entering negotiations with Paskevich for a Polish surrender. Three days later Łubieński returned to find Warsaw occupied by the Russians and he and the other Polish generals were condemned to exile in Russia. Due to his past exploits and thanks to his understanding of the Polish political situation, he won an audience with Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] on 24 November 1831 in Moscow. He then 'collaborated' as a deputy in the [[Saint Petersburg]] diet from 1832 to 1834 while looking after the interests of the Łubieński brothers' business in the chamber of commerce and working mainly to regain lands and assets confiscated from Polish insurgents.

===Businessman===
Tomasz and his brothers entered an industrial partnership, Bracia Łubieńscy SA, in the 1820s that was involved in steel production, sugar and textile manufacture and eventually railways and a department store. In 1839 he travelled to London to gain financial aid for his metallurgical business. In 1840 and 1841 he was director of works on the project to build a  rail route from Warsaw to Vienna, commissioned by the Polish railways. He retired from active life to Warsaw after his brother, Henryk's financial difficulties: he had been charged with alleged bank fraud (misappropriating public funds for personal use) and convicted to 4 years in prison. To save his brother's and the family's honour, Tomasz covered Henryk's debts to financiers.&lt;ref&gt;Łubieński, Tomasz Wentworth. (1886).

(in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasz spent his retirement in Warsaw, becoming president of "Resursa Kupiecka" (chamber of commerce), a member of the Chamber of Agriculture and a Catholic conservative senator for the town of [[Stary Sącz]].

Trade in Eastern Africa
African nations have been riddled with poverties since they have gained their independence. Countries of the [[East African Community|East African Community (EAC)]] have had no different fate. These countries include [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], and [[South Sudan]]. These nations fall below par in different measures of economic activities such as GDP per capita, population below poverty line, unemployment, and trade. The East African Community has made an effort to bolster trade through enhancing co-operation economically, socially, and politically within the member nations..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East African Community (EAC) |url=https://au.int/en/recs/eac |website=African Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The aim of EAC is to gradually establish among themselves a Customs Union, a Common Market, a Monetary Union, and ultimately a Political Federation of the East African States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EAC - East African Community) |url=https://www.uneca.org/oria/pages/eac-%E2%80%93-east-african-community}}&lt;/ref&gt; East African Community countries also have active trade to other parts of the world, like the [[European Union]]. Each country is apart of the [[World Trade Organization]] except for South Sudan who remains out of this conglomeration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East African Community (EAC) |url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/regions/eac/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2014, these six countries have a combined GDP of $159.5 billion, GDP per capita of $918, total population of 168.5 million, total import $40.2 billion, and total export $13.6 billion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EAC - East African Community |url=https://www.uneca.org/oria/pages/eac-%E2%80%93-east-african-community}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries become much stronger as a part of the community as they become a larger market for trade outside of the bloc. Also, the bloc allows for free trade between the member countries helping not only producers who have more options to sell their product but also consumers who have more cheap goods.

==Import and Export Markets per Country==
Relative to the world this group of countries have a very low export level. Tanzania is the country with the greatest exports and it only ranks 96th in the world. Tanzania also boasts a growth rate of 3.3% for their exports. On a global scale, eastern Africa still has a long way to go to become strong influencers in trade.

Though all of these countries are a part of the East African Community, they have relatively different major trade partners. For example, Rwanda's largest export markets are primarily African countries while Burundi's largest export markets are non-African countries. Due to the EAC, these six countries have free trade and are looking to create a economic and political bloc that can help the countries within the group to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East African Community (EAC) |url=https://au.int/en/recs/eac |website=African Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading within Africa==
 
These countries apart of the EAC have continually tried to develop trade within the continent. It began with Kenya and Uganda as a [[customs union]] in 1917. In 1927, Tanzania joined until the collapse of the bloc in 1977. The rebirth of the treaty that still stands was created in 1999, and this group of three countries held together until 2009 when Burundi and Rwanda joined. Eventually, in 2016, South Sudan joined the group and trade has been bolstered within each country ever since. With the help of harmonization of monetary and fiscal policies among the nations, there has been an enormous effort in eventually becoming one large nation, Political Federation of the East African States. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Successes and Failures of the East African Community |url=https://thebestofafrica.org/successes-and-failures-of-the-east-african-community/|date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming one nation will bring improved terms of trade as countries will want to ensure that their exports make it to a nation that increases its size by this type of sizable margin. It will also help them export as their will be a free sharing of resources that is currently not available but will be within the one nation.
[[File:Africa-countries-EAC.png|thumb|Map of East African Community and Africa]]
On top of free trade amongst the members of the EAC, these Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda joined together with the other members of the African Union to form the [[African Continental Free Trade Area]] (AfCFTA. The AfCTFA was ratified on March 21, 2018, and it creates a single market for Africa bringing together over one billion people and two trillion USD. Intra-continental trade has struggling in the past with only 10.2% of trade in the continent being done in Africa in 2010. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=African Continental Free Trade Area: What you need to know |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/african-continental-free-trade-area-afcfta-180317191954318.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chairperson of the African Union and President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, writes, "Increasing intra-African trade does not mean doing less business with the rest of the world.On the contrary, as we trade more among ourselves, African firms will become bigger, more specialized, and more competitive internationally.From now on, the clear wish of everyone is that consultation between business and political leadership, at all levels, becomes a continuous feature of continental deliberations." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 notable quotes from AU Summit on the Continental Free Trade Area |url=https://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/231402|date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence shows that liberalizing trade helps to bring sustained economic growth especially for developing regions by creating comparative advantages that would previously not be available. Evidence also shows that the economic growth would help reduce poverty among the nations by creating jobs. Uganda has been one nation that has experienced expedited growth along with a reduction in poverty by liberalizing their country. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Trade Liberalization and the Developing Countries |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2001/110801.htm#ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the continent, this liberalization can bring more production and consumption within the continents through a greater flow of goods among the members.  

==Trade Deals with Rest of World==
 
===With European Union===
The European Union (EU) has at least one trade agreement with all six countries aforementioned. Kenya and Rwanda have signed an [[Economic Partnership Agreements|Economic Partnership Agreement]] (EPA) with the European Union. The EPA provides duty-free and quota free access to the EU market for all EAC exports while gradually opening up agreed African countries to imports from the EU. This offers a benefit to companies within the ratified agreement to be able to trade for cheaper in the European Union. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Economic Partnership Agreement with the East African Community (EU-EAC EPA) |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-balanced-and-progressive-trade-policy-to-harness-globalisation/file-epa-with-east-africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda have yet to sign and ratify the same agreement. Though these countries have not ratified the agreement, they are all apart of the [[Everything but Arms]] treaty along with Rwanda as they are all a part of the [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDC) list. This offers duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union market for all exports aside from arms and armaments. 
The majority of exports from the East African Community to the EU are primary products especially food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/regions/eac/|title=East African Community (EAC) - Trade - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Engel's law|Engel's Law]], these countries are exposed to the risk of a decrease in the relative price of food. This theory states that when per capita global income increases, demand for luxury goods increases causing the relative price fall of goods like food. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Economics|last=Pugel|first=Thomas|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total exports to the EU was 2.4 billion Euros in 2017. The majority of imports from the EU is machinery, mechanical appliances, equipment, parts, vehicles, and pharmaceuticals. The total imports from the EU was 3.6 billion Euros in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East African Community (EAC) |url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/regions/eac/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===With United States===
The United States and EAC have signed their own Trade and Investment Agreement (TIFA) and a cooperation agreement. TIFA attempts to increase trade and investments among both regions thus increasing growth, job creation, trade, technology, and economic development while also increasing transparency to prevent bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EAC-United States (TIFA) |url=https://agoa.info/bilaterals/agreements/eac-united-states-tifa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperation agreement is intended to increase economic ties within the region. The three main areas of the agreement are trade facilitation, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, and technical barriers to trade (TBT). These areas focus on improving trade between the two entities and also improving infrastructure of the African nations as seen through the United State's desire to trade more with the rest of the continent and the improvement of a port in Mombasa Kenya and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. and East African Community Join to Increase Trade Competitiveness and Deepen Economic Ties |url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2015/february/us-and-east-african-community-join}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest export categories to the United States are woven apparel, knit apparel, spices/coffee/tea, and edible fruit and nuts which are apart of the total $788 million exports as of 2015. The largest import categories are aircraft, machinery, electrical machinery, and cereals which are a part of the total $1.2 Billion of imports as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East African Community |url=https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/africa/regional-economic-communities-rec/east-african-community}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Tess McGill is an [[United States|American]] working-class stockbroker's secretary from [[Staten Island]] with a bachelor's degree in [[Business]] from evening classes. She works in the [[mergers and acquisitions]] department of a [[Wall Street]] [[investment bank]]. Tess aspires to reach an executive position. Tricked by her boss into a date with his lascivious, [[cocaine]]-snorting colleague, she gets into trouble by publicly insulting him and is reassigned as secretary to a new financial executive, Katharine Parker. Seemingly supportive, Katharine encourages Tess to share ideas. Tess suggests that a client, Trask Industries, should invest in radio to gain a foothold in media. Katharine listens to the idea and says she'll pass it through some people. Later, she says the idea wasn't well received. But when Katharine breaks her leg skiing in Europe, she asks Tess to house-sit. While at Katharine's place, Tess discovers some meeting notes where Katharine plans to pass off the merger idea as her own. At home, Tess finds her boyfriend Mick Dugan in bed with another woman. Disillusioned, she returns to Katharine's apartment and begins her transformation.

Tess uses her boss's absence and connections, including her errant beau, executive Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford), to put forward her own idea for a merger deal. She sets up a meeting with Trainer, using her boss's name as an entrée. She wants to see Trainer the evening before the meeting at a party, which she will attend in a dress of Katharine's. Before the party, when Tess suffers a [[panic attack]], her friend Cynthia gives her a valium from Katharine's bathroom. At the party, Tess unknowingly meets Jack, who is fascinated by her. They have a couple of drinks, and the combined effect of valium and alcohol lead to her waking next morning in Jack's bed. She leaves before he wakes and, entering the meeting, realizes Jack Trainer is the man she had spent the night with. She feels the pitch goes badly. Back at her desk, she is mortified about the night before, but Jack comes in and says they are happy with Tess's idea. Days later, Tess and Jack gatecrash Trask's daughter's wedding and pitch their plan. Trask is interested, and a meeting is set up. Later, Tess and Jack end up in bed together. Tess wants to explain her true situation but keeps quiet after learning Jack has been in a relationship with Katharine, which he says is all but over.

Katharine comes home on the day of the meeting with Trask. Tess overhears Katharine asking Jack to confirm his love for her, but he avoids answering and hurries out. Tess also rushes off, leaving her appointment book, which Katharine reads. The meeting goes well until Katharine storms in, accusing Tess, a mere secretary, of having stolen her idea. Tess protests but leaves, apologizing. Days later, Tess clears out her desk and then bumps into Jack, Katharine, and Trask in front of the lobby elevators. Tess confronts Katharine and starts to tell everyone her side of the story. Katharine tries to lead the group away, but Jack says he believes Tess. When Trask hears a convincing tidbit, he hops off the closing elevator, leaving Katharine still in the lift. Trask gets on another elevator with Jack and Tess, where Tess then gives her [[elevator pitch]] to Trask, telling him the roundabout way in which she came up with the idea for the merger. When they get to their office floor, Trask confronts Katharine, asking her how she came up with the idea. She stumbles and balks and can't really explain where the idea came from. Katharine is fired on the spot for her fraud, and Trask offers Tess an "entry-level" job with his company.

Tess starts her new job, armed with a lunchbox prepared by Jack. Directed to an office, she sees a woman on the phone, assumes she is her new boss, and seats herself in the typing pool. The woman identifies herself as Alice and reveals that she is, in fact, Tess’s secretary and that Tess is the new junior executive for whom she is working. Tess insists they work together as colleagues, showing she will be very different from Katharine. She then calls Cynthia from her office overlooking [[Manhattan]] to say she's landed her dream job.

She clearly has the stuff of a megastar, and the movie glows from her".&lt;ref name="kempley"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kempley | first = Rita | coauthors = | title = ''Working Girl'' | work = [[Washington Post]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = December 21, 1988 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/workinggirlrkempley_a0c9d9.htm | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]], in her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote, "Mike Nichols, who directed ''Working Girl'', also displays an uncharacteristically blunt touch, and in its later stages the story remains lively but seldom has the perceptiveness or acuity of Mr. Nichols's best work".&lt;ref name="maslin"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Maslin | first = Janet | coauthors = | title = The Dress-for-Success Story Of a Secretary From Staten Island | work = [[New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = December 21, 1988 | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE5DD153AF932A15751C1A96E948260&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Richard Corliss wrote, "Kevin Wade shows this in his smart screenplay, which is full of the atmospheric pressures that allow stars to collide. Director Mike Nichols knows this in his bones. He encourages Weaver to play (brilliantly) an airy shrew. He gives Ford a boyish buoyancy and Griffith the chance to be a grownup mesmerizer".&lt;ref name="corliss"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Corliss | first = Richard | coauthors = | title = Two Out of Five Ain't Bad | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = December 19, 1988 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956569,00.html | accessdate = 2009-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
