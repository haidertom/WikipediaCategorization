'''Algorithmics''' is the science of [[algorithm]]s. It includes [[algorithm design]], the art of building a procedure which can solve efficiently a specific problem or a class of problem, [[algorithmic complexity theory]], the study of estimating the hardness of problems by studying the properties of algorithm that solves them, or [[algorithm analysis]], the science of studying the properties of a problem, such as quantifying resources in time and memory space needed by this algorithm to solve this problem.

'''Anātman''' in [[Sanskrit]] means that "which is different from atman" or "non-self".&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Article on Anatman, '''Quote:''' anAtman m. non-self, another; something different from spirit or soul&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, the former definition is found in some texts, while in [[Buddhism]], [[anatta|anātman or anattā]] means non-self.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (“the self”)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita concept of Anātman==
According to [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III|Śrī Candraśekhara Bhāratī of Śringeri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III]] of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;dq=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cSjAUOuVM4vprQe-moHoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shankara does not use the term anātman to mean non-soul or anti-soul. The Atman is formless and partless whose true nature cannot be perceived, while the anātman has form, has parts and whose nature can be perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekachudamani of Adi Shankara|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|place=Kolkata|quote= Verse 148|pages=56|url=https://archive.org/details/vivekachudamanio00sankrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anātman, a creation of Brahman which is non-different from Brahman and has no existence apart from Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekachudamani of Adi Shankara|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|place=Kolkata|quote= Verse 20|pages=12|url=https://archive.org/details/vivekachudamanio00sankrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; To comprehend the difference between ātman and anātman is to become liberated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekachudamani of Adi Shankara|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|place=Kolkata|quote= Verse 152|pages=58|url=https://archive.org/details/vivekachudamanio00sankrich }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to realise the self-existent eternal Atman, the seeker after Truth uses "Neti, neti", that is "not this, not this" on Anatman, to reach that which remains as Atman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III]] of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|pages=270–272, 342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist concept of Anatman or Anatta==
Buddhists believe that there is no permanent underlying substance called self or soul (Atman) in human beings.&lt;ref name=4sourcesbr&gt;[a] KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards;&lt;br&gt;[b] Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.";&lt;br&gt;[c] Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=2}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'', pages 2-4;&lt;br&gt;[d] Katie Javanaud (2013), [https://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Is_The_Buddhist_No-Self_Doctrine_Compatible_With_Pursuing_Nirvana Is The Buddhist ‘No-Self’ Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?], Philosophy Now&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (“the self”)."&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that anattā/anātman (non-self), [[impermanence]] and [[dukkha]] (suffering) are the three characteristics (trilakkhana) of all existence, and understanding of these three constitutes right understanding. "The ''anātman'' doctrine was in no sense an addendum, since it was fundamental to the other two doctrines; that is, because there is no real human self, there is no duration in human experience; and because there is no duration in human experience, there is no genuine happiness."{{sfn|Organ|1987|p=163}}

Nāgārjuna's explication of the theory of anātman as śūnyatā (emptiness) in the ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'' was part of his restatement of the Buddha's [[Four Noble Truths]] as well as a rejection of the philosophies of the [[early Buddhist schools]] of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] and the [[Sautrāntika]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1996|p=67}}

'''Arlene Raven''' (''Arlene Rubin'': July 12, 1944, [[Baltimore, Maryland]] &amp;ndash; August 1, 2006, [[Brooklyn]], New York) was a feminist [[Art history|art historian]], author, critic, educator, and curator. Raven was a co-founder of numerous feminist art organizations in Los Angeles in the 1970s.

==Life and work==
Arlene Raven's parents were Joseph and Annette Rubin, middle-class Jewish-American parents, in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;ref name="legacy.com"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/baltimoresun/obituary.aspx?pid=172164204] Joseph Rubin Obituary, Baltimore Sun, 20 August 2014. Note that Joseph Rubin's obituary lists Arlene as a decedent family member, but spells the last name "Ravan".&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a bar owner, and her mother a homemaker.&lt;ref name="legacy.com"/&gt;

Raven earned an Artium Baccalaureatus from [[Hood College]] in [[Maryland]] in 1965, then went on to complete graduate study.&lt;ref name=woo&gt;{{cite web|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=Arlene Raven, 62; Established L.A. Center to Support Female Artists|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/13/local/me-raven13|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in painting from [[George Washington University]] and completed a PhD in art history from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=woo/&gt;

Raven was a major figure in the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|Feminist Art Movement]] and was part of an effort to educate women artists and provide them with opportunities to make and show work that was specifically about their experiences as women.&lt;ref name=studio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arlene Raven|author2=Judy Chicago|author3=Sheila de Bretteville|title=The Feminist Studio Workshop|journal=Womanspace|date=April–May 1973|volume=1|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, Raven co-founded the Feminist Studio Workshop with [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]].&lt;ref name="The Woman's Building"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Woman's Building|url=http://womansbuilding.org/timeline.htm|work=Timeline|accessdate=November 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125014956/http://www.womansbuilding.org/timeline.htm|archive-date=November 25, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of the Feminist Studio Workshop, an independent art school ultimately housed in the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]], was to "come together as a community of working individuals whose work grows out of our shared experiences as women and our shared social context," and an emphasis was put on "cooperation, collaboration, and sisterhood."&lt;ref name=studio/&gt; That same year, Raven co-founded The Center for Feminist Art Historical Studies with fellow Johns Hopkins-educated art historian Ruth Iskin.&lt;ref name=hands&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilding|first=Faith|title=By Our Own Hands|year=1977|publisher=Double X|location=Santa Monica, CA|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was dedicated to serious research on women artists, developing a feminist art historical [[methodology]], and creating a slide archive of work by women.&lt;ref name=hands/&gt; Raven also co-founded and edited the women's culture magazine ''Chrysalis.''&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chicago |first=Judy |title=Arlene Raven Feminist Art Activist 1944 – 2006 |url=http://jwa.org/weremember/raven |work=We Remember |accessdate=November 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922120916/http://jwa.org/weremember/raven |archivedate=September 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, she was a founding member of The Lesbian Art Project; she herself was a lesbian as well.&lt;ref name="The Woman's Building"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=arlene+raven+lesbian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_-UdVK7qNsK1yASgwoCwBA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6wEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=arlene%20raven%20lesbian&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Members explored lesbianism through artwork, researched lesbian artists of the past, such as the painter [[Romaine Brooks]], and questioned the cultural meaning of the very term "lesbian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Site to Vision: The Woman's Building in Contemporary Culture|year=2011|publisher=OTIS College of Art and Design|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=354|author=Terry Wolverton|authorlink=Lesbian Art : A Partial Inventory|editor=Sondra Hale and Terry Wolverton}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a founder of the [[Women’s Caucus for Art]].&lt;ref name=photo&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Arlene Raven|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/waaw/corinne/Raven.htm|work=Lesbian Photography on the West Coast, 1972–1977|publisher=Women Artists of the American West|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Feminist Studio Workshop, Raven also taught at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], [[Parsons The New School for Design]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[University of Southern California]] and [[The New School for Social Research]].&lt;ref name=photo/&gt; In the 1980s she became the chief [[art critic]] for the ''[[Village Voice]].''&lt;ref name="Chicago"/&gt;

She curated ten exhibitions, including ones for the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] and the [[Long Beach Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=woo/&gt; One notable exhibition was "At Home," "which brought together many of the artists and ideas she had championed for the previous decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovelace |first1=Carey |title=Bringing It All Back Home |journal=Artforum International |date=Nov 2006 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=61–62 |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/214349890?accountid=25324 |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Raven became critic-in-residence at the Rinehart School of Sculpture at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]].&lt;ref name=woo/&gt; In 2002, she received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raven died of cancer at her home in [[Brooklyn]], New York on August 1, 2006, aged 62.&lt;ref name=woo/&gt; She was survived by her father, her sister Phyllis [Gelman], and [[Nancy Grossman]], her life partner of 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/baltimoresun/obituary.aspx?pid=172164204 Joseph Rubin Obituary, Baltimore Sun, 20 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/13/local/me-raven13 Arlene Raven Obituary, Los Angeles Times, 13 August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64499">In [[mathematics]], a '''bivector''' or '''2-vector''' is a quantity in [[exterior algebra]] or [[geometric algebra]] that extends the idea of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s and [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s. If a scalar is considered an order zero quantity, and a vector is an order one quantity, then a bivector can be thought of as being of order two. Bivectors have applications in many areas of mathematics and physics. They are related to [[complex number]]s in two dimensions and to both [[pseudovector]]s and [[quaternion]]s in three dimensions. They can be used to generate [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s in any number of dimensions, and are a useful tool for classifying such rotations. They also are used in [[physics]], tying together a number of otherwise unrelated quantities.

Bivectors are generated by the [[exterior product]] on vectors: given two vectors '''a''' and '''b''', their exterior product {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} is a bivector, as is the sum of any bivectors. Not all bivectors can be generated as a single exterior product. More precisely, a bivector that can be expressed as an exterior product is called ''simple''; in up to three dimensions all bivectors are simple, but in higher dimensions this is not the case.&lt;ref name="Lounesto 2001 p. 87"/&gt; The exterior product of two vectors is [[anticommutativity|anticommutative]] and [[Alternating multilinear map|alternating]], so {{nowrap|'''b''' ∧ '''a'''}} is the negation of the bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}, producing the opposite orientation, and {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''a'''}} is the zero bivector.

In layman terms, any surface is the same bivector, if it has the same area, same orientation, and is parallel to the same plane (see figure).

==History==
The bivector was first defined in 1844 by German mathematician [[Hermann Grassmann]] in [[exterior algebra]] as the result of the [[exterior algebra#Formal definitions and algebraic properties|exterior product]] of two vectors. Just the previous year, in Ireland, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] had discovered [[quaternions]]. It was not until English mathematician [[William Kingdon Clifford]] in 1888 added the geometric product to Grassmann's algebra, incorporating the ideas of both Hamilton and Grassmann, and founded [[Clifford algebra]], that the bivector as it is known today was fully understood.

Around this time [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] developed [[vector calculus]], which included separate [[cross product]] and [[dot product]]s that were derived from quaternion multiplication.&lt;ref name=Rowe&gt;{{cite book

Today the bivector is largely studied as a topic in [[geometric algebra]], a Clifford algebra over [[Real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[vector space]]s with a [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|nondegenerate]] [[quadratic form]]. Its resurgence was led by [[David Hestenes]] who, along with others, applied geometric algebra to a range of new applications in [[physics]].&lt;ref name=Hestenes3&gt;{{cite book
|title=''op. cit |author=David Hestenes

|page=61
|isbn=0-7923-5302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==
For this article the bivector will be considered only in real geometric algebras. This in practice is not much of a restriction, as all useful applications are drawn from such algebras. Also unless otherwise stated, all examples have a [[Metric tensor#The Euclidean metric|Euclidean metric]] and so a [[positive-definite]] [[quadratic form]].

===Geometric algebra and the geometric product===
The bivector arises from the definition of the [[Geometric algebra#Definition and notation|geometric product]] over a vector space. For vectors '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''', the geometric product on vectors is defined as follows:

;[[Associativity]]: &lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{ab})\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a}(\mathbf{bc}) &lt;/math&gt;
;Left and right [[distributivity]]: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a}(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) &amp;= \mathbf{ab} + \mathbf{ac} \\
  (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c})\mathbf{a} &amp;= \mathbf{ba} + \mathbf{ca}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
;Contraction: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{a}}^2 = Q(\mathbf{a}) = \epsilon_{\mathbf{a}}{\left |\mathbf{a}\right|}^2&lt;/math&gt;{{paragraph}} Where ''Q'' is the quadratic form, |'''a'''| is the [[Norm (mathematics)|magnitude]] of '''a''' and ''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Metric signature|signature]] of the vector. For a space with Euclidean metric ''ϵ''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt; is 1 so can be omitted, and the contraction condition becomes:{{paragraph}} &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{a}}^2 = {\left |\mathbf{a}\right|}^2&lt;/math&gt;

===The interior product===
From associativity {{nowrap|'''a'''('''ab''') {{=}} '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''b'''}}, a scalar times '''b'''. When '''b''' is not parallel to and hence not a scalar multiple of '''a''', '''ab''' cannot be a scalar. But

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{ab} + \mathbf{ba}) = \frac{1}{2} ((\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})^2 - \mathbf{a}^2 - \mathbf{b}^2)&lt;/math&gt;

is a sum of scalars and so a scalar. From the [[law of cosines]] on the triangle formed by the vectors its value is |'''a'''||'''b'''|cos''θ'', where ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors. It is therefore identical to the interior product between two vectors, and is written the same way,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{ab} + \mathbf{ba}).&lt;/math&gt;

It is symmetric, scalar valued, and can be used to determine the angle between two vectors: in particular if '''a''' and '''b''' are orthogonal the product is zero.

===The exterior product===
Just as the interior product can be formulated as the symmetric part of the geometric product another quantity, the exterior product can be formulated as its [[Alternatization|antisymmetric part]]:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{ab} - \mathbf{ba})&lt;/math&gt;

It is antisymmetric in '''a''' and '''b'''
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b} \wedge \mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{ba} - \mathbf{ab})  = -\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{ab} - \mathbf{ba}) = -\mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;

and by addition:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{ab} + \mathbf{ba}) + \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{ab} - \mathbf{ba}) = \mathbf{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the geometric product is the sum of the symmetric interior product and antisymmetric exterior product.

To examine the nature of {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}, consider the formula
: &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})^2 - (\mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b})^2 = \mathbf{a}^2\mathbf{b}^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

which using the [[Pythagorean trigonometric identity]] gives the value of {{nowrap|('''a''' ∧ '''b''')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}

: &lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b})^2 = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})^2 - \mathbf{a}^2\mathbf{b}^2 = \left|\mathbf{a}\right|^2\left|\mathbf{b}\right|^2( \cos^2 \theta - 1) = -\left|\mathbf{a}\right|^2\left|\mathbf{b}\right|^2\sin^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;

With a negative square it cannot be a scalar or vector quantity, so it is a new sort of object, a '''bivector'''. It has [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] {{nowrap|{{abs|'''a'''}} {{abs|'''b'''|}} {{abs|sin''θ''|}}}}, where ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors, and so is zero for parallel vectors.

To distinguish them from vectors, bivectors are written here with bold capitals, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b} = -\mathbf{b} \wedge \mathbf{a} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

although other conventions are used, in particular as vectors and bivectors are both elements of the geometric algebra.

==Properties==

===The space Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;===
The algebra generated by the geometric product is the [[geometric algebra]] over the vector space. For a Euclidean vector space it is written &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; or ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℝ), where ''n'' is the dimension of the vector space ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is both a vector space and an algebra, generated by all the products between vectors in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so it contains all vectors and bivectors. More precisely as a vector space it contains the vectors and bivectors as [[linear subspace]]s, though not [[subalgebra]]s (since the geometric product of two vectors is not generally another vector). The space of all bivectors is written Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lounesto 2001 p. 35"&gt;Lounesto (2001) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===The even subalgebra===
The subalgebra generated by the bivectors is the ''even subalgebra'' of the geometric algebra, written {{SubSup|''C''ℓ|''n''|+}}. This algebra results from considering all products of scalars and bivectors generated by the geometric product. It has dimension {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and contains Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as a linear subspace with dimension {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' − 1)}} (a [[triangular number]]). In two and three dimensions the even subalgebra contains only scalars and bivectors, and each is of particular interest. In two dimensions the even subalgebra is [[isomorphic]] to the [[complex number]]s, ℂ, while in three it is isomorphic to the [[quaternion]]s, ℍ. More generally the even subalgebra can be used to generate [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s in any dimension, and can be generated by bivectors in the algebra.

===Magnitude===
As noted in the previous section the magnitude of a simple bivector, that is one that is the exterior product of two vectors '''a''' and '''b''', is |'''a'''||'''b'''|sin ''θ'', where ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors. It is written |'''B'''|, where '''B''' is the bivector.

For general bivectors the magnitude can be calculated by taking the [[Euclidean distance|norm]] of the bivector considered as a vector in the space Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. If the magnitude is zero then all the bivector's components are zero, and the bivector is the zero bivector which as an element of the geometric algebra equals the scalar zero.

===Unit bivectors===
A unit bivector is one with unit magnitude. It can be derived from any non-zero bivector by dividing the bivector by its magnitude, that is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{B}}{\left|\mathbf{B}\right|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Of particular interest are the unit bivectors formed from the products of the [[standard basis]]. If '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct basis vectors then the product  {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a bivector. As the vectors are orthogonal this is just '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, written '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, with unit magnitude as the vectors are [[unit vector]]s. The set of all such bivectors form a basis for Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. For instance in four dimensions the basis for Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Lounesto (2001) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple bivectors===
The exterior product of two vectors is a bivector, but not all bivectors are exterior products of two vectors. For example, in four dimensions the bivector

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2 + \mathbf{e}_3 \wedge \mathbf{e}_4 = \mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2 + \mathbf{e}_3\mathbf{e}_4 = \mathbf{e}_{12} + \mathbf{e}_{34}&lt;/math&gt;

cannot be written as the exterior product of two vectors. A bivector that can be written as the exterior product of two vectors is simple. In two and three dimensions all bivectors are simple, but not in four or more dimensions; in four dimensions every bivector is the sum of at most two exterior products. A bivector has a real square if and only if it is simple, and only simple bivectors can be represented geometrically by an oriented plane area.&lt;ref name="Lounesto 2001 p. 87"&gt;Lounesto (2001) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product of two bivectors===
The geometric product of two bivectors, '''A''' and '''B''', is

: &lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{A}\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}  + \mathbf{A} \wedge \mathbf{B}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The quantity {{nowrap|'''A''' · '''B'''}} is the scalar valued interior product, while {{nowrap|'''A'''  ∧ '''B'''}} is the grade 4 exterior product that arises in four or more dimensions. The quantity {{nowrap|'''A''' × '''B'''}} is the bivector valued [[commutator]] product, given by

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{AB} - \mathbf{BA}),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name = "HestenesPG"&gt;{{cite journal

The space of bivectors Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are a [[Lie algebra]] over ℝ, with the commutator product as the Lie bracket. The full geometric product of bivectors generates the even subalgebra.

Of particular interest is the product of a bivector with itself. As the commutator product is antisymmetric the product simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{A}\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A} \wedge \mathbf{A}. &lt;/math&gt;

If the bivector is ''simple'' the last term is zero and the product is the scalar valued {{nowrap|'''A''' · '''A'''}}, which can be used as a check for simplicity. In particular the exterior product of bivectors only exists in four or more dimensions, so all bivectors in two and three dimensions are simple.&lt;ref name="Lounesto 2001 p. 87"/&gt;

==Two dimensions==
When working with coordinates in geometric algebra it is usual to write the [[basis vectors]] as ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...), a convention that will be used here.

A [[Euclidean vector|vector]] in real two-dimensional space ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be written {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are real numbers, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[orthonormal]] basis vectors. The geometric product of two such vectors is

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \mathbf{a}\mathbf{b} &amp;= (a_1\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\mathbf{e}_2)(b_1\mathbf{e}_1 + b_2\mathbf{e}_2) \\&amp;= a_1b_1\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_1 + a_1b_2\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2 + a_2b_1\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2b_2\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_2 \\&amp;= a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + (a_1b_2 - a_2b_1)\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be split into the symmetric, scalar valued, interior product and an antisymmetric, bivector valued exterior product:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} &amp;= a_1b_1 + a_2b_2, \\ \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b} &amp;= (a_1b_2 - a_2b_1)\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2 = (a_1b_2 - a_2b_1)\mathbf{e}_{12}. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

All bivectors in two dimensions are of this form, that is multiples of the bivector '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, written '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to emphasise it is a bivector rather than a vector. The magnitude of '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is 1, with

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{12}^2 = -1, &lt;/math&gt;

so it is called the '''unit bivector'''. The term unit bivector can be used in other dimensions but it is only uniquely defined (up to a sign) in two dimensions and all bivectors are multiples of '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. As the highest grade element of the algebra '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is also the [[Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)|pseudoscalar]] which is given the symbol ''i''.

===Complex numbers===
With the properties of negative square and unit magnitude, the unit bivector can be identified with the [[imaginary unit]] from [[complex numbers]]. The bivectors and scalars together form the even subalgebra of the geometric algebra, which is [[isomorphic]] to the complex numbers ℂ. The even subalgebra has basis (1, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), the whole algebra has basis (1, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;).

The complex numbers are usually identified with the [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate axes]] and two-dimensional vectors, which would mean associating them with the vector elements of the geometric algebra. There is no contradiction in this, as to get from a general vector to a complex number an axis needs to be identified as the real axis, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; say. This multiplies by all vectors to generate the elements of even subalgebra.

All the properties of complex numbers can be derived from bivectors, but two are of particular interest. First as with complex numbers products of bivectors and so the even subalgebra are [[commutative]]. This is only true in two dimensions, so properties of the bivector in two dimensions that depend on commutativity do not usually generalise to higher dimensions.

Second a general bivector can be written

: &lt;math&gt;\theta\mathbf{e}_{12} = i\theta,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is a real number. Putting this into the [[Taylor series]] for the [[exponential function|exponential map]] and using the property '''e&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 results in a bivector version of [[Euler's formula]],

: &lt;math&gt;e^{\theta\mathbf{e}_{12}} = e^{i\theta} = \cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

which when multiplied by any vector rotates it through an angle ''θ'' about the origin:

: &lt;math&gt; (x'\mathbf{e}_1 + y'\mathbf{e}_2) =  (x\mathbf{e}_1 + y\mathbf{e}_2)e^{i\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The product of a vector with a bivector in two dimensions is [[anticommutative]], so the following products all generate the same rotation

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}' =  \mathbf{v}e^{i\theta}  = e^{-i\theta}\mathbf{v} = e^{\frac{-i\theta}{2}} \mathbf{v}e^{\frac{i\theta}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Of these the last product is the one that generalises into higher dimensions. The quantity needed is called a [[Rotor (mathematics)|rotor]] and is given the symbol ''R'', so in two dimensions a rotor that rotates through angle ''θ'' can be written

: &lt;math&gt; R = e^{\frac{-i\theta}{2}} = e^{\frac{-\theta\mathbf{e}_{12}}{2}}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the rotation it generates is&lt;ref&gt;Lounesto (2001) p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}' = R\mathbf{v}R^{-1}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Three dimensions==
In [[three dimensions]] the geometric product of two vectors is
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \mathbf{ab}  &amp;= (a_1\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\mathbf{e}_2 + a_3\mathbf{e}_3)(b_1\mathbf{e}_1 + b_2\mathbf{e}_2 + b_3\mathbf{e}_3) \\ &amp;= a_1 b_1{\mathbf{e}_1}^2 + a_2 b_2{\mathbf{e}_2}^2 + a_3 b_3{\mathbf{e}_3}^2 + (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2)\mathbf{e}_2\mathbf{e}_3  + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3)\mathbf{e}_3\mathbf{e}_1 + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1)\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be split into the symmetric, scalar valued, interior product and the antisymmetric, bivector valued, exterior product:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} &amp;= a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 \\ \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b} &amp;= (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2)\mathbf{e}_{23}  + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3)\mathbf{e}_{31} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1)\mathbf{e}_{12}. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In three dimensions all bivectors are simple and so the result of an exterior product. The unit bivectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; form a basis for the space of bivectors Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is itself a three-dimensional linear space. So if a general bivector is:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A_{23}\mathbf{e}_{23} + A_{31}\mathbf{e}_{31} + A_{12}\mathbf{e}_{12},  &lt;/math&gt;

they can be added like vectors

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = (A_{23} + B_{23})\mathbf{e}_{23} + (A_{31} + B_{31})\mathbf{e}_{31} + (A_{12} + B_{12})\mathbf{e}_{12}.  &lt;/math&gt;

while when multiplied they produce the following

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} = -A_{23}B_{23} - A_{31}B_{31} - A_{12}B_{12} + (A_{12}B_{31} - A_{31}B_{12})\mathbf{e}_{23} + (A_{23}B_{12} - A_{12}B_{23})\mathbf{e}_{31} + (A_{31}B_{23} - A_{23}B_{31})\mathbf{e}_{12} &lt;/math&gt;

which can be split into symmetric scalar and antisymmetric bivector parts as follows

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} &amp;= -A_{12}B_{12} - A_{31}B_{31} - A_{23}B_{23} \\ \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} &amp;= (A_{23}B_{31} - A_{31}B_{23})\mathbf{e}_{12} + (A_{12}B_{23} - A_{23}B_{12})\mathbf{e}_{13} + (A_{31}B_{12} - A_{12}B_{31})\mathbf{e}_{23}. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The exterior product of two bivectors in three dimensions is zero.

A bivector '''B''' can be written as the product of its magnitude and a unit bivector, so writing ''β'' for |'''B'''| and using the Taylor series for the exponential map it can be shown that

: &lt;math&gt;e^\mathbf{B} = e^{\beta\frac{\mathbf{B}}{\beta}} = \cos{\beta} + \frac{\mathbf{B}}{\beta}\sin{\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is another version of Euler's formula, but with a general bivector in three dimensions. Unlike in two dimensions bivectors are not commutative so properties that depend on commutativity do not apply in three dimensions. For example, in general {{nowrap|''e''&lt;sup&gt;'''A + B'''&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ ''e''&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;'''B'''&lt;/sup&gt;}} in three (or more) dimensions.
 
The full geometric algebra in three dimensions, ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℝ), has basis (1, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt;). The element '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; is a trivector and the [[pseudoscalar]] for the geometry. Bivectors in three dimensions are sometimes identified with [[pseudovector]]s&lt;ref name=Baylis&gt;

{{cite book |author=William E Baylis |title=Theoretical methods in the physical sciences: an introduction to problem solving using Maple V |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfMq1sxWVEC&amp;pg=PA234 |page=234, see footnote |isbn=0-8176-3715-X |year=1994 |quote=The terms ''axial vector'' and  ''pseudovector'' are often treated as synonymous, but it is quite useful to be able to distinguish a bivector (...the pseudovector) from its dual (...the axial vector). |publisher=Birkhäuser}}

&lt;/ref&gt; to which they are related, as [[#Axial vectors|discussed below]].

===Quaternions===
Bivectors are not closed under the geometric product, but the even subalgebra is. In three dimensions it consists of all scalar and bivector elements of the geometric algebra, so a general element can be written for example ''a'' + '''A''', where ''a'' is the scalar part and '''A''' is the bivector part. It is written {{SubSup|''C''ℓ|3|+}} and has basis (1, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). The product of two general elements of the even subalgebra is

: &lt;math&gt;(a + \mathbf{A})(b + \mathbf{B}) = ab + a\mathbf{B} + b\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

The even subalgebra, that is the algebra consisting of scalars and bivectors, is [[isomorphic]] to the [[quaternion]]s, ℍ. This can be seen by comparing the basis to the quaternion basis, or from the above product which is identical to the quaternion product, except for a change of sign which relates to the negative products in the bivector interior product {{nowrap|'''A''' · '''B'''}}. Other quaternion properties can be similarly related to or derived from geometric algebra.

This suggests that the usual split of a quaternion into scalar and vector parts would be better represented as a split into scalar and bivector parts; if this is done the quaternion product is merely the geometric product. It also relates quaternions in three dimensions to complex numbers in two, as each is isomorphic to the even subalgebra for the dimension, a relationship that generalises to higher dimensions.

===Rotation vector===
The rotation vector, from the [[axis-angle]] representation of rotations, is a compact way of representing rotations in three dimensions. In its most compact form, it consists of a vector, the product of a [[unit vector]] ''ω'' that is the [[axis of rotation]] with the (signed) [[angle]] of rotation ''θ'', so that the magnitude of the overall rotation vector ''θω'' equals the (unsigned) rotation angle.

The quaternion associated with the rotation is

:&lt;math&gt;q = \left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),  \omega \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In geometric algebra the rotation is represented by a bivector. This can be seen in its relation to quaternions.  Let ''Ω'' be a unit bivector in the plane of rotation, and let ''θ'' be the [[angle of rotation]].  Then the rotation bivector is ''Ωθ''.   The quaternion closely corresponds to the exponential of half of the bivector ''Ωθ''.  That is, the components of the quaternion correspond to the scalar and bivector parts of the following expression:

&lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{\Omega\theta}{2}} = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \Omega\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The exponential can be defined in terms of its power series, and easily evaluated using the fact that ''Ω'' squared is -1.

So rotations can be represented by bivectors.  Just as quaternions are elements of the geometric algebra, they are related by the exponential map in that algebra.

===Rotors===
The bivector  '''Ω'''''θ'' generates a rotation through the exponential map. The even elements generated rotate a general vector in three dimensions in the same way as quaternions:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}' = e^{\frac{\boldsymbol{\Omega}\theta}{2}}\mathbf{v}e^{-\frac{\boldsymbol{\Omega}\theta}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

As to two dimensions the quantity ''e''&lt;sup&gt;'''Ω'''''θ''&lt;/sup&gt; is called a [[Rotor (mathematics)|rotor]] and written ''R''. The quantity ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−'''Ω'''''θ''&lt;/sup&gt; is then ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and they generate rotations as follows

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}' = R\mathbf{v}R^{-1}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is identical to two dimensions, except here rotors are four-dimensional objects isomorphic to the quaternions. This can be generalised to all dimensions, with rotors, elements of the even subalgebra with unit magnitude, being generated by the exponential map from bivectors. They form a [[double covering group|double cover]] over the rotation group, so the rotors ''R'' and −''R'' represent the same rotation.

===Matrices===
Bivectors are isomorphic to [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric matrices]]; the general bivector {{nowrap|''B''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; + ''B''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; + ''B''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} maps to the matrix

: &lt;math&gt;M_B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; B_{12} &amp;  -B_{31} \\ -B_{12} &amp; 0 &amp; B_{23}\\ B_{31} &amp; -B_{23} &amp; 0  \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This multiplied by vectors on both sides gives the same vector as the product of a vector and bivector minus the outerproduct; an example is the [[angular velocity tensor]].

Skew symmetric matrices generate [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] with [[determinant]] 1 through the exponential map. In particular the exponent of a bivector associated with a rotation is a [[rotation matrix]], that is the rotation matrix ''M''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; given by the above skew-symmetric matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;M_R = e^{M_B}.&lt;/math&gt;

The rotation described by ''M''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as that described by the rotor ''R'' given by

: &lt;math&gt; R = e^{\frac{B}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

and the matrix ''M''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; can be also calculated directly from rotor ''R'':

: &lt;math&gt;M_R = \begin{pmatrix} (R\mathbf{e}_1R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_1 &amp; (R\mathbf{e}_2R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_1 &amp; (R\mathbf{e}_3R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_1 \\ (R\mathbf{e}_1R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; (R\mathbf{e}_2R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; (R\mathbf{e}_3R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 \\ (R\mathbf{e}_1R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_3 &amp; (R\mathbf{e}_2R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_3 &amp; (R\mathbf{e}_3R^{-1}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_3 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Bivectors are related to the [[eigenvalue]]s of a rotation matrix. Given a rotation matrix ''M'' the eigenvalues can calculated by solving the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]] for that matrix {{nowrap|1=0 = det(''M'' − λ''I'')}}. By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] this has three roots, but only one real root as there is only one eigenvector, the axis of rotation. The other roots must be a complex conjugate pair. They have unit magnitude so purely imaginary logarithms, equal to the magnitude of the bivector associated with the rotation, which is also the angle of rotation. The eigenvectors associated with the complex eigenvalues are in the plane of the bivector, so the exterior product of two non-parallel eigenvectors result in the bivector, or at least a multiple of it.

===Axial vectors===
[[File:Angular momentum bivector and pseudovector.svg|275px|thumb|The 3-angular momentum as a bivector (plane element) and [[axial vector]], of a particle of mass ''m'' with instantaneous 3-position '''x''' and 3-momentum '''p'''.]]

The rotation vector is an example of an [[axial vector]]. Axial vectors, or pseudovectors, are vectors with the special feature that their coordinates undergo a sign change relative to the usual vectors (also called "polar vectors") under inversion through the origin, reflection in a plane, or other orientation-reversing linear transformation.&lt;ref&gt;In strict mathematical terms, axial vectors are an ''n''-dimensional vector space equipped with the usual structure group GL(''n'','''R'''), but with the nonstandard representation ''A'' → ''A'' det(''A'')/|det(''A'')|.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include quantities like [[torque]], [[angular momentum]] and vector [[magnetic field]]s. Quantities that would use axial vectors in [[vector algebra]] are properly represented by bivectors in geometric algebra.&lt;ref name=Lasenby&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uI7bQb6qJ0C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22dispensing+with+the+traditional+definition+of+angular+momentum%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dispensing%20with%20the%20traditional%20definition%20of%20angular%20momentum%22&amp;f=false |page=56 |title=Geometric algebra for physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |isbn=0-521-48022-1 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  More precisely, if an underlying orientation is chosen, the axial vectors are naturally identified with the usual vectors; the [[Hodge dual#Three-dimensional example|Hodge dual]] then gives the isomorphism between axial vectors and bivectors, so each axial vector is associated with a bivector and vice versa; that is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = * \mathbf{a} \,,\quad \mathbf{a} = * \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
where ∗ indicates the Hodge dual. Note that if the underlying orientation is reversed by inversion through the origin, both the identification of the axial vectors with the usual vectors and the Hodge dual change sign, but the bivectors don't budge. Alternately, using the [[Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)#Unit pseudoscalar|unit pseudoscalar]] in ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(ℝ), ''i'' = '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{a}i \,,\quad \mathbf{a} = - \mathbf{A} i. &lt;/math&gt;

This is easier to use as the product is just the geometric product. But it is antisymmetric because (as in two dimensions) the unit pseudoscalar ''i'' squares to −1, so a negative is needed in one of the products.

This relationship extends to operations like the vector valued [[cross product]] and bivector valued exterior product, as when written as [[determinant]]s they are calculated in the same way:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \mathbf{e}_3\\a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_3\\b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3 \end{vmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_{23} &amp; \mathbf{e}_{31} &amp; \mathbf{e}_{12}\\a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_3\\b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3 \end{vmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

so are related by the Hodge dual:

:&lt;math&gt;{* (\mathbf a \wedge \mathbf b )} = \mathbf {a \times b} \,,\quad {* (\mathbf {a \times b} )} = \mathbf a \wedge \mathbf b  . &lt;/math&gt;

Bivectors have a number of advantages over axial vectors. They better disambiguate axial and polar vectors, that is the quantities represented by them, so it is clearer which operations are allowed and what their results are. For example, the inner product of a polar vector and an axial vector resulting from the cross product in the [[triple product]] should result in a [[pseudoscalar]], a result which is more obvious if the calculation is framed as the exterior product of a vector and bivector. They generalises to other dimensions; in particular bivectors can be used to describe quantities like torque and angular momentum in two as well as three dimensions.  Also, they closely match geometric intuition in a number of ways, as seen in the next section.&lt;ref&gt;Lounesto (2001) pp. 37–39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometric interpretation===
[[File:Wedge product.JPG|thumb|170px|Parallel plane segments with the same orientation and area corresponding to the same bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}.&lt;ref name="Dorst"/&gt;]]

As suggested by their name and that of the algebra, one of the attractions of bivectors is that they have a natural geometric interpretation. This can be described in any dimension but is best done in three where parallels can be drawn with more familiar objects, before being applied to higher dimensions. In two dimensions the geometric interpretation is trivial, as the space is two-dimensional so has only one plane, and all bivectors are associated with it differing only by a scale factor.

All bivectors can be interpreted as [[Plane (geometry)|planes]], or more precisely as directed plane segments. In three dimensions there are three properties of a bivector that can be interpreted geometrically:
* The arrangement of the plane in space, precisely the [[Attitude (geometry)|attitude]] of the plane (or alternately the [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[Orientation (geometry)|geometric orientation]] or [[gradient]] of the plane), is associated with the ratio of the bivector components. In particular the three basis bivectors, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, or scalar multiples of them, are associated with the ''yz''-plane, ''xz''-plane and ''xy''-plane respectively.
* The [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the bivector is associated with the [[area]] of the plane segment. The area does not have a particular shape so any shape can be used. It can even be represented in other ways, such as by an angular measure. But if the vectors are interpreted as lengths the bivector is usually interpreted as an area with the same units, as follows. 
* Like the direction of a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] a plane associated with a bivector has a direction, a circulation or a sense of rotation in the plane, which takes two values seen as [[clockwise and counterclockwise]] when viewed from viewpoint not in the plane. This is associated with a change of sign in the bivector, that is if the direction is reversed the bivector is negated. Alternately if two bivectors have the same attitude and magnitude but opposite directions then one is the negative of the other.
* If imagined as a 2d parallelogram, with vector's origin at 0, then signed area is the [[Determinant#2.C2.A0.C3.97.C2.A02 matrices|determinant]] of the vectors' Cartesian coordinates (&lt;math&gt;a_x b_y - b_x a_y&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XghF70fqkY WildLinAlg episode 4], Norman J Wildberger, Univ. of New South Wales, 2010, lecture via youtube&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exterior calc cross product.svg|right|thumb|200px|The cross product {{nowrap|'''a''' × '''b'''}} is [[orthogonal]] to the bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}.]]

In three dimensions all bivectors can be generated by the exterior product of two vectors. If the bivector {{nowrap|1='''B''' = '''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} then the magnitude of '''B''' is

: &lt;math&gt;\left|\mathbf{B}\right| = \left|\mathbf{a}\right|\left|\mathbf{b}\right|\sin{\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors. This is the area of the [[parallelogram]] with edges '''a''' and '''b''', as shown in the diagram. One interpretation is that the area is swept out by '''b''' as it moves along '''a'''. The exterior product is antisymmetric, so reversing the order of '''a''' and '''b''' to make '''a''' move along '''b''' results in a bivector with the opposite direction that is the negative of the first. The plane of bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} contains both '''a''' and '''b''' so they are both parallel to the plane.

Bivectors and axial vectors are related by [[Hodge dual#Three-dimensional example|Hodge dual]]. In a real vector space the Hodge dual relates a subspace to its [[orthogonal complement]], so if a bivector is represented by a plane then the axial vector associated with it is simply the plane's [[surface normal]]. The plane has two normals, one on each side, giving the two possible [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]]s for the plane and bivector.

[[File:Torque animation.gif|thumb|200px|right|Relationship between [[force]] '''F''', torque '''τ''', [[linear momentum]] '''p''', and angular momentum '''L'''.]]

This relates the [[cross product]] to the [[exterior product]]. It can also be used to represent physical quantities, like [[torque]] and [[angular momentum]]. In vector algebra they are usually represented by vectors, perpendicular to the plane of the [[force]], [[linear momentum]] or displacement that they are calculated from. But if a bivector is used instead the plane is the plane of the bivector, so is a more natural way to represent the quantities and the way they act. It also unlike the vector representation generalises into other dimensions.

The product of two bivectors has a geometric interpretation. For non-zero bivectors '''A''' and '''B''' the product can be split into symmetric and antisymmetric parts as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{AB} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

Like vectors these have magnitudes {{nowrap|1={{abs|'''A''' · '''B'''}} = {{abs|'''A'''}}{{abs|'''B'''}} cos ''θ''}} and {{nowrap|1={{abs|'''A''' × '''B'''}} = {{abs|'''A'''}}{{abs|'''B'''}} sin ''θ''}}, where ''θ'' is the angle between the planes. In three dimensions it is the same as the angle between the normal vectors dual to the planes, and it generalises to some extent in higher dimensions.

[[File:Bivector Sum.svg|thumb|200px|Two bivectors, two of the non-parallel sides of a prism, being added to give a third bivector.&lt;ref name="Lounesto 2001 p. 35"/&gt;]]

Bivectors can be added together as areas. Given two non-zero bivectors '''B''' and '''C''' in three dimensions it is always possible to find a vector that is contained in both, '''a''' say, so the bivectors can be written as exterior products involving '''a''':

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathbf{B} &amp;= \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b}\\ \mathbf{C} &amp;= \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{c}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be interpreted geometrically as seen in the diagram: the two areas sum to give a third, with the three areas forming faces of a [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] with '''a''', '''b''', '''c''' and {{nowrap|'''b''' + '''c'''}} as edges. This corresponds to the two ways of calculating the area using the [[distributivity]] of the exterior product:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{C} &amp;= \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \wedge \mathbf{c} \\ &amp;= \mathbf{a} \wedge (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This only works in three dimensions as it is the only dimension where a vector parallel to both bivectors must exist. In higher dimensions bivectors generally are not associated with a single plane, or if they are (simple bivectors) two bivectors may have no vector in common, and so sum to a non-simple bivector.

==Four dimensions==
In four dimensions the basis elements for the space Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; of bivectors are ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;), so a general bivector is of the form

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = a_{12}\mathbf{e}_{12} + a_{13}\mathbf{e}_{13} + a_{14}\mathbf{e}_{14} + a_{23}\mathbf{e}_{23} + a_{24}\mathbf{e}_{24} + a_{34}\mathbf{e}_{34}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Orthogonality===
In four dimensions the Hodge dual of a bivector is a bivector, and the space Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is dual to itself. Normal vectors are not unique, instead every plane is orthogonal to all the vectors in its Hodge dual space. This can be used to partition the bivectors into two 'halves', in the following way. We have three pairs of orthogonal bivectors: ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;), ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;) and ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;). There are four distinct ways of picking one bivector from each of the first two pairs, and once these first two are picked their sum yields the third bivector from the other pair. For example,  ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;) and ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Simple bivectors in 4D===
In four dimensions bivectors are generated by the exterior product of vectors in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, but with one important difference from ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In four dimensions not all bivectors are simple. There are bivectors such as {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; + '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;}} that cannot be generated by the exterior product of two vectors. This also means they do not have a real, that is scalar, square. In this case

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e}_{12} + \mathbf{e}_{34})^2 =\mathbf{e}_{12} \mathbf{e}_{12} + \mathbf{e}_{12} \mathbf{e}_{34} + \mathbf{e}_{34} \mathbf{e}_{12} + \mathbf{e}_{34} \mathbf{e}_{34} = -2 + 2 \mathbf{e}_{1234}.&lt;/math&gt;

The element '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1234&lt;/sub&gt; is the pseudoscalar in ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, distinct from the scalar, so the square is non-scalar.

All bivectors in four dimensions can be generated using at most two exterior products and four vectors. The above bivector can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{12} + \mathbf{e}_{34} = \mathbf{e}_{1} \wedge \mathbf{e}_{2} +  \mathbf{e}_{3} \wedge \mathbf{e}_{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, every bivector can be written as the sum of two simple bivectors. It is useful to choose two orthogonal bivectors for this, and this is always possible to do. Moreover, for a generic bivector the choice of simple bivectors is unique, that is, there is only one way to decompose into orthogonal bivectors; the only exception is when the two orthogonal bivectors have equal magnitudes (as in the above example): in this case the decomposition is not unique.&lt;ref name="Lounesto 2001 p. 87"/&gt; The decomposition is always unique in the case of simple bivectors, with the added bonus that one of the orthogonal parts is zero.

===Rotations in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;===
As in three dimensions bivectors in four dimension generate rotations through the exponential map, and all rotations can be generated this way. As in three dimensions if '''B''' is a bivector then the rotor ''R'' is ''e''&lt;sup&gt;'''B'''/2&lt;/sup&gt; and rotations are generated in the same way:

: &lt;math&gt;v' = RvR^{-1}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Tesseract.gif|thumb|200px|A 3D projection of an [[tesseract]] performing an [[SO(4)#Isoclinic rotations|isoclinic rotation]].]]

The rotations generated are more complex though. They can be categorised as follows:
: ''[[SO(4)#Simple rotations|simple]]'' rotations are those that fix a plane in 4D, and rotate by an angle "about" this plane.
: ''[[SO(4)#Double rotations|double]]'' rotations have only one fixed point, the origin, and rotate through two angles about two orthogonal planes. In general the angles are different and the planes are uniquely specified
: ''[[SO(4)#Isoclinic rotations|isoclinic]]'' rotations are double rotations where the angles of rotation are equal. In this case the planes about which the rotation is taking place are not unique.

These are generated by bivectors in a straightforward way. Simple rotations are generated by simple bivectors, with the fixed plane the dual or orthogonal to the plane of the bivector. The rotation can be said to take place about that plane, in the plane of the bivector. All other bivectors generate double rotations, with the two angles of the rotation equalling the magnitudes of the two simple bivectors the non-simple bivector is composed of. Isoclinic rotations arise when these magnitudes are equal, in which case the decomposition into two simple bivectors is not unique.&lt;ref&gt;Lounesto (2001) pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Bivectors in general do not commute, but one exception is orthogonal bivectors and exponents of them. So if the bivector {{nowrap|'''B''' {{=}} '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are orthogonal simple bivectors, is used to generate a rotation it decomposes into two simple rotations that commute as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; R = e^{\frac{\mathbf{B}_1 + \mathbf{B}_2}{2}} =  e^{\frac{\mathbf{B}_1}{2}}e^{\frac{\mathbf{B}_2}{2}} = e^{\frac{\mathbf{B}_2}{2}}e^{\frac{\mathbf{B}_1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

It is always possible to do this as all bivectors can be expressed as sums of orthogonal bivectors.

===Spacetime rotations===

[[Spacetime]] is a mathematical model for our universe used in special relativity. It consists of three [[Euclidean space|space]] dimensions and one [[Time in physics|time]] dimension combined into a single four-dimensional space. It is naturally described using geometric algebra and bivectors, with the [[Euclidean metric]] replaced by a [[Minkowski metric]]. That algebra is identical to that of Euclidean space, except the [[Metric signature|signature]] is changed, so

: &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{e}_i}^2 = \begin{cases} 1,  &amp; i = 1, 2, 3 \\  -1, &amp; i = 4 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

(Note the order and indices above are not universal – here '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the time-like dimension). The geometric algebra is ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;3,1&lt;/sub&gt;(ℝ), and the subspace of bivectors is Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3,1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The simple bivectors are of two types. The simple bivectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; have negative squares and span the bivectors of the three-dimensional subspace corresponding to Euclidean space, ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. These bivectors generate ordinary rotations in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The simple bivectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt; have positive squares and as planes span a space dimension and the time dimension. These also generate rotations through the exponential map, but instead of trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions are needed, which generates a rotor as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{\boldsymbol{\Omega}\theta}{2}} = \cosh\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \boldsymbol{\Omega}\sinh\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''Ω'' is the bivector ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.), identified via the metric with an antisymmetric linear transformation of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3,1&lt;/sup&gt;. These are [[Lorentz transformation#Boost in any direction|Lorentz boost]]s, expressed in a particularly compact way, using the same kind of algebra as in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and ℝ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

In general all spacetime rotations are generated from bivectors through the exponential map, that is, a general rotor generated by bivector '''A''' is of the form

: &lt;math&gt;R = e^{\frac{\mathbf{A}}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The set of all rotations in spacetime form the [[Lorentz group]], and from them most of the consequences of special relativity can be deduced. More generally this show how transformations in Euclidean space and spacetime can all be described using the same kind of algebra.

===Maxwell's equations===
(Note: in this section traditional 3-vectors are indicated by lines over the symbols and spacetime vector and bivectors by bold symbols, with the vectors '''J''' and '''A''' exceptionally in uppercase)

[[Maxwell's equations]] are used in physics to describe the relationship between [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] fields. Normally given as four differential equations they have a particularly compact form when the fields are expressed as a spacetime bivector from Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3,1&lt;/sup&gt;. If the electric and magnetic fields in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are {{overline|''E''}} and {{overline|''B''}} then the ''electromagnetic bivector'' is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{c}\overline{E}\mathbf{e}_4 + \overline{B}\mathbf{e}_{123},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is again the basis vector for the time-like dimension and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The product {{overline|''B''}}'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; yields the bivector that is Hodge dual to {{overline|''B''}} in three dimensions, as [[#Axial vectors|discussed above]], while {{overline|''E''}}'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a product of orthogonal vectors is also bivector valued. As a whole it is the [[electromagnetic tensor]] expressed more compactly as a bivector, and is used as follows. First it is related to the [[4-current]] '''J''', a vector quantity given by

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \overline{j} + c\rho\mathbf{e}_4,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{overline|''j''}} is [[current density]] and ''ρ'' is [[charge density]]. They are related by a differential operator ∂, which is

: &lt;math&gt;\partial = \nabla - \mathbf{e}_4\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The operator ∇ is a [[differential operator]] in geometric algebra, acting on the space dimensions and given by {{nowrap|∇'''M''' {{=}} ∇·'''M''' + ∇∧'''M'''}}. When applied to vectors ∇·'''M''' is the [[divergence]] and ∇∧'''M''' is the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] but with a bivector rather than vector result, that is dual in three dimensions to the curl. For general quantity '''M''' they act as grade lowering and raising differential operators. In particular if '''M''' is a scalar then this operator is just the [[gradient]], and it can be thought of as a geometric algebraic [[del]] operator.

Together these can be used to give a particularly compact form for Maxwell's equations in a vacuum:

: &lt;math&gt; \partial\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{J}.&lt;/math&gt;

This when decomposed according to geometric algebra, using geometric products which have both grade raising and grade lowering effects, is equivalent to Maxwell's four equations. This is the form in a vacuum, but the general form is only a little more complex. It is also related to the [[electromagnetic four-potential]], a vector '''A''' given by

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \overline{A} + \frac{1}{c}V\mathbf{e}_4,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{overline|''A''}} is the vector magnetic potential and ''V'' is the electric potential. It is related to the electromagnetic bivector as follows

: &lt;math&gt; \partial\mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;

using the same differential operator ∂.&lt;ref&gt;Lounesto (2001) pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher dimensions==
As has been suggested in earlier sections much of geometric algebra generalises well into higher dimensions. The geometric algebra for the real space ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℝ), and the subspace of bivectors is Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The number of simple bivectors needed to form a general bivector rises with the dimension, so for ''n'' odd it is {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1) / 2}}, for ''n'' even it is {{nowrap|''n'' / 2}}. So for four and [[five-dimensional space|five]] dimensions only two simple bivectors are needed but three are required for [[six-dimensional space|six]] and [[seven-dimensional space|seven]] dimensions. For example, in six dimensions with standard basis ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) the bivector

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_{12} + \mathbf{e}_{34} + \mathbf{e}_{56} &lt;/math&gt;

is the sum of three simple bivectors but no less. As in four dimensions it is always possible to find orthogonal simple bivectors for this sum.

===Rotations in higher dimensions===
As in three and four dimensions rotors are generated by the exponential map, so

: &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{\mathbf{B}}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the rotor generated by bivector '''B'''. Simple rotations, that take place in a [[plane of rotation]] around a fixed [[blade (geometry)|blade]] of dimension {{nowrap|(''n'' − 2)}} are generated by simple bivectors, while other bivectors generate more complex rotations which can be described in terms of the simple bivectors they are sums of, each related to a plane of rotation. All bivectors can be expressed as the sum of orthogonal and commutative simple bivectors, so rotations can always be decomposed into a set of commutative rotations about the planes associated with these bivectors. The group of the rotors in ''n'' dimensions is the [[spin group]], Spin(''n'').

One notable feature, related to the number of simple bivectors and so rotation planes, is that in odd dimensions every rotation has a fixed axis – it is misleading to call it an axis of rotation as in higher dimensions rotations are taking place in multiple planes orthogonal to it. This is related to bivectors, as bivectors in odd dimensions decompose into the same number of bivectors as the even dimension below, so have the same number of planes, but one extra dimension. As each plane generates rotations in two dimensions in odd dimensions there must be one dimension, that is an axis, that is not being rotated.&lt;ref&gt;Lounesto (2001) p.222&lt;/ref&gt;

Bivectors are also related to the rotation matrix in ''n'' dimensions. As in three dimensions the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]] of the matrix can be solved to find the [[eigenvalues]]. In odd dimensions this has one real root, with eigenvector the fixed axis, and in even dimensions it has no real roots, so either all or all but one of the roots are complex conjugate pairs. Each pair is associated with a simple component of the bivector associated with the rotation. In particular the log of each pair is ± the magnitude, while eigenvectors generated from the roots are parallel to and so can be used to generate the bivector. In general the eigenvalues and bivectors are unique, and the set of eigenvalues gives the full decomposition into simple bivectors; if roots are repeated then the decomposition of the bivector into simple bivectors is not unique.

==Projective geometry==
Geometric algebra can be applied to [[projective geometry]] in a straightforward way. The geometric algebra used is {{nowrap|''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℝ), ''n'' ≥ 3}}, the algebra of the real vector space ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. This is used to describe objects in the [[real projective space]] ℝℙ&lt;sup&gt;''n − 1''&lt;/sup&gt;. The non-zero vectors in ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(ℝ) or ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are associated with points in the projective space so vectors that differ only by a scale factor, so their exterior product is zero, map to the same point. Non-zero simple bivectors in Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; represent lines in ℝℙ&lt;sup&gt;''n − 1''&lt;/sup&gt;, with bivectors differing only by a (positive or negative) scale factor representing the same line.

A description of the projective geometry can be constructed in the geometric algebra using basic operations. For example, given two distinct points in ℝℙ&lt;sup&gt;''n − 1''&lt;/sup&gt; represented by vectors '''a''' and '''b''' the line between them is given by {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} (or {{nowrap|'''b''' ∧ '''a'''}}). Two lines intersect in a point if {{nowrap|'''A''' ∧ '''B''' {{=}} 0}} for their bivectors '''A''' and '''B'''. This point is given by the vector

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{A} \lor \mathbf{B} = (\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}) J^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The operation "⋁" is the meet, which can be defined as above in terms of the join, {{nowrap|''J'' {{=}} '''A''' ∧ '''B'''}} {{clarify|If J = A ∧ B = 0, you can't invert it!|date=January 2016}} for non-zero {{nowrap|'''A''' ∧ '''B'''}}. Using these operations projective geometry can be formulated in terms of geometric algebra. For example, given a third (non-zero) bivector '''C''' the point '''p''' lies on the line given by '''C''' if and only if

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} \land \mathbf{C} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

So the condition for the lines given by '''A''', '''B''' and '''C''' to be collinear is

: &lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{A} \lor \mathbf{B}) \land \mathbf{C} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

which in ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(ℝ) and ℝℙ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathbf{ABC} \rangle = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the angle brackets denote the scalar part of the geometric product. In the same way all projective space operations can be written in terms of geometric algebra, with bivectors representing general lines in projective space, so the whole geometry can be developed using geometric algebra.&lt;ref name = "HestenesPG" /&gt;

===Tensors and matrices===
As [[#Matrices|noted above]] a bivector can be written as a skew-symmetric matrix, which through the exponential map generates a rotation matrix that describes the same rotation as the rotor, also generated by the exponential map but applied to the vector. But it is also used with other bivectors such as the [[angular velocity tensor]] and the [[electromagnetic tensor]], respectively a 3×3 and 4×4 skew-symmetric matrix or tensor.

Real bivectors in Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are isomorphic to ''n''×''n'' skew-symmetric matrices, or alternately to antisymmetric [[tensor]]s of order 2 on ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. While bivectors are isomorphic to vectors (via the dual) in three dimensions they can be represented by skew-symmetric matrices in any dimension. This is useful for relating bivectors to problems described by matrices, so they can be re-cast in terms of bivectors, given a geometric interpretation, then often solved more easily or related geometrically to other bivector problems.&lt;ref&gt;Lounesto (2001) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally every real geometric algebra is [[Classification of Clifford algebras#Classification|isomorphic to a matrix algebra]]. These contain bivectors as a subspace, though often in a way which is not especially useful. These matrices are mainly of interest as a way of classifying Clifford algebras.&lt;ref&gt;Lounesto (2001) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Страшный суд.jpg|thumb|The [[Last Judgement]] by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]
The [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] of [[white]] and [[black]] ([[light]] and [[darkness]], [[day]] and [[night]]) has a long tradition of [[metaphor]]ical usage, traceable to the [[Ancient Near East]], and explicitly in the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ''[[Table of Opposites]]''.
In [[Western culture]] as well as in [[Confucianism]], the contrast symbolizes the moral dichotomy of [[good and evil]].

== Description ==

Day, Light, and Good are often linked together, in opposition to night, darkness, and evil. These contrasting metaphors may go back as far as human history, and appear in many cultures, including both the ancient Chinese and the ancient Persians. The philosophy of [[neoplatonism]] is strongly imbued with the metaphor of goodness as light.&lt;ref name=arnheim&gt;[[Rudolf Arnheim]]. (1974). Art and visual perception. Univ of California Press. "The Symbolism of Light" (pp. 324-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Religion and mythology ===

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] has God "separate light from darkness" on the First Day.

*The Bible associates light with God, truth, and virtue; darkness is associated with sin and the Devil. Painters such as [[Rembrandt]] portrayed divine light illuminating an otherwise dark world.&lt;ref name="arnheim" /&gt;
*''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', part of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].
*The [[underworld]] ([[Hades]], [[Tartarus]]) was imagined as a [[chthonic]] place of darkness, contrasting with the [[Heaven|celestial]] realm of the [[gods]]. Christian notions of [[heaven]] and [[hell]] inherit this conception, as do the "[[fallen angel|dark angel]]s" vs. the unfallen [[angels]], often with [[aureola]] ([[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]]), in [[Christian mythology]].
*Day and night are personified as deities in various [[mythology|mythologies]] (i.e. [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Dagr]] and [[Nótt]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Hemera]] and [[Nyx]], et cetera).

=== Dress ===

* White often represents purity or innocence in Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]: A Library of Universal Knowledge|publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp.|year=1918|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as white clothing or objects can be stained easily.  In most Western countries white is the color worn by brides at weddings.  [[Angels]] are typically depicted as clothed in white robes.
**In many [[Western (genre)|Hollywood Westerns]], bad cowboys wear [[black and white hat symbolism in film|black hats]] while the good ones wear white. 
**[[Melodrama]] villains are dressed in black and heroines in white dresses. 
**This can be reversed as a deliberate play on conventions, by having the evil character dress in white, as a symbol of their hypocrisy or arrogance.  For example, Don Fanucci in ''[[The Godfather, Part II]]'' is an evil character, but wears an expensive all-white suit as a sign of his esteem, power and prestige. Sometimes protagonists can wear black too, as in ''[[Return of the Jedi]],'' wherein [[Luke Skywalker]] wears black during the final battle.
**In [[computer security]], a [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] is an attacker with evil intentions, while a [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]] bears no such ill will.  (This is derived from the Western movie convention.)

=== Magic ===
* Healing or "good" paranormal magic is called [[magic (paranormal)|White magic]]. [[Black magic]] is a destructive or evil form of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].
** ''[[A Treatise on White Magic]]'' is a book by [[Alice Bailey]], a [[Neo-Theosophy|Theosophist]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on White Magic'' New York: 1934 Lucis Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[White witch]].
** Evil [[witches]] are stereotypically dressed in black and good [[fairies]] in white.

=== Popular Culture ===
* The [[Inventio#Topoi|topos]] of "light and darkness" is also reflected in numerous titles in popular culture, such as ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), ''[[Light in My Darkness]]'' (1927), ''[[Darkness and the Light]]'' (1942), ''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]'' (1969), ''[[From Darkness to Light]]'' (1973), ''[[Darkness and Light (novel)|Darkness and Light]]'' (1989), ''[[The Lord of the Light and of the Darkness]]'' (1993), the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space 9]]'' episode "[[The Darkness and the Light (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Darkness and the Light]]" (1997), the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Between the Darkness and the Light]]" (1997), and ''[[Out of the Darkness, Into the Light]]'' (1998).
* In works of [[fantasy]] fiction, the main antagonist is often called a "[[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]]", for example Sauron in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
* [[George Orwell]] makes a bitterly ironic use of the "light and darkness" topos in his ''[[Nineteen Eighty Four]]''. In the early part of the book the protagonist gets a promise that "We will meet in the place where there is no darkness" – which he interprets as referring to a place where the oppressive totalitarian state does not rule. But the man who made the promise was in fact an agent of the [[Thought Police]] – and they eventually meet as prisoner and interrogator where there is indeed no darkness, in detention cells where the light remains on permanently, day and night, as an additional means of torturing detainees.

=== Other Examples ===
* The [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] vs. the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* "[[False dilemma#Black-and-white thinking|Black and white thinking]]" is the [[false dichotomy]] of assuming anything not good is evil and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18113">The '''capitalist peace''', or '''capitalist peace theory''', posits that according to a given criterion for economic development ([[capitalism]]), developed economies have not engaged in war with each other, and rarely enter into low-level disputes. These theories have been proposed as an explanation for the [[democratic peace theory]] by accounting for both democracy and the peace among democratic nations. The exact nature of the causality depends upon both the proposed variable and the measure of the indicator for the concept used.

==History==
The philosophical roots of capitalist peace can be traced back to [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Norman Angell]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical economic theory]]. In his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, Immanuel Kant argued, among other things, that "the spirit of commerce . . . sooner or later takes hold of every nation, and is incompatible with war."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1939 [1795]. Perpetual Peace. Translated and Edited by Nicholas Murray Butler. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century Norman Angell reasoned that trade interdependence in modern economies makes war unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Norman. 1913 [1911]. The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power to National Advantage. G.P. Putnam's Sons: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Joseph Schumpeter offered the observation that with the advancement of capitalism people form "an unwarlike disposition."&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph. 1955. Imperialism ; Social Classes : Two Essays. Translated by Heinz Norden. New York : Meridian Books. Pp. 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern capitalist peace emerged with the democratic peace. In one of the earliest systematic confirmations of the democratic peace,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A. Bremer, "Dangerous Dyads: Conditions Affecting the Likelihood of Interstate War, 1816-1965," ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 36:309-41 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Bremer also examined the relationship between capitalism and war. He found capitalism to be a more powerful force for peace than democracy, yet the democratic peace accrued much more attention in the academic and policy literature. Today at least four theories of capitalist peace can be identified, with some of these theories claiming that a capitalist peace may subsume the democratic one, given that capitalism may be the cause of both democracy and peace.

==Definitions==
A key to explaining the capitalist peace rests on the indicative measures for capitalism. There are at least four different definitions of capitalism currently being employed. {{Citation Needed|reason=There's just so many claims here without any citation at all|date=June 2018}}

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
A number of models of the capitalist peace equate free markets with capitalism. In this usage, free markets and trade cause economic development, which in turn accounts for the peace among nations with advanced economies.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
A second understanding of capitalism is one that is conceptualized based on the intensity of market contracting in a society, where a capitalist economy is defined as one where most actors in the economy are integrated by contracting in the market. By definition contracts must be voluntary and undertaken without coercion.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;===
In the third measure for capitalism  inter-state trade is seen as an indicator for a developed, hence a capitalist economy. The level of trade interdependence, therefore, is the operationalized measure of this third type of capitalism.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;===
The final way that capitalism has been measured is with the size of government. States that have limited governments, hence large private sectors, are supposed to be capitalist economies. The size of government is used as an indicator for the level of capitalism a state has achieved.

==Explanations==
There are five primary theories that have attempted to explain the capitalist peace, each of which has used one of the above definitions of capitalism. Each theory has achieved varying levels of success and empirical corroboration, although they all rely on capitalism as the main explanatory variable for peace.

===Trade interdependence===
The interdependent trade explanation for the capitalist peace is built on the foundations of classical economic theory. This idea, which can be traced back to Kant, became the original theoretical explanation for the capitalist peace. In 1996, Erich Weede tied trade and free markets to development and peace, proposing that trade interdependence caused peace between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Economic Development, Social Order, and World Politics. Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Weede followed this up with what he called the "capitalist peace".&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Balance of Power, Globalization and the Capitalist Peace, Potsdam: Liberal Verlag (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the empirical findings of the link between trade and development have been drawn into question, as one study found that the proportion of GDP to foreign trade is only 0.08, measured by logged GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003785074 | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | year = 2010 | title = Coming to Terms with the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 185–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic norms theory===
Economic norms theory links the economic conditions of [[clientelism]], which prevail in many lower income societies, and a contract-intensive economy, which prevails in many higher income societies, with divergent political interests and habits.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace," ''International Security'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (Spring 2009), 52-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror," ''International Security'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Winter 2002-2003), 5-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic norms theory arose as an alternative explanation to the democratic peace, because it identified the causal relationship between democracy and peace as spurious. [[Michael Mousseau]] identified contract-intensive economies as a possible cause of both democracy and peace. The explanation is based on two aspects widely accepted in social science: (1) [[bounded rationality]]; and (2) divergent hierarchies between clientelism and contract-intensive economies. In contract-intensive societies, individuals have a loyalty towards the state that enforces the contracts between strangers. As a consequence, individuals in these societies expect that their states enforce contracts reliably and impartially, protect individual rights, and make efforts to enhance the general welfare. Moreover, with the assumption of bounded rationality, individuals routinely dependent on trusting strangers in contracts will develop the habits of trusting strangers and preferring universal rights, impartial law, and liberal democratic government. In contrast, individuals in contract-poor societies will develop the habits of abiding by the commands of group leaders, and distrusting those from out-groups.

According to economic norms theory, the people in contract-rich nations enjoy a permanent and positive peace. As long as their states accede to popular demands and remain reliably impartial, individuals in nations with contract intensive economies have an interest in everyone’s rights and material welfare, within and outside the nation. Consequently, contract-intensive nations not only avoid war with each other but engage in intense levels of mutual cooperation specifically aimed at promoting each other's material welfare. Leaders of nations with contract-poor economies, in contrast, pursue the interests of their dominant groups and have no interest in the security or welfare of members of out-groups, whether they are internal or external to the nation.

===Free capital markets/capital openness===
This theory, originally introduced by [[EriK Gartzke]], [[Quan Li (academic)|Quan Li]], and [[Charles Boehmer]],  argues that nations with a high level of capital openness are able to avoid conflict with each other and maintain a lasting peace. In particular, nations with freer capital markets are more dependent on international investors, because the investors are likely to withdraw if the country is engaged in a war or inter-state conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "The Capitalist Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:166-191 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt, "International Crises and the Capitalist Peace," ''International Interactions'', 2010 (forthcoming)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, leaders of states give greater credibility to threats made by countries with higher levels of capital openness, causing the aforementioned countries to be more peaceful than others by avoiding the possibility of misrepresentation of information. One particular advantage of this theory is that it has been formalized, which helps ensure its internal consistency. The 2007 study performed by Gartzke claimed to make the democratic peace variable insignificant when capital openness was controlled for, but a later re-examination found this study to have several design errors.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dafoe, "Democracy Still Matters: The Risks of Sample Censoring and Cross-Sectional and Temporal Controls," (2009). Available at www.allandafoe.com/research.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Using measured logged GDP per capita, development correlates with openness to foreign capital at 0.14, slightly higher than trade.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, et al., "Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict," ''International Organization'', 55:391-438 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the most recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784846 | author = Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt | year = 2010 | title = International Crises and the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 115–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; failed to control for the variables of economic norms theory and the size of government explanation.

===Size of government===
The size of government explanation for the capitalist peace relies on the fourth definition of capitalism.  Introduced by [[Patrick J. McDonald]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. McDonald, "The Purse Strings of Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:569-582 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784911 | author = Patrick J. McDonald | year = 2010 | title = Capitalism, Commitment, and Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 146–168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is that smaller governments are more dependent than larger or socialist governments on raising taxes for fighting wars. This makes the commitments of nations with smaller governments more credible than those with larger ones, allowing for nations with smaller governments, and thus "capitalist" economies, to be better positioned for avoiding conflicts.

===Ruling others by force===
This theory, adduces that if men want to oppose war, it is [[statism]] that they must oppose. So long as they hold the tribal notion that the individual is sacrificial fodder for the collective, that some men have the right to rule others by force, and that some (any) alleged "good" can justify it—there can be no peace within a nation and no peace among nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1966). "The Roots of War," [[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
==Golden arches theory==

In [[Thomas L. Friedman]]'s 1999 book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2000) ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree''. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; the following observation was presented: "No two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each other since each got its McDonald's". He supported that observation, as a theory, by stating that when a country has reached an [[economic development]] where it has a [[middle class]] strong enough to support a McDonald's network, it would become a "McDonald's country", and will not be interested in fighting wars anymore.

Shortly after the book was published, [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombed Yugoslavia]]. On the first day of the bombing, McDonald's restaurants in [[Belgrade]] were demolished by angry protesters and were rebuilt only after the bombing ended. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman argued that this exception proved the rule: the war ended quickly, he argued, partly because the Serbian population did not want to lose their place in a global system "symbolised by McDonald's" (Friedman 2000: 252&amp;ndash;253).

Critics have pointed to two other conflicts fought before 2000 as counterexamples, depending on what one considers "a war":

* The 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama]]
* In 1999, India and Pakistan fought a war over [[Kashmir]], known as the [[Kargil War]]. Both countries had (and continue to have) McDonald's restaurants. Although the war was not fought in all possible theatres (such as Rajasthan and Punjab borders), both countries mobilised their military all along their common borders and both countries made threats involving their nuclear capabilities.

In 2005, Friedman said that he framed this theory in terms of McDonald's [[Golden Arches]] "with [[tongue in cheek|tongue slightly in cheek]]".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2005) [[The Guardian]], 21 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 book ''[[The World is Flat]]'' he offered an updated theory he labelled the [[Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention]].

Since 2005, there have been three more conflicts cited as counterexamples:

* The 2006 war between [[Israel]] and [[Lebanon]], following hostilities ongoing since 1973, with [[South Lebanon]] occupied until May 2000. (McDonald's franchises were established in Israel and Lebanon in 1993 and 1998, respectively.) However, the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] were not a party to the fighting, the Israel Defense Forces action being taken instead against the paramilitary group [[Hezbollah]].
* The [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between [[Russia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time (restaurants began in the two countries in 1990 and 1999, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/08/russia-georgia-and-ir-theory-part-i.html Russia, Georgia, and IR Theory: Part 1], ''Lawyers, Guns, and Money'' (featuring photos of McDonald's in both countries)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[2014 Crimean crisis]] between Russia and [[Ukraine]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time.

Friedman's point is that due to [[globalization]], countries that have made strong economic ties with one another have too much to lose to ever go to war with one another. Regardless of whether the statement is true, the conclusions to be drawn are unclear. The global expansion of McDonald's restaurants is a relatively recent phenomenon when put into the context of the [[history of warfare]], and, with a few notable exceptions, has proceeded into relatively stable markets.

==Dell theory==

The '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''', also known as simply the '''Dell Theory''', has been presented by [[Thomas Friedman]] in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]''. This theory is an updated version of his previous "[[Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention]]".

:"The Dell Theory stipulates: No two countries that are both part of a major global supply chain, like [[Dell]]’s, will ever fight a war against each other as long as they are both part of the same global supply chain."&lt;ref name="Friedman, 421"&gt;''The World is Flat'' ({{ISBN|1-59397-668-2}}), Thomas L. Friedman, pg 421&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, as long as corporations have major [[supply chain]] operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts.  This is due to the economic interdependence between nations that arises from a large corporation (such as [[Dell]]) having supply chain operations in multiple global locations and the reluctance of developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) to give up their newfound wealth.

In his previous book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'', Friedman argued that no two nations with a [[McDonald's]] franchise had ever gone to war with one another: this was known as the [[Golden Arches theory]].  Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the "Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention" by saying that people or nations don't just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by McDonald's franchise in their downtown, but want to have the lump of the labour sector that is created by [[globalization]]. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multi-national companies who venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.

[[Thomas Friedman]] also warns in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]'' that the Dell Theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations who are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It rather means that the governments of these nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. These costs include the long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain.

This theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in their [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff|2001 - 2002 nuclear standoff]], where India was at risk of losing its global partners. The relationship between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] was also cited as an example of this theory - they both have strong supply relations with each other and a war between the two seems very unlikely today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13090">A '''causal theory of reference''' is a theory of how terms acquire specific [[reference|referents]] based on evidence. Such theories have been used to describe many referring terms, particularly logical terms, [[proper names]], and [[natural kind]] terms. In the case of names, for example, a causal theory of reference typically involves the following claims:

* a name's [[reference|referent]] is fixed by an original act of naming (also called a "dubbing" or, by [[Saul Kripke]], an "initial baptism"), whereupon the name becomes a [[rigid designator]] of that object.
* later uses of the name succeed in referring to the referent by being linked to that original act via a [[Causality|causal chain]].

Weaker versions of the position (perhaps not properly called "causal theories"), claim merely that, in many cases, events in the causal history of a speaker's use of the term, including when the term was first acquired, must be considered to correctly assign references to the speaker's words.

Causal theories of names became popular during the 1970s, under the influence of work by Saul Kripke and [[Keith Donnellan]]. Kripke and [[Hilary Putnam]] also defended an analogous causal account of [[natural kind]] terms.

== Kripke's causal account of names ==
In lectures later published as ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', Kripke provided a rough outline of his causal theory of reference for names. Although he refused to explicitly endorse such a theory, he indicated that such an approach was far more promising than the then-popular [[descriptive theory of names]] introduced by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], according to which names are in fact disguised [[definite descriptions]]. Kripke argued that in order to use a name successfully to refer to something, you do not have to be acquainted with a uniquely identifying description of that thing. Rather, your use of the name need only be caused (in an appropriate way) by the naming of that thing.

Such a causal process might proceed as follows: the parents of a newborn baby name it, pointing to the child and saying "we'll call her 'Jane'." Henceforth everyone calls her 'Jane'. With that act, the parents give the girl her name. The assembled family and friends now know that 'Jane' is a name which refers to Jane. This is referred to as Jane's dubbing, naming, or initial baptism.

However, not everyone who knows Jane and uses the name 'Jane' to refer to her was present at this naming. So how is it that when ''they'' use the name 'Jane', they are referring to Jane? The answer provided by causal theories is that there is a causal chain that passes from the original observers of Jane's naming to everyone else who uses her name. For example, maybe Jill was not at the naming, but Jill learns about Jane, and learns that her name is 'Jane', from Jane's mother, who ''was'' there. She then uses the name 'Jane' with the intention of referring to the child Jane's mother referred to. Jill can now use the name, and her use of it can in turn transmit the ability to refer to Jane to other speakers.

Philosophers such as [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] have insisted that the theory's account of the dubbing process needs to be broadened to include what are called 'multiple groundings'. After her initial baptism, uses of 'Jane' in the presence of Jane may, under the right circumstances, be considered to further ground the name ('Jane') in its referent (Jane). That is, if I am in direct contact with Jane, the reference for my utterance of the name 'Jane' may be fixed not simply by a causal chain through people who had encountered her earlier (when she was first named); it may also be indexically fixed to Jane at the moment of my utterance. Thus our modern day use of a name such as 'Christopher Columbus' can be thought of as referring to Columbus through a causal chain that terminates not simply in one instance of his naming, but rather in a series of grounding uses of the name that occurred throughout his life. Under certain circumstances of confusion, this can lead to the alteration of a name's referent (for one example of how this might happen, see [[Twin Earth thought experiment]]).

== Motivation ==
Causal theories of reference were born partially in response to the widespread acceptance of Russellian descriptive theories. Russell found that certain [[logic]]al [[contradiction]]s could be avoided if names were considered disguised [[definite description]]s (a similar view is often attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], mostly on the strength of a footnoted comment in "[[On Sense and Reference]]", although many Frege scholars consider this attribution misguided).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} On such an account, the name 'Aristotle' might be seen as meaning 'the student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great'. Later description theorists expanded upon this by suggesting that a name expressed not one particular description, but many (perhaps constituting all of one's essential knowledge of the individual named), or a weighted average of these descriptions.

Kripke found this account to be deeply flawed, for a number of reasons. Notably:

* We can successfully refer to individuals for whom we have ''no'' uniquely identifying description. (For example, a speaker can talk about Phillie Sophik even if one only knows him as 'some poet'.)
* We can successfully refer to individuals for whom the only identifying descriptions we have fail to refer as we believe them to. (Many speakers have no identifying beliefs about [[Christopher Columbus]] other than 'the first European in North America' or 'the first person to believe that the earth was round'. Both of these beliefs are incorrect. Nevertheless, when such a person says 'Christopher Columbus', we acknowledge that they are referring to Christopher Columbus, not to whatever individual satisfies one of those descriptions.)
* We use names to speak hypothetically about what ''could'' have happened to a person. A name functions as a [[rigid designator]], while a definite description does not. (One could say 'If Aristotle had died young, he would never have taught Alexander the Great.' But if 'the teacher of Alexander the Great' were a component of the ''meaning'' of 'Aristotle' then this would be nonsense.)

A causal theory avoids these difficulties. A name refers rigidly to the bearer to which it is causally connected, regardless of any particular facts about the bearer, and in all [[possible worlds]].

The same motivations apply to causal theories in regard to other sorts of terms. Putnam, for instance, attempted to establish that 'water' refers rigidly to the stuff that we do in fact call 'water', to the exclusion of any possible identical water-like substance for which we have no causal connection. These considerations motivate [[semantic externalism]]. Because speakers interact with a natural kind such as water regularly, and because there is generally no naming ceremony through which their names are formalized, the multiple groundings described above are even more essential to a causal account of such terms. A speaker whose environment changes may thus observe that the referents of his terms shift, as described in the [[Twin Earth thought experiment|Twin Earth]] and [[Swamp man]] [[thought experiment]]s.

== Variations&lt;!--'Causal-historical theory of reference', 'Causal-descriptive theory of reference', and 'Descriptive-causal theory of reference' redirect here--&gt; ==
Variations of the causal theory include:
* The '''causal-historical theory of reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the original version of the causal theory. It was put forward by [[Keith Donnellan]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;Donnellan, Keith. (1972). "Proper Names and Identifying Descriptions."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Kripke]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, S. "A Puzzle about Belief", in A. Margalit (ed.), ''Meaning and Use'', Reidel, pp. 239–83 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/ Names (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; This view introduces the idea of reference-passing links in a causal-historical chain.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;
* The '''descriptive-causal theory of reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also '''causal-descriptive theory of reference'''),&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name=Psillos279&gt;[[Stathis Psillos]], ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; a view put forward by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]&lt;ref name=Psillos279/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gattei&gt;Stefano Gattei, ''Thomas Kuhn's 'Linguistic Turn' and the Legacy of Logical Empiricism: Incommensurability, Rationality and the Search for Truth'', Ashgate Publishing, 2012, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Lewis (1984), "Putnam's Paradox." ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'', '''62'''(3), 221–36; reprinted in D. Lewis (1999), ''Papers on metaphysics and epistemology'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 56–77.&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the idea that a minimal descriptive apparatus needs to be added to the causal relations between speaker and object.&lt;ref name=Gattei/&gt; (See also [[Structuralism (philosophy of science)#Further criticism|Criticism of structuralism]].)

== Criticism of the theory ==
[[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] argued that the causal theory, or at least certain common and over-simple variants of it, have the consequence that, however remote or obscure the causal connection between someone's use of a proper name and the object it originally referred to, they still refer to that object when they use the name. (Imagine a name briefly overheard in a train or café.) The theory effectively ignores context and makes reference into a magic trick. Evans describes it as a "[[photograph]]" theory of reference.{{citation needed|reason=Evans' argument and quote are herein unsourced-no indication of where he argued this|date=April 2016}}

The links between different users of the name are particularly obscure. Each user must somehow pass the name on to the next, and must somehow "mean" the right individual as they do so (suppose "Socrates" is the name of a pet [[aardvark]]). Kripke himself notes the difficulty, [[John Searle]] makes much of it.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2015}}

[[Mark Sainsbury (philosopher)|Mark Sainsbury]] argued&lt;ref&gt;Sainsbury, R.M., ''Departing From Frege: Essays in the Philosophy of Language'', Routledge, 2002, Essay XII.&lt;/ref&gt; for a causal theory similar to Kripke's, except that the baptised object is eliminated. A "baptism" may be a baptism of nothing, he argues: a name can be intelligibly introduced even if it names nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Sainsbury|2001|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causal chain we associate with the use of proper names may begin merely with a "journalistic" source.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Sainsbury|2001|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causal theory has a difficult time explaining the phenomenon of reference change. [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] cites the example of when [[Marco Polo]] unknowingly referred to the African Island as "Madagascar" when the natives actually used the term to refer to a part of the mainland. Evans claims that Polo clearly intended to use the term as the natives do, but somehow changed the meaning of the term "Madagascar" to refer to the island as it is known today. [[Michael Devitt]] claims that repeated groundings in an object can account for reference change. However, such a response leaves open the problem of cognitive significance that originally intrigued Russell and Frege.

East Asians are more likely than Americans to have intuitions about reference in line with descriptivist theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{

The '''Centre for Appropriate Rural Technology''' (CART) is a community-driven [[sustainable development]] project located in the [[Eastern Cape]] of [[South Africa]]. It functions as a life skills centre in the heart of Sicambeni Village, a rural village near Port St Johns.

==Background==
[[Image:theview.jpg|right|500px]]
The Eastern Cape is South Africa’s poorest region and has for many years been a victim of massive skill loss due to the [[rural exodus|migration]] of workers to the larger cities in seek of work.  Invariably these migrants find themselves living in the already overcrowded [[Township (South Africa)]] compounding South Africa’s desperate slum culture.
Having accrued 15 years of experience working in several African Countries, building communities with the homeless, CART was formed as a centre to tackle poverty in a more holistic way. CART aims to give the local population the skills and technology to allow them to live self-sustainably without the need to seek work outside of their own villages, ultimately allowing the migrants to return to their homelands.

==Goals==
[[Image:AllofCART.jpg|right|500px]]
CART’s primary goal is to complete the self sustainable model, serving as the epicentre to the surrounding village of over four hundred families. Technology developed here is being taught to and implemented within the community to produce a fully sustainable village. CART ensures that any technology implemented can be replicated in other rural environments, allowing this sustainable village to become a living example to other communities around South Africa and Globally. 

CART operates numerous other initiatives, including innovative farming techniques, to provide much needed nutritional enrichment and a HIV support group offering nutritional, physical and spiritual healing. 

==Technologies==
[[Image:Aeratedbed.JPG|right|200 px]]
[[Image:Lotsofbricks.JPG|right|200 px]]
One of the primary goals of CART is to experiment with and implement technologies that can be used sustainably in a rural environment. This includes effective water, waste, energy and building systems.

===Aerated beds===
[[Image:Brickpit.JPG|right|200 px]]
[[Image:Education centre.JPG|right|200 px]]
The aerated, raised beds can be implemented anywhere but are ideally suited to areas that have high [[clay]] content in the soil structure. Though clay-rich soil is ideal for keeping nutrients in the soil, it can also retain too much water. The raised structure design allows better [[drainage]], minimizes the threat of [[root rot]], and enables rooting vegetables (carrots, beets, onions, etc.) to grow significantly larger than when planted in the ground. The structure's unique shape also makes monitoring the fertility easier and the overall planting surface is greatly improved.

The garden resembles a [[compost heap]] with green matter placed on the very bottom of the structure, which is made from lengths of thin poles (latte). Decomposed material (wood chips, leaves, etc.) is layered on top of the green matter, followed by a mix of soil and compost. Seedlings are planted and mulched on top of the bed while herbs are planted on the sides, creating a network of strong roots to help contain the soil in the garden structure.

===Brick machine===
[[Image:Thedam.JPG|right|200 px]]
A hand-operated mechanical press creates stabilised bricks. Clay based soil mixed with five percent cement is used to form the base of the bricks.

===Dams===
[[Image:Biodigester.JPG|right|200 px]]
[[Image:Insidethatchedroof.JPG|right|200 px]]
Water management problems mean that only one crop per year is grown. Sometime the community has little choice but to drink from [[water contamination|contaminated rivers]]. The project aims to improve on this by using year round planting and more effective water management techniques.

===Biodigester===
[[Image:Small Garden Prototype Complete.png|right|200 px]]
[[Image:Sustainable.jpg|right|200 px]]
One of the most common problems facing rural communities around the world is that of waste disposal.  The incorrect disposal of animal and human waste can lead to the poisoning of waterways, render land un-farmable and cause numerous fatal diseases such as [[Cholera]], [[Typhoid]] and [[Diphtheria]].  CART needed a way to not only dispose of its waste but also to find a way of actually making this waste useful.  After much research it was decided that a [[Biodigester]] could provide the solution to this problem, however no design existed that could be cheaply replicated in rural areas – so CART made one.   Conventional Biodigesters cost in the region of US$30,000, CART’s costs about US$500.

The simple design consists of a hole 7m x 1.5m x 1.5m into which a reinforced PVC cylindrical black bag is placed.  At one end is the ‘inlet’ situated at the bottom of the bag, a pipe from the toilet block brings all human waste into the bag together with a hatch for animal and kitchen waste.  Two outlet pipes are situated at the other end of the bag, one at the top for gas removal the other is 1/3 of the way up for liquid removal.  The design incorporates a black colour so as to attract solar heat to accelerate decomposition.  The placement of the outlet pipe is important as it is necessary to maintain 1/3 liquids : 2/3 gas.

Due to the sealed nature of the bag all this waste begins to decompose anaerobically releasing [[methane]] gas, water and sludge waste whilst also killing harmful [[pathogens]] such as [[E-Coli]].  The methane gas is released and captured using the valve at the top of the outlet end of the bag, this gas can be used for cooking, lighting and heating  (although CART currently intend to use the gas solely for cooking.)  The water is released through the outlet pipe, this water is known as ‘High nutrient’ or ‘Black’ water.  Less than 10% of the products are solids and therefore only need removing from the bag every few years, these solids can be used as a high nutrient fertiliser for fruit trees or for plants where the fertiliser does not come into direct contact with the crop.  The black water is mixed with grey waters, such as shower or washing water (N.B CART only uses organic, [[bio-degradable]] washing products to ensure no toxins are introduced to the cycle.)  This water is filtered through sand and charcoal and used to irrigate the food gardens.  Excess water, together with runoff from the gardens is collected in the Dam, from which it can be used to water gardens in the dry season or filtered further making it safe for drinking (see [[water cycle]]).

===Indoor gardens===
The indoor garden is a conceptual design for a compact, portable garden that can be put in almost any living space. Ideally, the garden would be put under a south-facing window (in the northern hemisphere), and would provide enough food to sustain a family.

In at least one source,&lt;ref&gt;"From Aristotle to EA: a type theory for EA"{{reliable source|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''class''' is a set in which an individual member can be recognized in one or both of two ways: a) it is included in an [[Extensionality|extensional]] definition of the whole set (a list of set members) b) it matches an [[Intensional definition]] of one set member. By contrast, a "type" is an intensional definition; it is a description that is sufficiently generalized to fit every member of a set.

[[Philosopher]]s sometimes distinguish classes from [[type (metaphysics)|types]] and [[natural kind|kinds]].  We can talk about the ''class'' of human beings, just as we can talk about the ''type'' (or ''natural kind''), human being, or humanity. How, then, might classes differ from types?  One might well think they are not actually different [[category of being|categories of being]], but typically, while both are treated as [[abstract object]]s, classes are not usually treated as [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]], whereas types usually are. Whether natural kinds ought to be considered universals is vexed; see [[natural kind]].

There is, in any case, a difference in how we talk about types or kinds. We say that [[Socrates]] is a ''[[Type-token distinction|token]]'' of a type, or an ''[[Instantiation principle|instance]]'' of the natural kind, ''human'' ''being''. But notice that we say instead that Socrates is a ''member'' of the class of human beings.  We would not say that Socrates is a "member" of the type or kind, human beings. Nor would we say he is a type (or kind) of a class. He is a token (instance) of the type (kind).  So the linguistic difference is: types (or kinds) have tokens (or instances); classes, on the other hand, have members.

The concept of a class is similar to the concept of a set defined by its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Antony Flew]]|page=64|title=Dictionary of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the class is extensional. If, however, a set is defined intensionally, then it is a set of things that meet some requirement to be a member. Thus, such a set can be seen as creating a type. Note that it also creates a class from the extension of the intensional set. A type always has a corresponding class (though that class might have no members), but a class does not necessarily have a corresponding type.

'''Control''', or '''controlling''', is one of the managerial functions like ''planning'', ''organizing'', ''staffing'' and ''directing''. It is an important function because it helps to check the errors and to take the corrective action so that deviation from standards are minimized and stated goals of the organization are achieved in a desired manner.

According to modern concepts, control is a foreseeing action whereas earlier concept of control was used only when errors were detected. Control in management means setting standards, measuring actual performance and taking corrective action.

== Definition ==
In 1916, [[Henri Fayol]] formulated one of the first definitions of control as it pertains to management: &lt;blockquote&gt;
''Control of an undertaking consists of seeing that everything is being carried out in accordance with the plan which has been adopted, the orders which have been given, and the principles which have been laid down. Its object is to point out mistakes in order that they may be rectified and prevented from recurring.''&lt;ref name="Fayol"&gt;{{cite book |author= Henri Fayol|title= General and Industrial Management|publisher= Pitman Publishing|location=New York|year=1949|pages=107–109|isbn=|oclc=825227|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Edward Francis Leopold Brech|EFL Brech]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Control is checking current performance against pre-determined standards contained in the plans, with a view to ensure adequate progress and satisfactory performance.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Harold Koontz]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Controlling is the measurement and correction of performance in order to make sure that enterprise objectives and the plans devised to attain them are accomplished.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Stafford Beer]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;
''Management is the profession of control.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert J. Mockler]] presented a more comprehensive definition of managerial control:&lt;blockquote&gt; 
''Management control can be defined as a systematic effort by business management to compare performance to predetermined standards, plans, or objectives in order to determine whether performance is in line with these standards and presumably in order to take any remedial action required to see that human and other corporate resources are being used in the most effective and efficient way possible in achieving corporate objectives.''&lt;ref name="Mockler"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert J. Mockler|title=Readings in Management Control|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York|year=1970|pages=14–17|isbn=978-0-390-64439-8 |oclc=115076|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also control can be defined as ''"that function of the system that adjusts operations as needed to achieve the plan, or to maintain variations from system objectives within allowable limits"''. The control subsystem functions in close harmony with the operating system. The degree to which they interact depends on the nature of the operating system and its objectives. Stability concerns a system's ability to maintain a pattern of output without wide fluctuations. Rapidity of response pertains to the speed with which a system can correct variations and return to expected output.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn=978-0-87620-540-2 |oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A political election can illustrate the concept of control and the importance of feedback. Each party organizes a campaign to get its candidate selected and outlines a plan to inform the public about both the candidate's credentials and the party's platform. As the election nears, opinion polls furnish feedback about the effectiveness of the campaign and about each candidate's chances to win. Depending on the nature of this feedback, certain adjustments in strategy and/or tactics can be made in an attempt to achieve the desired result.

From these definitions it can be stated that there is close link between planning and controlling. Planning is a process by which an organization's objectives and the methods to achieve the objectives are established, and controlling is a process which measures and directs the actual performance against the planned goals of the organization. Thus, goals and objectives are often referred to as [[siamese twins]] of [[management]].
the managerial function of management and correction of performance in order to make sure that enterprise objectives and the goals devised to attain them being accomplished.

==Elements==
The four basic elements in a control system:
# the characteristic or condition to be controlled
# the sensor
# the comparator
# the activator

occur in the same sequence and maintain a consistent relationships to each other in every system.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
 
The first element is the ''characteristic'' or condition of the operating system which is to be measured. We select a specific characteristic because a correlation exists between it and how the system is performing. The characteristic can be the output of the system during any stage of processing or it may be a condition that is the result of the system. For example, it may be the heat energy produced by the furnace or the temperature in the room which has changed because of the heat generated by the furnace. In an elementary school system, the hours a teacher works or the gain in knowledge demonstrated by the students on a national examination are examples of characteristics that may be selected for measurement, or control.

The second element of control, the ''sensor'', is a means for measuring the characteristic or condition. For example, in a home heating system this device would be the thermostat, and in a quality-control system this measurement might be performed by a visual inspection of the product.

The third element of control, the [[comparator]], determines the need for correction by comparing what is occurring with what has been planned. Some deviation from the plan is usual and expected, but when variations are beyond those considered acceptable, corrective action is required. It involves a sort of preventative action which indicates that good control is being achieved.

The fourth element of control, the activator, is the corrective action taken to return the system to its expected output. The actual person, device, or method used to direct corrective inputs into the operating system may take a variety of forms. It may be a hydraulic controller positioned by a solenoid or electric motor in response to an electronic error signal, an employee directed to rework the parts that failed to pass quality inspection, or a school principal who decides to buy additional books to provide for an increased number of students. As long as a plan is performed within allowable limits, corrective action is not necessary; however, this seldom occurs in practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Information]] is the medium of control, because the flow of sensory data and later the flow of corrective information allow a characteristic or condition of the system to be controlled. To illustrate how information flow facilitates control, let us review the elements of control in the context of information.&lt;ref name="Eilon"&gt;{{cite book |author=Samuel Eilon|title=Management control|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|year=1979|pages=|isbn=978-0-08-022482-4 |oclc=4193519|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between the elements of control and real time information===

====Controlled characteristic or condition====
The primary requirement of a control system is that it maintains the level and kind of output necessary to achieve the system's objectives.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book |author=James G March; Herbert A Simon|title= Organizations|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1958|pages=9–11|isbn=978-0-471-56793-6 |oclc=1329335}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually impractical to control every feature and condition associated with the system's output. Therefore, the choice of the controlled item (and appropriate information about it) is extremely important. There should be a direct correlation between the controlled item and the system's operation. In other words, control of the selected characteristic should have a direct relationship to the goal or objective of the system.

====Sensor====
After the [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]] is sensed, or measured, information pertinent to control is fed back. Exactly what information needs to be transmitted and also the language that will best facilitate the communication process and reduce the possibility of distortion in transmission must be carefully considered. Information that is to be compared with the standard, or plan, should be expressed in the same terms or language as in the original plan to facilitate decision making. Using machine methods (computers) may require extensive translation of the information. Since optimal languages for computation and for human review are not always the same, the relative ease of translation may be a significant factor in selecting the units of measurement or the language unit in the sensing element.

In many instances, the measurement may be sampled rather than providing a complete and continuous feedback of information about the operation. A sampling procedure suggests measuring some segment or portion of the operation that will represent the total.&lt;ref name="Mockler"/&gt;

====Comparison with standard====
In a [[social system]], the norms of acceptable behavior become the standard against which so-called [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] may be judged. Regulations and laws provide a more formal collection of information for society. Social norms change, but very slowly. In contrast, the standards outlined by a formal law can be changed from one day to the next through revision, discontinuation, or replacement by another.
Information about deviant behavior becomes the basis for controlling [[Social action|social activity]]. Output information is compared with the standard or norm and significant deviations are noted. In an industrial example, frequency distribution (a tabulation of the number of times a given characteristic occurs within the sample of products being checked) may be used to show the average quality, the spread, and the comparison of output with a standard.

If there is a significant and uncorrectable difference between output and plan, the system is "out of control." This means that the objectives of the system are not feasible in relation to the capabilities of the present design. Either the objectives must be reevaluated or the system redesigned to add new capacity or capability. For example, the traffic in drugs has been increasing in some cities at an alarming rate. The citizens must decide whether to revise the police system so as to regain control, or whether to modify the law to reflect a different norm of acceptable behavior.

====Implementor====
The activator unit responds to the [[information]] received from the comparator and initiates corrective action. If the system is a machine-to-machine system, the corrective inputs (decision rules) are designed into the network. When the control relates to a man-to-machine or man-to-man system, however, the individual(s) in charge must evaluate (1) the accuracy of the feedback information, (2) the significance of the variation, and (3) what corrective inputs will restore the system to a reasonable degree of stability. Once the decision has been made to direct new inputs into the [[system]], the actual process may be relatively easy. A small amount of energy can change the operation of jet airplanes, automatic steel mills, and hydroelectric power plants. The pilot presses a button, and the landing gear of the airplane goes up or down; the operator of a steel mill pushes a lever, and a ribbon of white-hot steel races through the plant; a worker at a control board directs the flow of electrical energy throughout a regional [[wikt:network|network]] of stations and substations. It takes but a small amount of control energy to release or stop large quantities of input.&lt;ref name="Eilon"/&gt;

The comparator may be located far from the [[operating system]], although at least some of the elements must be in close proximity to operations. For example, the measurement (the sensory element) is usually at the point of operations. The measurement information can be transmitted to a distant point for comparison with the standard (comparator), and when deviations occur, the correcting input can be released from the distant point. However, the input (activator) will be located at the operating system. This ability to control from afar means that aircraft can be flown by remote control, dangerous manufacturing processes can be operated from a safe distance, and national organizations can be directed from centralized headquarters in Dublin, Ireland.

==Process==
Step 1. Establishment of Standard.

Standards are the criteria against which actual performance will be measured. Standards are set in both quantitative and qualitative terms.

Step 2. Measurement of actual performance

Performance is measured in an objective and reliable manner. It should be checked in the same unit in which the standards are set.

Step 3. Comparing actual performance with standards.

Step 4. Analysis the cause of deviations.

Step 5. Taking corrective action.

==Kinds==
Control may be grouped according to three general classifications:&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
# the nature of the information flow designed into the system (open- or closed-loop control)
# the kind of components included in the design (man or machine control systems)
# the relationship of control to the decision process (organizational or operational control).

===Open- and closed-loop control===

A street-lighting system controlled by a timing device is an example of an open-loop system. At a certain time each evening, a mechanical device closes the circuit and energy flows through the electric lines to light the lamps. Note, however, that the timing mechanism is an independent unit and is not measuring the objective function of the lighting system. If the lights should be needed on a dark, stormy day the timing device would not recognize this need and therefore would not activate energy inputs. Corrective properties may sometimes be built into the controller (for example, to modify the time the lights are turned on as the days grow shorter or longer), but this would not close the loop. In another instance, the sensing, comparison, or adjustment may be made through action taken by an individual who is not part of the system. For example, the lights may be turned on by someone who happens to pass by and recognizes the need for additional light.

If control is exercised as a result of the operation rather than because of outside or predetermined arrangements, it is a closed-loop system. The home thermostat is the classic example of a control device in a closed-loop system. When the room temperature drops below the desired point, the control mechanism closes the circuit to start the furnace and the temperature rises. The furnace-activating circuit is turned off as the temperature reaches the preselected level. The significant difference between this type of system and an open-loop system is that the control device is an element of the system it serves and measures the performance of the system. In other words, all four control elements are integral to the specific system.

An essential part of a closed-loop system is feedback; that is, the output of the system is measured continually through the item controlled, and the input is modified to reduce any difference or error toward zero. Many of the patterns of information flow in organizations are found to have the nature of closed loops, which use feedback. The reason for such a condition is apparent when one recognizes that any system, if it is to achieve a predetermined goal, must have available to it at all times an indication of its degree of attainment. In general, every goal-seeking system employs feedback.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

===Human and machine control===
The elements of control are easy to identify in machine systems. For example, the characteristic to be controlled might be some variable like speed or temperature, and the sensing device could be a speedometer or a thermometer. An expectation of precision exists because the characteristic is quantifiable and the standard and the normal variation to be expected can be described in exact terms. In automatic machine systems, inputs of information are used in a process of continual adjustment to achieve output specifications. When even a small variation from the standard occurs, the correction process begins. The automatic system is highly structured, designed to accept certain kinds of input and produce specific output, and programmed to regulate the transformation of inputs within a narrow range of variation.&lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert N Anthony|title=The management control function|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|year=1970|pages=14–17|isbn=978-0-87584-184-7 |oclc=18052725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an illustration of mechanical control: as the load on a steam engine increases and the engine starts to slow down, the regulator reacts by opening a valve that releases additional inputs of steam energy. This new input returns the engine to the desired number of revolutions per minute. This type of mechanical control is crude in comparison to the more sophisticated electronic control systems in everyday use. Consider the complex missile-guidance systems that measure the actual course according to predetermined mathematical calculations and make almost instantaneous corrections to direct the missile to its target.

Machine systems can be complex because of the sophisticated technology, whereas control of people is complex because the elements of control are difficult to determine. In human control systems, the relationship between objectives and associated characteristics is often vague; the measurement of the characteristic may be extremely subjective; the expected standard is difficult to define; and the amount of new inputs required is impossible to quantify. To illustrate, let us refer once more to a formalized social system in which deviant behavior is controlled through a process of observed violation of the existing law (sensing), court hearings and trials (comparison with standard), incarceration when the accused is found guilty (correction), and release from custody after rehabilitation of the individual has occurred.&lt;ref name="Anthony"/&gt;

The speed limit established for freeway driving is one standard of performance that is quantifiable, but even in this instance, the degree of permissible variation and the amount of the actual variation are often a subject of disagreement between the patrolman and the suspected violator. The complexity of our society is
reflected in many of our laws and regulations, which establish the general standards for economic, political, and social operations. A citizen may not know or understand the law and consequently would not know whether or not he was guilty of a violation.

Most organized systems are some combination of man and machine; some elements of control may be performed by machine whereas others are accomplished by man. In addition, some standards may be precisely structured whereas others may be little more than general guidelines with wide variations expected in output. Man must act as the controller when measurement is subjective and judgment is required. Machines such as computers are incapable of making exceptions from the specified control criteria regardless of how much a particular case might warrant special consideration. A pilot acts in conjunction with computers and automatic pilots to fly large jets. In the event of unexpected weather changes, or possible collision with another plane, he must intercede and assume direct control.&lt;ref name="Eilon"/&gt;

===Organizational and operational control===
The concept of organizational control is implicit in the bureaucratic theory of [[Max Weber]]. Associated with this theory are such concepts as "[[span of control]]", "closeness of supervision", and "hierarchical authority". Weber's view tends to include all levels or types of organizational control as being the same. More recently, writers have tended to differentiate the control process between that which emphasizes the nature of the organizational or systems design and that which deals with daily operations. To illustrate the difference, we "evaluate" the performance of a system to see how effective and efficient the design proved to be or to discover why it failed. In contrast, we operate and "control" the system with respect to the daily inputs of material, [[information]], and [[energy]]. In both instances, the elements of feedback are present, but organizational control tends to review and evaluate the nature and arrangement of components in the system, whereas operational control tends to adjust the daily inputs.

The direction for organizational control comes from the goals and strategic plans of the organization. General plans are translated into specific performance measures such as share of the [[Market (economics)|market]], [[earnings]], [[return on investment]], and [[budget]]s. The process of organizational control is to review and evaluate the performance of the system against these established norms. Rewards for meeting or exceeding standards may range from special recognition to [[salary]] increases or [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]s. On the other hand, a failure to meet expectations may signal the need to reorganize or redesign.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=241–244|isbn=978-0-87620-540-2 |oclc=2299496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''organizational control''', the approach used in the program of review and evaluation depends on the reason for the evaluation — ''that is, is it because the system is not effective (accomplishing its objectives)? Is the system failing to achieve an expected standard of efficiency? Is the evaluation being conducted because of a breakdown or failure in operations? Is it merely a periodic audit-and-review process?''

When a system has failed or is in great difficulty, special diagnostic techniques may be required to isolate the trouble areas and to identify the causes of the difficulty. It is appropriate to investigate areas that have been troublesome before or areas where some measure of performance can be quickly identified. For example, if an organization's output backlog builds rapidly, it is logical to check first to see if the problem is due to such readily obtainable measures as increased demand or to a drop in available man hours. When a more detailed analysis is necessary, a systematic procedure should be followed.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

In contrast to organizational control, '''operational control''' serves to regulate the day-to-day output relative to [[Schedule (workplace)|schedules]], [[specification]]s, and [[cost]]s. ''Is the output of product or service the proper [[Quality (business)|quality]] and is it available as scheduled? Are inventories of raw materials, goods-in-process, and finished products being purchased and produced in the desired quantities? Are the costs associated with the transformation process in line with cost estimates? Is the information needed in the transformation process available in the right form and at the right time? Is the energy resource being utilized efficiently?''

The most difficult task of management concerns monitoring the behavior of individuals, comparing performance to some standard, and providing rewards or punishment as indicated. Sometimes this control over people relates entirely to their output. For example, a [[Management|manager]] might not be concerned with the behavior of a salesman as long as sales were as high as expected. In other instances, close supervision of the [[salesman]] might be appropriate if achieving [[customer]] satisfaction were one of the sales organization's main [[goal|objective]]s.

The larger the unit, the more likely that the control characteristic will be related to some output goal. It also follows that if it is difficult or impossible to identify the actual output of individuals, it is better to measure the performance of the entire group. This means that individuals' levels of motivation and the measurement of their performance become subjective judgments made by the [[supervisor]]. Controlling output also suggests the difficulty of controlling individuals' performance and relating this to the total system's objectives.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

==Problems==
The perfect plan could be outlined if every possible variation of input could be anticipated and if the system would operate as predicted. This kind of planning is neither realistic, economical, nor feasible for most business systems. If it were feasible, planning requirements would be so complex that the system would be out of date before it could be operated. Therefore, we design control into systems. This requires more thought in the systems design but allows more flexibility of operations and makes it possible to operate a system using unpredictable components and undetermined input. Still, the design and effective operation of control are not without problems.

The objective of the system is to perform some specified function. 
The objective of organizational control is to see that the specified function is achieved. 
The objective of operational control is to ensure that variations in daily output are maintained within prescribed limits.

It is one thing to design a system that contains all of the elements of control, and quite another to make it operate true to the best objectives of design. Operating "in control" or "with plan" does not guarantee optimum performance. For example, the plan may not make the best use of the inputs of materials, energy, or information — in other words, the system may not be designed to operate efficiently. Some of the more typical problems relating to control include the difficulty of measurement, the problem of timing information flow, and the setting of proper standards.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

When objectives are not limited to quantitative output, the measurement of system effectiveness is difficult to make and subsequently perplexing to evaluate. Many of the characteristics pertaining to output do not lend themselves to quantitative measurement. This is true particularly when inputs of human energy cannot be related directly to output. The same situation applies to machines and other equipment associated with human involvement, when output is not in specific units. In evaluating man-machine or human-oriented systems, psychological and sociological factors obviously do not easily translate into quantifiable terms. ''For example, how does mental fatigue affect the quality or quantity of output? And, if it does, is mental fatigue a function of the lack of a challenging assignment or the fear of a potential injury? ''

Subjective inputs may be transferred into numerical data, but there is always the danger of an incorrect appraisal and transfer, and the danger that the analyst may assume undue confidence in such data after they have been quantified. Let us suppose, for example, that the decisions made by an executive are rated from 1 to 10, 10 being the perfect decision. After determining the ranking for each decision, adding these, and dividing by the total number of decisions made, the average ranking would indicate a particular executive's score in his decision-making role. On the basis of this score, judgments — which could be quite erroneous — might be made about his decision-making effectiveness. One executive with a ranking of 6.75 might be considered more effective than another who had a ranking of 6.25, and yet the two managers may have made decisions under different circumstances and conditions. External factors over which neither executive had any control may have influenced the difference in "effectiveness".&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

Quantifying human behavior, despite its extreme difficulty, subjectivity, and imprecision in relation to measuring physical characteristics is the most prevalent and important measurement made in large systems. The behavior of individuals ultimately dictates the success or failure of every man-made system.

===Information flow===
[[File:Oscillation and Feedback.JPG|thumb|right|400 px|Oscillation and Feedback]] 
Another problem of control relates to the improper timing of information introduced into the feedback channel. Improper timing can occur in both computerized and human control systems, either by mistakes in measurement or in judgment. The more rapid the system's response to an error signal, the more likely it is that the system could overadjust; yet the need for prompt action is important because any delay in providing corrective input could also be crucial. A system generating feedback inconsistent with current need will tend to fluctuate and will not adjust in the desired manner.

The most serious [[problem]] in information flow arises when the delay in [[feedback]] is exactly one-half cycle, for then the corrective action is superimposed on a variation from norm which, at that moment, is in the same direction as that of the correction. This causes the system to overcorrect, and then if the reverse adjustment is made out of cycle, to correct too much in the other direction, and so on until the system fluctuates ("oscillates") out of control. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 1. “Oscillation and Feedback”. If, at Point A, the trend below standard is recognized and new inputs are added, but not until Point B, the system will overreact and go beyond the allowable limits. Again, if this is recognized at Point C, but inputs are not withdrawn until Point D, it will cause the system to drop below the lower limit of allowable variation.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

One solution to this problem rests in anticipation, which involves measuring not only the change but also the rate of change. The correction is outlined as a factor of the type and rate of the error. The difficulty also might be overcome by reducing the time lag between the measurement of the output and the adjustment to input. If a trend can be indicated, a time lead can be introduced to compensate for the time lag, bringing about consistency between the need for correction and the type and magnitude of the indicated action. It is usually more effective for an organization to maintain continuous measurement of its performance and to make small adjustments in operations constantly (this assumes a highly sensitive control system). Information feedback, consequently, should be timely and correct to be effective. That is, the information should provide an accurate indication of the status of the system.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

==Setting standards==
Setting the proper standards or control limits is a problem in many systems. Parents are confronted with this dilemma in expressing what they expect of their children, and business managers face the same issue in establishing standards that will be acceptable to employees. Some theorists have proposed that workers be allowed to set their own standards, on the assumption that when people establish their own goals, they are more apt to accept and achieve them.

Standards should be as precise as possible and communicated to all persons concerned. Moreover, communication alone is not sufficient; understanding is necessary. In human systems, standards tend to be poorly defined and the allowable range of deviation from standard also indefinite. For example, how many hours each day should a professor be expected to be available for student consultation? Or, what kind of behavior should be expected by students in the classroom? Discretion and personal judgment play a large part in such systems, to determine whether corrective action should be taken.

Perhaps the most difficult problem in human systems is the unresponsiveness of individuals to indicated correction. This may take the form of opposition and subversion to control, or it may be related to the lack of defined [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] or [[authority]] to take action. [[Leadership]] and positive motivation then become vital ingredients in achieving the proper response to input requirements.

Most control problems relate to design; thus the solution to these problems must start at that point. Automatic control systems, provided that human intervention is possible to handle exceptions, offer the greatest promise. There is a danger, however, that we may measure characteristics that do not represent effective performance (as in the case of the speaker who requested that all of the people who could not hear what he was saying should raise their hands), or that improper [[information]] may be communicated.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

A '''cuckoo clock''' is a typically [[pendulum clock|pendulum-regulated]] [[clock]] that [[striking clock|strikes the hours]] with a sound like a [[common cuckoo|common cuckoo's]] call and has an automated cuckoo bird that moves with each note. Some move their wings and open/close their beaks while leaning forward, whereas in others, only the bird's body leans forward. The mechanism to produce the cuckoo call has been in use since the middle of the 18th century and has remained almost without variation until the present.

It is unknown who invented it and where the first one was made. It is thought that much of its development and evolution was made in the [[Black Forest]] area in southwestern Germany (State of [[Baden-Württemberg]]), the region where the cuckoo clock was popularized. The cuckoo clocks were exported to the rest of the world from the mid 1850s on. Today, the cuckoo clock is one of the favourite souvenirs of travelers in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Austria]]. It has become a [[cultural icon]] of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Neville-Hadley |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/03/21/germanys-black-forest-clock-route-full-of-surprises |title=Germany's Black Forest clock route full of surprises |publisher=torontosun.com |date=2016-04-03 |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ross Sveback |url=http://www.fox9.com/good-day/ross-sveback/11720211-story |title=Cuckoo for cuckoo clocks |publisher=fox9.com |date=2015-08-25 |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
The design of a cuckoo clock is now conventional. Most are made in the "traditional style" (also known as "carved") or "[[chalet]]" to hang on a wall. In the "traditional style" the wooden case is decorated with carved leaves and animals. They have an [[automaton]] of the bird that appears through a small trap door while the clock is striking. The bird is often made to move as the clock strikes, typically by means of an arm that lifts the back of the carving.

There are two kinds of movements: one-day (30-hour) and eight-day clockworks. Some have musical devices, and play a tune on a Swiss [[music box]] after striking the hours and half-hours. Usually the melody sounds only at full hours in eight-day clocks and both at full and half hours in the one-day timepieces. Musical cuckoo clocks frequently have other automata which move when the music box plays. Today's cuckoo clocks are almost always weight driven, though a very few are spring driven. The weights are made of cast iron in a [[pine cone]] shape and the "cuc-koo" sound is created by two tiny [[gedackt]] pipes in the clock, with bellows attached to their tops. The clock's movement activates the bellows to send a puff of air into each pipe alternately when the timekeeper strikes.

In recent years, [[quartz clock|quartz]] battery-powered cuckoo clocks have become available. As with their mechanical counterparts, the cuckoo bird emerges from its enclosure and moves up and down, but on the quartz timepieces it also flaps its wings and open its beak while it sings. During the call the double doors open and the cuckoo emerges as usual, but only on the full hour, and they do not have a gong wire chime. The movement of the cuckoo in such clocks is regulated by an electromagnet that pulses on and off, attracting a weight, that acts as a [[Lever|fulcrum]], connected to the tail of the plastic cuckoo bird, thus moving the bird up and down in his enclosure. Instead of the call being reproduced by the traditional [[bellows]], it is a digital recording of a cuckoo calling in the wild (with a corresponding [[echo]]). The cuckoo call is usually accompanied by the sound of a [[waterfall]] and other birds in the background.

In musical quartz clocks, the hourly chime is followed by the replay of one of twelve popular melodies (one for each hour). Some musical quartz clocks also reproduce many of the popular automata found on mechanical musical clocks, such as [[beer]] drinkers, [[wood-choppers]], and jumping [[deer]].

Uniquely, quartz cuckoo clocks often include a sensor, so that when the lights are turned off at night they automatically silence the hourly chime. Other quartz cuckoo clocks are pre-programmed not to strike between a set of pre-determined hours. Whether this is controlled by a light sensor or pre-programmed, the function is referred to as a 'night silence' feature. On quartz clocks the weights are conventionally cast in the shape of Aleppo [[pine]] [[Conifer cone|cones]] made of plastic rather than iron, as are as the cuckoo bird and clock hands. The [[pendulum]] bob is often another carved leaf. Here, the weights and pendulum are purely ornamental as the clock is driven by battery power. As with mechanical cuckoo clocks, the dial is usually small, and typically marked with [[Roman numerals]].

==History==

===First modern cuckoo clocks===
[[File:dukirch.gif|thumb|right|150px|Mechanical cuckoo, 1650.]]

In 1629, many decades before clockmaking was established in the [[Black Forest]],&lt;ref&gt;For the early history of Black Forest clockmaking, see Gerd Bender, "Die Uhrenmacher des hohen Schwarzwaldes und ihre Werke". Vol. 1 (Villingen, 1975): pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Augsburg]] nobleman by the name of [[Philipp Hainhofer]] (1578–1647) penned the first known description of a modern cuckoo clock.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story''. NAWCC Bulletin, December 2006: p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt;  The clock belonged to Prince Elector [[August, Elector of Saxony|August von Sachsen]].

Likewise, in a widely known handbook on music, ''Musurgia Universalis'' (1650), the scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] describes a mechanical organ with several automated figures, including a mechanical cuckoo. This book contains the first documented description—in words and pictures—of how a mechanical cuckoo works.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasius Kircher, ''Musurgia Universalis sive Ars magna consoni &amp; dissoni'', 2 Vol (Rome, 1650), here Vol. 2, p. 343f and Plate XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that Kircher did not invent the cuckoo mechanism, because this book, like his other works, is a compilation of known facts into a handbook for reference purposes. The engraving clearly shows all the elements of a mechanical cuckoo. The bird automatically opens its beak and moves both its wings and tail. Simultaneously, there is heard the [[whistle]]—call of the cuckoo, created by two organ pipes, tuned to a minor or major third. There is only one fundamental difference from the Black Forest-type cuckoo mechanism: The functions of Kircher's bird are not governed by a count wheel in a strike train, but a pinned program barrel synchronizes the movements and sounds of the bird.

On the other hand, in 1669 [[Domenico Martinelli]], in his handbook on elementary clocks ''Horologi Elementari'', suggests using the call of the cuckoo to indicate the hours.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Martinelli, ''Horologi Elementari'' (Venezia, 1669): p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at that time the mechanism of the cuckoo clock was known. Any mechanic or clockmaker, who could read Latin or Italian, knew after reading the books that it was feasible to have the cuckoo announce the hours.

Subsequently, cuckoo clocks appeared in regions that had not been known for their clockmaking. For instance, the ''Historische Nachrichten'' (1713), an anonymous publication generally attributed to Court Preacher Bartholomäus Holzfuss, mentions a musical clock in the [[Oranienburg]] palace in [[Berlin]]. This clock, originating in [[West Prussia]], played eight church hymns and had a cuckoo that announced the quarter hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preussischer Kulturbesitz''. Document No.:"I.HA, Rep. 36, Nr. 3048, fol. 21f": "In another room, where the Dutch porcelain is kept, is a singing clock, which was made by a farmer in [[Kashubia|Kaschuben]], which plays eight hymns; but the quarter hours are called out by a cuckoo". See also Claudia Sommer, ''[[Schloss Oranienburg]]. Ein Inventar aus dem Jahre 1743'', p. 151, where there is also a reference to a currently missing inventory of 1709. The inventory of 1702 does not yet list this clock; therefore, it is probable that it reached Oranienburg between 1702 and 1709, ''Verwaltung der Märkischen Schlösser'').&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately this clock, like the one mentioned by Hainhofer in 1629, can no longer be traced today.&lt;ref&gt;It remains doubtful which is the oldest cuckoo clock before the bird made its appearance in the Black Forest. Again and again old iron or wooden clock movements are discovered, which have automated cuckoos that possibly predate the first wooden movement cuckoo clocks from the Black Forest. (See also Wilhelm Schneider, "Die eiserne Kuckucksuhr" (The Iron Movement Cuckoo Clock), ''Alte Uhren und Moderne Zeitmessung'', No. 5 (1989): pp. 37–44).&lt;/ref&gt;

A few decades later, people in the Black Forest started to build cuckoo clocks.

===First cuckoo clocks made in the Black Forest===
[[File:Du320.png|thumb|right|150px|Early cuckoo clock, Black Forest, 1760–1780 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 03-2002)]]

It is not clear who built the first cuckoo clocks in the [[Black Forest]]&lt;ref&gt;Also refer to the discussion on the origin of the Black Forest cuckoo clock to: Richard Mühe, Helmut Kahlert and Beatrice Techen, ''Kuckucksuhren'' (München, 1988): pp. 7–14.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is unanimity that the unusual clock with the bird call very quickly conquered the region. Already by the middle of the 18th century, several small clockmaking shops produced cuckoo clocks with wooden gears. So the first Black Forest examples were created between 1740 and 1750. The earliest Black Forest examples had shields decorated with paper.&lt;ref&gt;* Miller, Justin , Rare and Unusual Black Forest Clocks, (Schiffer 2012), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hard to judge how large the proportion of cuckoo clocks was among the total production of modern movement Black Forest clocks. Based on the proportions of pieces surviving to the present, it must have been a small fraction of the total production.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Kahlert, ''Die Kuckucksuhren-Saga, Alte Uhren'', No. 4 (1983): pp. 347–353; here p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding its murky origins, there are two main fables from the first two chroniclers of Black Forest horology which tell contradicting stories about it:

The first is from Father Franz Steyrer, written in his "Geschichte der Schwarzwälder Uhrmacherkunst" (History of the Art of Clockmaking in the Black Forest) in 1796. He describes a meeting between two clock peddlers from Furtwangen (a town in the Black Forest) who met a travelling Bohemian merchant who sold wooden cuckoo clocks. Both the Furtwangen traders were so excited that they bought one. On bringing it home they copied it and showed their imitation to other Black Forest clock traders. Its popularity grew in the region and more and more clockmakers started producing them. With regard to this chronicle, the historian Adolf Kistner claimed in his book "Die Schwarzwälder Uhr" (The Black Forest Clock) published in 1927, that there is not any Bohemian cuckoo clock in existence to verify the thesis that this clock was used as a sample to copy and produce Black Forest cuckoo clocks. Bohemia had no fundamental clockmaking industry during that period.

[[File:Wildi-Kuckuck.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Exemplary by Johannes Wildi, [[Eisenbach]], ca. 1780. (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2008-024)]]

The second story is related by another priest, Markus Fidelis Jäck, in a passage extracted from his report "Darstellungen aus der Industrie und des Verkehrs aus dem Schwarzwald" (Descriptions of the Industry and the Traffic of the Black Forest), (1810) said as follows: "The cuckoo clock was invented (in 1730) by a clock-master [Franz Anton Ketterer] from Schönwald [literally "Beautiful Forest", i.e. the Black Forest]. This craftsman adorned a clock with a moving bird that announced the hour with the cuckoo-call. The clock-master got the idea of how to make the cuckoo-call from the bellows of a church organ". As time went on, the second version became the more popular, and is the one generally related today. Unfortunately, neither Steyrer nor Jäck quote any sources for their claims, making them unverifiable.

On the other side, R. Dorer pointed out, in 1948, that Franz Anton Ketterer (1734–1806) could not have been the inventor of the cuckoo clock in 1730 because he had not yet been born.

This statement was corroborated by Gerd Bender in the most recent edition of the first volume of his work ''Die Uhrenmacher des hohen Schwarzwaldes und ihre Werke'' (''The Clockmakers of the High Black Forest and their Works'') (1998) in which he wrote that the cuckoo clock was not native to the Black Forest and also stated that: "There are no traces of the first production line of cuckoo clocks made by Ketterer".

However, Schaaf in ''Schwarzwalduhren'' (''Black Forest Clocks'') (1995), provides his own research which leads to the earliest cuckoos having been built in the ''Franken-Niederbayern'' area ("Franconia and Lower Bavaria", in the southeast of Germany, forming nowadays the northern two-thirds of the Free State of Bavaria), in the direction of [[Bohemia]] (nowadays the main region of the Czech Republic), which he notes, lends credence to the Steyrer version.

The legend that the cuckoo clock was invented by a clever Black Forest mechanic in 1730 (Franz Anton Ketterer) keeps being told over and over again. But all of this is not true.&lt;ref name="Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story'' p. 651"&gt;Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock: A Success Story''. In: NAWCC Bulletin, December 2006: p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of clock is much older than clockmaking in the Black Forest. As early as 1650 the bird with the distinctive call was part of the reference book knowledge recorded in handbooks. It took nearly a century for the cuckoo clock to find its way to the Black Forest, where for many decades it remained a tiny niche product.

Although the idea of placing an automaton cuckoo bird in a clock to announce the passing of time did not originate in the [[Black Forest]], it is necessary to emphasize that the cuckoo clock as we know it today, comes from this region located in southwest [[Germany]] whose tradition of clockmaking started in the late 17th century. The Black Forest people who created the cuckoo clock industry developed it, and still come up with new designs and technical improvements which have made the cuckoo clock a valued work of art all over the world. The cuckoo clock history is linked to the Black Forest.

Even though the functionality of the cuckoo mechanism has remained basically unchanged, the appearance has changed as case designs and clock movements evolved in the region. The now traditional Black Forest clock design, the "Schilduhr" (Shield-clock), was characterized by having a painted flat square wooden face behind which all the clockwork was attached. On top of the square was usually a semicircle of highly decorated painted wood which contained the door for the cuckoo. These usually depicted floral patterns (so-called "Rosenuhren", rose clocks) and often had a painted column, on either side of the chapter ring, others were decorated with illustrations of fruit as well. Some pieces also bore the names of the bride and bridegroom on the dial, which were normally painted by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antique-horology.org/_Editorial/BlackForestClocks/default.htm |title=Pier Van Leeuwen,'&amp;#39; Clocks from the Black Forest (1740–1900)'&amp;#39; (2005): in the Museum of the Dutch Clock website |publisher=Antique-horology.org |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no cabinet surrounding the clockwork in this model. This design was the most prevalent between the end of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. These timekeepers were typically sold from door to door by "Uhrenträger" (Clock-peddlers, literally "clock carriers") who would carry the dials and movements on their backs displayed on huge backpacks.

Towards the middle of the nineteenth century till the 1870s, cuckoo clocks were also manufactured in the Black Forest type of clock known as "Rahmenuhr" (Framed-clock). As the name suggests, these scarce wall cuckoo clocks consisted of a picture frame, usually with a typical Black Forest scene painted on a wooden background or a sheet metal, [[lithography]] and [[screen-printing]] were other techniques used. Other common themes depicted were; hunting, love, family, death, birth, mythology, military and Christian religious scenes. Works by painters such as Johann Baptist Laule (1817–1895) and Carl Heine (1842–1882) were used to decorate the fronts of this and other types of clocks. The painting was almost always protected by a glass and some models displayed a person or an animal with blinking or flirty eyes as well, being operated by a simple mechanism worked by means of the pendulum swinging. The cuckoo normally took part in the scene painted, and would pop out in 3D, as usual, to announce the hour.

From the 1860s until the early 20th, cases were manufactured in a rich variety of styles such as; Biedermeier (some models also included a painting of a person or animal with moving eyes), Neoclassical or Georgian (certain pieces also displayed a painting), Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Art Nouveau, etc., becoming a suitable complementary piece for the bourgeois living room. These timepieces, based both on architectural and home decorative styles, are rarer than the popular ones looking like gatekeeper-houses (Bahnhäusle style clocks) and they could be mantel, wall or bracket clocks.

But the popular house-shaped Bahnhäusleuhr (Railroad house clock) virtually forced the discontinuation of other designs within a few decades.

===Bahnhäusle style, a successful design from Furtwangen===
[[File:Eisenl2.png|thumb|right|150px|Left: Railway-house clock by Friedrich Eisenlohr, 1850–1851; right: Kreuzer, Glatz &amp; Co., Furtwangen, 1853–1854, without cuckoo bird (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2003-081)]]

In September 1850, the first director of the Grand Duchy of Baden Clockmakers School in [[Furtwangen]], [[Robert Gerwig]], launched a public competition to submit designs for modern clockcases, which would allow homemade products to attain a professional appearance.

Friedrich Eisenlohr (1805–1854), who as an architect had been responsible for creating the buildings along the then new and first Badenese Rhine valley railway, submitted the most far-reaching design.&lt;ref&gt;The credit for first discovering Eisenlohr's original design goes to Herbert Jüttemann. See Herbert Jüttemann, ''Die Schwarzwalduhr'', 4th ed. (Karlsruhe, 2000): p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eisenlohr enhanced the facade of a standard railroad-guard's residence, as he had built many of them, with a clock dial. His ''"Wallclock with shield decorated by ivy vines,"'' (in reality the ornament were grapevines and not ivy) as it is referred to in a surviving, handwritten report from the Clockmakers School from 1851 or 1852, became the prototype of today's popular souvenir cuckoo clocks.

Eisenlohr was also up-to-date stylistically. He was inspired by local images; rather than copying them slavishly, he modified them. Contrary to most present-day cuckoo clocks, his case features light, unstained wood and were decorated with symmetrical, flat fretwork ornaments.

Eisenlohr's idea became an instant hit, because the modern design of the Bahnhäusle clock appealed to the decorating tastes of the growing bourgeoisie and thereby tapped into new and growing markets.

While the Clockmakers School was satisfied to have Eisenlohr's clock case sketches, they were not fully realized in their original form. Eisenlohr had proposed a wooden facade; Gerwig preferred a painted metal front combined with an enamel dial. But despite intensive campaigns by the Clockmakers School, sheet metal fronts decorated with oil paintings (or coloured lithographs) never became a major market segment because of the high cost and labour-intensive process,&lt;ref name="Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story'' p. 649."&gt;Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story''. In: NAWCC Bulletin, December 2006: p. 649.&lt;/ref&gt; hence only a few were produced (from the 1850s until around 1870), whether wall or mantel versions, and are nowadays sought-after collector pieces.

Characteristically, the makers of the first Bahnhäusle clocks deviated from Eisenlohr's sketch in only one way: they left out the cuckoo mechanism. Unlike today, the design with the little house was not synonymous with a cuckoo clock in the first years after 1850. This is another indication that at that time cuckoo clocks could not have been an important market segment.&lt;ref name="Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story'' p. 649."/&gt;

Only in December 1854, [[Johann Baptist Beha]], the best known maker of cuckoo clocks of his time, sold two of them, with oil paintings on their fronts, to the Furtwangen clock dealer Gordian Hettich, which were described as ''Bahnhöfle Uhren'' ("Railroad station clocks").&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Schneider "Frühe Kuckucksuhren von Johann Baptist Beha aus Eisenbach im Hochschwarzwald" (Remembering the design of a genius. 150 years of Bahnhaeusle clocks), ''Alte Uhren und moderne Zeitmessung'', No. 3 (1987): pp. 45–53, here p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; More than a year later, on January 20, 1856, another respected Furtwangen-based cuckoo clockmaker, [[Theodor Ketterer]], sold one to Joseph Ruff in [[Glasgow]] ([[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]]).

Concurrently with Beha and Ketterer, other [[Black Forest]] clockmakers must have started to equip Bahnhäusle clocks with cuckoo mechanisms to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for this type of clock. Starting in the mid-1850s there was a real boom in this market.

By 1860, the Bahnhäusle style had started to develop away from its original, "severe" graphic form, and evolve, among other designs, toward the well-known case with three-dimensional woodcarvings, like the ''Jagdstück'' ("Hunt piece", design created in Furtwangen in 1861), a cuckoo clock with carved oak foliage and hunting motives, such as trophy animals, guns and powder pouches.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider 1987, p. 51. ''(Within a short time more orders for hunt pieces are recorded, specifically on October 30, November 7 and November 26, 1861.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1862 the reputed clockmaker Johann Baptist Beha, started to enhance his richly decorated Bahnhäusle clocks with hands carved from bone and weights cast in the shape of fir cones.&lt;ref&gt;As per Wilhelm Schneider, who had a chance to examine the account books of Beha. See Wilhelm Schneider, "Frühe Kuckucksuhren von Johann Baptist aus Eisenbach im Hochschwarzwald" (Early cuckoo clocks by Johann Baptist Beha of Eisenbach in the high Black Forest). ''Alte Uhren und moderne Zeitmessung''. No 3 (1987): pp. 45–53, here p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Even today this combination of elements is characteristic for cuckoo clocks, although the hands are usually made of wood or plastic, white celluloid was employed in the past too. As for the weights, there was during this second half of the 19th century, a few models which featured weights cast in the shape of a [[Gnome]] and other curious forms.

Only ten years after its invention by Friedrich Eisenlohr, all variations of the house-theme had reached maturity. There were also Bahnhäusle timepieces and its derived manufactured as mantel clocks but not as many as the wall versions.

The basic cuckoo clock of today is the railway-house (Bahnhäusle) form, still with its rich ornamentation, and these are known under the name of "traditional" (or carved); which display carved leaves, birds, deer heads (Jagdstück design), other animals, etc. The richly decorated Bahnhäusle clocks have become a symbol of the Black Forest that is instantly understood anywhere in the world.

The cuckoo clock became successful and world-famous after Friedrich Eisenlohr contributed the Bahnhäusle design to the 1850 competition at the Furtwangen Clockmakers School.&lt;ref name="Johannes Graf, ''The Black Forest Cuckoo Clock. A Success Story'' p. 651"/&gt;

==="Chalet" style, the Swiss contribution===
[[File:Swiss cuckoo clock, ca. 1900.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Swiss mantel cuckoo clock with case in the shape of a Brienz chalet. It is fitted with a music box with 8 melodies, ca. 1900.]]
The "Chalet" style originated at the end of the 19th century in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=– 11:11 |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Going_cuckoo_about_real_Swiss_cuckoo_clocks.html?cid=681210 |title=Robert Brookes, '&amp;#39;Going cuckoo about real Swiss cuckoo clocks'&amp;#39; (2006): in |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time they were highly valued as souvenirs. Indeed, music and jewellery boxes of several sizes as well as timepieces were manufactured in the shape of a typical Swiss chalet, some of those clocks had also the added feature of a cuckoo bird and other automata. In the English-speaking world, cuckoo clocks are sufficiently identified with Switzerland that the film [[The Third Man]] has a oft-quoted speech (and it even had [[The Third Man#.22Swiss cuckoo clock.22 speech|antecedents]]) in which the villainous Harry Lime mockingly says that "in Switzerland they had brotherly love. They had 500 years of democracy and peace. And what did that produce? The cuckoo clock."

There are three basic styles, named after the type of traditional house depicted: Black Forest chalet, Swiss chalet (with two types the "[[Brienz]]" and the "[[Emmental]]"), and finally the Bavarian chalet. The only genuine Swiss chalet cuckoo clock maker in existence today is Loetscher AG. 

Along with the common projecting bird, it may also display other types of animated figurines, examples include woodcutters, moving beer drinkers and turning water wheels. Some "traditional" style cuckoo clocks feature a music box and dancing figurines too.

===Designer cuckoo clocks: The stylistic revolution===
[[File:Cuckoo clock by Pascal Tarabay.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Designer]] cuckoo clock by Pascal Tarabay, 2005. It is based on the traditional Jagdstück (Hunt piece).]]

The early 21st century has seen a revitalization of this ancient icon with designs, materials, technologies, shapes and colors never seen before in cuckoo clock manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Juan F. Déniz, ''Designer Cuckoo Clocks'' p. 479."&gt;[http://nawcc.org/images/stories/publications/405_479_485n.pdf Juan F. Déniz, ''Designer Cuckoo Clocks''. In: NAWCC Bulletin, September/October 2013: p. 479.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These timekeepers are distinguished by its [[Form follows function|functional]], schematic and [[minimalism|minimalist]] aesthetic.

Although simplified [[design]]s with simple, clear lines had already been produced in the 20th century, the real boom of seeing the cuckoo clock as a designer item, where the [[creativity]] and talent of [[designer]]s are freely expressed and where the only limit seems to be [[imagination]], was initiated in the 2000s (the first examples dating back to the 1990s), particularly in Italy and Germany.&lt;ref name="Juan F. Déniz, ''Designer Cuckoo Clocks'' p. 479."/&gt;

As for the models, there are a great variety, many of them [[avant-garde]] and adventurous creations made of different materials and [[List of geometric shapes|geometric shapes]], such as rhombuses, squares, cubes, circles, rectangles, ovals, etc. Without carving, these clocks are usually flat and smooth. Some are painted in a single colour while others are polychromes with abstract or figurative paintings, multicolour lines and stripes, others include text and phrases, etc. About the clockwork, there are quartz, mechanical and sometimes, digital.

==Museums==
In Europe, museums that display collections are the [[Cuckooland Museum]] in the UK, and the [[Deutsches Uhrenmuseum]] and [[Dorf- und Uhrenmuseum Gütenbach]] in Germany. One of the biggest [[private collection]]s in the United States that are open to the public located in [[Minneapolis]]. It contains more than 300 cuckoo clocks.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Marsh.

In [[economics]], the '''Debreu theorems''' are several statements about the representation of  a [[preference (economics)|preference ordering]] by a real-valued function. The theorems were proved by [[Gerard Debreu]] during the 1950s.

== Background ==
Suppose we interrogate a person and ask him questions of the form "Do you prefer A or B?" (when A,B can be options, actions to take, states of the world, consumption bundles, etc.). We write down all the answers. Then, we want to represent the preferences of that person by a numeric ''utility function'', such that the utility of option A is larger than option B if and only if the agent prefers A to B.

The Debreu theorems come to answer the following basic question: what conditions on the preference relation of the agent guarantee that we can find such representative utility function?

== Existence of [[ordinal utility]] function ==
'''The 1954 Theorems'''&lt;ref name="Debreu54"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://korora.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p00b/p0097.pdf | title=Representation of a preference ordering by a numerical function | author=Debreu, Gerard | year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; say, roughly, that every preference relation which is complete, transitive and continuous, can be represented by a [[Ordinal utility#Continuity|continuous ordinal utility function]].

=== Statement ===
The theorems are usually applied to spaces of finite commodities. However, they are applicable in a much more general setting. These are the general assumptions:
* X is a [[topological space]].
* &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is a relation on X which is [[total relation|total]] (all items are comparable) and [[transitive relation|transitive]].
* &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is ''continuous''. This means that the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:
*# For every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, the sets &lt;math&gt;\{y|y\preceq x\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{y|y\succeq x\}&lt;/math&gt; are [[topologically closed]] in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
*# For every sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i \to x_\infty&lt;/math&gt;, if for all ''i'' &lt;math&gt;x_i\preceq y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x_\infty\preceq y&lt;/math&gt;, and if for all ''i'' &lt;math&gt;x_i\succeq y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x_\infty\succeq y&lt;/math&gt;

Each one of the following conditions guarantees the existence of a real-valued continuous function that represents the preference relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;:

1. The set of [[equivalence class]]es of the relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; (defined by: &lt;math&gt;x\sim y&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;x\preceq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\succeq y&lt;/math&gt;) are a [[countable set]].

2. There is a countable subset of X, &lt;math&gt;Z=\{z_0,z_1,...\}&lt;/math&gt;, such that for every pair of non-equivalent elements &lt;math&gt;x\prec y&lt;/math&gt;, there is an element &lt;math&gt;z_i\in Z&lt;/math&gt; that separates them (&lt;math&gt;x\preceq z_i \preceq y&lt;/math&gt;).

3. X is [[Separable space|separable]] and [[Connected space|connected]].

4. X is [[second countable]]. This means that there is a [[countable set]] S of open sets, such that every open set in X is the union of sets of the class S.

The proof for the fourth result had a gap which Debreu later corrected&lt;ref name="Debreu64"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Continuity properties of Paretian utility | journal=International Economic Review | volume=5 | number=3 | pages=285-293 | author=Debreu, Gerard | year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Examples ===
A. Let &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with the [[standard topology]] (the Euclidean topology). Define the following preference relation: &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\preceq (x',y')&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;x+y \leq x'+y'&lt;/math&gt;. It is continuous because for every &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, the sets &lt;math&gt;\{(x',y')|x'+y'\leq x+y\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{(x',y')|x'+y'\geq x+y\}&lt;/math&gt; are closed half-planes. Condition 1 is violated because the set of equivalence classes is uncountable. However, condition 2 is satisfied with Z as the set of pairs with rational coordinates. Condition 3 is also satisifed since X is separable and connected. Hence, there exists a continuous function which represents &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;. An example of such function is &lt;math&gt;u(x,y)=x+y&lt;/math&gt;.

B. Let &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with the standard topology as above. The [[lexicographic preferences]] relation is not continuous in that topology. For example, &lt;math&gt;(5,1)\succ (5,0)&lt;/math&gt;, but in every ball around (5,1) there are points with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;5&lt;/math&gt; and these points are inferior to &lt;math&gt;(5,0)&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, this relation cannot be represented by a continuous real-valued function.

=== Extension ===
Diamond&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1911893|jstor=1911893|title=The Evaluation of Infinite Utility Streams|journal=Econometrica|volume=33|pages=170|year=1965|last1=Diamond|first1=Peter A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied Debreu's theorem to the space &lt;math&gt;X=\ell^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all bounded real-valued sequences with the topology induced by the supremum metric (see [[L-infinity]]). X represents the set of all utility streams with infinite horizon.

In addition to the requirement that &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; be total, transitive and continuous, He added a ''sensitivity'' requirement:
* If a stream &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than a stream &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in every time period, then &lt;math&gt;x\prec y&lt;/math&gt;.
* If a stream &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is smaller-than-or-equal-to a stream &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in every time period, then &lt;math&gt;x\preceq y&lt;/math&gt;.

Under these requirements, every stream &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a constant-utility stream, and every two constant-utility streams are separable by a constant-utility stream with a rational utility, so condition #2 of Debreu is satisfied, and the preference relation can be represented by a real-valued function.

The existence result is valid even when the topology of X is changed to the topology induced by the discounted metric: &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\sum_{t=1}^\infty{2^{-t}|x_t-y_t|}&lt;/math&gt;

==Additivity of [[ordinal utility]] function==

'''Theorem 3 of 1960'''&lt;ref name="Debreu60"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://dido.wss.yale.edu/P/cp/p01b/p0156.pdf | title=Topological Methods in Cardinal Utility Theory | author=Debreu, Gerard}}&lt;/ref&gt; says, roughly, that if the commodity space contains 3 or more components, and every subset of the components is preferentially-independent of the other components, then the preference relation can be represented by an ''additive'' value function.

=== Statement ===
These are the general assumptions:
* X, the space of all bundles, is a cartesian product of ''n'' commodity spaces: &lt;math&gt;X = \times_{i=1}^n{X_i}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the space of bundles is a set of ''n''-tuples of commodities).
* &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is a relation on X which is [[total relation|total]] (all items are comparable) and [[transitive relation|transitive]].
* &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is continuous (see above).
* There exists an [[ordinal utility]] function, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, representing &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;.

The function &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is called ''additive'' if it can be written as a sum of ''n'' ordinal utility functions on the ''n'' factors:
::::&lt;math&gt;v(x_1,...,x_n)=\sum_{i=1}^n{k_i v_i(x_i)}&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; are constants.

Given a set of indices &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, the set of commodities &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''preferentially independent'' if the preference relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; induced on &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt;, given constant quantities of the other commodities &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\notin I}&lt;/math&gt;, does not depend on these constant quantities.

If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is additive, then obviously all subsets of commodities are preferentially-independent.

If all subsets of commodities are preferentially-independent AND at least three commodities are essential (meaning that their quantities have an influence on the preference relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is additive.

Moreover, in that case &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is unique up to an increasing ''linear'' transformation.

For an intuitive constructive proof, see [[Ordinal utility#additivity3|Ordinal utility - Additivity with three or more goods]].

==Theorems on [[Cardinal utility]]==
'''Theorem 1 of 1960'''&lt;ref name="Debreu60"/&gt; deals with preferences on lotteries. It can be seen as an improvement to the [[von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem]] of 1947. The earlier theorem assumes that agents have preferences on lotteries with arbitrary probabilities. Debreu's theorem weakens this assumption and assumes only that agents have preferences on equal-chance lotteries (i.e., they can only answer questions of the form: "Do you prefer A over an equal-chance lottery between B and C?").

Formally, there is a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of sure choices. The set of lotteries is &lt;math&gt;S\times S&lt;/math&gt;. Debreu's theorem states that if:
# The set of all sure choices &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Connected space|connected]] and [[separable space]];
# The preference relation on the set of lotteries &lt;math&gt;S\times S&lt;/math&gt; is continuous - the sets &lt;math&gt;\{(A,B)\in S\times S|(A,B)\preceq (A',B')\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{(A,B)\in S\times S| (A,B)\succeq (A',B')\}&lt;/math&gt; are [[topologically closed]] for all &lt;math&gt;(A,B)\in S&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;(A_1,B_2)\preceq (A_2,B_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A_2,B_3)\preceq (A_3,B_2)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;(A_1,B_3)\preceq (A_3,B_1)&lt;/math&gt;
Then there exists a cardinal utility function ''u'' that represents the preference relation on the set of lotteries, i.e.:
:::&lt;math&gt;u(A,B) = (u(A,A)+u(B,B))/2&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 2 of 1960'''&lt;ref name="Debreu60"/&gt; deals with agents whose preferences are represented by frequency-of-choice. When they can choose between ''A'' and ''B'', they choose ''A'' with frequency &lt;math&gt;p(A,B)&lt;/math&gt;  and ''B'' with frequency &lt;math&gt;p(B,A)=1-p(A,B)&lt;/math&gt;. The value &lt;math&gt;p(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as measuring ''how much'' the agent prefers ''A'' over ''B''.

Debreu's theorem states that if the agent's function ''p'' satisfies the following conditions:
# Completeness: &lt;math&gt;p(A,B)+p(B,A)=1&lt;/math&gt;
# Quadruple Condition: &lt;math&gt;p(A,B)\leq p(C,D) \iff p(A,C)\leq p(B,D)&lt;/math&gt;
# Continuity: if &lt;math&gt;p(A,B)\leq q\leq p(A,D)&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists ''C'' such that: &lt;math&gt;p(A,C)=q&lt;/math&gt;.
Then there exists a cardinal utility function ''u'' that represents ''p'', i.e:
:::&lt;math&gt;p(A,B)\leq p(C,D) \iff u(A)-u(B)\leq u(C)-u(D)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the [[philosophy of language]], the '''descriptivist theory of proper names''' (also '''descriptivist theory of reference''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/frege/ Frege, Gottlob – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; is the view that the meaning or semantic content of a [[Proper name (philosophy)|proper name]] is identical to the descriptions associated with it by speakers, while their referents are determined to be the objects that satisfy these descriptions. [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Gottlob Frege]] have both been associated with the descriptivist theory, which is sometimes called the [[Frege–Russell view]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke]], ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, this theory came under attack from [[causal theory of reference|causal theorists]] such as [[Saul Kripke]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and others. However, it has seen something of a revival in recent years, especially under the form of what are called [[two-dimensionalism|two-dimensional]] semantic theories. This latter trend is exemplified by the theories of [[David Chalmers]], among others.

==The descriptive theory and its merits==

A simple descriptivist theory of names can be thought of as follows: for every proper name ''p'', there is some collection of descriptions ''D'' associated with ''p'' that constitute the meaning of ''p''.  For example, the descriptivist may hold that the proper name ''[[Saul Kripke]]'' is synonymous with the collection of descriptions such as 
# the man who wrote ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''
# a person who was born on November 13, 1940 in [[Bay Shore]], [[New York (state)|New York]]
# the son of a leader of Beth El Synagogue in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]]
: etc ...
The descriptivist takes the meaning of the name ''Saul Kripke'' to be that collection of descriptions and takes the referent of the name to be the thing that satisfies all or most of those descriptions.

A simple descriptivist theory may further hold that the meaning of a sentence ''S'' that contains ''p'' is given by the collection of sentences produced by replacing each instance of ''p'' in ''S'' with one of the descriptions in ''D''.  So, the sentence such as "Saul Kripke stands next to a table" has the same meaning as the following collection of sentences:
# The man who wrote ''Naming and Necessity'' stands next to a table.
# A person who was born on November 13, 1940 in Bay Shore, New York stands next to a table.
# The son of a leader of Beth El Synagogue in Omaha, Nebraska stands next to a table.
: etc ...

A version of descriptivism was formulated by Frege in reaction to problems with his original theory of meaning or reference (''Bedeutung''), which entailed that sentences with empty proper names cannot have a meaning. Yet a sentence containing the name 'Odysseus' is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds. Also, the sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege said that if an identity statement such as "[[Hesperus]] is the same planet as [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.&lt;ref&gt;G. Frege, "Über Sinn und Bedeutung", ''Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik'', vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25–50, esp. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars disagree as to whether Frege intended such modes of presentation to be descriptions. See the article [[Sense and reference]].

Russell’s approach is somewhat different. First of all, Russell makes an important distinction between what he calls “ordinary” proper names and “logically” proper names. Logically proper names are indexicals such as ''this'' and ''that'', which directly refer (in a [[Millianism|Millian]] sense) to sense-data or other objects of immediate acquaintance.  For Russell, ordinary proper names are ''abbreviated definite descriptions.'' Here definite description refers again to the type of formulation “The…” which was used above to describe Santa Claus as “the benevolent, bearded….’’ According to Russell, the name “Aristotle” is just a sort of shorthand for a definite description such as “The last great philosopher of ancient Greece” or “The teacher of Alexander the great” or some conjunction of two or more such descriptions. Now, according to Russell’s [[theory of descriptions|theory of definite descriptions]], such descriptions must, in turn, be reduced, to a certain very specific logical form of existential generalization as follows:

*"The king of France is bald".
becomes
*&lt;math&gt; \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow x=y) \land B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

This says that there is exactly one object ‘’x’’ such that ‘’x’’ is King of France and ‘’x’’ is bald. Notice that this formulation is entirely general: it says that there is some x out in the world that satisfies the description, but does not specify which one thing ‘’x’’ refers to. Indeed, for Russell, definite descriptions (and hence names) have no reference at all and their meanings (senses in the Fregean sense) are just the truth conditions of the logical forms illustrated above. This is made clearer by Russell’s example involving ‘’Bismarck’’:

*(G) ”The Chancellor of Germany...”

In this case, Russell suggests that only Bismarck himself can be in a relation of acquaintance such that the man himself enters into the proposition expressed by the sentence. For any other than Bismarck, the only relation that is possible with such a proposition is through its descriptions. Bismarck could never have existed and the sentence (G) would still be meaningful because of its general nature described by the logical form underlying the sentence.

Notwithstanding these differences however, descriptivism and the descriptive theory of proper names came to be associated with both the views of Frege and Russell and both address the general problems (names without bearers, Frege’s puzzles concerning identity and substitution in contexts of intentional attitude attributions) in a similar manner.

Another problem for Millianism is Frege’s famous puzzles concerning the identity of co-referring terms. For example:

*(V) ”Hesperus is Phosphorus.”

In this case, both terms (“Hesperus” and “Phosphorus”) refer to the same entity: Venus. The Millian theory would predict that this sentence is trivial, since meaning is just reference and “Venus is Venus” is not very informative. Suppose, however, that someone did not know that Hesperus and Phosphorus both referred to Venus. Then it is at least arguable that the sentence (V) is an attempt to inform someone of just this fact.

Another problem for Millianism is that of statements such as “Fred believes that Cicero, but not Tully, was Roman.”

== Kripke’s objections and the causal theory==

In his book ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'',  [[Saul Kripke]] criticised the descriptivist theory. At the end of Lecture I (pp.&amp;nbsp;64–70) Kripke sets out what he believes to be the tenets of the descriptivist theory. Kripke formally states a number of theses as the core of the descriptivist theory, with these theses explaining the theory in terms of reference (rather than the sense or meaning). As he explains before stating the theory, "There are more theses if you take it in the stronger version as a theory of meaning" (p.&amp;nbsp;64).

As he states it, the descriptivist theory is "weaker," i.e., the claims it makes do not assert as much as a stronger theory would. This actually makes it harder to refute. The descriptivist theory of meaning would include these theses and definitions however, thus refuting these would suffice for refuting the descriptivist theory of meaning as well. Kripke formulates them as follows:

# To every name or designating expression 'X', there corresponds a cluster of properties, namely the family of those properties φ such that [speaker] A believes 'φX'
# One of the properties, or some conjointly, are believed by A to pick out some individual uniquely.
# If most, or a weighted most, of the φ's are satisfied by one unique object y, then y is the referent of 'X'. 
# If the vote yields no unique object, 'X' does not refer. 
# The statement, 'If X exists, then X has most of the φ's [corresponding to X]' is known ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' by the speaker.
# The statement, 'If X exists, then X has most of the φ's [corresponding to X]' expresses a necessary truth (in the idiolect of the speaker).&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. Naming and Necessity. Basil Blackwell. Boston. 1980. (p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt;

(1) States the properties or concepts related to any given proper name, where a name 'X' has a set of properties associated with it. The set of properties are those that a speaker, on inquiry of "Who is Barack Obama?" would respond "The President of the U.S., former Senator of Illinois, husband of Michelle Obama, etc." (1) does not stipulate that the set of properties φ is the meaning of X. (2) stipulates the epistemic position of the speaker. Note (2) says "believed by A to pick out".

(3) Takes the properties in (1) and (2) and turns them into a mechanism of reference. Basically, if a unique object satisfies the properties associated with 'X' such that A believes that 'X has such-and-such properties', it picks out or refers to that object. (4) states what happens when no object satisfies the properties (Kripke talks in terms of taking a "vote" as to the unique referent).

(5) [[Logical consequence|Follows from]] (1)-(3). If there is a set of properties that speaker A believes to be associated with X, then these properties must be already known by the speaker. In this sense they are a priori. To know what a bachelor is, an individual must know what an unmarried male is; likewise an individual must know who is 'The President of the U.S., former Senator of Illinois, husband of Michelle Obama, etc.' to know who Obama is.
(6) However is not a direct product of the theses. Kripke notes "(6) need not be a thesis of the theory if someone doesn't think that the cluster is part of the meaning of the name" (p.&amp;nbsp;65). However, when the descriptivist theory is taken as a theory of reference and meaning, (6) would be a thesis.

Taken as a theory of reference, the following would be true:
* If someone fits the description 'the author who wrote, among other things, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]''' uniquely, then this someone is the [[George Orwell]]. (Thesis 3)
* 'George Orwell wrote, among other things, ''1984'' and ''Animal Farm''' is known a priori by the speaker. (Thesis 5)

The idea in the second sentence is that one can't refer to something without knowing what he or she is referring to. 
Taken as a theory of reference and meaning, the following would be true:

* The author who wrote, among other things, ''1984'' and ''Animal Farm'', wrote ''1984'' and ''Animal Farm''. (Thesis 6)

After breaking down the descriptivist theory, he begins to point out what's wrong with it. First, he offered up what has come to be known as “the modal argument” (or argument from rigidity) against descriptivism. Consider the name ‘’Aristotle’’ and the descriptions “the greatest student of Plato’’, “the founder of logic” and “the teacher of Alexander.” Aristotle obviously satisfies all of the descriptions (and many of the others we commonly associate with him), but it is not a [[logical truth|necessary truth]] that if Aristotle existed then Aristotle was any one, or all, of these descriptions, contrary to thesis (6). Aristotle might well have existed without doing any single one of the things he is known for. He might have existed and not have become known to posterity at all or he might have died in infancy.

Suppose that Aristotle is associated by Mary with the description
“the last great philosopher of antiquity” and (the actual) Aristotle died in infancy. Then Mary’s description would seem to refer to Plato. But this is deeply counterintuitive. Hence, names are ‘’rigid designators’’, according to Kripke. That is, they refer to the same individual in every possible world in which that individual exists.

This is the counterintuitive result of thesis (6). For descriptivists Aristotle means “the greatest student of Plato’’, “the founder of logic” and “the teacher of Alexander.” So the sentence “the greatest student of Plato, etc., was the greatest student of Plato,” is equivalent to “Aristotle was the greatest student of Plato, etc.” Of course a sentence like “x=x” is necessary, but this just isn't the case with proper names and their descriptions. Aristotle could have done something else, thus he is not necessarily identical to his description.

The second argument employed by Kripke has come to be called the ‘’epistemic argument” or “the argument from unwanted necessity.” This is simply the observation that if the meaning of ‘’Angela Merkel’’ is “the Chancellor of Germany”, then “Angela is the Chancellor of Germany” should seem to the average person to be a priori, analytic, and trivial, as if falling out of the meaning of “Angela Merkel” just as “unmarried male” falls out of the meaning of “bachelor.” If thesis (5) is to hold, the properties of Angela Merkel should be known a priori by the speaker. But this is not true. We had to go out into the world to see who the Chancellor of Germany is.

Kripke’s third argument against descriptive theories consisted in pointing out that people may associate inadequate or inaccurate descriptions with proper names. Kripke uses [[Kurt Gödel]] as an example. The only thing most people know about Gödel is that he proved the incompleteness of arithmetic. Suppose he hadn't proved it, and really he stole it from his friend Schmidt. Thesis (3) says that if most of the properties associated with 'Gödel' are satisfied by one unique object, in this case Schmidt, then Schmidt is the referent of 'Gödel.' This means that every time someone (in the world where Gödel stole the incompleteness theorem from Schmidt) says 'Gödel' he or she is actually referring to Schmidt. This is far too counter-intuitive for the descriptivist theory to hold.

Such arguments seem to have convinced the majority of philosophers of language to abandon descriptive theories of proper names.

==Revival of descriptivism and two-dimensionalism==

In recent years, there has been something of a revival in descriptivist theories, including descriptivist theories of proper names. Metalinguistic description theories have been developed and adopted by such contemporary theorists as [[Kent Bach]] and [[Jerrold Katz]]. According to Katz, “metalinguistic description theories explicate the sense of proper nouns - but not common nouns - in terms of a relation between the noun and the objects that bear its name.” Differently from the traditional theory, such theories do not posit a need for sense to determine reference and the metalinguistic description mentions the name it is the sense of (hence it is "metalinguistic") while placing no conditions on being the bearer of a name. Katz's theory, to take this example, is based on the fundamental idea that sense should not have to be defined in terms of, nor determine, referential or extensional properties but that it should be defined in terms of, and determined by, all and only the intensional properties of names.

He illustrates the way a metalinguistic description theory can be successful against Kripkean counterexamples by citing, as one example, the case of ‘’Jonah’’. Kripke’s Jonah case is very powerful because in this case the only information that we have about the Biblical character Jonah is just what the Bible tells us. Unless we are fundamentalist literalists, it is not controversial that all of this is false. Since, under traditional descriptivism, these descriptions are what define the name Jonah; these descriptivists must say that Jonah did not exist. But this does not follow. But under Katz's version of descriptivism, the sense of Jonah contains no information derived from the Biblical accounts but contains only the term "Jonah" itself in the phrase "the thing that is a bearer of 'Jonah'." Hence, it is not vulnerable to these kinds of counterexamples.

The most common and challenging criticism to metalinguistic description theories was put forth by Kripke himself: they seem to be an ad hoc explanation of a single linguistic phenomenon. Why should there be a metalinguistic theory for proper nouns (like names) but not for common nouns, count nouns, verbs, predicates, indexicals and other parts of speech.

Another recent approach is ''two-dimensional semantics.'' The motivations for this approach are rather different from those that inspired other forms of descriptivism, however. Two–dimensional approaches are usually motivated by a sense of dissatisfaction with the causal theorist explanation of how it is that a single proposition can be both [[Logical truth|necessary]] and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' or [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.

{{Economic systems sidebar}}
'''Economic democracy''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] philosophy that proposes to shift decision-making power from [[Management|corporate managers]] and [[Shareholder|corporate shareholders]] to a larger group of [[stakeholder theory|public stakeholders]] that includes workers, customers, suppliers, neighbors and the broader public. No single definition or approach encompasses economic democracy, but most proponents claim that modern property relations [[externality|externalize]] costs, subordinate the general well-being to private profit and deny the polity a democratic voice in economic policy decisions.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} In addition to these moral concerns, economic democracy makes practical claims, such as that it can compensate for [[capitalism]]'s inherent [[effective demand]] gap.{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}}

Proponents of economic democracy generally argue that modern capitalism periodically results in economic crises characterized by deficiency of effective demand as society is unable to earn enough income to purchase its output production. [[Corporation|Corporate]] monopoly of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]] typically creates [[artificial scarcity]], resulting in socio-economic imbalances that restrict workers from access to economic opportunity and diminish consumer [[purchasing power]].{{sfn|George|1912}}{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} Economic democracy has been proposed as a component of larger socioeconomic ideologies, as a stand-alone theory and as a variety of reform agendas. For example, as a means to securing full [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]], it opens a path to full [[Civil Rights|political rights]], defined as including the former.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} Both market and non-market theories of economic democracy have been proposed. As a reform agenda, supporting theories and real-world examples range from [[decentralization]] and [[economic liberalism|economic liberalization]] to [[Cooperative|democratic cooperatives]], [[public banking]], [[fair trade]] and the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] of [[Local food|food production]] and [[Local currency|currency]].
{{toclimit|3}}

== Deficiency of effective demand ==
According to many analysts, deficiency of effective demand is the most fundamental economic problem. That is, modern society does not earn enough income to purchase its output. For example, [[geographer]] [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] claims, "Workers spending their wages is one source of effective demand, but the total wage bill is always less than the total capital in circulation (otherwise there would be no profit), so the purchase of wage goods that sustain daily life (even with a suburban lifestyle) is never sufficient for the profitable sale of the total output".{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}} While balanced [[Mixed economy|mixed economies]] have existed briefly throughout history, veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] and other critics claim that [[Planned economy|command economies]] are predominate, citing [[state capitalism]] and [[imperialism]] as related. As common resources are monopolized by imperial centers of wealth and power, conditions of scarcity are imposed artificially upon the majority, resulting in large-scale socio-economic imbalance.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

In the [[Georgist]] view of any [[economics|economic system]], "wealth" includes all material things produced by labor for the satisfaction of human desires and having [[exchange value]]. [[Land (economics)|Land]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and capital are generally considered the essential factors in producing wealth. Land includes all natural opportunities and forces. Labor includes all human exertion. [[Capital (economics)|Capital]] includes the portion of wealth devoted to producing more wealth. While the income of any individual might include proceeds from any combination of these three sources—land, labor and capital are generally considered mutually exclusive factors in economic models of the production and distribution of wealth. According to [[Henry George]]: "People seek to satisfy their desires with the least exertion".{{sfn|George|1912|date=January 2012}} Human beings interact with nature to produce goods and services that other human beings need or desire. The laws and [[Custom (law)|customs]] that govern the relationships among these entities constitute the economic structure of a given society.

Alternately, [[David Schweickart]] asserts in his book, ''After Capitalism'': "The structure of a capitalist society consists of three basic components:

* "The bulk of the [[means of production]] are privately owned, either directly by individuals or by corporations that are themselves owned by private individuals.
* "Products are exchanged in a market -- that is to say, goods and services are bought and sold at prices determined for the most part by competition and not by some governmental pricing authority. Individual enterprises compete with one another in providing goods and services to consumers, each enterprise trying to make a profit. This competition is the primary determinant of prices.
* "Most of the people who work for pay in this society work for other people, who own the means of production. Most working people are '[[wage labour]]ers'".{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=22–23}}

[[Supply and demand]] are generally accepted as market functions for establishing [[price]]s. Organisations typically endeavor to 1) minimize the [[Cost-of-production theory of value|cost of production]]; 2) increase sales; in order to 3) maximize profits. But, according to David Schweickart, if "those who produce the goods and services of society are paid less than their productive contribution", then as consumers they cannot buy all the goods produced, and investor confidence tends to decline, triggering declines in production and employment. Such economic instability stems from a central contradiction: Wages are both a cost of production and an essential source of [[effective demand]] (needs or desires backed with purchasing power), {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=36, 40–43, 95}} resulting in deficiency of effective demand along with a growing interest in economic democracy.

In chapter 3 of his book, "Community Organizing: Theory and Practice", [[Douglas Biklen|Douglas P. Biklen]] discusses a variety of perspectives on "The Making of Social Problems". One of those views suggests that "writers and organizers who define social problems in terms of social and economic democracy see problems not as the experiences of poor people, but as the relationship of poverty to wealth and exploitation". Biklen states that according to this viewpoint:

{{Quote|[C]orporate power, upper class power, uneven distribution of wealth and prejudice cause social problems... [T]he problem is not one of poverty, but of enormous wealth. The problem is not one of gaps or cracks in an otherwise fine system but of a system which perpetuates prejudicial views concerning race, sex, age, and disability. The problem is not one of incompetence but of barriers to education, jobs, and power. Accordingly, as long as there is a deep gulf between social classes, both in terms of wealth, power, and outlook, traditional social programs will act merely as palliatives to oppression and not as a way of ending large scale human misery. This perspective is, above all, eclectic. It embraces Marx's criticism of social class inequality but is not only a social class analysis. It is anti-racist, but it is not only a theory of race equality. It favors democratic distribution of power but is also an economic theory. It can be called a social and economic democracy perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=41, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

=== Savings, investment and unemployment ===

In his 1879 book ''Progress and Poverty'', Henry George argued that a majority of wealth created in a "free market" economy was appropriated by land owners and [[monopoly|monopolists]] through [[economic rent]]s, and that concentration of such [[Unearned income|unearned wealth]] was the root cause of poverty.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "Behind the abstraction known as 'the market' lurks a set of institutions designed to maximize the wealth and power of the most privileged group of people in the world—the creditor-rentier class of the first world and their junior partners in the third".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henwood | first = Doug | title = Wall Street: How It Works and For Whom | publisher = Verso | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-86091-495-2 | page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schweickart claimed that private savings are not only unnecessary for economic growth, they are often harmful to the overall economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=17}}

In an advanced industrial society, business credit is necessary for a healthy economy. A business that wants to expand production needs to command the labor of others, and money is the default mechanism for exercising this authority.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} It is often cheaper for a business to borrow capital from a bank than to stockpile cash.

If private savings are loaned out to entrepreneurs who use them to buy raw materials and hire workers, then aggregate demand is not reduced.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} However, when private savings are not reinvested, the whole economy suffers recession, unemployment, and disappearance of savings {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=42–43}} which characterize deficiency of effective demand.

In this view, unemployment is not an aberration, indicating any sort of systemic malfunction. Rather, unemployment is a necessary structural feature of capitalism, intended to discipline the workforce. If unemployment is too low, workers make wage demands that either cut into profits to an extent that jeopardizes future investment, or are passed on to consumers, thus generating inflationary instability. Schweickart suggested, "Capitalism cannot be a full-employment economy, except in the very short term. For unemployment is the "[[invisible hand]]"—carrying a stick—that keeps the workforce in line."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} In this view, [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith's]] "invisible hand" does not seem reliable to guide economic forces on a large scale.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Assuming business credit could come from public sources rather than from private savers, Schweickart and other analysts consider interest payments to private savers both undeserved and unnecessary for economic growth. Moreover, the personal decision to save rather than consume decreases aggregate demand, increases the likelihood of unemployment, and exacerbates the tendency toward economic stagnation. Since wealthy people tend to save more than poor people, the propensity of an economy to slump because of excess saving becomes ever more acute as a society becomes more affluent.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett suggested that health and social problems are significantly worse in more unequal wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Richard G | title = The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger | publisher = Bloomsbury Press | isbn = 978-1-60819-036-2 |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there are "pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, (and) encouraging excessive consumption"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Jarvis | first = Brooke |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/happiness/want-the-good-life-your-neighbors-need-it-too | title = Equality and the Good Life: Interview with Richard Wilkinson, author of The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better | work = yesmagazine.org |date = March 4, 2010 |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monopoly power versus purchasing power ===

Regarding a social and economic democracy perspective on social problems, Douglas P. Biklen states:

{{quote|The theme of profit superseding individual well-being flows through this antimonopoly view of social problems. On the one hand, poor and middle income people find their lives deformed by their meager or nonexistent ability to pay for goods and services. Wealthy people, on the other hand, find that their relative position, in terms of wealth and power, grows with their ability to maintain the gulf between social classes. Thus monopolies or concentrated wealth plays a large part in creating social problems. Indeed, one might say, monopolies and policies which promote the former or concentrations of wealth are the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N. J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=43, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The discipline of economics is largely a study of [[scarcity]] management; "the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Lionel|title=An Essay On The Nature And Significance Of Economic Science|year=1932|publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co, Ltd|location=St. Martin's Street, London|asin=B000XG8SV4|pages=15|url=https://mises.org/books/robbinsessay2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent scarcity and alternative uses of available resources, many analysts claim there is no [[economic problem]]". For example, Richard C. Cook asserts that conditions of scarcity are artificially maintained by [[Corporate finance|corporate structures]] that confine [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] to an exclusively entitled minority. In this view, socio-economic imbalance stems not from a failure to manage limited [[Resource (economics)|resources]] in a world of scarcity, but from mismanagement of virtually unlimited abundance and prosperity.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} American businessman Edward Kellogg (1790–1858) supports this perspective in his 1849 book, ''Labor and Other Capital'', where he states:

{{quote|Money power is not only the most governing and influential, but it is also the most unjust and deceitful of all earthly powers. It entails upon millions excessive toil, poverty and want, while it keeps them ignorant of the cause of their sufferings; for, with their tacit consent, it silently transfers a large share of their earnings into the hands of others, who have never lifted a finger to perform any productive labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kellogg |first=Edward |last2=Campbell |first2=Alexander |title=Labor and Other Capital |year=1971 |publisher=Scholar's Bookshelf |isbn=0-678-00803-5 |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While he considers these functions a public wrong, Kellogg also asserted the responsibility of the public to find and implement a remedy. Generally considered [[Monopoly|monopoly power]], some view this "public wrong" as the most influential factor in [[artificial scarcity]]. For example, Henry George further suggested:

{{quote|There is in reality no conflict between labor and capital; the true conflict is between labor and monopoly... Abolish the monopoly that forbids men to employ themselves and capital could not possibly oppress labor... [R]emove the cause of that injustice which deprives the laborer of the capital his toil creates and the sharp distinction between capitalist and laborer would, in fact, cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = George | first = Henry | title = Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, With Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor | year = 1998 | publisher = Robert Schalkenbach Foundation | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-911312-83-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

For example, many analysts consider [[invention]] a "more or less costless store of knowledge, captured by monopoly capital and protected in order to make it secret and a 'rare and scarce commodity', for sale at monopoly prices. So far as invention is concerned, a price is put on them not because they are scarce but in order to make them scarce to those who want to use them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Edith Tilton |title=The International Patent System | publisher = Johns Hopkins Press | location = Baltimore |year=1951 | oclc = 181961 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nadudere |first=Dan |title=The Political Economy of Imperialism |year=1977 |publisher=Zed Books |page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Patent monopolies raise share prices above tangible labor value. The difference between labor-value and monopoly-value raises goods prices, and is collected as "profit" by intermediaries who have contributed nothing to earn it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Analysts generally agree that such conditions typically result in a deficiency of effective demand. Labor does not earn enough to buy what enterprises produce. For example, Richard C. Cook maintains that the difference between earnings and prices is typically appropriated by industrial and banking centers of capital through monopoly control of finance and other market resources. Such exclusive entitlement tends to artificially impose conditions of economic scarcity upon the majority of the population.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} While the accelerating advance of technology, developed and maintained by labor, tends to generate abundance, this process depresses wages as workers are replaced by machines, ironically minimizing the purchasing power of workers in the market. {{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} According to Jack Rasmus, author of ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', in June 2006, investment bank Goldman Sachs reported: "The most important contribution to the higher profit margins over the past five years has been a decline in Labor's share of national income." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasmus|first=Jack|title=The Trillion Dollar Income Shift, Part 1|journal=Z Magazine|date=February 2007|volume=20|issue=2|pages=44–49|url=http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/Wealth/JackRasmusZMag.txt|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enclosure of the commons ===
Artificially restricted access of labor to common resources is generally considered monopoly or [[enclosure|enclosure of the commons]]. Due to the economic imbalance inherently imposed, such monopoly structures tend to be centrally dictated by law, and must be maintained by military force, trade agreements, or both.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In 1911, American journalist [[Ambrose Bierce]] defined "land" as:

{{quote|A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society.... Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bierce | first = Ambrose | authorlink = Ambrose Bierce | title = [[The Devil's Dictionary]] | year = 1911 | oclc = 49294964}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In ''The Servile State'' (1912), [[Hilaire Belloc]] referred to the [[Enclosure|Enclosures Movement]] when he said, "England was already captured by a wealthy [[oligarchy]] before the series of great [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] discoveries began". If you sought the accumulated wealth preliminary to launching new industry, "you had to turn to the class which had already monopolized the bulk of the means of production in England. The rich men alone could furnish you with those supplies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belloc|first=Hilaire|title=The Servile State|year=1912|publisher=T. N.

According to [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]], author of ''Capitalism 3.0'', when Adam Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations'' in 1776, the dominant form of business was partnership, in which regional groups of co-workers ran co-owned businesses. From this perspective, many considered the corporate model—stock sold to strangers—inherently prone to fraud. While numerous scandals historically support this dim view of corporate policy, small partnerships could not possibly compete with the aggregate capital generated by corporate [[economies of scale]]. The greatest advantage of corporations over any other business model is their ability to raise capital from strangers. The corporate model benefits from laws that limit stockholders' liability to the amounts they have invested.{{sfn|Barnes|2006}}

In ''A Preface To Economic Democracy'', [[Robert A. Dahl]] suggests that [[Agriculture|agrarian]] economy and society in the early United States "underwent a [[Industrial Revolution|revolutionary]] transformation into a new system of commercial and industrial capitalism that automatically generated vast [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] of wealth, income, [[Social status|status]], and [[Economic power|power]]." Dahl claims that such inequalities result from the "[[liberty]] to accumulate unlimited [[Factors of production|economic resources]] and to organize economic activity into [[Hierarchy|hierarchically]] governed enterprises."{{sfn|Dahl|1985|p=50}}

=== The rise of corporations and ending labor shortage ===
According to author Greg MacLeod, the concept of the corporation originated in Roman times. However, "the modern business corporation evolved radically from its ancient roots into a form with little relation to the purpose as understood by historians of law." John Davis, a legal historian, noted that the precursor of the business corporation was the first [[monastery]], established in the sixth century, the purpose of which was to serve society. Most business corporations before 1900 developed in Great Britain, where they were established by [[royal charter]], with the expectation of contributions to society. Incorporation was a privilege granted in return for service to the crown or the nation. MacLeod goes on to say:

{{quote|A corporation is considered by the law to exist as a legal person. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was called a "persona ficta". This is a very useful way of looking at a business corporation, because it suggests correctly that the [[corporate personhood|corporate person]] has a certain personality. It has duties and responsibilities vested unto it by the legitimate government or society that fostered it. The corporate person receives great benefits from society – and, in return, it must exercise great responsibilities. One of the most basic responsibilities is job creation, a fundamental need in any society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacLeod | first = Greg | title = The Public Purpose Corporation | journal = Harvard International Review | date = 2009-04-04 | url = http://hir.harvard.edu/the-mondragon-experiment | accessdate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

By the mid-nineteenth century, corporations could live forever, engage in any legal activity, and merge with or acquire other corporations. In 1886, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] legally recognized corporations as “persons”, entitled under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the same protections as living [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Unlike average citizens, large corporations had large flows of money at their disposal. With this money they can hire [[Lobbying|lobbyists]], donate copiously to politicians, and sway [[public opinion]].

But, despite [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings, the modern corporation is not a real person. Rather, the publicly traded stock corporation is what Barnes terms an "[[automaton]]", explicitly designed to maximize return to its owners. A corporation never sleeps or slows down. It externalizes as many costs as possible, and never reaches an upper limit of profitability, because no such limit has yet been established. As a result, corporations keep getting larger. In 1955, sales of the [[Fortune 500]] accounted for one-third of U.S. gross domestic product. By 2004 they commanded two-thirds. In other words, these few hundred corporations replaced smaller firms organized as partnerships or [[Sole proprietorship|proprietorships]]. Corporations have established a homogeneous global playing field around which they can freely move raw materials, labor, capital, finished products, tax-paying obligations, and profits. Thus, corporate franchise has become a perpetual grant of [[sovereignty]], including [[immortality]], [[Self-governance|self-government]], and [[limited liability]]. By the end of the twentieth century, corporate power—both economic and political—stretched worldwide. International agreements not only lowered [[tariff]]s but extended corporate [[Property|property rights]] and reduced the ability of sovereign nations to regulate corporations.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p=}}

David Schweickart submits that such "hypermobility of capital" generates economic and political insecurity.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "If the search for lower wages comes to dominate the movement of capital, the result will be not only a lowering of worldwide wage disparities (the good to which some economists point) but also a lowering of total global income (a straight-out utilitarian bad)."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=96}} Jack Rasmus, author of ''The War At Home'' and ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', argues that the increasing concentration of corporate power is a cause of the large-scale debt, unemployment, and poverty characteristic of economic [[recession]] and [[depression (economics)|depression]]. According to Rasmus, income inequality in contemporary America increased as the relative share of income for corporations and the wealthiest one percent of households rose while income shares declined for 80-percent of the United States workforce. After rising steadily for three decades after World War II, the standard of living for most American workers has sharply declined between the mid-1970s to the present. Rasmus likens the widening income gap in contemporary American society to the decade leading up to the [[Great Depression]], estimating "well over $1 trillion in income is transferred annually from the roughly 90 million working class families in America to corporations and the wealthiest non-working-class households. While a hundred new billionaires were created since 2001, [[real wages|real weekly earnings]] for 100 million workers are less in 2007 than in 1980 when [[Ronald Reagan]] took office".

According to economist [[Richard D. Wolff]], the 1970s brought an end to the labor shortage which had facilitated more than a century of rising average [[real wage]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}.

* "...the combination of computerization, exported jobs, women surging into the labor market, and a new wave of immigration ended the period of rising real wages in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff says Americans responded to the resulting deficiency of effective demand by working more hours and excessive borrowing; the latter paving the way for the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name="Wolff 2012 46"&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}.

* "Across the 1980s and 1990s and up to 2007, US families worked and borrowed more and more, while real wages stagnated... When they began defaulting on their debts - the system crashed."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperialism ===
According to David Harvey, "the export of capital and the cultivation of new markets around the world" is a solution "as old as capitalism itself" for the deficiency of effective demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=David|title=The Enigma of Capital: And the Crises of Capitalism|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0199836841|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imperialism, as defined by ''Dictionary of Human Geography'', is "the creation and/or maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states and often in the form of an empire, based on domination and subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston | first = Ronald John | year = 2000 |title = The Dictionary of Human Geography | edition = 4th | publisher =Wiley-Blackwell | page=375 | isbn = 0-631-20561-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These geographic shifts", according to David Harvey, "are the heart of uneven geographic development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=David|title=Reading Marx’s Capital Vol 1 – Class 12, Chapters 26-33|url=http://davidharvey.org/2008/09/capital-class-12/|work=Video Lecture|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] viewed imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. He asserted that the merging of banks and industrial cartels gave rise to finance capital, which was then exported (rather than goods) in pursuit of greater profits than the home market could offer. Political and financial power became divided among international monopolist firms and European states, colonizing large parts of the world in support of their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir |title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism |year=1916 |place=London |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analyst Michael Parenti, imperialism is "the process whereby the dominant politico-economic interests of one nation expropriate for their own enrichment the land, labor, raw materials, and markets of another people."&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Against Empire |last=Parenti |first=Michael |year=1995 |publisher=City Lights Publishers |isbn=978-0-87286-298-2 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenti says imperialism is older than capitalism. Given its expansionist nature, capitalism has little inclination to stay home. While he conceded imperialism is not typically recognized as a legitimate allegation about the United States, Parenti argued:

{{quote|Emperors and conquistadors were interested mostly in plunder and tribute, gold and glory. Capitalist imperialism differs from these earlier forms in the way it systematically accumulates capital through the organized exploitation of labor and the penetration of overseas markets. Capitalist imperialism invests in other countries, transforming and dominating their economies, cultures, and political life, integrating their financial and productive structures into an international system of capital accumulation.&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''The Political Struggle for the 21st century'', [[J. W. Smith|J.W. Smith]] examines the economic basis for the history of imperial civilization. On a global scale, he says developed nations tended to impede or prohibit the economic and technological advancement of weaker developing countries through the military force, martial law, and inequitable practices of trade that typically characterize [[colonialism]]. Rhetorically termed as "[[survival of the fittest]]", or "[[might makes right]]", such economic crises stem from the imbalances imposed by [[corporate imperialism]]. Just as cities in the [[Middle Ages]] monopolized the [[means of production]] by conquering and controlling the sources of raw materials and countryside markets, Smith claims that contemporary centers of capital now control our present world through private monopoly of public resources sometimes known as "the commons". Through inequalities of trade, developing countries are overcharged for import of manufactured goods and underpaid for raw material exports, as wealth is siphoned from the periphery of empire and hoarded at the imperial-centers-of-capital:

{{Quote|Over eight-hundred years ago the powerful of the city-states of Europe learned to control the resources and markets of the countryside by raiding and destroying others’ primitive industrial capital, thus openly monopolizing that capital and establishing and maintaining extreme inequality of pay. This low pay siphoned the wealth of the countryside to the imperial-centers-of-capital. The powerful had learned to plunder-by-trade and have been refining those skills ever since.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=}}|sign=|source=}}

Smith goes on to say that, like other financial empires in history, the contemporary model forms alliances necessary to develop and control wealth, keeping peripheral nations impoverished providers of cheap resources for the imperial capital centers. Belloc estimated that, during the British Enclosures, "perhaps half of the whole population was [[Proletariat|proletarian]]", while roughly the other "half" owned and controlled the means of production. Under modern Capitalism, J.W. Smith claimed that fewer than 500 individuals possess more wealth than half of the earth's population. The wealth of 1/2 of 1-percent of the United States population roughly equals that of the lower 90-percent. {{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Richard Cook claimed that the United States maintained stability by economically dominating the world as a means of filling the gap between production and consumption. Beginning with loans to European combatants during World War I, and continuing through the [[lend-lease]] program of World War II, U.S. domination of trade peaked through economic recovery measures following those wars. Though forming the basis for U.S. prosperity during the 1950s and 1960s, U.S trade domination was exhausted by the mid-1970s, when the United States implemented a policy known as [[dollar hegemony]], intended to stabilize the economy.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}

Wolff says reform agendas are fundamentally inadequate, given that capitalist corporations, the dominant institutions of the existing system, retain the incentives and the resources to undo any sort of reform policy. For example, Wolff goes on to say:

{{quote|The [[New Deal]]–era taxes on business and the rich and [[regulation]]s of [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] behavior proved vulnerable and unsustainable. The enemies of the New Deal had the incentives ([[profit maximization]]) and the resources (their returns on investments) to undo many of its reforms after [[World War II]], with ever-greater effect in the period since the 1970s. They systematically evaded, then weakened, the taxes and regulations of the New Deal, and eventually, when politically possible, eliminated them altogether. Business profits funded the parties, politicians, public relations campaigns, and professional think tanks that together shaped the real social effects and historical decline of government economic regulation. Examples include the destruction of the [[Glass-Steagall Act]], the current assault on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], the shift in the federal tax burden from business to individuals and from upper- to middle-income individuals, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D.|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

According to David Schweickart, a serious critique of any problem cannot be content to merely note the negative features of the existing [[scientific modelling|model]]. Instead, we must specify precisely the structural features of an alternative: "But if we want to do more than simply denounce the evils of capitalism, we must confront the claim that 'there is no alternative'—by proposing one."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=45}} Schweickart argued that both full employment and guaranteed basic income are impossible under the restrictions of the U.S. economic system for two primary reasons: a) unemployment is an essential feature of capitalism, not an indication of systemic failure;{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} and b) while capitalism thrives under [[polyarchy]], it is not compatible with genuine democracy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=151}} Assuming these "democratic deficits" significantly impact the management of both the workplace and new investment,{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=46}} many proponents of economic democracy tend to favor the creation and implementation of a new economic model over reform of the existing one.

For example, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] claimed "Communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of Capitalism but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/political/martin_luther_king_talks/where_do_we_go_from_here/ |title=Where Do We Go From Here |first=Martin Luther Jr |last= King|work=writespirit.net | date = August 16, 1967 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the gap between productivity and purchasing power, Dr. King maintained:

{{quote|The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available.{{sfn|King|1968|p=163}}|sign=|source=}}

According to historian and political economist, [[Gar Alperovitz]]: "King’s final judgment stands as instructive evidence of his understanding of the nature of systemic challenge — and also as a reminder that given the failures of both traditional socialism and corporate capitalism, it is time to get serious about clarifying not only the question of strategy, but what, in fact, the meaning of changing the system in a truly democratic direction might one day entail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk About The Next American Revolution|date=2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, VT|isbn=978-160358-491-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unionist and social activist Allan Engler argued further that economic democracy was the working-class alternative to capitalism. In his book, "Economic Democracy", Engler stated:

{{quote|When economic democracy – a world of human equality, democracy and cooperation – is the alternative, capitalism will no longer be seen as a lesser evil. When the working class, not a revolutionary party, is the agency of social transformation, change will be based on workplace organization, community mobilizations and democratic political action. The goal will be to transform capitalism into economic democracy through gains and reforms that improve living conditions while methodically replacing wealth-holders' entitlement with human entitlement, capitalist ownership with community ownership and master-servant relations with workplace democracy.{{sfn|Engler|2010|p=8}}|sign=|source=}}

Assuming that "democracy is not just a political value, but one with profound economic implications, the problem is not to choose between [[Planned economy|plan]] and [[Market economy|market]], but to integrate these institutions into a democratic framework".&lt;ref name="Schweickart Essay"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Economic Democracy: A Worthy Socialism That Would Really Work |journal=Science &amp; Society |volume=56| issue=1 | pages=9–38|date=Spring 1992 |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~dschwei/economicdemocracy.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like capitalism, economic democracy can be defined in terms of three basic features:

* Worker self-management: each productive enterprise is controlled democratically by its workers.
* Social control of investment: funds for new investment are returned to the economy through a network of public investment banks.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}
* The market: enterprises interact with one another and with consumers in an environment largely free of governmental price controls. Raw materials, instruments of production and consumer goods are all bought and sold at prices largely determined by the forces of supply and demand.

In real-world practice, Schweickart concedes economic democracy will be more complicated and less "pure" than his model. However, to grasp the nature of the system and to understand its essential dynamic, it is important to have a clear picture of the basic structure. Capitalism is characterized by private ownership of productive resources, the market, and wage labor. The Soviet economic model subordinated private ownership of productive resources to public ownership by collectivizing farms and factories. It further subordinated the market to central planning—but retained the institution of wage labor.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=47}}

Most proposed models for economic democracy generally begin with democratizing the workplace and the ownership of capital. Other proposals advocate replacing the market with some form of planning, as well.

=== Worker self-management ===
{{Main|Worker self-management}}In worker self-management, each productive enterprise is controlled by those who work there. Workers are responsible for the operation of the facility, including organization, discipline, production techniques, and the nature, price, and distribution of products. Decisions concerning distribution are made democratically. Problems of authority delegation are solved by democratic representation. Management is chosen by the worker, not appointed by the State, not elected by the community at large and not selected by a board of directors elected by [[stockholder]]s. Ultimate authority rests with the enterprise's workers, following the one-person, one-vote principle.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–48}}

According to veteran [[World Bank]] economic adviser [[David Ellerman|David P. Ellerman]] it's the [[employment contract]] that needs to be abolished, not private property. In other words, "a firm can be socialized and yet remain 'private' in the sense of not being government-owned."{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|p=56}} In his book, "The Democratic Firm", Ellerman stated:

{{quote|In the world today, the main form of enterprise is based on renting human beings ([[private company|privately]] or [[public enterprise|publicly]]). Our task is to construct the alternative. In the alternative type of firm, employment by the firm is replaced with membership in the firm. Economic democracy requires the abolition of the employment relation, not the abolition of [[private property]]. Democracy can be married with private property in the workplace; the result of the union is the democratic worker-owned firm.{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|pp=44–49}}|sign=|source=}}

Alternately, in Schweickart's model, workers control the workplace, but they do not "own" the means of production. Productive resources are regarded as the collective property of the society. Workers run the enterprise, use its capital assets as they see fit, and distribute the profits among themselves. Here, societal "ownership" of the enterprise manifests itself in two ways: 1) All firms pay tax on their [[capital asset]]s, which goes into society's investment fund. In effect, workers rent capital assets from society. 2) Firms are required to preserve the value of the [[capital stock]] entrusted to them. This means that a [[depreciation]] fund must be maintained to repair or replace existing capital stock. This money may be spent on capital replacements or improvements, but not to supplement workers' incomes. {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–49}}

Italy's [[Legacoop]] and Spain's [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] multi-sectoral worker-cooperatives have both been able to reach significant scale and demonstrate long-term sustainability. According to a study conducted by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the greatest lesson to be learned from these European experiences is the importance of developing an economically integrated network of cooperatives rather than a single cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoyt|first1=Lorlene|last2=Luviene|first2=Nicholas|last3=Stitely|first3=Amy|title=Sustainable Economic Democracy: Worker Cooperatives for the 21st Century|url=http://web.mit.edu/colab/pdf/papers/Sustainable_Economic_Democracy.pdf|website=colab.mit.edu|publisher=MIT Community Innovators Lab  with support from the Barr Foundation|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to say:

{{quote|In a market based economy the cooperative business form suffers from several strategic challenges when operating independently. One worker cooperative on its own is most likely doomed to fail in a highly competitive global economy. However, an ecosystem of several worker cooperatives and support organizations can create an infrastructure that leads to sustained growth and expansion. In Mondragon the cooperative network expanded from a single cooperative polytechnic school to a network of 256 industrial, retail, finance, educational, and research and development firms.}}

=== Social control of investment ===
While there is no single approach or 'blueprint' for social control of investment, many strategies have been proposed. For example, [[Gar Alperovitz]] claims many real-world strategies have already emerged to democratize and decentralize the ownership of wealth and capital. In addition to worker cooperatives, Alperovitz highlights ESOPs, [[credit union]]s and other cooperative forms, [[social enterprise]]s, municipally-owned utilities and [[public bank]]s as starting points for what he has termed a "[[Pluralist commonwealth|Pluralist Commonwealth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk about the Next American Revolution|date=May 1, 2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=85 North Main Street, Suite 120, White River Junction, VT 05001|isbn=1603585044|pages=139–147|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, David Schweickart proposes a [[Flat tax|flat-rate tax]] on capital assets to replace all other business taxes. This "capital assets tax" is collected and invested by the central government. Funds are dispersed throughout society, first to regions and communities on a per capita basis, then to public banks in accordance with past performance, then to those firms with profitable [[project]] proposals. Profitable projects that promise increased employment are favored over those that do not. At each level, national, regional and local, legislatures decide what portion of their funds is to be used for public capital expenditures, then send the remainder to the next lower level. Associated with most banks are entrepreneurial divisions, which promote firm expansion and new firm creation. For large (regional or national) enterprises, local investment banks are complemented by regional and national investment banks. These too would be public institutions that receive their funds from the national investment fund.

Banks are public, not private, institutions that make [[Grant (money)|grants]], not loans, to business enterprises. According to Schweickart, these grants do not represent "free money", since an investment grant counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring [[interest]] payments but no repayment of [[Debt|principal]].{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=56}}

While an economy of worker-self-managed enterprises might tend toward lower unemployment than under capitalism - because banks are mandated to consistently prioritize investment projects that would increase employment - Schweickart notes that it does not guarantee [[full employment]]. Social control of investment serves to increase employment. If the market provides insufficient employment, the public sector becomes the [[employer of last resort]]. The original formulation of the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act|U.S. Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978]] assumed that only in this way could full employment be assured in a market economy. Economic Democracy adopts this approach. Social control of investment then blocks the cyclical unemployment typical of capitalism.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=135, 136}}

=== The market ===
Hungarian historian [[Karl Polanyi]] suggested that market economies should subordinate themselves to larger societal needs. He states that human-beings, the source of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], do not reproduce for the sole purpose of providing the market with workers. In [[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]] Polanyi says that, while modern states and market economies tend to grow under capitalism, both are mutually interdependent for functional development. In order for market economies to be truly prosperous, he claims social constructs must play an essential role. Polanyi claimed that [[Land (economics)|land]], labor, and money are all [[commodities|commodified]] under capitalism, though the inherent purpose of these items was never intended "for sale"—what he labels "[[fictitious commodities]]." He says [[natural resources]] are "God-given", money is a bookkeeping entry validated by law, and labor is a human prerogative, not a personal obligation to market economies.

Schweickart's economic democracy is a form of [[market economy]], at least insofar as the allocation of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[capital goods]] is concerned. [[business entity|Firm]]s buy [[raw materials]] and machinery from other firms and sell their products to other enterprises or consumers. "Prices are largely [[Regulation|unregulated]] except by supply and demand, although in some cases price controls or price supports might be in order – as they are deemed in order in most real-world forms of capitalism."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Without a [[price mechanism]] sensitive to supply and demand, it is extremely difficult for a producer or planner to know what and how much to produce, and which production and marketing methods are the most efficient. Otherwise, it is difficult to motivate producers to be both efficient and [[Innovation|innovative]]. [[Competition (economics)|Market competition]] resolves these problems, to a significant if incomplete degree, in a [[Authoritarianism|non-authoritarian]], [[Bureaucracy|non-bureaucratic]] fashion.

Enterprises still strive to make a profit. However, "profit" in a worker-run firm is calculated differently than under capitalism. For a capitalist firm, labor is counted as a cost. For a worker-run enterprise it is not. Labor is not another "factor of production" on par with land and capital. Labor is the residual claimant. Workers get all that remains, once other costs, including depreciation set asides and the capital assets tax, have been paid.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=49}}

Because of the way workplaces and the investment mechanism are structured, Schweickart's model aims to facilitate [[fair trade]], not [[free trade]], between nations. Under Economic Democracy, there would be virtually no cross-border capital flows. Enterprises themselves would not relocate abroad, since they are democratically controlled by their own workers. [[Financial capital|Finance capital]] stays mostly at home, since funds for investment are publicly generated and are mandated by law to be reinvested domestically. "Capital doesn't flow into the country, either, since there are no [[stock]]s nor [[Bond (finance)|corporate bonds]] nor businesses to buy. The capital assets of the country are collectively owned – and hence not for sale."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=63}}

According to Michael Howard, "in preserving commodity exchange, a [[market socialism]] has greater continuity with the society it displaces than does nonmarket socialism, and thus it is more likely to emerge from capitalism as a result of tendencies generated within it." But Howard also suggested, "one argument against the market in socialist society has been that it blocks progress toward full communism or even leads back to capitalism".&lt;ref name="Rose In The Fist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Michael |title=Self-Management and the Crisis of Socialism: The Rose in the Fist of the Present |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn=0-8476-8905-0 |year=2000 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, nonmarket models of economic democracy have also been proposed.

=== Economic democracy as part of an inclusive democracy ===
{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}
Economic democracy is described as an integral component of an [[inclusive democracy]] in Takis Fotopoulos' ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' as a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalization of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice.

The proposed system aims to meet the basic needs of all citizens ([[macroeconomic]] decisions), and secure freedom of choice ([[microeconomic]] decisions). Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: (1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and a confederal assembly, and (2) an artificial market using [[Labour voucher|personal vouchers]], which ensures [[choice|freedom of choice]] but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although David Pepper called this system "a form of money based on the labour theory of value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pepper | first = David | title = Modern environmentalism: An Introduction | publisher = Routledge | location = London; New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-415-05745-5 | page = 321}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Another distinguishing feature of inclusive democracy is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is determined separately according to the cost of basic needs, and according to degree of effort for non-basic needs. Inclusive democracy is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, [[participatory economics]] guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only for public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Albert  | first = Michael |title = Parecon: Life After Capitalism | publisher = Verso Books | location = New York | year = 2003 | pages = 37–38 | isbn = 978-1-85984-698-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advocates of participatory economics and [[Participism]] have contested this.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As part of inclusive democracy, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere—which requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all macroeconomic decisions (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used and so on) are made collectively and without representation. However, microeconomic decisions are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of vouchers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy is only feasible if the participants can easily cooperate.

== Reform agendas ==
While [[Reform movement|reform agendas]] tend to critique the existing system and recommend corrective measures, they do not necessarily suggest alternative models to replace the fundamental structures of capitalism; private ownership of productive resources, the market and wage labor.

=== Social credit ===
{{Main|Social credit}}
Rather than an economic shortfall, many analysts{{who|date=January 2012}} consider the gap between production and purchasing power a social dividend. In this view, credit is a [[public utility]] rather than debt to financial centers. Once reinvested in human productive potential, the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] of societal output could actually increase Gross Domestic Product rather than throttling it, resulting in a more efficient economy, overall.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} [[Social Credit]] is an economic reform movement that originates from theories developed by Scottish engineer Major [[C. H. Douglas]]. His aim to make societal improvement the goal of economic systems is reflected in the term "Social Credit", and published in his book, entitled ''Economic Democracy''. In this view, the term "economic democracy" does not mean worker control of industry.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"&gt;{{cite book |title=Credit-Power and Democracy |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1933 |publisher=The Social Credit Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |pages=4–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While technological advancement tends to increase unemployment along with productivity, Douglas suggests that our perspective will determine whether this problem is a "catastrophe" or a "magnificent achievement":

{{quote|The so-called unemployment problem is really a problem of leisure. The problem really is a problem, first of the distribution of purchasing power to those who are not required, and will decreasingly be required, in the industrial system, and secondly, of ensuring that the total purchasing distributed shall always be enough to pay for the goods and services for sale.{{sfn|Cook, "C.H. Douglas"|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

A national dividend and a compensated price mechanism are the two most essential components of the Social Credit program. While these measures have never been implemented in their purest form, they have provided a foundation for Social Credit political parties in many countries and for reform agendas that retain the title, "economic democracy".

==== Credit as a public utility ====
Following Douglas and a reform program based on direct government spending set forth by groups such as the [[American Monetary Institute]], veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] proposes two general measures, which together he terms, "economic democracy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cook| first=Richard C.| year=07/02/2010 | title=Monetary Reform and How a National Monetary System Should Work| publisher=Global Research| url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Credit as a public utility: "We should spend sufficient credit into existence to supply the basic operating expenses of government at all levels without recourse to either taxes or borrowing. At least ninety percent of all taxes could be eliminated. The only taxes that should be retained would be those in the form of user fees for infrastructure operations and maintenance and those levied only for dire emergencies. Capital expenses for infrastructure construction at the federal, state, and local levels should be financed through a self-capitalized national infrastructure bank lending at zero-interest. Operating on a national scale, such a bank could begin to rebuild our job base starting at the state and local levels. A public program of direct government expenditures as described herein would be as effective, as timely, far less inflationary, and much cheaper than creating new public debt by borrowing credit created 'out of thin air' by the banking system".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

[[File:GAP Chart from We Hold These Truths.jpg|thumb|320px|GAP Chart from [[We Hold These Truths: The Hope of Monetary Reform|''We Hold These Truths'']]]]

* A national dividend: "The endemic gap between prices and purchasing power in an advanced economic system in reality is the “leisure dividend” that we never received from our amazing producing economy. That gap should now be filled by a non-taxable national dividend of two types. One would be a cash stipend paid to all citizens which would also serve the purpose of eliminating poverty by providing everyone with a basic income guarantee. The remainder of the national dividend would consist of an overall pricing subsidy, whereby a designated proportion of all purchases, including home building expenses, would be rebated to consumers. The average national dividend per person would probably exceed $12,000 per year under today's economic conditions. It would be a calculated value charged against a government ledger but would be off-budget, with no need to finance it with taxation or borrowing".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

While Smith and others suggest an [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] might be necessary to drive a movement toward large-scale economic democracy,{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} {{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook argues that "most economic reform programs address symptoms, not causes":{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

{{quote|[[Monetary reform]] embraces the enormous productivity of modern industrial methods with approval and hope. But it identifies factors in the nature of industrial production at the level of the corporation as creating a chronic state of instability.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} The top priority of the reform program would be to use public credit to rebuild the producing economy which has been wrecked by the phony ideology of 'market' economics and the inept and self-serving manipulation of the money supply by the Federal Reserve and the banks.{{sfn|Cook, "Credit as a Public Utility" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

Cook avoided [[Collectivism|collectivist]] solutions. Rather, he affirmed the value of "democratic capitalism," combined with a shift to more public control of credit, and suggested a new approach to achieving worldwide prosperity, starting with economic recovery in the United States. Cook's argument stemmed from prior success in the United States treating credit as a public utility, including [[Early American currency|colonial paper currencies]] which allowed an emerging American society to monetize the value of its goods and services, the [[Greenback (money)|Greenbacks]] issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American civil war]], and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) which moved to recapitalize failing state banks in rural areas and small towns during the [[Great Depression]]. While President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s efforts failed, Cook credits RFC programs with providing low interest loans to the railroad industry, farmers, exporters, state and local governments, and wartime industries over a period of at least 20 years.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=81–112}}

==== National dividend ====
Cook also proposed a national dividend, sometimes known as a [[Basic income|Basic Income Guarantee]] or "BIG", was advocated in the United States by economists, politicians and reformers, including [[Thomas Paine]], [[Milton Friedman]], Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. Friedman originally proposed a [[negative income tax]] to support this system, but then opposed the bill because its revised implementation would have merely supplemented rather than replacing existing tax-structures. Cook suggested that racism might have been at the root of BIG's demise in the late 1960s, as "many beneficiaries of the program would have been African-American".{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=121}} In 2006, Representative [[Bob Filner]] (D-CA) proposed a modest basic income guarantee via an inflation-adjusted refundable tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/5257 |title=H.R.5257 - Tax Cut for the Rest of Us Act of 2006, 109th Congress (2005-2006)|date=2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network:

{{quote|The basic income guarantee (BIG) is a government insured guarantee that no citizen's income will fall below some minimal level for any reason. All citizens would receive a BIG without means test or work requirement. BIG is an efficient and effective solution to poverty that preserves individual autonomy and work incentives while simplifying government social policy. Some researchers estimate that a small BIG, sufficient to cut the poverty rate in half could be financed without an increase in taxes by redirecting funds from spending programs and tax deductions aimed at maintaining incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 1, 2007|url=http://www.usbig.net/ |title=The U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Cook suggests existing U.S. (GDP) could support such a system. GDP of $12.98-trillion minus $9.21-trillion in purchasing power ("wages") equals a difference of $3.77-trillion. Distributed equally amongst United States citizens, Cook estimates a "National Dividend" of approximately $12,600 could be provided annually to every U.S. citizen. A primary function of monetary reform is to "provide sufficient individual income"—not merely "create jobs"—for American workers displaced by technological advancement, outsourcing, and other economic influences beyond their control. Funding of the National Dividend would be drawn from a national credit account, which would include all factors that generate production costs and create new capital assets. The national credit account could also be used for price subsidies to discourage manufacturers from cutting costs by shipping jobs overseas. 
Rather than [[Federal Reserve Note]]s, circulated only through debt payable to a bank with interest, the National Dividend would be "real money", based on the productive capacity of the economy expressed as GDP. Cook says, "it's important to realize that [[Social Credit]] is not a socialist system. Rather it is 'democratic capitalism,' in contrast to the 'finance capitalism' that has become so damaging".{{sfn|Cook, "US Economy on Life Support"|2007}} Rooted in the ideals of Social Credit, proposed by Douglas in the 1920s, Cook explains:

{{quote|The difference between a National Dividend and a basic income guarantee is that the dividend is tied to production and consumption data and may vary from year to year. During years that the dividend falls below a designated threshold, the balance of a basic income guarantee could be provided from tax revenues. But in a highly automated economy such as that of the U.S., the National Dividend would normally be sufficient.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''Capitalism 3.0'', Peter Barnes likens a "National Dividend" to the game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], where all players start with a fair distribution of financial opportunity to succeed, and try to privatize as much as they can as they move around "the commons". Distinguishing the board game from real-world business, Barnes claims that "the top 5 percent of the population owns more [[property]] than the remaining 95 percent", providing the smaller minority with an unfair advantage of approximately "$5-trillion" annually, at the beginning of the game. Contrasting "redistribution" of income (or property) with "predistribution", Barnes argues for "propertizing" (without corporately privatizing) "the commons" to spread ownership universally, without taking wealth from some and giving it to others. His suggested mechanism to this end is the establishment of a "Commons Sector", ensuring payment from the Corporate Sector for "the commons" they utilize, and equitably distributing the proceeds for the benefit of contemporary and future generations of society.

One real-world example of such reform is in the U.S. State of [[Alaska]], where each citizen receives an annual share of the part of the state's oil revenues via the "[[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]]". Barnes suggests this model could extend to other states and nations because "we jointly own many valuable assets". As corporate pollution of common assets increased, the permits for such pollution would become more scarce, driving prices for those permits up. "Less pollution would equal more revenue", and over time, "trillions of dollars could flow into an American Permanent Fund".{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

However, none of these proposals aspire to the mandates recommended by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:

{{quote|Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the gains of security and stability.{{sfn|King|1968|p=164}}}}

Barnes deemed any such reform unlikely. Thomas Paine originally recommended a National Dividend to compensate for the brutality of British Enclosures, but his idea was never adopted.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Monopoly power versus public utility ===
{{Main|J. W. Smith}}

Rather than superficially compensating for legalized inequities, Smith recommends abolishing or redefining property rights laws with particular respect for "the commons".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} According to Smith [[entitlement|exclusive title]] to natural resources and technologies should be converted to inclusive conditional titles—the condition being that society should collect rental values on all natural resources.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=2}} Smith suggests the basic principles of monopolization under feudalism were never abandoned, and residues of exclusive feudal property rights restrict the potential efficiency of capitalism in [[Western culture]]s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} He estimated that roughly 60 percent of American capital is little more than capitalized values of unearned wealth. He proposed that elimination of these monopoly values would double [[economic efficiency]], maintain [[quality of life]], and reduce [[Working time|working hours]] by half. Wasteful monetary flows could be stopped only by eliminating all methods of monopolization typical in Western economies.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}

Smith divided "primary (feudal) monopoly" into four general categories: banking; land; technology and [[Telecommunication|communications]]. He listed three general categories of "secondary (modern) monopoly"; insurance, law, health care.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=14}} Smith further claimed that converting these exclusive entitlements to inclusive human rights would minimize battles for [[market share]], thereby eliminating most offices and staff needed to maintain monopoly structures, and stop the wars generated to protect them. Dissolving roughly half the economic activity of a monopoly system would reduce the costs of common resources by roughly half, and significantly minimize the most influential factors of poverty.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In Smith's view, most taxes should be eliminated, and productive enterprise should be privately owned and managed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 187}} Inventors should be paid well and all technology placed in the public domain. Crucial services currently monopolized through [[License|licensing]] should be legislated as human rights.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 13, 22, 90, 102, 113, 124, 220}}

Smith envisioned a balanced economy under a socially owned banking commons within an inclusive society with full and [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=3}} Federated regions collect [[resource rent]]s on land and technology to a [[social fund]] to operate governments and care for social needs.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=17, 54}} Socially owned banks provide finance capital by creating debt-free money for social infrastructure and industry.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}} Rental values return to society through expenditure on public infrastructures. Local labor is trained and employed to build and maintain water systems, sewers, roads, communication systems, railroads, ports, airports, post offices, and education systems.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 84}} Purchasing power circulates regionally, as labor spends wages in consumption and governments spend resource rent and banking profits to maintain essential services.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=16–17}}

According to Smith, all monetary systems, including [[money market]]s, should function within [[fractional-reserve banking]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=15}} Financial capital should be the total savings of all citizens, balanced by primary-created money to fill any shortfall, or its destruction through increased reserve requirements to eliminate any surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=16}} Adjustments of required reserves should facilitate the balance between building with socially created money or savings. Any shortage of savings within a socially owned banking system should be alleviated by simply printing it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=13}}

=== Cooperatives ===
{{Main|Cooperative}}
A [[cooperative]] is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. By various names, cooperatives play an essential role in all forms of Economic Democracy. Classified as either [[consumer cooperative]]s or [[worker cooperative]]s, the cooperative business model is fundamental to the interests of economic democracy.

According to the [[International Cooperative Alliance]]'s [[Statement on the Cooperative Identity]], "cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner."

==== Worker cooperatives ====
{{Main|Worker cooperative}}
According to the [[United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives]]: "Worker cooperatives are business entities that are owned and controlled by their members, the people who work in them. The two central characteristics of worker cooperatives are: 1) workers invest in and own the business and (2) decision-making is democratic, generally adhering to the principle of one worker-one vote." Worker cooperatives occupy multiple sectors and industries in the United States, mostly in the Northeast, the West Coast and the Upper Midwest, totaling 300 democratic workplaces in the United States, employing over 3,500 people and generating over $400 million in annual revenues. While a few are larger enterprises, most are small. Growing steadily between 1990 and 2010, technology and home health care experienced most of the recent increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|title=About Worker Cooperatives|url=http://usworker.coop/aboutworkercoops|publisher=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worker cooperatives generally employ an industrial model called [[workplace democracy]], which rejects the "master-servant relationship" implicit in the traditional employment contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellerman|first=David P.|title=The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm: A New Model for the East and West|publisher=Unwin Hyman Limited (HarperCollins Academic)|location=London|isbn=0-04-445743-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilkinson and Pickett, neither ownership or participation alone are sufficient to establish democracy in the workplace. "[M]any share-ownership schemes amount to little more than incentive schemes, intended to make employees more compliant with management and sometimes to provide a nest-egg for retirement... To make a reliable difference to company performance, share-ownership has to be combined with more participative management methods." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Richard|title=The Spirit Level|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60819-036-2|pages=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl further argued that self-governing enterprises should not be confused with other systems they might resemble:

{{quote|Self-governing enterprises only remotely resemble pseudodemocratic schemes of employee consultation by management; schemes of limited employee participation that leave all critical decisions with a management elected by stockholders; or Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) that are created only or primarily to provide corporations with low-interest loans, lower corporate income taxes, greater cash flow, employee pension plans, or a market for their stock, without, however, any significant changes in control.{{sfn|Dahl|1985|pp=92–93 }}|sign=|source=}}

In worker cooperatives, [[net income]] is called [[Economic surplus|surplus]] instead of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] and is distributed among the members based on hours worked, seniority, or other criteria. In a worker cooperative, workers own their jobs, and therefore have a direct stake in the local environment and the power to conduct business in ways that benefit the community rather than destroying it. Some worker cooperatives maintain what is known as a “multiple bottom line”, evaluating success not merely in terms of net income, but also by factors like their sustainability as a business, their contribution to the community, and the happiness and longevity of their workers.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt;

Worker-control can take many forms depending on the size and type of the business. Approaches to decision-making include: an elected board of directors, elected managers, management job roles, no management at all, consensus, majority vote, or combinations of the above.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt; Participation in decision-making becomes the responsibility and privilege of each member.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}} In one variation, workers usually invest money when they begin working.&lt;ref name="usworker"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usworker.coop/front |title=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives |work=usworker.coop |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member owns one share, which provides its owner with one vote in company decision-making. While membership is not a requirement of employment, only employees can become members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianworker.coop/worker-co-op |title=What is a Worker Co-op? | publisher = Canadian Worker Co-op Federation |work=canadianworker.coop |year=2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kenneth W. Stikkers, the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon cooperatives]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque region]] of [[Spain]] have achieved a previously unknown level of economic democracy. Established in 1956, Mondragon has since become an economic model that transcends the capitalist-socialist dichotomy and thereby helps us to imagine creative solutions to current economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stikkers|first=Kenneth W.|title=Dewey and the Mondragon Cooperatives|journal=European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy|year=2011|volume=3|series=2036-4091|issue=2|pages=195–197|url=http://lnx.journalofpragmatism.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/stikkers.pdf|accessdate=10/02/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] argues that Mondragon is an example of "a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organization of production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff]] (June 24, 2012). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon "Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way."] ''[[The Guardian]].'' Retrieved 27 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer cooperatives ====
{{Main|Consumer cooperative}}
A [[consumers' cooperative]] is owned by its customers for their [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual benefit]]. Oriented towards service rather than profit, consumers often provide capital to launch or purchase the enterprise. In practice, consumer cooperatives price goods and services at competitive market rates. The co-op returns profits to the consumer/owner according to a formula instead of paying a separate investor group.

In his book, ''From Mondragon To America'', Greg MacLeod argues that "in consumer cooperatives where the customer-members own the capital and the employees are subject to capital, the normal dynamic is the adversarial relationship of labor to capital. Sometimes the result is strikes of labor against management." In some cooperatives, however, consumer/owners are workers as well. For example, Mondragon has developed a large "hybrid" cooperative which sells groceries and furniture in Spain.

Consumer cooperatives vary in organization and operations, but typically follow the [[Rochdale Principles]]. Consumer cooperatives may also form [[Co-operative Federation]]s. These may take the form of [[Co-operative Wholesale Society|co-operative wholesale societies]], through which they collectively purchase goods at [[wholesale]] prices and, in some cases, cooperatively own factories. Alternatively, they may be members of [[Co-operative union]]s.

Consumer cooperatives are very different from "discount clubs," which charge annual fees in exchange for a discount on purchases. The club is not owned or governed by the members and profits go to investors, not to members.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer"&gt;[http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html What is a Consumer Cooperative? – Cooperative Grocer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055607/http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Food cooperatives =====
{{Main|Food cooperative}}Most food co-ops are consumer cooperatives that specialize in grocery products. Members patronize the store and vote in elections. The members elect a board of directors to make high-level decisions and recruit managers.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer" /&gt; [[Food cooperatives]] were originally established to provide fresh, [[Organic food|organic produce]] as a viable alternative to packaged imports. The ideas of local and [[slow food]] production can help local farmers prosper, in addition to providing consumers with fresher products. But the growing ubiquity of organic food products in corporate stores testifies to broadening consumer awareness, and to the dynamics of global marketing.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

For example, associated with national and international cooperative communities, Portland Oregon cooperatives manage to survive market competition with corporate franchise. As Lee Lancaster, financial manager for Food Front, states, "cooperatives are potentially one democratic economic model that could help guide business decisions toward meeting human needs while honoring the needs of society and nature". He admits, however, it is difficult to maintain collaboration among cooperatives while also avoiding integration that typically results in centralized authority.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

=== Regional trading currencies ===
According to [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]], author of New Money for Healthy Communities "The pinnacle of power in today's world is the power to issue money. If that power can be democratized and focused in a direction which gives social and ecological concerns top priority, then there may yet be hope for saving the world". In this regard, he recommended the regionalization of currencies. Cook suggested that "under the [[Bretton Woods system]], the Federal Reserve acted as the world's central bank. This gave America enormous leverage over economic policies of its principal trading partners".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook claimed that developing nations were susceptible to exploitation mainly because they have no independent monetary system, using the U.S. dollar instead. This fed the fractional reserve banking system, operated by the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan. Developing nations paid heavily for this service through market interest rates and because banking profits and property ownership emigrate to financial centers elsewhere.{{sfn|Cook, "US Immigration Crisis"|2007}}

According to Smith, "Currency is only the representation of wealth produced by combining land (resources), labor, and industrial capital". He claimed that no country was free when another country has such leverage over its entire economy. But by combining their resources, Smith claimed that developing nations have all three of these foundations of wealth:

{{quote|By peripheral nations using the currency of an imperial center as its trading currency, the imperial center can actually print money to own industry within those periphery countries. By forming regional trading blocs and printing their own trading currency, the developing world has all four requirements for production, resources, labor, industrial capital, and finance capital. The wealth produced provides the value to back the created and circulating money.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Smith further explained that developed countries need resources from the developing world as much as developing countries need finance capital and technology from the developed world. Aside from the superior military power of the imperial centers, the undeveloped world actually has superior bargaining leverage. With independent trading currencies, developing countries could barter their resources to the developed world for the latest industrial technologies. Barter avoids "hard money monopolization"{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and the unequal trade between weak and strong nations that result. Smith suggested that barter was how Germany resolved many financial difficulties "put in place to strangle her", and that "World Wars I and II settled that trade dispute". He claimed that their intentions of exclusive entitlement were clearly exposed when the imperial centers resorted to military force to prevent such barter and maintain monopoly control of others' resources.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Democratizing workplaces and distributing productive assets ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

==== The Workplace as a political entity to be democratized ====
Workplace democracy has been cited as a possible solution to the problems that arise from excluding employees from decision-making such as low-employee morale, employee alienation, and low employee engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=122513|title=An Alternative Organizational Model: Workplace Democracy|last=van der Vliet|first=Merijn|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political theorist Isabelle Ferreras argues that there exists “a great contradiction between the democratic nature of our times and the reality of the work experience.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firms as Political Entities: Saving Democracy through Economic Bicameralism|last=Ferreras|first=Isabelle|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781108245043|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the modern corporation's two basic inputs, capital and labor, are treated in radically different ways. Capital owners of a firm wield power within a system of shareholder democracy that allocates voice democratically according to how much capital investment they place in the firm. Labor, on the other hand, rarely benefits from a system to voice their concerns within the firm. She argues that firms are more than just economic organizations especially given the power that they wield over people's livelihoods, environment, and rights. Rather, Ferreras holds that firms are best understood as political entities. And as political entities “it is crucial that firms be made compatible with the democratic commitments of our nations.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Germany and to a lesser extent the broader European Union have experimented with a way of workplace democracy known as Co-determination, a system that allows workers to elect representatives that sit on the board of directors of a company. Common criticisms of workplace democracy include that democratic workplaces are less efficient than hierarchical workplace, that managers are best equipped to make company decisions since they are better educated and aware of the broader business context.

==== Creating a widespread distribution of productive assets ====
One of the biggest criticisms against capitalism is that it concentrates economic and, as a result, political power in few hands. Theorists of economic democracy have argued that one solution to this unequal concentration of power is to create mechanism that distribute ownership of productive assets across the entire population. In ''Justice as Fairness: A Restatement'', John Rawls argues that only two systems could embody the main features of his principles of justice: liberal socialism or a property-owning democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45388455|title=Justice as fairness : a restatement|last=1921-2002.|first=Rawls, John,|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Kelly, Erin.|isbn=0674005104|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=45388455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within property-owning democracy Rawls envisions widespread use of worker-owned cooperatives, partial-employee ownership of firms, systems to redistribute one's asset after death to prevent the accumulation of wealth, as well as a strong system of asset-based redistribution that encourages workers to own productive assets.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Samuel. "'Rawls and Property-Owning Democracy'." In Unpacking Rawls, edited by Nicola Riva., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating under the idea that making ownership more widespread leads to more equitable outcomes various proposals of asset-based welfare and asset-redistribution have been conceived. Individualistic and liberal asset-based welfare strategies such as the United Kingdom's Child Trust Fund of the United States Individual Development Account aimed to help people save money so that it could be invested on education, home-ownership, or entrepreneurship. More expirmental and left-leaning proposals include worker owned cooperatives, ESOPS, or Roemers coupon socialism.

== Critiques ==
[[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that ownership and control over the [[means of production]] belongs to private firms and can only be sustained by means of consumer choice, exercised daily in the marketplace.{{sfn|Mises|1953|loc=preface; p. 443}} "The capitalistic social order", he claimed, therefore "is an economic democracy in the strictest sense of the word".{{sfn|Mises|2006|p=158}} Critics of this claim point out that consumers only vote on the value of the product when they make a purchase—they are not participating in the management of firms, or voting on how the profits are to be used.

'''Flaying''', also known colloquially as [[skinning]], is a method of slow and painful execution in which [[skin]] is removed from the [[Human body|body]]. Generally, an attempt is made to keep the removed portion of skin intact.{{cn|date= October 2017}}

==Scope==
A dead animal may be flayed when preparing it to be used as human food, or for its hide or [[fur]]. This is more commonly called [[skinning]].

Flaying of humans is used as a method of [[torture]] or [[Execution (legal)|execution]], depending on how much of the skin is removed. This is often referred to as "flaying alive". There are also records of people flayed after [[death]], generally as a means of debasing the corpse of a prominent enemy or [[Crime|criminal]], sometimes related to religious beliefs (e.g. to deny an afterlife); sometimes the skin is used, again for deterrence, esotheric/ritualistic purposes, etc. (e.g. [[scalping]]).{{cn| date= October 2017}}

==Causes of death==
[[Dermatologist]] Ernst G. Jung notes that the typical causes of death due to flaying are [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], critical loss of [[blood]] or other [[body fluid]]s, [[hypothermia]], or [[infection]]s, and that the actual death is estimated to occur from a few hours up to a few days after the flaying.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LAnRRHPMmlcC&amp;pg=PA69 p.69 ''Kleine Kulturgeschichte der Haut'']. p. 69. Ernst G. Jung (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Hypothermia is possible, as skin is essential for maintaining a person's body temperature, as it provides a person's natural insulation.

==History==

=== The Assyrian tradition ===
[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Assyria]]ns flaying their prisoners alive]]
Ernst G. Jung, in his "''Kleine Kulturgeschichte der Haut''" ("A small cultural history of the skin"), provides an essay in which he outlines the [[Neo-Assyrian]] tradition of flaying human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph based on the essay "''Von Ursprung des Schindens in Assyrien''" in ''Jung'' (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAnRRHPMmlcC&amp;pg=PA67 p.67-70]&lt;/ref&gt; Already from the times of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (r. 883-859 BC), the practice is displayed and commemorated in both carvings and official royal edicts. The carvings show that the actual flaying process might begin at various places on the body, such as at the [[Crus (lower leg)|crus]] (lower leg), the [[thigh]]s, or the [[buttocks]].

In their royal edicts, the Neo-Assyrian kings seem to gloat over the terrible fate they imposed upon their captives, and that flaying seems, in particular, to be the fate meted out to rebel leaders. Jung provides some examples of this triumphant rhetoric. Here are some from Ashurnasirpal II:{{quote|I have made a pillar facing the city gate, and have flayed all the rebel leaders; I have clad the pillar in the flayed skins. I let the leaders of the conquered cities be flayed, and clad the city walls with their skins. The captives I have killed by the sword and flung on the dung heap, the little boys and girls were burnt.{{Citation needed |reason=source not clear |date=November 2016}}}} 

The Rassam Cylinder, in the British Museum demonstrates this.{{quote|Their corpses they hung on stakes, they stripped off their skins and covered the city wall with them.{{sfn|Rassam Cylinder. The British Museum.|636BC|pp=Col.1, L.52 to Col.2, L. 27}}}}

=== Other examples ===
Searing or cutting the flesh from the body was sometimes used as part of the public execution of [[Treason|traitors]] in medieval Europe. A similar mode of execution was used as late as the early 18th century in France; one such episode is graphically recounted in the opening chapter of [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1979).

In 1303, the Treasury of [[Westminster Abbey]] was robbed while holding a large sum of money belonging to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. After arrest and interrogation of 48 monks, three of them, including the [[Prior|subprior]] and [[Sacristan|sacrist]], were found guilty of the robbery and flayed. Their skin was attached to three doors as a warning against robbers of Church and State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Andrews |first1=William |title=The Church Treasury of History, Custom, Folk-Lore, etc. |date=1898 |publisher=Williams Andrews &amp; Co. |location=London|pages=158–167 |url=http://www.elfinspell.com/England/Andrews/TheChurchTreasury/HumanSkinOnChurchDoors.html |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copford]] church in Essex, England, has been found to have human skin attached to a door.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;Wall, J. Charles (1912), ''Porches and Fonts.'' Wells Gardner and Darton, London. pp. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 991 AD, during a [[Viking]] raid in England, a Danish Viking is said to have been flayed by London locals for ransacking a church. Alleged human skin found on a local church door has, for many years, been considered as proof for this legend, but a deeper analysis made during the production of the 2001 BBC documentary, ''Blood of the Vikings'', came to the conclusion that the preserved skin came from a cow hide and was part of a 19th-century hoax.
* [[Pierre Basile]] was flayed alive and all defenders of the chateau [[hanging|hanged]] on 6 April 1199, by order of the mercenary leader [[Mercadier]], for shooting and killing [[monarch|King]] [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] of [[England]] with a [[crossbow]] at the siege of [[Châlus]], in March 1199.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Mercadier |volume=18 |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1314, the brothers d'Aulnoy, who were lovers of the daughters-in-law of king [[Philip IV of France]], were flayed alive, then [[castrated]] and beheaded, and their bodies were exposed on a [[gibbet]] (''[[Tour de Nesle Affair]]''). The extreme severity of their punishment was due to the ''[[lèse majesté]]'' nature of the crime. 
* In 1404 or 1417, the [[Hurufi]] Imad ud-Din [[Nesîmî]], an [[Islam]]ic poet of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] extraction, was flayed alive, apparently on orders of a [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] governor, and for [[heresy]].
*In August 1571, [[Marcantonio Bragadin]], a defeated [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] commander, was flayed to death by the [[Ottomans]], causing enormous outrage in Venice and perhaps inspiring [[Titian]]'s ''[[Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)|Flaying of Marsyas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2003/agosto/17/fine_Marsia_secondo_Tiziano_co_0_030817072.shtml |author=Mariotti, Giovanni |title=La fine di Marsia secondo Tiziano|website=[[Il Corriere della Sera]]|date= 17 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the year 1689, Aurangzeb captured [[Sambhaji]], the second ruler of the [[Maratha kingdom]]. He was ordered to bow before [[Aurangzeb]] and convert to Islam. It was his refusal to do so, Aurangzeb brutally tortured Sambhaji for more than 40 days where his skin was flayed along with other tortures before he was finally killed.
* The Rawhide Valley in [[Wyoming]] is said to have acquired its name from a white settler who was flayed alive there for murdering a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] woman.{{cn|date=January 2018}}
* In [[Marcel Ophüls]]' documentary, ''[[Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie]]'', the daughter of a [[French Resistance]] leader claims her father was tortured, including being flayed, by [[Klaus Barbie]] during his time at [[Lyon]], 1942-44.
* In 1957, a victim of [[Ed Gein]] was found "[[Field dressing (hunting)|dressed out]] like a deer". His story fueled the inspiration of movie characters of Norman Bates (Psycho), [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Jame Gumb "Buffalo Bill"]] (The Silence of the Lambs) and Leatherface (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre).

===Fictional===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6565">A '''functional response''' in [[ecology]] is the intake rate of a [[heterotroph|consumer]] as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of [[food density]] (the amount of food available in a given [[ecotope]]). It is associated with the [[numerical response]], which is the [[reproduction]] rate of a consumer as a function of food density. Following [[C. S. Holling]], functional responses are generally classified into three types, which are called Holling's type I, II, and III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last1=Holling |first1=C. S. |title=The components of [[predation]] as revealed by a study of small-[[mammal]] predation of the European pine sawfly |journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=91 |issue=5 |date=May 1959 |pages=293–320 |doi=10.4039/Ent91293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FunctionalResponsesGraph.svg|thumb|300px|right|Types I, II, and III functional responses]]

== Type I ==

Type I functional response assumes a linear increase in intake rate with food density, either for all food densities, or only for food densities up to a maximum, beyond which the intake rate is constant. The linear increase assumes that the time needed by the consumer to process a food item is negligible, or that consuming food does not interfere with searching for food. A functional response of type I is used in the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra]] predator–prey model. It was the first kind of functional response described and is also the simplest of the three functional responses currently detailed.

== Type II ==

Type II functional response is characterized by a decelerating intake rate, which follows from the assumption that the consumer is limited by its capacity to process food. Type II functional response is often modeled by a [[rectangular hyperbola]], for instance as by Holling's disc equation,&lt;ref name="Holling59b"&gt;{{cite article|last1=Holling|first1=C. S.|title=Some characteristics of simple types of predation and parasitism|journal=The Canadian Entomologist|volume=91|issue=7| date=July 1959 |pages=385&amp;ndash;98|doi=10.4039/Ent91385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which assumes that processing of food and searching for food are mutually exclusive behaviors. The equation is
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align} 
f(R) &amp;= \frac{a R}{1 + a h R}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Wolves killing caribou.png|thumb|upright=1.2|''Wolves killing Caribou'', by [[Arthur Robert Harding]], 1909. If the number of [[wolf|wolves]] is held constant, the number of [[caribou]] killed increases, then levels off.&lt;ref name=Dale1994/&gt;]]

where ''f'' denotes intake rate and ''R'' denotes food (or resource) density. The rate at which the consumer encounters food items per unit of food density is called the attack rate, ''a''. The average time spent on processing a food item is called the handling time, ''h''. Similar equations are the [[Monod equation]] for the growth of [[microorganism]]s and the [[Michaelis–Menten equation]] for the rate of enzymatic reactions. 

In an example with [[wolves]] and [[caribou]], as the number of caribou increases while holding wolves constant, the number of caribou kills increases and then levels off. This is because the proportion of caribou killed per wolf decreases as caribou density increases. The higher the density of caribou, the smaller the proportion of caribou killed per wolf. Explained slightly differently, at very high caribou densities, wolves need very little time to find prey and spend almost all their time handling prey and very little time searching. Wolves are then satiated and the total number of caribou kills reaches a plateau.&lt;ref name=Dale1994&gt;{{cite article |last1=Dale |first1=Bruce W. |first2=Layne G. |last2=Adams |first3=R. Terry |last3=Bowyer |title=Functional Response of Wolves Preying on Barren-Ground Caribou in a Multiple-Prey Ecosystem |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=63 |year=1994 |pages=644–652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type III ==
Type III functional response is similar to type II in that at high levels of prey density, saturation occurs.  But now, at low prey density levels, the graphical relationship of number of prey consumed and the density of the prey population is a more than linearly increasing function of prey consumed by predators.  This accelerating function is largely descriptive, and often justified by learning time, prey switching, or a combination of both phenomena, but the type III functional response lacks the rigorous theoretical underpinning of the type II functional response. 

Learning time is defined as the natural improvement of a predator’s searching and attacking efficiency or the natural improvement in their handling efficiency as prey density increases.  Imagine a prey density so small that the chance of a predator encountering that prey is extremely low.  Because the predator finds prey so infrequently, it has not had enough experience to develop the best ways to capture and subdue that species of prey.  Holling identified this mechanism in [[shrews]] and [[deer mice]] feeding on [[sawflies]].  At low numbers of sawfly cocoons per acre, deer mice especially experienced exponential growth in terms of the number of cocoons consumed per individual as the density of cocoons increased.  The characteristic saturation point of the type III functional response was also observed in the deer mice.  At a certain density of cocoons per acre, the consumption rate of the deer mice reached a saturation amount as the cocoon density continued to increase.&lt;ref name="Holling59b"/&gt;

Prey switching involves two or more prey species and one predator species.  When all prey species are at equal prey densities, the predator will indiscriminately select between prey species.  However, if the density of one of the prey species decreases, then the predator will start selecting the other, more common prey species with a higher frequency.  Murdoch demonstrated this effect with [[guppy]] preying on tubificids and [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]]. As fruit fly numbers decreased guppies switched from feeding on the fruit flies on the water’s surface to feeding on the more abundant tubificids along the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Murdoch|first1=William W.|title=Stabilizing effects of spatial heterogeneity in predator-prey systems|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=11|year=1977|pages=252&amp;ndash;73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greed''', or '''avarice''', is an inordinate or insatiable longing for material gain, be it [[food]], [[wealth|money]], [[Social status|status]], or [[Power (social and political)|power]].

As a secular psychological concept, greed is an inordinate [[desire (emotion)|desire]] to acquire or possess more than one needs. The degree of inordinance is related to the inability to control the reformulation of "wants" once desired "needs" are eliminated. [[Erich Fromm]] described greed as "a bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever reaching satisfaction." It is typically used to criticize those who seek excessive material wealth, although it may apply to the need to feel more [[self-righteousness|excessively moral]], [[popularity|social]], or otherwise [[narcissism|better than]] someone else.

The purpose for greed, and any actions associated with it, is possibly to deprive others of potential means (perhaps, of basic survival and comfort) or future opportunities accordingly, or to obstruct them therefrom, thus insidious and [[Tyranny|tyrannical]] or otherwise having a negative connotation. Alternately, the purpose could be defense or counteraction from such dangerous, potential negotiation in matters of questionable agreeability. A consequence of greedy activity may be an inability to sustain any of the [[cost]]s or burdens associated with that which has been or is being accumulated, leading to a [[Back-fire|backfire]] or destruction, whether of self or more generally. So, the level of "inordinance" of greed pertains to the amount of [[vanity]], [[Malice (law)|malice]] or burden associated with it.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] says that greed "is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."&lt;ref name="st3118"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3118.htm |publisher=New Advent |author=Thomas Aquinas |title=The Summa Theologica II-II.Q118 (The vices opposed to liberality, and in the first place, of covetousness) |edition=1920, Second and Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|A1}} In Dante's ''[[Purgatorio|Purgatory]]'', the avaricious penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated too much on earthly thoughts.


[[Meher Baba]] dictated that "Greed is a state of restlessness of the heart, and it consists mainly of craving for power and possessions. Possessions and power are sought for the fulfillment of desires. Man is only partially satisfied in his attempt to have the fulfillment of his desires, and this partial satisfaction fans and increases the flame of craving instead of extinguishing it. Thus greed always finds an endless field of conquest and leaves the man endlessly dissatisfied. The chief expressions of greed are related to the emotional part of man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses.'' Volume II. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Boesky]] famously defended greed in an 18 May 1986 commencement address at the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]'s [[Haas School of Business|School of Business]] Administration, in which he said, "Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself".&lt;ref name="Gabriel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gabriel |first=Satya J |title=Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street'' and the Market for Corporate Control |work=Economics in Popular Film |publisher=Mount Holyoke |date=November 21, 2001 |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/sgabriel/filmcourse/oliver_stone.html |accessdate=2008-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This speech inspired the 1987 film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', which features the famous line spoken by [[Gordon Gekko]]: "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind."&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ross |first=Brian |title=Greed on Wall Street |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher= |date=November 11, 2005 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=1305010 |accessdate=2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inspirations ==
[[Scavenging]] and [[hoarding]] of materials or objects, theft and [[robbery]], especially by means of violence, trickery, or manipulation of [[authority]] are all actions that may be inspired by greed. Such misdeeds can include [[simony]], where one profits from soliciting goods within the actual confines of a church.
A well-known example of greed is the pirate [[Hendrick Lucifer]], who fought for hours to acquire Cuban gold, becoming mortally wounded in the process. He died of his wounds hours after having transferred the booty to his ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dream-the-impossible.blogspot.com/2009/01/greed-is-good-discuss.html |title=Examples of greed |author=Dreamtheimpossible |date=September 14, 2011 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118071652/http://dream-the-impossible.blogspot.com/2009/01/greed-is-good-discuss.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
Some research suggests there is a genetic basis for greed. It is possible people who have a shorter version of the [[ruthlessness gene]] (AVPR1a) may behave more selfishly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080404/full/news.2008.738.html 'Ruthlessness gene' discovered]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human Rights Day''' is celebrated annually across the world on 10 December every year.

The date was chosen to honour the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s adoption and proclamation, on 10 December 1948, of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first global enunciation of [[human rights]] and one of the first major achievements of the new [[United Nations]]. The formal establishment of Human Rights Day occurred at the 317th Plenary Meeting of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] on 4 December 1950, when the General Assembly declared resolution 423(V), inviting all member states and any other interested organizations to celebrate the day as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A/RES/423(V) |session=5 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |resolution_number=423(V) |url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&amp;DS=A/RES/423(V)&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=RESOLUTION |accessdate=29 October 2009 |date=4 December 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HumanRightsDay.aspx |title=The History of Human Rights Day |accessdate=29 October 2009 |author=Office of the High Commission for Human Rights |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day is normally marked both by high-level political conferences and meetings and by cultural events and exhibitions dealing with human rights issues. In addition it is traditionally on 10 December that the five-yearly [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] are awarded. Many [[international organization|governmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]] active in the human rights field also schedule special events to commemorate the day, as do many civil and social-cause organizations.

==History==
[[File:Turkish journalists protesting imprisonment of their colleagues in 2016.jpg|thumb|Turkish journalists protesting [[Turkey's media purge after the failed July 2016 coup d'état|imprisonment]] of their colleagues, 10 December 2016]]
Human Rights Day is the day in 1948 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ibtimes.co.in/human-rights-day-best-quotes-by-famous-personalities-mark-un-day-658792|title = Human Rights Day: Best Quotes By Famous Personalities to Mark UN Day|last = James|first = Anu|date = 9 December 2015|work = International Business Times|access-date = 9 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal inception of Human Rights Day dates from 1950, after the Assembly passed resolution 423(V) inviting all States and interested organizations to adopt 10 December of each year as Human Rights Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Human Rights|last = Lawson|first = Edward|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|year = 1996|isbn = 9781560323624|location = |pages = 722–724|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J-SrdFtSuDUC&amp;lpg=PA723&amp;dq=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;pg=PA723#v=onepage&amp;q=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;f=false|edition = 2nd|others = Research and contributing editor, Jan K. Dargel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the day can be shown by the fact that the commemorative Human Rights Day stamp issued by the [[United Nations Postal Administration]] in 1952, received approximately 200,000 advance orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = United Nations and Human Rights|last = Green|first = James Frederick|publisher = The Brookings Institution|year = 1956|isbn = |location = |pages = 676|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wI58IE-n4H0C&amp;lpg=PA676&amp;dq=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;pg=PA676#v=onepage&amp;q=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the General Assembly adopted the Declaration, with 48 states in favor and eight abstentions, it was proclaimed as a "common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations", towards which individuals and societies should "strive by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance". The measure was received by both advocates and critics alike as "being more declarative than legislative, more suggestive than binding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Rights in the Twentieth Century|last = Cohen|first = G. Daniel|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780521194266|location = |pages = 49–50|editor-last = Hoffmann|editor-first = Stefan-Ludwig|chapter = The 'Human Rights Revolution' at Work: Displaced Persons in Postwar Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Declaration with its broad range of [[civil and political rights|political, civil]], [[economic, social and cultural rights]] is not a binding document, it inspired more than 60 human rights instruments which together constitute an international standard of human rights. Today the general consent of all United Nations Member States on the basic Human Rights laid down in the Declaration makes it even stronger and emphasizes the relevance of Human Rights in our{{who|date=December 2017}} daily lives.{{according to whom|date=December 2017}}

The High Commissioner for Human Rights, as the main United Nations rights official, and his Office play a major role in coordinating efforts for the yearly observation of Human Rights Day:

{{quote|Today, poverty prevails as the gravest human rights challenge in the world. Combating poverty, deprivation and exclusion is not a matter of charity, and it does not depend on how rich a country is. By tackling poverty as a matter of human rights obligation, the world will have a better chance of abolishing this scourge in our lifetime... [[poverty reduction|Poverty eradication]] is an achievable goal.|[[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Louise Arbour]], 10 December 2006}}

The 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights occurred on 10 December 2008, and the UN Secretary-General launched a year-long campaign leading up to this anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/udhr60/|title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: 1948–2008|date = 2008|accessdate = 9 December 2015|website = United Nations|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the UDHR holds the world record as the most translated document (except for the Bible), organizations around the globe used the year to focus on helping people everywhere learn about their rights.

On 9 December 2001, [[United States President|President]] [[George W.

{{History of the Jews in England}}

Around the start of the 19th century, various factors led to a more positive image of the [[Jews]] in England. As the century went on, [[German Jews|Jews of German origin]] acquired greater social status. Despite powerful opposition, there was a gradual move towards [[Religious intolerance#Historical perspectives|religious toleration]] and full [[civil rights]] for the Jews. 

==Improvement of Jewish relations==

One reason for an improvement in the public image of the Jews at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th can be found in positive attitudes towards Jewish [[pugilist]]s. A further cause for kindlier feeling on the part of at least the [[middle class]]es of [[England|Englishmen]] toward the Jews was supplied by the revival of [[Religious conversion|conversionist]] hopes at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Misled doubtless by the tendency to desertion shown by not a few of the [[Sephardim]], many [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians anticipated the conversion ''en masse'' of the Jewish population, and on the initiative of [[Lewis Way]] the [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|London Society for the Promotion of Christianity Among the Jews]] was founded in 1809. This and kindred societies wasted large sums of money with indifferent results but, politically, they helped to increase sympathy for the Jews among the [[non-conformist]]s, who formed the bulk of their contributors and were at the same time becoming a leading factor in the formation of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] policy.

==British Israelism==
Similarly, at a much later period the craze of [[British Israelism]] made many of the narrower [[Bible Christian]]s more sympathetic toward the Jews. On the other hand, the great influence of Dr. [[Thomas Arnold]] in the Liberal ranks was ultimately directed against the Jewish hopes. The more [[Erastian]] he was, the more he desired to see the legislature exclusively Christian.

==Rise of German Jewish community==
In the meanwhile the lead among the English Jews was passing from the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish]] to the [[Ashkenazi Jews|German]] section of the community. The bankers Goldsmid acquired both influence and culture, and their efforts to raise the community were soon to be supplemented by those of [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan Rothschild]], the ablest of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Mayer Rothschild]]'s sons, who had settled first in [[Manchester]] and afterward in [[London]]. The times were in a measure propitious for a new effort to remove the civil [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] of the Jews. The example of [[France]] had not been without its effect. The rising tide in favour of religious liberty, as applied to dissenters generally and to [[Roman Catholic]]s in particular, might have been expected to carry with it more favourable conditions for the Jews; but a long struggle was to intervene before "Englishmen of the Jewish persuasion" were to have equal [[rights]] with other Englishmen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6828">'''Interlocus contest evolution''' (ICE) is a process of intergenomic conflict by which different [[locus (genetics)|loci]] within a single [[genome]] antagonistically [[coevolution|coevolve]]. ICE supposes that the [[Red Queen hypothesis|Red Queen process]], which is characterized by a never-ending antagonistic [[evolutionary arms race]], does not only apply to [[species]] but also to [[gene]]s within the genome of a species.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"&gt;Rice &amp; Holland, 1997. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brett_Holland/publication/227329481_The_enemies_within_Intergenomic_conflict_interlocus_contest_evolution_ICE_and_the_intraspecific_Red_Queen/links/0c960520406849c122000000.pdf The enemies within: intergenomic conflict, interlocus contest evolution (ICE), and the intraspecific Red Queen]." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 41(1): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[genetic recombination|sexual recombination]] allows different gene loci to evolve semi-autonomously, genes have the potential to coevolve antagonistically. ICE occurs when "an allelic substitution at one locus selects for a new allele at the interacting locus, and vice versa." As a result, ICE can lead to a chain reaction of perpetual gene substitution at antagonistically interacting loci, and no stable equilibrium can be achieved. The rate of evolution thus increases at that locus.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

ICE is thought to be the dominant mode of evolution for genes controlling social behavior.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt; The ICE process can explain many biological phenomena, including intersexual conflict, [[parent offspring conflict]], and interference competition.

==Intersexual conflict==
{{main|Interlocus sexual conflict}}
A fundamental conflict between the sexes lies in differences in investment: males generally invest predominantly in fertilization while females invest predominantly in offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, AJ. 1948. “[http://www2.nau.edu/~shuster/shustercourses/BIO%20698/Literature/Bateman1948.pdf Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila].” Heredity 2: 349-368.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict manifests itself in many traits associated with [[sexual reproduction]]. Genes expressed in only one sex are selectively neutral in the other sex; male- and female-linked genes can therefore be acted upon separated by selection and will evolve semi-autonomously.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt; Thus, one sex of a species may evolve to better itself rather than better the species as a whole, sometimes with negative results for the opposite sex: loci will antagonistically coevolve to enhance male reproductive success at females’ expense on the one hand, and to enhance female resistance to male coercion on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R.L. 1972. "[http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf Parental investment and sexual selection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025739/http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}." Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man, 1871–1971. Campbell, Aldine Publishing. 136–179.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of [[intralocus sexual conflict]], and is unlikely to be resolved fully throughout the genome. However, in some cases this conflict may be resolved by the restriction of the gene’s expression to only the sex that it benefits, resulting in [[sexual dimorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonduriansky, R, SF Chenoweth. 2009. "Intralocus sexual conflict." Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 24(5): 280-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICE theory can explain the differentiation of the human [[X chromosome|X-]] and [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosomes]]. Semi-autonomous evolution may have promoted genes beneficial to females in the X-chromosome even when detrimental to males, and genes beneficial to males in the Y-chromosome, even when detrimental to females. As the distribution of the X-chromosome is three times as large as the Y-chromosome (the X-chromosome occurs in 3/4 of offspring genes, while the Y-chromosome occurs in only 1/4), the Y-chromosome has a reduced opportunity for rapid evolution. Thus the Y-chromosome has "shed" its genes to leave only the essential ones (such as the [[Testis determining factor|SRY gene]]), which gives rise to the differences in the X- and Y-chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, M. 2000. Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters. Harper and Collins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parent–offspring conflict==
A father, mother and offspring may differ in the optimal resource allocation to the offspring. This co-evolutionary conflict can be considered in the context of ICE. Selection will favor genes in the male to maximize female investment in the current offspring, no matter the consequences to the female's reproduction later in life, while selection will favor genes in the female that increase her overall lifetime [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Genes expressed in the offspring will be selected to produce an intermediary level of resource allocation between the male-benefit and female-benefit loci. This three-way conflict again occurs when parents feed their offspring, as the optimum feeding rate and optimum point in time to discontinue feeding differ between father, mother and offspring.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

==Interference competition==
ICE can also explain the theory of [[interference competition]], which is most likely to be associated with opposing sets of genes that determine the outcome of [[competition]] between individuals. Different sets of genes may code for signal or receiver [[phenotype]]s, such as in the context of [[Deimatic behavior|threat displays]]: when a competing male can win more contests by intimidation, rather than by fighting, selection will favor the accumulation of deceitful genes that may not be honest indicators of the male’s fighting capability.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

For example, primitive male [[elephant seal]]s may have used the lowest frequencies in the threat call of a rival as an indication of body size. The elephant seal's enormous nose may have evolved as a resonating device to amplify low frequencies,&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, GA, NE Collias. 1962. "The role of vocalization in the social behaviour of the northern elephant seal." Animal Behaviour 10(1): 7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating selection that favors the production of low-frequency threat vocalizations. However, this counter-selects for receptor systems that provide an increased threshold required for intimidation, which in turn selects for deeper threat vocalizations. The rapid divergence of threat displays among closely related species provides further evidence in support of the co-evolutionary arms race within the genome of a single species, driven by the ICE process.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

'''Krogh's principle''' states that "for such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied." This concept is central to those disciplines of [[biology]] that rely on the [[comparative method]], such as [[neuroethology]], [[comparative physiology]], and more recently [[functional genomics]].

==History==
Krogh's principle is named after the Danish physiologist [[August Krogh]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] for his contributions to understanding the anatomy and physiology of the [[capillary|capillary system]], who described it in The American Journal of Physiology in 1929.   However, the principle was first elucidated nearly 60 years prior to this, and in almost the same words as Krogh, in 1865 by [[Claude Bernard]], the French instigator of experimental medicine, on page 27 of his "Introduction à l'étude de la médecine expérimentale":
{{quote|

Dans l'investigation scientifique, les moindres procédés sont de la plus haute importance. '''Le choix heureux d'un animal''', d'un instrument construit d'une certaine façon, l'emploi d'un réactif au lieu d'un autre, suffisent souvent pour résoudre les questions générales les plus élevées.

Claude Bernard: ''Introduction à l'étude de la médecine expérimentale'', J.B. Baillière et Fils, Libraires de L'Académie Impériale de Médecine, 1865. pp. 400}}

Krogh wrote the following in his 1929 treatise on the then current 'status' of physiology (emphasis added):
{{quote|

...I want to emphasize that the route by which we can strive toward the ideal is by a study of the vital functions in all their aspects throughout the myriads of [[organism]]s. We may find out, nay, we will find out before very long the essential mechanisms of [[mammal]]ian [[renal function|kidney function]], but the general problem of [[excretion]] can be solved only when excretory [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s are studied wherever we find them and in all their essential modifications. Such studies will be sure, moreover, to expand and deepen our insight into problems of the [[human]] [[kidney]] and will prove of value also from the narrowest [[utilitarian]] point of view.

'''For such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be most conveniently studied'''.  Many years ago when my teacher, [[Christian Bohr]], was interested in the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] mechanism of the [[lung]] and devised the method of studying the exchange through each lung separately, he found that a certain kind of [[tortoise]] possessed a [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] dividing into the main [[bronchus|bronchi]] high up in the neck, and we used to say as a laboratory joke that this animal had been created expressly for the purposes of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration physiology]].  I have no doubt that there is quite a number of animals which are similarly "created" for special [[physiology|physiological]] purposes, but I am afraid that most of them are unknown to the men for whom they were "created," and we must apply to the [[zoologist]]s to find them and lay our hands on them."

August Krogh ''The Progress of Physiology'', The American Journal of Physiology, 1929. 90(2) pp. 243-251}}

"Krogh's principle" was not utilized as a formal term until 1975 when the biochemist [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] (who initially described the [[Citric Acid Cycle]]), first referred to it.

More recently, at the International Society for Neuroethology meeting in [[Nyborg]], [[Denmark]] in 2004, Krogh's principle was cited as a central principle by the group at their 7th Congress.  Krogh's principle has also been receiving attention in the area of [[functional genomics]], where there has been increasing pressure and desire to expand genomics research to a more wide variety of organisms beyond the traditional scope of the field.

==Philosophy and applications==
A central concept to Krogh's principle is evolutionary adaptation.  Evolutionary theory maintains that organisms are suited to particular [[Ecological niche|niches]], some of which are highly specialized for solving particular biological problems.  These adaptations are typically exploited by biologists in several ways:

[[Image:Thermus aquaticus.JPG|thumb|''Thermus aquaticus'']]
*'''Methodology''': (e.g. [[Taq polymerase]] and [[PCR]]): The need to manipulate biological systems in the laboratory has driven the use of an organismal specialization.  One example of Krogh's principle presents itself in the heavily used [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR), a method which relies on the rapid exposure of [[DNA]] to high heat for amplification of particular sequences of interest.  [[DNA polymerase]] [[enzyme]] from many organisms would denature at high temperatures, however, to solve this problem, Chien and colleagues turned to ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'', a strain of bacteria native to [[hydrothermal vent]]s.  ''Thermus aquaticus'' has a polymerase that is heat stable at temperatures necessary for PCR.  Biochemically modified Taq polymerase, as it is usually called, is now routinely used in PCR applications.
*'''Overcoming technical limitations''': (e.g. large  [[neuron]]s in [[Mollusca]]):  Two Nobel Prize–winning bodies of study were facilitated by using ideas central to Krogh's principle to overcome technical limitations in [[nervous system]] physiology.  The [[ion channel|ionic basis]] of the [[action potential]] was elucidated in the [[squid giant axon]] in 1958 by [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], developers of the original [[voltage clamp]] device and co-recipients of the 1963 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].  The voltage clamp is now a central piece of technology in modern [[neurophysiology]], but was only possible to develop using the wide diameter of the squid giant axon.  Another marine mollusc, the [[opisthobranch]] [[Aplysia]] possesses relatively small number of large [[nerve cell]]s that are easily identified and mapped from individual to individual.  Aplysia was selected for these reasons for the study of the cellular and molecular basis of learning and memory which led to [[Eric Kandel]]'s receipt of the Nobel Prize in 2000.

[[Image:Tyto alba close up.jpg|thumb|''Tyto alba'', the Barn Owl]]
*'''Understanding more complex/subtle systems''' (e.g. [[Barn owls]] and [[sound localization]]):  Beyond overcoming technical limitations, Krogh's principle has particularly important implications in the light of [[convergent evolution]] and [[homology (biology)|homology]].  Either because of evolutionary history, or particular constraints on a given niche, there are not infinite solutions to all biological problems.  Instead, organisms utilize similar neural algorithms, behaviors, or even structures to accomplish similar tasks.  If one's goal is to understand how the nervous system might localize objects using sound, one may take the approach of using an [[auditory system|auditory]] 'specialist' such as the barn owl studied by [[Masakazu Konishi|Mark Konishi]], [[Eric Knudsen]] and their colleagues.  A [[nocturnal]] [[predator]] by nature, the barn owl relies heavily on using precise information on the time of arrival of sound in its ears.  The information gleaned from this approach has contributed heavily to our understanding of how the brain maps sensory space, and how nervous systems encode timing information.

Most investigators accept the definition of '''language intensity''' proposed by John Waite Bowers:&lt;ref&gt;http://comm.colorado.edu/bowersj/; (1963), p. 345; 1964, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; a quality of language that "indicates the degree to which the speaker's attitude toward a concept deviates from neutrality." Intensity as a [[lexical variable]] in [[communication studies]] has generated extensive empirical research.

==Theoretical setting==
A theory proposed by Bradac, Bowers, and Courtright (1979, 1980) asserts causal relationships among intensity and a number of other psychological, social, and communication variables. An experimental study by Hamilton, Hunter, and Burgoon (1990) generally supports the relationships proposed by the theory at least in the limited domain of persuasion.
 
Intensity has been related to:
* Other message variables including [[verbal immediacy]], [[lexical diversity]] (Bowers, 2006; Bradac, Bowers, &amp; Courtright, 1979, 1980), [[message style]] (Burgoon &amp; Miller, 1971), and [[verbal aggressiveness]] (Greenberg, 1976)
* Psychological variables such as [[cognitive stress]] (Bradac, Konsky, &amp; Elliott, 1976; Burgoon &amp; Miller, 1971; Daly &amp; Miller, 1975; Franzwa, 1969; Osgood &amp; Walker, 1975), arousal (Bowers, 1963; Carmichael &amp; Cronkhite, 1965), and need for approval (Basehart, 1971)
* Attributional variables including attributions of [[source internality]] (Bradac, Hosman, &amp; Tardy, 1978; Rotter, 1966), attributions of [[source competence]] (Burgoon, Jones, &amp; Stewart, 1975; Infante, 1975; McEwen &amp; Greenberg, 1970; Mehrley &amp; McCroskey, 1970; Miller &amp; Basehart, 1969; Miller &amp; Lobe, 1967), and attributions of source similarity with audience (Bourhis, Giles, &amp; Taajfel, 1973; McEwen &amp; Greenberg, 1970; Miller &amp; Basehart, 1969; Wheeless, 1978)
* Speaker–audience attitudinal [[congruence relation|congruency]] and [[discrepancy function|discrepancy]] (Infante, 1975; McEwen &amp; Greenberg, 1970; Mehrley &amp; McCroskey, 1970)
* Credibility of message sources and of messages (Bowers, 1963; Burgoon, Jones, &amp; Stewart, 1975; Miller &amp; Basehart, 1969; Miller &amp; Lobe, 1967)
* Information processing (Badzinski, 1989)
* Practical variables such as [[response rate (survey)|response rate]] in [[e-mail survey]]s (Anderson &amp; Blackburn, 2004) and family interventions protecting children from ultraviolet radiation (Buller, Burgoon, Hall, Levine, Taylor, Beach, Melcher, Buller, Bowen, Hunsaker, &amp; Bergen, 2000)

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons at least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain, for each category, the first fifteen cases with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and at least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and at least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.
The separate articles for the different categories have more extensive lists.

''Only the first 15 entries are shown here. For the entire list see:'' [[List of rampage killers (home intruders)]], [[List of familicides]], [[List of familicides in the United States]] and [[List of familicides in Europe]].

This section contains cases that could be considered non-public, which means mass murders perpetrated in a domestic environment. The section is divided into two sub-categories; the first encompasses the lists of familicides and contains those incidents where most of the victims were relatives of the perpetrator, while the second, paraphrased as home intruders, contains those cases where the targeted families were not related to the perpetrator.

==Vehicular homicide==
''Only the first 15 entries are shown here. For the entire list see:'' [[List of rampage killers (vehicular homicide)]] &lt;br&gt;
This section contains those cases where only vehicles were [[Vehicle-ramming attack|used to attack people]]. Since it may be quite difficult to distinguish accidents, or cases of reckless driving from those incidents where the driver, or pilot, had the intention to harm others, only those cases are included where it is clear that the vehicle was applied as a weapon and crashed deliberately into people, other vehicles, or buildings. Also, those cases where a rampage killer used an armed vehicle, such as a tank, or a fighter aircraft, to shoot others are listed here. [[Airliner]]s are not included in this section but in [[List of rampage killers#Other incidents|other incidents]].

==Mass murders committed using grenades==
''Only the first 15 entries are shown here. For the entire list see:'' [[List of rampage killers (mass murders committed using grenades)]] &lt;br&gt;
This section lists mass murders where the perpetrator used only [[hand grenade]]s or comparable explosive devices, like [[pipe bomb]]s or [[dynamite]] sticks, for the attack. As it is sometimes difficult to distinguish cases of grenade attacks from acts of terrorism or gang-related attacks, incidents are only included where there is at least some indication that it was neither committed in the context of a political, ethnic, or religious conflict, nor part of an assault with more than one participating offender.

[[File:Koeln wrm 1044.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Prometheus]] tortured ([[Jacob Jordaens]], 1640)]]

'''''Lucifer and Prometheus''''' is a work of [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychological literary criticism]] written by [[R.J. Zwi Werblowsky]] and published in 1952. In it, Werblowsky argues that the [[Satan]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For Werblowsky's purposes, the names "Satan" and "[[Lucifer]]" are used more or less interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' became a disproportionately appealing character because of attributes he shares with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]]. It has been called "most illuminating" for its historical and typological perspective on Milton's Satan as embodying both positive and negative values.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Bausani, "Islam in the History of Religions," ''Problems and Methods of the History of Religions'' (Brill, 1972), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also been significant in pointing out the essential ambiguity of Prometheus and his dual Christ-like/Satanic nature as developed in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliahu G. Stroumsa, "Myth into Metaphor: The Case of Prometheus," ''Gilgul: Essays on Transformation, Revolution and Permanence in the History of Religions'' (Brill, 1987), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Werblowsky uses the terminology of [[Carl Jung]] and [[Analytical psychology|his school]] in examining "mythological projections of [[Psyche (psychology)|the human ''psyche'']]", though he emphasizes that he is not interested in the concept of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]] in the strict Jungian sense. Rather, he sees the myth of figures such as Satan and Prometheus as expressing "the shortcomings … of the world as conceived by the human soul." The relation of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and [[civilization]] is explored through the interaction of the concepts of [[Old Testament]] [[sin]] and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] ''[[hubris]]''. In this analysis, Satan "becomes the sole power-exponent in this [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar]], [[Fall of Man|post-lapsarian]] but pre-[[eschatology|eschatological]] universe, and thus stands as the prototype of human civilizing effort."

Werblowsky sets out to explore "the [[hero]]ic at its limits", and makes explicit the motivating factor of [[World War II]] and its horrors in undertaking this study:

{{cquote|The [[The Beast (Bible)|apocalyptic beast let loose]] has become a reality to our generation, and nobody knows what is still ahead of us. It is understandable therefore that books on the [[devil]] have been on the increase lately. … If the attempts of this school have not yet borne much fruit, it is because we fear the devil's sight more than his activity, and because of a very understandable reticence to force open our 'whited sepulchres.'&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "whited sepulchres" is an allusion to {{bibleverse||Matthew|23:27}}; it is used also in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Lucifer and Prometheus'' was one of 204 volumes in [[The International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method]] series published 1910–1965 and including titles from Jung, [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Erich Fromm]] and others. It was Werblowsky's first published book.&lt;ref&gt;Stroumsa, "Myth into Metaphor'', p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; This volume was reissued in 1999 by Routledge. It includes an introduction written by Jung.

[[File:Chester_Brown_(2016)_Mary_Wept_Over_the_Feet_of_Jesus_(cover).jpg|thumb|''Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus'', [[Chester Brown]], 2016, 270&amp;nbsp;pages]]
'''''Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus''''' is a [[graphic novel]] by Canadian cartoonist [[Chester Brown]], published in 2016.  The book is subtitled '''''Prostitution and Religious Obedience in the Bible''''', and is made up of adaptations of stories from the Bible that Brown believes promote pro-prostitution attitudes among early Christians, and argues for the decriminalization of prostitution.{{sfn|Donachie|2016}}

==Background==

{{Empty section|date=January 2018}}

==Content==

As in his previous graphic novel ''[[Paying for It]]'' (2011), Brown takes a pro-prostitution stance in ''Mary Wept Over the Feet of Jesus''.  He declares his research has determined that [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was a prostitute, that early Christians practised prostitution, and that Jesus' [[parable of the talents or minas|Parable of the Talents]] should be read in a pro-prostitution light.  Brown describes himself as a Christian who is "not at all concerned with imposing 'moral' values or religious laws on others" and believes that Biblical figures such as [[Cain and Abel|Abel]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] "find favour with God because they oppose his will or challenge him in some way".{{sfn|Lehoczky|2016}}

Brown adapts the stories or portions of stories of [[Cain and Abel]], Tamar, [[Rahab]], [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], [[Bathsheba]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], the [[Parable of the talents or minas|Parable of the talents]], [[Mary of Bethany]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]].{{sfn|Brown|2016}}  Handwritten appendices make up the final third of the book, including commentary on the comics, a 55-title bibliography,{{sfn|Lehoczky|2016}} and a 20-page comics adaptation of the [[Book of Job]].{{sfn|Hatfield|2016}}

==Analysis==

{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}

Brown lays out the simple, precise artwork in a fixed grid of four panels to a page.  The dialogue is plain and direct.  The cover features a vagina-shaped frame into which Brown incorporates two smiling snakes and an open book, from which red drops fall.{{sfn|Brown|2016}}

In the book's appendices, Brown puts forth his interpretations of the stories.  He argues that prostitution had an honorable place in Biblical society, and that Matthew left clues in his narrative that Mary was a prostitute.  Brown details facts from his research that coloured his interpretations, such as that ''feet'' was used as a euphemism for "penis".  He also tells of where he used [[artistic license]] in his retellings, and of errors he made, such as depicting coins at a time when coins had not yet come into use.{{sfn|Brown|2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8170">{{Other uses|Mode (disambiguation){{!}}Mode}}

In [[literature]] and other artistic media, a '''mode''' is an unspecific critical term usually designating a broad but identifiable kind of [[literary method]], [[Mood (literature)|mood]], or manner that is not tied exclusively to a particular [[List of narrative forms|form]] or [[Literary genre|genre]]. Examples are the ''satiric'' mode, the ''ironic'', the ''comic'', the ''pastoral'', and the ''didactic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] uses 'mode' in a more specific sense. Kinds of poetry, he writes, may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'' of [[mimesis|imitation]], according to their ''objects'' of imitation, and according to their mode or 'manner' of imitation (section I). "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section III). According to this definition, 'narrative' and 'dramatic' are modes of fiction:
:"This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in Aristotle's differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''[[mimesis]]'' (direct imitation). It has, as we shall see, important consequences for both the logic and the language of the drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Elam|1980|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction-writing==
[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Agent and author [[Evan Marshall (agent)|Evan Marshall]] identifies five [[fiction-writing mode]]s: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Marshall|1998|pp=143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morrell|2006|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Selgin|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summarization===
Summarization (also referred to as summary, narration, or narrative summary) is the fiction-writing mode whereby story events are condensed.  The reader is told what happens, rather than having it shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marshall|1998|pp=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fiction-writing axiom "[[Show, don't tell]]" the "tell" is often in the form of summarization.

Summarization has important uses:
* To connect one part of a story to another
* To report events whose details aren't important
* To telescope time
* To convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marshall|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Browne|King|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Selgin|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author [[Orson Scott Card]], either action or summarization could be right, either could be wrong.  Factors such as rhythm, pace, and tone come into play.  The objective is to get the right balance between telling versus showing, action versus summarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Card|1988|pp=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introspection===
{{main|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey a character's thoughts.  As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, "One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Browne|King|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Nancy Kress]], a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kress|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene]] and [[sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bickham|1993|pp=12–22,50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essay-writing==
According to Frederick Crews, it is traditional and useful to think of essays as falling into four types, corresponding to four basic functions of prose:  ''description'', or picturing; ''narration'', or telling; ''exposition'', or explaining; and ''argument'', or convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Anker distinguishes between nine different modes of essay writing:  ''narration'', or writing that tells stories; ''illustration'', or writing that gives examples; ''description'', or writing that creates pictures in words; ''process analysis'', or writing that explains how things happen; ''classification'', or writing that sorts things into groups; ''definition'', or writing that tells what something means; ''comparison and contrast'', or writing that shows similarities and differences; ''cause and effect'', or writing that explains reasons or results; and ''argument'', or writing that persuades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Anker|2004|pp=97–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security''''' is a book written by [[Daniel J. Solove]] regarding the [[nothing to hide argument]] regarding [[privacy]]. It was published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2011.

==Summary==
The book, written for a general audience, includes some material that had been adapted by law review articles written by Solove. Raymond G. Kessler wrote in the ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]'' that "the average reader may find some discussions of the law difficult to follow."&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;Kessler, Raymond G. "[http://www.lpbr.net/2011/09/nothing-to-hide-false-tradeoff-between.html Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security]" (book review) ([https://www.webcitation.org/6HdSAyXhk Archive]). ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]''. Volume 21, Issue 9. p. 514-517. Retrieved on June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has twenty one chapters in four parts.&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt; The parts are "How We Should Assess and Balance the Values of Privacy and Security", "How the Law Should Address Matters of National Security", "How the Constitution Should Protect Privacy" and "How the Law Should Cope With Changing Technology".&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Tony Doyle wrote in a book review published in the ''[[Journal of Value Inquiry]]'' that "Overwhelmingly ''Nothing to Hide'' is a carefully argued, hysteria-free book" and that the author "makes a strong case for the profound social value of privacy, the siege it is currently under, and how to preserve it."&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodrow Hartzog wrote in the ''[[Michigan Law Review]]'' that the thesis of his book review is "[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove]]'s polemic is a strong and desperately needed collection of frames that counterbalances the "nothing to hide" argument and other refrains so often used in privacy disputes."&lt;ref&gt;Hartzog, p. 1022.&lt;/ref&gt; J.M. Keller wrote in ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'' that the book is "Interesting for those with a passing interest in privacy, security, or legal rhetoric, yet well researched enough to recommend to privacy and security scholars."&lt;ref&gt;Keller, J.M. "Solove, Daniel J.: Nothing to hide: the false tradeoff between privacy and security." ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]''. 49.5 (Jan. 2012): p. 980. Available at Academic ASAP Infotrac, Expanded Academic ASAP Infotrac, General OneFile, Literature Resource Center, and Popular Magazines, all by [[Gale Cengage Learning]] (document number: GALE|A276134746).&lt;/ref&gt;

Delmus E. Williams of the ''[[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]'' argues that while Solove "writes well" and "offers solid support for those who would argue that we need more protection for personal privacy" he argues that the book "does not claim to a balanced, and thoughtful readers will want to find other sources if they hope to understand counter arguments."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Delmus E. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099133311002357 Nothing to Hide: the Tradeoff between Privacy and Security, Daniel J. Solove (Ed.). Yale University Press, New Haven, CT (2011), 245 pp. $25.00] {{ISBN|978-0-300-17231-7}}" (book review). ''[[The Journal of Academic Librarianship]]''. Volume 38, Issue 1, January 2012, Pages 72. Available at [[SciVerse]], [[ScienceDirect]].&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond G. Kessler wrote in the ''[[Law and Politics Book Review]]'' that "Being so short, some readers might find it wanting in details, examples and explanations. However, this work is one very, very, good place to start."&lt;ref name=Kessler/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">'''Numerical taxonomy'''  is a [[Biological classification|classification system]] in biological [[systematics]] which deals with the grouping by [[numerical method]]s of [[taxon|taxonomic units]] based on their character states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=461900&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d461900 |title=Numerical Taxonomy (biology) |author= |date= |work=www.accessscience.com |publisher=McGraw Hill Ltd. |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to create a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] using numeric algorithms like [[cluster analysis]] rather than using subjective evaluation of their properties. The concept was first developed by [[Robert R. Sokal]] and [[Peter H. A. Sneath]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;Sokal &amp; Sneath: ''Principles of Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; and later elaborated by the same authors.&lt;ref&gt;Sneath and Sokal: ''Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; They divided the field into [[phenetics]] in which classifications are formed based on the patterns of overall similarities and [[cladistics]] in which classifications are based on the branching patterns of the estimated evolutionary history of the taxa.{{cn span|In recent years many authors treat numerical taxonomy and phenetics as synonyms despite the distinctions made by those authors.|date=May 2017}}

Although intended as an objective method, in practice the choice and implicit or explicit [[weighting]] of characteristics is influenced by available data and research interests of the investigator. What was made objective was the introduction of explicit steps to be used to create [[dendrogram]]s and [[cladogram]]s using numerical methods rather than subjective synthesis of data.

Object segments are depicted by the red edge.]]

In [[computer vision]], '''object co-segmentation''' is a special case of [[image segmentation]], which is defined as jointly segmenting semantically similar objects in multiple images or video frames&lt;ref name="Vicente Rother Kolmogorov 2011 p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen Chen Chang 2012 p. "/&gt;.

== Challenges ==

It is often challenging to extract segmentation masks of a target/object from a noisy collection of images or video frames, which involves [[Object detection|object discovery]] coupled with [[Image segmentation|segmentation]]. A '''noisy collection''' implies that the object/target is present sporadically in a set of images or the object/target disappears intermittently throughout the video of interest.

== Dynamic Markov Networks-based Methods ==

A joint object discover and co-segmentation method based on coupled dynamic [[Markov random field|Markov Networks]] has been proposed recently&lt;ref name="Liu Wang Hua Zhang 2018 pp. 5840–5853"/&gt;, which claims significant improvements in robustness against irrelevant/noisy video frames.

== [[Convolutional neural network|CNN]] and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]]-based Methods ==
[[File:Overview of the coarse-to-fine temporal action localization.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Overview of the coarse-to-fine temporal action localization in &lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"/&gt;. (a) Coarse localization. Given an untrimmed video, we first generate saliency-aware video clips via variable-length sliding windows. The proposal network decides whether a video clip contains any actions (so the clip is added to the candidate set) or pure background (so the clip is directly discarded). The subsequent classification network predicts the specific action class for each candidate clip and outputs the classification scores and action labels. (b) Fine localization. With the classification scores and action labels from prior coarse localization, further prediction of the video category is carried out and its starting and ending frames are obtained.]][[File:Flowchart of the spatio-temporal action localization detector Segment-tube.png|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Flowchart of the spatio-temporal action localization detector Segment-tube&lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"/&gt;. As the input, an untrimmed video contains multiple frames of actions (&lt;span&gt;''e.g.''&lt;/span&gt;, all actions in a pair figure skating video), with only a portion of these frames belonging to a relevant category (&lt;span&gt;''e.g.''&lt;/span&gt;, the DeathSpirals). There are usually irrelevant preceding and subsequent actions (background). The Segment-tube detector alternates the optimization of temporal localization and spatial segmentation iteratively. The final output is a sequence of per-frame segmentation masks with precise starting/ending frames denoted with the red chunk at the bottom, while the background are marked with green chunks at the bottom.]]

In [[Activity recognition|action localization]] applications, ''object co-segmentation'' is also implemented as the '''Segment-Tube''' spatio-temporal detector&lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"/&gt;. Inspired by the recent spatio-temporal action localization efforts with tubelets (sequences of bounding boxes), Le &lt;span&gt;''et al.''&lt;/span&gt; present a new spatio-temporal action localization detector Segment-tube, which consists of sequences of per-frame segmentation masks. This Segment-tube detector can temporally pinpoint the starting/ending frame of each action category in the presence of preceding/subsequent interference actions in untrimmed videos. Simultaneously, the Segment-tube detector produces per-frame segmentation masks instead of bounding boxes, offering superior spatial accuracy to tubelets. This is achieved by alternating iterative optimization between temporal action localization and spatial action segmentation.


The proposed Segment-tube detector is illustrated in the flowchart on the right. The sample input is an untrimmed video containing all frames in a pair figure skating video, with only a portion of these frames belonging to a relevant category (e.g., the DeathSpirals). Initialized with saliency based image segmentation on individual frames, this method first performs temporal action localization step with a cascaded 3D [[Convolutional neural network|CNN]] and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]], and pinpoints the starting frame and the ending frame of a target action with a coarse-to-fine strategy. Subsequently, the Segment-tube detector refines per-frame spatial segmentation with [[Graph cuts in computer vision|graph cut]] by focusing on relevant frames identified by the temporal action localization step. The optimization alternates between the temporal action localization and spatial action segmentation in an iterative manner. Upon practical convergence, the final spatio-temporal action localization results are obtained in the format of a sequence of per-frame segmentation masks (bottom row in the flowchart) with precise starting/ending frames.

The '''prevalence of circumcision''' is the percentage of males in a given population who have been [[circumcision|circumcised]]. The rates vary widely by country, from virtually 0% in [[Honduras]], to 7% in [[Spain]], to 20% in the [[United Kingdom]], to 45% in [[South Africa]], to 80% in the [[United States of America|United States]], to over 90% in many [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority countries]].&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"&gt;{{Cite web

==Overview==

Male circumcision is nearly universal in the [[Muslim world]] and in [[Israel]] due to the religious beliefs of the majority of [[Muslims]] and [[Jews]]; however, some non-Muslim groups living within Muslim-majority countries, such as [[Armenians]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], do not practise it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-6407-1_20|chapter = Reclaiming Circumcision: Armenian Stories|title = Genital Cutting: Protecting Children from Medical, Cultural, and Religious Infringements|pages = 307–315|year = 2013|last1 = Vardanyan|first1 = Astrik N|isbn = 978-94-007-6406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is prevalent in some Muslim-majority countries in [[southeast Asia]] such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]; however, the WHO states that there is "little non-religious circumcision in [[Asia]], with the exceptions of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]".&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"/&gt; In parts of [[Africa]] it is often practised as part of tribal or religious customs. The prevalence of circumcision is also high in the [[United States]], although there has been a slight (~6%) decrease in routine neonatal circumcision in recent years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In contrast, rates are much lower in most of [[Europe]], parts of [[southern Africa]], most of Asia, [[Oceania]] and [[Latin America]], constituting [[South America]], [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Drain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drain PK, Halperin DT, Hughes JP, Klausner JD, Bailey RC | title = Male circumcision, religion, and infectious diseases: an ecologic analysis of 118 developing countries | journal = BMC Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 172 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17137513 | pmc = 1764746 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2334-6-172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are examples of countries that have seen a decline in male circumcision in recent decades, while there have been indications of increasing demand in southern Africa, partly for preventive reasons due to the [[HIV]] [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|epidemic there]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise J | title = Demand for male circumcision rises in a bid to prevent HIV | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 84 | issue = 7 | pages = 509–11 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16878217 | pmc = 2627386 | url = http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v84n7/v84n7a05.pdf | quote = As a result, there are already indications of increasing demand for male circumcision in traditionally non-circumcising societies in Southern Africa. | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
Studies indicate that about 62% of African males are circumcised. However, the rate varies widely between different regions, and among ethnic and religious groups, with Muslim North Africans practising it for religious reasons, central Africans as part of tribal rituals or local custom, (with some practising [[female genital mutilation]] as well) and some traditionally non-circumcising populations in the South recently adopting the practice due to measures by the World Health Organisation to prevent AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Questions and answers: NIAID-sponsored adult male circumcision trials in Kenya and Uganda |publisher=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |date=December 2006 |url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/QA/AMC12_QA.htm |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309060025/https://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/QA/AMC12_QA.htm |archive-date=9 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Williams, B.G. ''et al.'' commented that: "Most of the currently available data on the prevalence of [male circumcision] are several decades old, while several of the recent studies were carried out as adjuncts to demographic and health surveys and were not designed to determine the prevalence of [male circumcision]."&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams BG, Lloyd-Smith JO, Gouws E, Hankins C, Getz WM, Hargrove J, de Zoysa I, Dye C, Auvert B | title = The potential impact of male circumcision on HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e262 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16822094 | pmc = 1489185 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision in Canada followed the pattern that existed in other English speaking countries, picking up the practice during the 1900s to prevent masturbation and other perceived issues of the time, and then had its rate of circumcision decline due to new policy statements passed and due to coverage for the procedure being dropped, with a pattern of declining incidence of circumcision occurring from 1970 to 1979 after a new policy statement was released In 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Paediatric Society]] offered an estimate of 48 percent for the prevalence of male circumcision in Canada in 1970 prior to this fall in prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Neonatal circumcision revisited.

For Example, [[Yukon]] reported a rate of 74.8 percent in while [[Newfoundland]] reported an incidence of 1.9 to 2.4 percent in 1977-78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wirth JL | title = Current circumcision practices: Canada | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 705–8 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 7432876 | pmc =  | doi =  | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/66/5/705.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate continued to drop, with the newborn circumcision rate in Ontario In 1994-95 dropping to 29.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goel |first= V.

A survey of Canadian maternity practices conducted in 2006/2007 and published in 2009 by the national public health agency found a newborn circumcision rate of 31.9%.&lt;ref name="phac"/&gt; Rates varied markedly across the country, from close to zero in [[Newfoundland]] and [[Labrador]] to 44.3% in [[Alberta]].

====United States====
The [[Centers For Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) uses two data sources to track circumcision rates. The first is the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES), which records circumcisions performed at any time at any location. The second is the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), which does not record circumcisions performed outside the hospital setting or those performed at any age following discharge from the birth hospitalization.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris BJ, Bailis SA, Wiswell TE | title = Circumcision rates in the United States: rising or falling? What effect might the new affirmative pediatric policy statement have? | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 89 | issue = 5 | pages = 677–86 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24702735 | doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2014.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based off NHANES data, the CDC estimated that 80.5% of American males aged 14 to 59 years old from 2005 to 2010 were circumcised. Among racial breakdown, 90.8% of [[Non-Hispanic whites|non-Hispanic white males]], 75.7% of non-Hispanic [[African Americans|black]], and 44% of [[Mexican American]] males from that same age group and time span were circumcised.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Based off NHDS data, the CDC reported a national decline in circumcision rates of newborns, from 64.5% to 58.3%, during the 32-year period from 1972 to 2010. Trends varied regionally, with the Midwest mirroring the national trend; in the Northeast there was no discernible trend in the 32-year period; the South experienced an increase in circumcision rates from 1979 until 1998 and then a decline until 2010; finally, the West saw a decrease of 37% during the period in question, with the biggest drop happening in the 1980's, continuing with a slower decrease until 2010.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trends in Circumcision for Male Newborns in U.S. Hospitals: 1979-2010|author=The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Health Care Statistics |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/circumcision_2013/circumcision_2013.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline is in large part due to the growing Hispanic population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is increasingly common due do increasing health care costs that health care providers require the mother and baby to leave the hospital within 24 hours after birth without complications. As a result, a large number of circumcisions are performed in out-patient clinics and are not recorded in the NHDS data.

In 2009, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) reported its findings regarding newborn circumcisions based on U.S. region and income bracket. Its data came from several states' hospital associations and health departments. The Western Region reported a rate of 24.6%, the North Central Region reported a rate of 76.2%, the Northeast Region reported a rate of 67%, and the Southern Region reported a rate of 55.7%. The combined newborn circumcision rate of all regions was 54.5%, which is similar but slightly lower than the NHDS data from 2010. There was also significant variation between rural and urban areas. Rural areas reported a rate of 66.9%, while urban areas reported a rate of 41.2%. The lowest income bracket reported a rate of 51.5%, while the highest income bracket reported a rate of 60.4%.&lt;ref name="hcup" /&gt;

[[Medicaid]] funding for infant circumcision used to be available in every state, but starting with California in 1982, 18 states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington) had eliminated Medicaid coverage of routine (non-therapeutic) circumcision by July 2011.&lt;ref name = "adler"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, published in early 2009, found a difference in the neonatal male circumcision rate of 24% between states with and without Medicaid coverage. The study was controlled for other factors such as the percentage of Hispanic patients.&lt;ref name="Leibovitz"&gt;

When we controlled for other factors, hospitals in states in which Medicaid covers routine male circumcision had circumcision rates that were 24 percentage points higher than did hospitals in states without such coverage (P &lt; .001). }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that the rise of immigrants from [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asian]], [[South Asia]] and Hispanic [[South America|South American]] countries are a large factor in why the rates continue to drop in the US.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/circumcision-rates-continue-to-drop-in-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision was the second-most common procedure performed on patients under one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;Pfuntner A., Wier L.M., Stocks C. Most Frequent Procedures Performed in U.S. Hospitals, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #165. October 2013. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. [http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb165.jsp].&lt;/ref&gt; There are various explanations for why the infant circumcision rate in the United States is different from comparable countries. Many parents’ decisions about circumcision are preconceived, which may contribute to the high rate of elective circumcision.&lt;ref name="CSA:I-99"&gt;{{cite web|date=December 1999 |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13585.html |title=Report 10 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (I-99):Neonatal Circumcision |website=1999 AMA Interim Meeting: Summaries and Recommendations of Council on Scientific Affairs Reports |pages=17 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |access-date=2006-06-13 |deadurl=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705182814/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/13585.html |archive-date=5 July 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Brown &amp; Brown (1987) reported the most important factor is whether the father is circumcised.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal |

====South Korea====
Circumcision is largely a modern-day phenomenon in South Korea. While the rate in the twentieth century has been nearing 80%, virtually no circumcision was performed just a century ago, as it was against Korea's long and strong tradition of preserving the body as a gift from parents.&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt; A 2001 study of 20-year-old South Korean men found that 78% were circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ku JH, Kim ME, Lee NK, Park YH | title = Circumcision practice patterns in South Korea: community based survey | journal = Sexually Transmitted Infections | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–7 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12576619 | pmc = 1744613 | doi = 10.1136/sti.79.1.65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the authors commented that "South Korea has possibly the largest absolute number of teenage or adult circumcisions anywhere in the world. Because circumcision started through contact with the American military during the Korean War, South Korea has an unusual history of circumcision." According to a 2002 study, 86.3% of South Korean males aged 14–29 were circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pang MG, Kim DS | title = Extraordinarily high rates of male circumcision in South Korea: history and underlying causes | journal = BJU International | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–54 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11849160 | doi = 10.1046/j.1464-410x.2002.02545.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it's the case of 75.8% of the same age group. Only after 1999 has some information against circumcision become available (at the time of the 2012 study, only 3% of Korean internet sites, using the most popular Korean search engine [[Naver]], are against indiscriminate circumcision and 97% are for).&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt; The authors of the study speculate "that the very existence of information about the history of Korean circumcision, its contrary nature relative to a longstanding tradition, its introduction by the US military, etc., has been extremely influential on the decision-making process regarding circumcision."&lt;ref name="Kimetal"/&gt;

A national survey on sexual attitudes in 2000 found that 15.8% of men or boys in the United Kingdom (ages 16–44) were circumcised by their parents' choosing. 11.7% of 16- to 19-year-olds, and 19.6% of 40- to 44-year-olds said they had been circumcised. Apart from black Caribbeans, men born overseas were more likely to be circumcised.&lt;ref name="Dave2003" /&gt; Rickwood ''et al.'' reported that the proportion of English boys circumcised for medical reasons had fallen from 35% in the early 1930s to 6.5% by the mid-1980s.

They called for a target to reduce the percentage to 2%.

In Finland, the overall prevalence of circumcision is 2-4%, according to a recent publication by the Finnish Health Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.terveyskirjasto.fi/xmedia/duo/duo98530.pdf|title = Esinahan kirurgia|date = |access-date = 20 October 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Maija|first = Kolehmainen|first2 = Seppo|last2 = Taskinen | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents found that 10.9% of boys aged 0–17 had been circumcised.&lt;ref name="kamtsiuris"/&gt;

In France, according to a telephone survey (TNS Sofres Institute, 2008), 14% of men are circumcised.&lt;ref name="manix.net"&gt;[http://www.manix.net/enjoy/sex-news/sex-stat-1/index.cfm?i=1132 Telephone survey of the TNS Sofres Institute (commissioned by Manix), 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808004024/http://www.manix.net/enjoy/sex-news/sex-stat-1/index.cfm?i=1132 |date=8 August 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall prevalence of circumcision in Spain is reported to be 6.6%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1986, 511 out of approximately 478,000 Danish boys aged 0–14 years were circumcised.

In [[Slovenia]], a 1999-2001 national probability sample of the general population aged 18–49 years found that overall, 4.5% of Slovenian male citizens reported being circumcised. Prevalence strongly varied across religious groups, with 92.4% of Muslims being circumcised, 1.7% of Roman Catholics, 0% of other religious affiliations (Evangelic, Serbian Orthodox, other), and 7.1% of those with no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klavs I, Hamers FF | title = Male circumcision in Slovenia: results from a national probability sample survey | journal = Sexually Transmitted Infections | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–50 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17881413 | doi = 10.1136/sti.2007.027524 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5962502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Circumcision reached its peak in Australia in the 1950s with a rate of more than 80%, but has steadily fallen to an estimated 26% in 2012. The rate of circumcision has dropped rapidly over the years. It is estimated that males aged roughly 80 percent of males 35 and under are intact, and remaining 20 percent are circumcised. Circumcision rates have declined drastically in recent years as young fathers are starting to have children of their own and leaving them intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.circinfo.org/statistics.html |title=Incidence and prevalence of circumcision in Australia |website=Circumcision Information Australia |date=January 2013 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, circumcised males tend to be older.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medicare Australia]] records show the number of males younger than six months that underwent circumcision dropped from 19,663 in 2007/08 to 6309 (4%) in 2016/17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-is-the-number-of-male-circumcisions-declining-in-australia |title=Why is the number of male circumcisions declining in Australia? |author=Rashida Yosufzai |work=SBS News |date=19 February 2018 |access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Projected area''' is two-dimensional [[area]] measurement of a three-dimensional object by projecting its shape on to an arbitrary plane. This is often used in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[architectural engineering]] related fields, specifically [[hardness]] testing, [[axial stress]], wind pressures, and [[terminal velocity]].

The geometrical definition of a projected area is: "the rectilinear [[parallel projection]] of a surface of any shape onto a plane". This translates into the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{projected} = \int_{A} \cos{\beta} \, dA&lt;/math&gt;

where A is the original area, and &lt;math&gt;\beta \,&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the normal to the surface A and the normal to the arbitrary plane onto which we project. For basic shapes the results are listed in the table below.&lt;ref name="rpfaq"&gt;[https://employeepages.scad.edu/~kwitte/documents/Photometry_FAQ.PDF]{{Citation|last = Palmer|first = James M.|title = Radiometry and photometry FAQ|date = 1999-07-08|url = https://employeepages.scad.edu/~kwitte/documents/Photometry_FAQ.PDF|accessdate = 2011-04-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1990s, several books, convenings, and exhibitions have generated new momentum and investment in public interest design. Since then, public interest design—frequently described as a movement or field—has gained public recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cary|first=John|title=Dignifying Design|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/dignifying-design.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 6, 2012|author2=Courtney E. Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Public interest design grew out of the community design movement, which got its start in 1968 after American [[civil rights]] leader [[Whitney Young]] issued a challenge to attendees of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) national convention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=Jacqueline|title=From the Studio to the Streets: Service Learning in Planning and Architecture|year=2006|publisher=Stylus Publishing|location=Sterling, VA|isbn=978-1563771002|pages=103|authorlink=Multiplying Knowledge: Service-Learning x Activism = Community Scholars|author2=Kara Hoffernan |editor=Mary C. Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

".  .  .  ''you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights, and I am sure this does not come to you as any shock.  You are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designingactivism.com/2011/12/31/whitney-young-1968-speech-to-the-aia Whitney Young 1968 Speech to the AIA]&lt;/ref&gt;"

The response to Young’s challenge was the establishment of community design centers (CDCs) across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcoalition.org/aboutus/our%20roots.htm Design Coalition, "Our Roots"]&lt;/ref&gt;  CDCs, which were often established with the support of area universities,&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Jason|title=University-Community Design Partnerships: Innovations in Practice|year=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=1-56898-379-4|pages=6–7|url=http://www.nea.gov/pub/UnivCommDesign.pdf|editor=Mark Robbins|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a variety of design services – such as affordable housing - within their own neighborhoods.

In architecture schools, “design/build programs” provided outreach to meet local design needs, particularly in low-income and underserved areas.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;  One of the earliest design/build programs was [[Yale University]]’s Vlock Building Project.  The project, which was initiated by students at Yale University School of Architecture in 1967, requires graduate students to design and build low-income housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=David|title=The New Frontier in Education|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2012/03/The-New-Frontier-Education.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most publicized programs is the [[Auburn University]] [[Rural Studio]] design/build program, which was founded in 1993.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemence|first=Sara|title=Avant-Garde in Alabama|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304356604577342370002244732|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bostwick|first=William|title="Citizen Architect": The Humble Origins of Socially-Responsible Design|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1585096/citizen-architect-humble-origins-socially-responsible-design|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rural Studio’s first project, Bryant House, was completed in 1994 for $16,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Mockbee and the Rural Studio: Community Architecture|url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/samuel-mockbee.html|publisher=National Building Museum|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Interest Design from the 1990s – Present==
Interest in public interest design – particularly socially responsible architecture – began to grow during the 1990s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium.  Conferences, books, and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers,&lt;ref name=Cary /&gt; which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;

[[Non-profit]] organizations – including [[Architecture for Humanity]], BaSiC Initiative, Design Corps, [[Public Architecture]], Project H, Project Locus, and MASS Design Group – began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=C.J.|title=Does "Doing Good" Pay the Bills?|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/practice/Community-Service/2012/03/perspective-practice/Humanitarian-Work.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allweil|first1=Yael|title=The House of Dance and Feathers Mardi Gras Indian Museum-New Orleans, LA by Project Locus: Patrick Rhodes, Executive Director [EDRA/Places Awards 2007--Design].|journal=Places|date=2007|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public interest design organizations also provide training and [[service-learning]] programs for architecture students and graduates.  In 1999, the Enterprise Rose Architectural Fellowship was established,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; giving young architects the opportunity to work on three-year-long design and community development projects in low-income communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprisecommunity.com/solutions-and-innovation/design-leadership/rose-architectural-fellowship/about-the-fellowship Enterprise Community website, "About the Fellowship"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio at Mississippi State University&lt;ref name=Cary&gt;{{cite web|last=Cary|first=John|title=Chronology of the Public Interest Design Field|url=http://www.publicinterestdesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Public-Interest-Design-Chronology-120601.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012|coauthors=PublicInterestDesign.org, University of Minnesota College of Design, Tandus Flooring}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Public Interest Design Summer Program at the [[University of Texas]]&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soa.utexas.edu/csd/PID/overview.html Overview of Public Interest Design program, University of Texas School of Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416152806/http://www.soa.utexas.edu/csd/PID/overview.html |date=2012-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Portland State University launched the first graduate certificate program in Public Interest Design in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdx.edu/the-arts/recent-and-upcoming/cpid-launches-graduate-certificate-in-public-interest-design |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218044206/http://www.pdx.edu/the-arts/recent-and-upcoming/cpid-launches-graduate-certificate-in-public-interest-design |archivedate=2015-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first professional-level training was conducted in July 2011 by the Public Interest Design Institute (PIDI) and held at the [[Harvard]] Graduate School of Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicinterestdesign.com/harvard-school-of-design%20 Harvard School of Design course description]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, a survey of [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), 77% of AIA members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Public Interest Design Takes Shape|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20120917/public-interest-design-takes-shape|publisher=Metropolismag.com|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Bryan|author2=Roberta Feldman |author3=Sergio Palleroni |author4=Davide Perkes |title=2011 Latrobe Prize Progress Report: Public Interest Practices in Architecture|date=31 December 2011|url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aiab094604.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Structures for Inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world.  The first conference, which was held in 2000, was called “Design for the 98% Without Architects."&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; Speaking at the conference, Rural Studio co-founder [[Samuel Mockbee]] challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population: “I believe most of us would agree that American architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditions&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Good Deeds, Good Design: Community Service Through Architecture|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1568983912|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;...in creating architecture, and ultimately community, it should make no difference which economic or social type is served, as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;" 

In 2007, the [[Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum]] held an exhibition, titled “Design for the Other 90%,” curated by Cynthia Smith. Following the success of this exhibit, Smith developed the "Design Other 90" initiative into an ongoing series, the second of which was titled “Design for the Other 90%: CITIES”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities Design for the Other 90%: CITIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016121902/http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011), held at the [[United Nations]] headquarters. In 2010, Andres Lipek of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York curated an exhibit, called “Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/smallscalebigchange/ MoMA Exhibition: "Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement"]&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;

==Professional Networks==
One of the oldest professional networks related to public interest design is the professional organization is the Association for Community Design (ACD), which was founded in 1977.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitydesign.org/about Association for Community Design website, "About" page]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}}

In 2005, adopting a term coined by architect Kimberly Dowdell, the Social Economic Environmental Design (SEED) Network was co-founded by a group of community design leaders,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; during a meeting hosted by the Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The SEED Network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design. An evaluation tool called the SEED Evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with SEED Network goals and criteria.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 2006, the Open Architecture Network was launched by [[Architecture for Humanity]] in conjunction with co-founder [[Cameron Sinclair]]'s TED Wish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_sinclair_on_open_source_architecture.html Cameron Sinclair's TED Prize talk and wish for the Open Architecture Network]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}} Taking on the name Worldchanging in 2011, the network is an open-source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design. Designers of all persuasions can share ideas, designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects. while protecting their intellectual property rights using the [[Creative Commons]] "some rights reserved" licensing system.

In 2007, DESIGN 21: Social Design Network, an online platform built in partnership with UNESCO, was launched.

In 2011, the Design Other 90 Network was launched by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in conjunction with its Design with the Other 90%: CITIES exhibition.

In 2012, IDEO.org, with the support of The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, launched HCD Connect, a network for social sector leaders committed to human-centered design. In this context, human-centered design begins with the end-user of a product, place, or system — taking into account their needs, behaviors and desires. The fast-growing professional network of 15,000 builds on "The Human-Centered Design Toolkit,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/ The Human-Centered Design Toolkit from IDEO]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=January 2018}} which was designed specifically for people, nonprofits, and social enterprises that work with low-income communities throughout the world. People using the HCD Toolkit or human-centered design in the social sector now have a place to share their experiences, ask questions, and connect with others working in similar areas or on similar challenges.

The '''virtuality continuum''' is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual, a [[Virtual Reality|virtuality]], and the completely real, [[reality]]. The '''reality–virtuality continuum''' therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and [[Virtuality|virtual]] objects. It has been described as a concept in [[new media]] and [[computer science]], but in fact it could be considered a matter of [[anthropology]].{{clarify|date=October 2013}}{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Milgram |author2=H. Takemura |author3=A. Utsumi |author4=F. Kishino  |title=Augmented Reality: A class of displays on the reality-virtuality continuum |booktitle=Proceedings of Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies |pages=2351–34 |year=1994 |url=http://etclab.mie.utoronto.ca/publication/1994/Milgram_Takemura_SPIE1994.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2007-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area between the two extremes, where both the real and the virtual are mixed, is called [[mixed reality]]. This in turn is said to consist of both [[augmented reality]], where the virtual augments the real, and [[augmented virtuality]], where the real augments the virtual.

==Overview==
[[File:Mediated reality continuum 2d.png|thumb|left|300px|Mediated reality continuum showing four points: augmented reality, augmented virtuality, mediated reality, and mediated virtuality on the virtuality and mediality axes|alt=Mann's Continuum]]

This continuum has been extended into a two-dimensional plane of ''virtuality'' and ''mediality''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wearcam.org/presence_connect/ Mediated Reality with implementations for everyday life], 2002 August 6th, Presence Connect, the on line companion to the MIT Press journal PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxonomy of reality, virtuality, mediality. The origin R denotes unmodified reality. A continuum across the virtuality axis, V, includes reality augmented with graphics (augmented reality), as well as graphics augmented by reality (augmented virtuality). However, the taxonomy also includes modification of reality or virtuality or any combination of these.  

The mediality axis denotes changes  The modification is denoted by moving up the mediality axis. Further up this axis, for example, we can find mediated reality, mediated virtuality, or any combination of these. Further up and to the right, we have virtual worlds that are responsive to a severely modified version of reality. 

[[Augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]] are now sometimes used as synonyms.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The virtuality continuum has grown and progressed past labels such as [[computer science]] and [[new media]]. As the concept has much to do with the way in which humans continue to change how they communicate; the way in which identities form and the way in which they interact to and within the world; it is more accurately described as a subject within [[anthropology]].{{OR|date=March 2015}}

Changes in attitudes towards and the increase in availability of technology and media have changed and progressed the way it is used. One to one (SMS), one to many (email), and many to many (chat rooms), have become ingrained in society. The use of such items have made once clear distinctions like ''online'' and ''offline'' obsolete, and the distinctions between reality and virtuality have become blurred as people are incorporating and relying heavily upon virtuality within their everyday personal realities.{{OR|date=March 2015}}

[[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and Don Slater are prominent researchers pursuing the concept of the virtuality continuum and the media and its effect on communities, especially in the Caribbean, most notably Trinidad and Jamaica.

[[Steve Woolgar]] is another researcher who has established four rules of virtuality. These are:
*The way in which media and technology affect people relies on their non-[[information communication technology]] (ICT) related background which may include gender, age, social status, income amongst others.
*Risks and fears in regards to new media and technology are unevenly socially distributed.
*Advancements in media and technology supplement rather than replace existing activities in reality.
*New media and technology tends to create new kinds of localism rather than furthering globalization.

'''Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals''' ('''REACH''') is a [[European Union regulation]] dating from 18 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; REACH addresses the production and use of [[chemical substance]]s, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.  Its 849 pages took seven years to pass, and it has been described as the most complex legislation in the Union's history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU's REACH chemicals law begins life in Helsinki | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/24169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most important in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Q&amp;A: Reach chemicals legislation | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4437304.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the strictest law to date regulating chemical substances and will affect industries throughout the world.&lt;ref name="US affected"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGR2MV8UT1.DTL&amp;hw=toxic+chemicals&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | title=European Parliament OKs world's toughest law on toxic chemicals | date=14 December 2006 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Marla | last=Cone}}&lt;/ref&gt; REACH entered into force on 1 June 2007, with a phased implementation over the next decade. The regulation also established the [[European Chemicals Agency]], which manages the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of REACH.

==Overview==
[[File:European Chemicals Agency.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|[[European Chemicals Agency]] headquarters in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}.]]

When REACH is fully in force, it will require all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the European Union in quantities of one [[tonne]] or more per year to register these substances with a new [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}, [[Finland]]. Since REACH applies to some substances that are contained in objects (''articles'' in REACH terminology), any company importing goods into Europe could be affected.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt;

The [[European Chemicals Agency]] has set three major deadlines for registration of chemicals. In general these are determined by tonnage manufactured or imported, with 1000 tonnes/a. being required to be registered by 1 December 2010, 100 tonnes/a. by 1 June 2013 and 1 tonne/a. by 1 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/what-is-reach/|title=What is REACH? – ReAgent Chemical Services|date=6 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chemicals of higher concern or toxicity also have to meet the 2010 deadline.

About 143,000 chemical substances marketed in the European Union were pre-registered by the 1 December 2008 deadline. Although pre-registering was not mandatory, it allows potential registrants much more time before they have to fully register. Supply of substances to the European market which have not been pre-registered or registered is illegal (known in REACH as "no data, no market").

REACH also addresses the continued use of chemical ''[[substance of very high concern|substances of very high concern]]'' (SVHC) because of their potential negative impacts on human health or the environment. From 1 June 2011, the European Chemicals Agency must be notified of the presence of SVHCs in articles if the total quantity used is more than one tonne per year and the SVHC is present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the object. Some uses of SVHCs may be subject to prior authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency, and applicants for authorisation will have to include plans to replace the use of the SVHC with a safer alternative (or, if no safer alternative exists, the applicant must work to find one) - known as ''substitution''. {{As of|2015|06|15}}, there are 168 SVHCs on the candidate list for authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

REACH applies to all [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] imported or produced in the EU. The European Chemicals Agency will manage the technical, [[Science|scientific]] and administrative aspects of the REACH system.

To somewhat simplify the registration of the 143,000 substances and to limit vertebrate animal testing as far as possible, substance information exchange forums (SIEFs) are formed amongst legal entities (such as manufacturers, importers, and data holders) who are dealing with the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |title=Substance Information Exchange Fora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher=[[European Chemicals Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223062045/http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows them to join forces and finances to create 1 registration dossier. However, this creates a series of new problems as a SIEF is the cooperation between sometimes a thousand legal entities that did not know each other at all before but suddenly must:
*find each other and start communicating openly and honestly
*start sharing data
*start sharing costs in a fair and transparent way
*democratically and in full consensus take the most complex decisions
in order to complete a several thousand end points dossier in a limited time.

The [[European Commission]] supports businesses affected by REACH by handing out &amp;ndash; free of charge &amp;ndash; a software application ([[IUCLID]]) that simplifies capturing, managing, and submitting data on chemical properties and effects. Such submission is a mandatory part of the [[REACh authorisation procedure|registration process]]. Under certain circumstances the performance of a [[chemical safety assessment]] (CSA) is mandatory and a [[chemical safety report]] (CSR) assuring the safe use of the substance has to be submitted with the dossier. Dossier submission is done using the web-based software [[REACH-IT]].

The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment by identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. At the same time, innovative capability and competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry should be enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reach|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|website = TEPPFA|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The European Commission’s (EC) White Paper of 2001 on a ‘future chemical strategy’ proposed a system that requires chemicals manufactured in quantities of greater than 1 tonne to be ‘registered’, those manufactured in quantities greater than 100 tonnes to be ‘evaluated’, and certain substances of high concern (for example carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction - CMR’s) to be ‘authorised’.

The EC adopted its proposal for a new scheme to manage the manufacture, importation and supply of chemicals in Europe on in October 2003. This proposal eventually became law once the European Parliament officially approved its final text of REACH. It came into force on 1 June 2007.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
One of the major elements of the REACH [[regulation]] is the requirement to communicate information on [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] up and down the [[supply chain]]. This ensures that manufacturers, importers, and also their customers are aware of information relating to [[health]] and [[safety]] of the products supplied. For many [[retail]]ers the obligation to provide information about [[Chemical substance|substance]]s in their products within 45 days of receipt of a request from a [[consumer]] is particularly challenging. Having detailed information on the substances present in their products will allow retailers to work with the manufacturing base to substitute or remove potentially harmful substances from products. The list of harmful substances is continuously growing and requires [[organization]]s to constantly monitor any announcements and additions to the REACH scope. This can be done on the [[European Chemicals Agency]]'s website.

===Registration===
A requirement is to collect, collate and submit data to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the hazardous properties of all substances (except Polymers and non-isolated intermediates) manufactured or imported into the EU in quantities above 1 tonne per year. Certain substances of high concern, such as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxic substances (CMRs) will have to be authorised.

Chemicals will be registered in three phases according to the tonnage of the substance evaluation:

More than 1000 tonnes a year, or substances of highest concern, must be registered in the first 3 years;

100-1000 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 6 years;

1-100 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 11 years.

In addition, industry should prepare risk assessments and provide controls measures for using the substance safely to downstream users.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Evaluation===
Evaluation provides a means for the authorities to require registrants, and in very limited cases downstream users, to provide further information.

There are two types of evaluation: dossier evaluation and substance :

Dossier evaluation is conducted by authorities to examine proposals for testing to ensure that unnecessary animal tests and costs are avoided, and to check the compliance of registration dossier with the registration requirements.

The relevant authorities perform substance evaluation when there is a reason to suspect that a substance presents a risk to human health or the environment (e.g. because of its structural similarity to another substance). Therefore, all registration dossiers submitted for a substance are examined together and any other available information is taken into account.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Authorisation===
{{main|REACH authorisation procedure}}
The REACH proposal sets up a system under which the use of substances with properties of very high concern and their placing on the market can be made subject to an authorisation requirement.

This authorisation requirement ensures that risks from the use of such substances are either adequately controlled or justified by socio-economic grounds, having taken into account the available information on alternative substances or processes.

The Regulation enables restrictions of use to be introduced across the European Community where this is shown to be necessary. Member States or the Commission may prepare such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = www.teppfa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information exchange===
[[File:REACh Dates.png|{{largethumb}}|REACh Key Dates]]

Manufactures and/or importers should develop risk reduction measures for all known uses of the chemical including downstream uses. Downstream users such as plastic pipe producers should provide detail of their uses to their suppliers. In cases where downstream users decide not to disclose this information, they need to have their own CSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
REACH is the product of a wide-ranging overhaul of EU chemical policy.  It passed the first reading in the [[European Parliament]] on 17 November 2005, and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] reached a political agreement for a common position on 13 December 2005. The European Parliament approved REACH on 13 December 2006 and the Council of Ministers formally adopted it on 18 December 2006. Weighing up expenditure versus profit has always been a significant issue, with the estimated cost of compliance being around €5&amp;nbsp;billion over 11&amp;nbsp;years, and the assumed health benefits of saved billions of euro in healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU backs landmark chemicals law | date=13 December 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4524772.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been different studies on the estimated cost which vary considerably in the outcome. It came into force on 20 January 2009, and will be fully implemented by 2015.

A separate regulation – the [[CLP Regulation]] (for "Classification, Labelling, Packaging") – implements the United Nations [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) and will steadily replace the previous [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] and [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]].

The REACH regulation was amended in April 2018 to include specific information requirements for [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/view-article/-/journal_content/title/improved-clarity-on-nanomaterials-in-the-eu-member-states-vote-to-amend-reach-annex-1|title=Improved clarity on nanomaterials in the EU - Member States vote to amend REACH Annexes|last=|first=|date=|publisher=The European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The legislation was proposed under dual reasoning: protection of [[health|human health]] and protection of [[natural environment|the environment]].

Using potentially [[toxic substances]] (such as [[phthalate]]s or [[brominated flame retardant]]s) is deemed undesirable and REACH will force the use of certain substances to be phased out. Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those [[ingest]]ed by humans (such as [[electronic device]]s) may seem to be safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during [[consumer]] use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of the tens of thousands of chemicals placed on the market before 1981.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt; There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed. Of these only 3,000 have been tested and over 800 are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. These are listed in the Annex 1 of the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] (now Annex VI of the [[CLP Regulation]]).

Continued use of many toxic chemicals is sometimes justified because "at very low levels they are not a concern to health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pesticides 'in a third of foods' | date=27 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5384138.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these substances may [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in the human body, thus reaching dangerous concentrations. They may also [[chemical reaction|chemically react]] with one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Food chemicals 'may harm humans' | date=21 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5366028.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing new substances with new risks.

==In non-EU countries==
A number of countries outside of the European Union have started to implement REACH-regulations or are in the process of adopting such a regulatory framework to approach a more globalized system of chemicals registration under the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130708194823/http://www.icis.com/Articles/2010/05/31/9362538/reach-like+regulations+enacted+globally.html ICIS.com REACH-like regulations enacted globally] retrieved July 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Balkan countries such as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] are in the process of adopting the EU REACH system under the auspices of the EU IPA programme. [[Switzerland]] has moved towards implementation of REACH through partial revision of the Swiss Chemical Ordinance on February 1, 2009.  The new Chemicals Management Regulation in [[Turkey]] is paving the way for the planned adoption of REACH in 2013. [[China]] has moved towards a more efficient and coherent system for the control of chemicals in compliance with GHS.

==Controversy==
Apart from the potential costs to [[industry]] and the complexity of the new law, REACH has also attracted concern because of [[animal testing]]. Animal tests on [[vertebrate]]s are now required but allowed only once per each new substance and if suitable alternatives cannot be used.  If a company pays for such tests, it must sell the rights of the results for a "reasonable" price, which is not defined.  There are additional concerns that access to the necessary information may prove very costly for potential registrants needing to purchase it.

An opinion in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2009 by Thomas Hartung and Constanza Rovida estimated that 54 million vertebrate animals would be used under REACH and that the costs would amount to €9.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;T. Hartung &amp; C. Rovida: Chemical regulators have overreached. Opinion in Nature, vol. 460, 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hartung is the former head of European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a news release, ECHA criticised assumptions made by Hartung and Rovida; ECHA's alternative assumptions reduced sixfold the number of animals.&lt;ref&gt;ECHA - [http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf New study inaccurate on the number of test animals for REACH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215231108/http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}. Helsinki, 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On 8 June 2006, the REACH proposal was criticized by non-EU countries, including the United States, India and [[Brazil]], which stated that the bill would hamper global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Beunderman | title=EU chemicals bill under fire from US-led coalition | date=June 9, 2006 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/21813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Only representative services==
Non-EU consultancies offer "only representative" services, though according to REACH it is not possible to register a substance if your "only representative" consultancy company is not based in the EU, unless it is subcontracted to an EU-based registrant.

Only representatives are EU based entities that must comply with REACH (Article 8) and should operate standard, transparent working practices. The Only Representative assumes responsibility and [[Legal liability|liability]] for fulfilling obligiations of importers in accordance with REACH for substances being brought into the EU by a non-EU manufacturer.

The SIEFs will bring new challenges. An article in the business news service [[Chemical Watch]] described how some "pre-registrants" may simply be consultants hoping for work ("gold diggers") while others may be aiming to charge exorbitant rates for the data they have to offer ("jackals").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Authorisation List==
The [[European Chemical Agency]] (ECHA) has published the REACH Authorisation List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/authorisation-list|title=Page has moved - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to tighten the use of [[substance of very high concern|Substances of Very High Concern]] (SVHCs). The list is an official recommendation from the ECHA to the [[European Commission]]. The list is also regularly updated and expanded. Currently the Candidate List for Authorisation comprises a total of 173 SVHCs, some of which are already active on the Authorization List.

To sell or use these substances, manufacturers, importers, and retailers in the [[European Union]] (EU) must apply for authorization from the [[European Chemical Agency|ECHA]]. The applicant is to submit a chemical safety report on the risks entailed by the substance, as well as an analysis of possible alternative substances or technologies including present and future [[research and development]] processed.

There has been controversy about the practicality of establishing a right to be forgotten to the status of an international [[human rights|human right]] in respect to access to information, due in part to the vagueness of current rulings attempting to implement such a right.&lt;ref name="fleischer"&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Fleischer |url=http://peterfleischer.blogspot.co.nz/2011/03/foggy-thinking-about-right-to-oblivion.html |title=Peter Fleischer: Privacy...?: Foggy thinking about the Right to Oblivion |publisher=Peterfleischer.blogspot.co.nz |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are concerns about its impact on the right to [[freedom of expression]], its interaction with the [[right to privacy]], and whether creating a right to be forgotten would decrease the quality of the [[Internet]] through [[censorship]] and a [[historical revisionism (negationism)|rewriting of history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tessa |last=Mayes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/mar/18/forgotten-online-european-union-law-internet |title=We have no right to be forgotten online |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in favour of the right to be forgotten cite its necessity due to issues such as [[revenge porn]] sites appearing in [[search engine]] listings for a person's name, as well as instances of these results referencing petty crimes individuals may have committed many years ago. The central concern here being, these results can unduly play a prominent role in a person's online presence almost indefinitely if not removed.&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt;

==Conception and proposal==
Europe's data protection legislation are intended to secure potentially damaging, private information about individuals. The notion of "the right to be forgotten" is derived from numerous preexisting European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974|Rehabilitation of Offenders Act]], that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are "spent", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment. Similarly, France values this right - le droit à l'oubli (the right to be forgotten).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/explainer-right-to-be-forgotten-the-newest-cultural-shibboleth|title=Explaining the 'right to be forgotten' – the newest cultural shibboleth|author=Charles Arthur|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially recognized in French Law in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2010 |title=Charte sur la publicité ciblée et la protection des internautes |trans-title=Code of Good Practice on Targeted Advertising and the Protection of Internet Users |publisher=Secrétariat d'Etat chargé de la Prospective et du Développement de l'économie numérique |url=http://www.huntonfiles.com/files/webupload/PrivacyLaw_Charte_publicite.pdf |format=PDF |language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Views on the right to be forgotten differ greatly between America and EU countries. In America, transparency, the right of free speech according to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the right to know have typically been favored over the obliteration of truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. The term "right to be forgotten" is a relatively new idea, though on May 13, 2014, the European Court of Justice legally solidified that the "right to be forgotten" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'' case.

In 1995, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Protection Directive|European Data Protection Directive]] (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. EU Directive 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; This is now considered a component of [[human rights law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitrou |first=Lilian |first2=Maria |last2=Karyda |title=EU's Data Protection Reform and the right to be forgotten—A legal response to a technological challenge? |work=5th International Conference of Information Law and Ethics |year=2012 |pages=29–30 |ssrn=2165245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new European Proposal for [[General Data Protection Regulation]] provides protection and exemption for companies listed as "media" companies, like newspapers and other journalistic work. However, Google purposely opted out of being classified as a "media" company and so is not protected. Judges in the European Union ruled that because the international corporation, Google, is a collector and processor of data it should be classified as a "data controller" under the meaning of the EU data protection directive. These "data controllers" are required under EU law to remove data that is "inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant", making this directive of global importance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Current legal frameworks==
The right to be forgotten "reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them."&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;Weber, Rolf H. "The right to be forgotten." More than a Pandora's Box 2 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121}} It has been defined as "the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring."&lt;ref&gt;Pino, G. (2000). "The right to personal identity in Italian private law: Constitutional interpretation and judge-made rights". In: M. Van Hoecke; F. Ost (eds.). The harmonization of private law in Europe (pp. 225-237). Oxford: Hart Publishing. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to be forgotten leads to allowing individuals to have information, videos or photographs about themselves deleted from certain internet records so that they cannot be found by search engines.&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt;
{{As of|2011}} there are few protections against the harm that incidents such as [[revenge porn]] sharing, or pictures uploaded due to poor judgement, can do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill |first=Kashmir |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/06/revenge-porn-with-a-facebook-twist |title=Revenge Porn With A Facebook Twist |publisher=Forbes |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be forgotten is distinct from the [[right to privacy]], due to the distinction that the right to privacy constitutes information that is not publicly known, whereas the right to be forgotten involves removing information that was publicly known at a certain time and not allowing third parties to access the information.&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt;{{rp|122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=L. Gordon |last=Crovitz |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704658204575610771677242174 |title=Crovitz: Forget any 'Right to Be Forgotten' - WSJ |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations of application in a [[jurisdiction]] include the inability to require removal of information held by companies outside the jurisdiction. There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google can not escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2014 on the right to be forgotten. Mayer-Schönberger said nations, including the US, had long maintained that their local laws have "extra-territorial effects".&lt;ref&gt;(September 23, 2015)[http://en.yibada.com/articles/66331/20150922/expert-google-escape-french-law-right-forgotten.htm?exe=reporter Expert: Google Can Not Escape French Law on Right to Delist].

==Recognition==

===European Union===
In Article 12 of the Directive 95/46/EC the EU gave a legal base to internet protection for individuals.&lt;ref name="mantelero"/&gt;{{rp|233}} In 2012 the [[European Commission]] disclosed a draft European Data Protection Regulation to supersede the directive, which includes specific protection in the right to be forgotten in Article 17.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and On the Free Movement of Such Data ([[General Data Protection Regulation]]). 2012/0011 (COD). Article 17. Right to be forgotten and To Erasure&lt;/ref&gt;

To exercise the right to be forgotten and request removal from a search engine, one must complete a form through the search engine's website. [[Google]]'s removal request process requires the applicant to identify their country of residence, personal information, a list of the URLs to be removed along with a short description of each one, and attachment of legal identification.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant receives an email from Google confirming the request but the request must be assessed before it is approved for removal. If the request is approved, searches using the individual's name will no longer result in the content appearing in search results. The content remains online and is not erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-right-to-be-forgotten-form-192837|title=How Google's New "Right To Be Forgotten" Form Works: An Explainer|date=30 May 2014|work=Search Engine Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a request is filled, their removals team reviews the request, weighing "the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to know", deciding if the website is "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed".&lt;ref name=Brindle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brindle|first1=Beth|title=How can Google forget you?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/how-can-google-forget-you.htm|website=How Stuff Works|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google has formed an Advisory Council of various professors, lawyers, and government officials from around Europe to provide guidelines for these decisions.&lt;ref name="Powles and Chaparro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powles|first1=Julia|last2=Chaparro|first2=Enrique|title=How Google determined our right to be forgotten|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the review process is still a mystery to the general public. Guidelines set by EU regulators were not released until November 2014, but Google began to take action on this much sooner than that, which (according to one author) allowed them "to shape interpretation to [their] own ends".&lt;ref name="Powles and Chaparro" /&gt; In May 2015, eighty academics called for more transparency from Google, in an open letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/dear-google-open-letter-from-80-academics-on-right-to-be-forgotten|title = Dear Google: open letter from 80 academics on 'right to be forgotten'|website = The Guardian|last = Kiss|first = Jemima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form asks people to select one of the twenty-eight countries that make up the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Removal Request Under Data Protection Law in Europe|url=https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch|website=Google|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The form allows an individual or someone representing an individual to put in a request" for the removal of any URLs believed to be a violation of the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Danny|title=How Google's New 'Right to be Forgotten' Form Works: An Explainer|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-right-to-be-forgotten-form-192837|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=Search Engine Land|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of who is submitting the form, some form of photo identification of the person the form is being submitted for must be presented. The purpose of this is to provide proof that the person for whom the request is being made does in fact approve.
 
The form allows people to submit the name they would like search results removed for. However, it only allows for the submission of one name, which some view as one of its flaws.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt; For example, if someone known as both "Lawrence Smith" and "Larry Smith" were to submit a form for the removal of search results for his name, he would only be allowed to indicate one of these names on the form.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt; Many people view it as inconvenient and believe it is a problem that Google should be able to easily fix.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt;

If Google refuses a request to delink material, Europeans can appeal to their local data protection agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/26/google-removing-right-to-be-forgotten-links|title = Google removing 'right to be forgotten' search links in Europe|website = The Guardian|last = Arthur|first = Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2015, the British Data Protection Agency had treated 184 such complaints, and overturned Google's decision in about a quarter of those.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/14/ico_google_clash_right_to_be_forgotten/|title = 'Right to be forgotten' festers as ICO and Google come to blows|website = The Register|last = Martin|first = Alexander J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Google objects to a Data Protection Agency decision, it can face legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/internet/article4438460.ece|title = Google could face legal action over 'right to be forgotten' rejections|website = The Times|last = Dean|first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, in the early stages of Google's effort to comply with the court ruling, legal experts questioned whether Google's widely publicised delistings of a number of news articles violated the UK and EU [[Data Protection Directive]], since in implementing the Directive, Google is required to weigh the damage to the person making the request against any public interest in the information being available.&lt;ref name="whydoit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/04/google_peston_bbc_delisting_not_compliant_w_public_interest_law_says_expert/ |title=Google de-listing of BBC article 'broke UK and Euro public interest laws' - So WHY do it? |last1=Orlowski |first1=Andrew |date=4 July 2014 |website=www.theregister.co.uk |publisher=The Register |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google indeed acknowledged that some of its search result removals, affecting articles that were of public interest, were incorrect, and reinstated the links a week later.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/what-is-google-deleting-under-the-right-to-be-forgotten-and-why|last=Arthur|first=Charles|title=What is Google deleting under the 'right to be forgotten' - and why?

Google notifies websites that have URLs delinked, and the BBC and other news organizations have published lists of delinked articles. Complainants have been named in news commentary regarding those delinkings. In August 2015 the British Data Protection Agency issued an enforcement action requiring Google to delink some of these more recent articles from searches for a complainant's name, after Google refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/20/google-ordered-to-remove-links-to-stories-about-right-to-be-forgotten-removals|title = Google ordered to remove links to 'right to be forgotten' removal stories|website = The Guardian|last = Gibbs|first = Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google complied with the request.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some academics have criticized news organizations and Google for their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/bbc-wrong-right-to-be-forgotten|title = Why the BBC is wrong to republish 'right to be forgotten' links|website = The Guardian|last = Powles|first = Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theconversation.com/privacy-watchdog-takes-first-step-against-those-undermining-right-to-be-forgotten-46495|title = Privacy watchdog takes first step against those undermining right to be forgotten|website = The Conversation|last = Boiten|first = Eerke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2014, Google has removed 1,390,838 URLs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a gathering of which websites had the most amount of links removed, Facebook won with a total of 11,973 URLs removed. [[YouTube]] had 5,999 removed, [[Google Groups]] had 7,246 removed, and [[Twitter]] had 4,588 removed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Though Facebook had the largest number of deleted URLs, there were other received requests that were not granted deletion. While Google does evaluate millions of URLs that have been requested to be removed, the ultimate decision must be made by a human "because the variables, including public interest claims, needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, it is to be kept in mind that internet users can still find removed information somewhat easily, just not through European Google search engines.

In July 2015, Google accidentally revealed data on delinkings that "shows 95% of Google privacy requests are from citizens out to protect personal and private information – not criminals, politicians and public figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/14/google-accidentally-reveals-right-to-be-forgotten-requests|title = Google accidentally reveals data on 'right to be forgotten' requests|website = The Guardian|last = Tippmann|first = Sylvia|first2 = Julia|last2 = Powles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This data leak caused serious social consequences for Google as the public expressed their outrage and fear over the information that was recently made public. Though only 5% of requests were made by criminals, politicians, and public figures, the content removed was what sparked the most fear.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, one request for data removal was from a British doctor requesting to have 50 links removed on past botched medical procedures. Google agreed to remove three search results containing his personal information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The public voiced their outrage stating that removing such information can be used for manipulation and could lead to innocent people making uninformed decisions. Google responded to the public outrage by saying that when removing content they consider both the right of the individual and public interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The European Union has been pushing for the delinkings requested by EU citizens to be implemented by Google not just in European versions of Google (as in google.co.uk, google.fr, etc.), but on google.com and other international subdomains. Regulators want delinkings to be implemented so that the law cannot be circumvented in any way. Google has refused the French Data Protection Agency's demand to apply the right internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/30/google-rejects-france-expand-right-to-be-forgotten-worldwide|title = Google says non to French demand to expand right to be forgotten worldwide|website = The Guardian|last = Hern|first = Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to their refusal to comply with the recommendation of the privacy regulating board Google has become the subject of a four-year-long antitrust investigation by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/eu-wants-right-to-be-forgotten-applied-globally/|title=EU wants 'right to be forgotten' applied globally|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the French Data Protection Agency dismissed Google's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/21/french-google-right-to-be-forgotten-appeal|title = French data regulator rejects Google's right-to-be-forgotten appeal|date = 21 September 2015|accessdate = 23 September 2015|website = The Guardian|last = Gibbs|first = Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2015, the most delinked site is ''www.facebook.com''. Three of Google's own sites, ''groups.google.com'', ''plus.google.com'' and ''www.youtube.com'' are among the ten most delinked sites.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/?hl=en|title = Transparency Report.

In May 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled against [[Google]] in ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'', a case brought by a Spanish man, Mario Costeja González, who requested the removal of a link to a digitized 1998 article in ''La Vanguardia'' newspaper about an auction for his foreclosed home, for a debt that he had subsequently paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain | title=What we can salvage from 'right to be forgotten' ruling | publisher=Wired.co.uk | date=15 May 2014 | accessdate=16 May 2014 | author=Julia Powles}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially attempted to have the article removed by complaining to the [[Spanish Agency of data protection]], which rejected the claim on the grounds that it was lawful and accurate, but accepted a complaint against Google and asked Google to remove the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solon|first=Olivia|title=People have the right to be forgotten, rules EU court|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/13/right-to-be-forgotten-ruling|work=Wired.co.uk|publisher=Conde Nast Digital|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google sued in the [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|Spanish ''Audiencia Nacional'']] (National High Court) which referred a series of questions to the European Court of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=[[European Court of Justice]] |title=Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-131/12: An internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/P_127116/ |location=Luxembourg |publisher= |agency= |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled in ''Costeja'' that search engines are responsible for the content they point to and thus, Google was required to comply with EU data privacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU court backs 'right to be forgotten' in Google case|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27388289|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU court rules Google must tweak search results in test of 'right to be forgotten'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eu-court-google-must-tweak-search-results-right-to-be-forgotten/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/technology/google-should-erase-web-links-to-some-personal-data-europes-highest-court-says.html |title=European Court Lets Users Erase Records on Web |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=13 May 2014|accessdate= 14 August 2014|author=David Streitfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its first day of compliance only (May 30, 2014), Google received 12,000 requests to have personal details removed from its search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Removal of Google personal information could become work intensive|url=http://www.europenews.net/index.php/sid/222490797/scat/88176adfdf246af5/ht/Removal-of-Google-personal-information-could-become-work-intensive|accessdate=2 June 2014|publisher=Europe News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2009, lawyers for [[Wolfgang Werlé]] who—together with Manfred Lauber—was convicted of murdering [[Walter Sedlmayr]] sent the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] a [[cease and desist]] letter requesting that Werlé's name be removed from the English language [[Wikipedia]] article [[Walter Sedlmayr]], citing a 1973 [[Federal Constitutional Court]] decision that allows the suppression of a criminal's name in news accounts once he is released from custody.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Two German Killers Demanding Anonymity Sue Wikipedia's Parent |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/us/13wiki.html |quote=Wolfgang Werlé and Manfred Lauber became infamous for killing a German actor in 1990.

Stopp, attorney for Werlé and Lauber, had won a default judgment in German court, on behalf of Lauber, against the Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; According to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], Werlé's lawyers also challenged an Internet service provider in Austria which published the names of the convicted killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/12/wikipedia_sued_by_convicted_murderer |title=Wikipedia sued for publishing convicted murderer's name |work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikimedia is based in the United States, where the First Amendment protects [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press in the United States|freedom of the press]]. In Germany, the law seeks to protect the name and likenesses of private persons from unwanted publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Convicted Murderer To Wikipedia: Shhh! |author=[[Jennifer Granick]] | quote=Who killed Sedlmayr? Its [sic] a matter of public record, but if one of the men and his German law firm gets their way, Wikipedia (and EFF) will not be allowed to tell you. A few days ago, the online encyclopedia received a cease and desist letter from one of the convicts—represented by the aptly named German law firm Stopp and Stopp—demanding that the perpetrator's name be taken off of the Sedlmayr article page. | publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=10 November 2009 |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/11/murderer-wikipedia-shhh}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 2008, a court in [[Hamburg]] supported the personality rights of Werlé, which under German law includes removing his name from archive coverage of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abwägung bei einem Unterlassungsanspruch zwischen dem Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung und dem Persönlichkeitsrecht (Resozialisierung) bei elektronischen Pressearchiven einen Mordfall betreffend |author=|publisher=Hamburger Justiz|date=18 January 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2012 | language=German|url=http://www.landesrecht.hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bshaprod.psml;jsessionid=D0EE59E4F4B727BF37EAB3766448FAB8.jpj4?showdoccase=1&amp;doc.id=JURE080001422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Wolfgang Werlé had a case pending against the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] in a German court. The editors of the German-language Wikipedia [[:de:Walter Sedlmayr|article about Sedlmayr]] removed the names of the murderers,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; which have since then been restored to the article. ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the lawsuit has led to the [[Streisand effect]], an upsurge in publicity for the case resulting from the legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Arthur |title=Wikipedia sued by German killers in privacy claim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/13/wikipedia-sued-privacy-claim |quote= |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-15 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2009, the German [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] (Bundesgerichtshof) in [[Karlsruhe]] ruled that German websites do not have to check their archives in order to provide permanent protection of personality rights for convicted criminals. The case occurred after the names of the brothers were found on the website of [[Deutschlandradio]], in an archive article dating from July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vor 10 Jahren – Walter Sedlmayr ermordet|language=German|work=[[Deutschlandradio]]|date= 14 July 2000|url= http://www.dradio.de/dlr/sendungen/kalender/127148/|accessdate = 2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge Gregor Galke stated "This is not a blank check", and pointed out that the right to rehabilitation of offenders had been taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Namen der Sedlmayr-Mörder bleiben online|work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/computer/410/497712/text/|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=avs/dpa |title=BGH-Urteil – Keine ständige Kontrolle von Online-Archiven |url=http://www.focus.de/digital/internet/bgh-urteil-keine-staendige-kontrolle-von-online-archiven_aid_463464.html |publisher=Focus |language=German|date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Argentina has seen law suits by [[celebrities]] against [[Google]] and [[Yahoo!]] in which the plaintiffs demand the removal of certain search results, and require removal of links to photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infotechnology.com/internet/La-Justicia-argentina-sobreseyo-a-Adriana-Norea-presidente-de-Google.hmtl-20120604-0005.html |title=La Justicia Argentina Sobreseyó a Adriana Noreña, Directora General de Google |publisher=Infotechnology.com |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case, brought by artist [[Virginia da Cunha]], involved photographs which had originally been taken with her permission and uploaded with her permission, however she alleged that the search results improperly associated her photographs with pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Edward L. "Argentina's Right to Be Forgotten." Emory International Law Review. 27 (2013): pg 23.&lt;/ref&gt; De Cunha's case achieved initial success resulting in Argentine search engines not showing images of the particular celebrity, however this decision is on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/139989/ |title='Search engines not responsible for content' |publisher=BuenosAiresHerald.com |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Simari, the judge in favor of De Cunha, stated that people have the right to control their image and avert others from "capturing, reproducing, broadcasting, or publishing one's image without permission."&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.emory.edu/eilr/content/volume-27/issue-1/recent-developments/argentinas-right-to-be-forgotten.html|title=Argentina's Right to be Forgotten|last=Carter|first=Edward|date=|website=Emory International Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Simari used a treatise written by Julio César Rivera, a Buenos Aires lawyer, author, and law professor  "the right to control one's personal data includes the right to prevent others from using one's image."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; Since the 1990s Argentina has also been a part of the habeas data movement in which they "adopted a constitutional provision that is part freedom-of-government-information law and part data privacy law."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; However, their version is known as amparo. Article 43&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; explains the version:

"Any person shall file this action to obtain information on the data about himself and their purpose, registered in public records or databases, or in private ones intended to supply information; and in case of false data or discrimination, this action may be filed to request the suppression, rectification, confidentiality or updating of said data."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt;

Argentina's efforts to protect their people's right to be forgotten has been called 'the most complete' because individuals are able to correct, delete, or update information about themselves. Overall, their information is bound to remain confidential.

===United States===
Consideration of the right to be forgotten can be seen in US case law, specifically in ''Melvin v. Reid'', and in ''Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.''&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931); Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Melvin v. Reid'' (1931), an ex-prostitute was charged with murder and then acquitted; she subsequently tried to assume a quiet and anonymous place in society. However, the 1925 film ''[[The Red Kimono]]'' revealed her history, and she successfully sued the producer.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Red {{sic|Kimono}}: The Saga of Gabriel Darley Melvin |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir |title=Guarding Life's Dark Secrets: Legal and Social Controls over Reputation, Propriety, and Privacy |location= |publisher=Stanford University Press |edition= |year=2007 |pages=217–225 |isbn=978-0-8047-5739-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court reasoned that "any person living a life of rectitude has that right to happiness which includes a freedom from unnecessary attacks on his character, social standing or reputation."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931) at 852-853&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.'' (1940), the plaintiff, [[William James Sidis]], was a former [[child prodigy]] who wished to spend his adult life quietly, without recognition; however, this was disrupted by an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; The court held here that there were limits to the right to control one's life and facts about oneself, and held that there is social value in published facts, and that a person cannot ignore their celebrity status merely because they want to.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is opposition to further recognition of the right to be forgotten in the United States as commentators argue that it will contravene the right to [[freedom of speech]] and freedom of expression, or will constitute [[censorship]], thus potentially breaching peoples' constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression in the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendel |first=John |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-journalists-shouldnt-fear-europes-right-to-be-forgotten/251955/ |title=Why Journalists Shouldn't Fear Europe's 'Right to be Forgotten' |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are consistent with the proposal that the only information that can be removed by user's request is content that they themselves uploaded.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;Walker, Robert K.

In a June 2014 opinion piece in Forbes, columnist Joseph Steinberg noted that "many privacy protections that Americans believe that they enjoy – even some guaranteed by law – have, in fact, been eroded or even obliterated by technological advances." Steinberg, in explaining the need for legislation guaranteeing the "right to be forgotten", noted that existing laws that require adverse information to be removed from credit reports after a period of time, and that allow the sealing or expunging of criminals records, are effectively undermined by the ability of prospective lenders or employers to forever find the removed information in a matter of seconds by doing a web search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/06/02/your-privacy-is-now-at-risk-from-search-engines-even-if-the-law-says-otherwise/ |author=Joseph Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg |title=Your Privacy Is Now At Risk From Search Engines -- Even If The Law Says Otherwise |publisher=Forbes |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2015, [[Intelligence Squared|Intelligence Squared US]], an organization that stages [[Debate#Oxford-style debating|Oxford-Style debates]], held an event centered on the question, "Should the U.S. adopt the 'Right to be Forgotten' online?" The side against the motion won with a 56% majority of the voting audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/1252-the-u-s-should-adopt-the-right-to-be-forgotten-online|title=The U.S. Should Adopt the 'Right to Be Forgotten' Online|work=intelligencesquaredus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While opinions among experts are divided in the U.S., one survey indicated that 9 in 10 Americans want some form of the right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adweek.com/prnewser/hey-google-9-in-10-americans-want-the-right-to-be-forgotten/111218|title = Hey Google: 9 in 10 Americans Want the 'Right to Be Forgotten'|website = Adweek|last = Coffee|first = Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer rights organization [[Consumer Watchdog]] has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for Americans to obtain the right as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/consumer-watchdog-google-should-extend-right-be-forgotten-u-s-n388131|title = Consumer Watchdog: Google Should Extend 'Right To Be Forgotten' to U.S.|website = NBC News|last = Eng|first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, [[State of New York|New York]] state senator [[Tony Avella]] and assemblyman [[David Weprin]] introduced a bill proposing that individuals be allowed to require search engines and online speakers to remove information that is "inaccurate", "irrelevant", "inadequate", or "excessive", that is "no longer material to current public debate or discourse" and is causing demonstrable harm to the subject.&lt;ref name="wp-nybill"&gt;{{cite web|title=N.Y. bill would require people to remove 'inaccurate,' 'irrelevant,' 'inadequate' or 'excessive' statements about others|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/03/15/n-y-bill-would-require-people-to-remove-inaccurate-irrelevant-inadequate-or-excessive-statements-about-others/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
In April 2016, the [[Delhi High Court]] began to examine the issue after a Delhi banker requested to have his personal details removed from search results following a marital dispute.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Delhi-banker-seeks-right-to-be-forgotten-online/articleshow/52060003.cms|title=Delhi banker seeks 'right to be forgotten' online - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, due to the dispute being settled, the banker's request is valid.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The High Court has asked for a reply from Google and other search engine companies by September 19, upon which the court will continue to investigate the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catchnews.com/tech-news/what-is-the-right-to-be-forgotten-and-how-it-will-affect-you-1462532182.html|title=What is the Right to be Forgotten and how it could affect you?|website=CatchNews.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 the [[Karnataka High Court]] upheld the right to be forgotten, in a case involving a woman who originally went to court in order to get a marriage certificate annulled, claiming to have never been married to the man on the certificate.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livelaw.in/first-indian-court-upholds-right-forgotten-read-order/|title=In A First An Indian Court Upholds The 'Right To Be Forgotten' [Read Order] {{!}} Live Law|date=2017-02-03|work=Live Law|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the two parties came to an agreement, the woman's father wanted her name to be removed from search engines regarding criminal cases in the high court.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Karnataka High Court approved the father's request, stating that she had a right to be forgotten. According to the court, its ruling would align with western countries' decisions, which typically approve of the right to be forgotten when dealing with cases "involving women in general and highly sensitive cases involving rape or affecting the modesty and reputation of the person concerned."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The woman in this specific case was worried that the search results would affect her standing with her husband, as well as her reputation in society.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

As of February 2017, the Delhi High Court is hearing a case involving a man requesting to have information regarding his mother and wife to be removed from a search engine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/right-to-be-forgotten-how-a-prudent-karnataka-hc-judgment-could-pave-the-way-for-privacy-laws-in-india-3270938.html|title=Right to be forgotten: How a prudent Karnataka HC judgment could pave the way for privacy laws in India|date=2017-02-07|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man believes that having his name linked to the search is hindering his employment options.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Delhi High Court is still working on the case, along with the issue of whether or not a right to be forgotten should be a legal standard in India.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Currently, there is no legal standard for the right to be forgotten, but if implemented, this would mean that citizens no longer need to file a case in order to request for information from search engines to be removed.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This case could have significant impacts on the right to be forgotten and search engines in India.

=== South Korea ===
In May 2016, [[Korea Communications Commission|South Korea's Korea Communications Commission]] (KCC) announced citizens will be able to request search engines and website administrators to restrict their own postings from being publicly accessible.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bna.com/south-korea-releases-n57982070847/|title=South Korea Releases Right to Be Forgotten Guidance|website=www.bna.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KCC released "[http://src.bna.com/eBy Guidelines on the Right to Request Access Restrictions on Personal Internet Postings]", which will take effect in June 2016, which will not apply to third party contents.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  To the extent that the right to be forgotten concerns a data subject's right to limit the searchability of third party postings about him/her, the Guideline does not constitute a right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/736858.html|title=방통위, '잊혀질 권리 가이드라인' 제정|date=2016-03-25|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, as to the right to withdraw one's own posting, critics have noted that people have been able to delete their own postings before the Guideline as long as they have retained their login credentials, and that people who have misplaced their login credentials were permitted to retrieve or receive new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byline.network/2016/04/1-94/|title=[심재석의 입장] 방통위의 이상한 '잊혀질 권리 가이드라인'|last=심재석|date=2016-04-01|website=BYLINE NETWORK|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only services significantly affected by the Guideline are Wiki-type services where people's contributions make logical sense only in response to or in conjunction with one another's contributions and therefore the postings are made permanent part of the mass-created content, but KCC made sure that the Guideline applies to these services only when the posting identifies the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/06/29/2016062902224.html|title='네이버 지식iN' 질문 글, 개인정보 남아 있을 때만 '잊혀질 권리' 적용|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines created by the KCC include that data subjects can remove content that includes the URL links, and any evidence consisting of personal information. The commission included different amendments to the guideline. This includes describing the Guidelines as a "minimum" and "preliminary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bna.com/south-korea-releases-n57982070847/|title=South Korea Releases Right to Be Forgotten Guidance|last=Lim|first=James|date=|website=Bloomberg BNA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; precaution regarding privacy rights in vague areas of existing laws. The guideline encompasses foreign Internet companies that provide translation services for South Korean consumers. In order to have a person's information "forgotten" he or she has to go through a three step process:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/561018/IT+internet/Korea+Communications+Commission+Releases+Guidelines+On+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten|title=Korea Communications Commission Releases Guidelines On "The Right to Be Forgotten"|last=Yulchon LLC|first=|date=|website=Mondaq|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the issue posted with the URL, proof of ownership of the post, grounds for the request. There are restrictions on each step. When posting the URL, the web operator has the right to preserve the posting issue. The second being that if the post is relevant to public interest, web operators will process this request on the terms of relevance.

=== China ===
In May 2016, Chinese courts in Beijing determined citizens do not have the right to be forgotten when a judge ruled in favor of [[Baidu]] in a lawsuit over removing search results.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sixthtone.com/news/chinese-have-no-right-be-forgotten-court-rules|title=Chinese Have No Right to Be Forgotten, Court Rules|last=Tone|first=Sixth|date=2016-05-05|website=Sixth Tone|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of such cases to be heard in Chinese court.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the suit, Ren Jiayu sued Chinese search engine Baidu over search results that associated him with a previous employer, Wuxi Taoshi Biotechnology.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ren argued that by posting the search results, Baidu had infringed upon his right of name and right of reputation, both protected under Chinese law.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of these protections, Ren believed he had a right to be forgotten by removing these search results.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The court ruled against Ren, claiming his name is a collection of common characters and as a result the search results were derived from relevant words.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

China has one of the longest histories as an entire nation, being over 2000 years of feudal society; their civil laws and personal rights have not been altered through legislative efforts. Nowhere in the country's civil agreement does it discuss the concept of "privacy", more specifically internet privacy, and the growing issue that citizens, "have the right to be forgotten" on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/research/publications/vuwlr/prev-issues/pdf/vol-36-2005/issue-3/jingchun.pdf|title=Protecting the Right to Privacy in China|last=Jingchun|first=Cao|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no data protection authority or a specific state agency set in place to monitor the protection of citizens personal data. In China today, data protection is aimed at simply the consumer, as an individual. In contrast to the EU's right to privacy, which the individual is considered a "data subject", with the right to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese legislation remains neutral, with slow progression towards the support of the "right to be forgotten". The topic has been debated for more than 10 years now, and continues to be a challenge. Small provisions have been implemented related to personal data processing, however they do not amount to a comprehensive data protection regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no solid, common ground to be found on two fundamentally different systems: realistic, to Chinese laws that are already in place, and legalist, the steps it takes to change those laws, approaches that elicit a need for reification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to international relations==
The regulatory differences in the protection of personal data between countries has real impact on international relations. The right to be forgotten, specifically, is a matter of EU-US relations when applied to cross-border data flow, as it raises questions about territorial sovereignty. The structure of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian international system]] assumes that the reach of a country's jurisdiction is limited to its geographic territory.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobrin | first1 = Stephen J. | year = 2004 | title = Safe harbours are hard to find: the trans-Atlantic data privacy dispute, territorial jurisdiction and global governance | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1017/S0260210504005856 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, online interactions are independent of geographic location and present across multiple locations, rendering the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty moot.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"/&gt; Therefore, the EU and the United States are forced to confront their regulatory differences and negotiate on a set of regulations that apply to all foreign companies processing and handling data of European citizens and residents.&lt;ref name="Stephen J.

The regulatory differences on the right to be forgotten along with numerous other data protection rights have shaped discussions and negotiations on trans-Atlantic data privacy regulations. A case in point is the EU and the United States' endeavors to develop the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|Safe Harbor]] agreement, a data transfer pact that enables the transfer of data between the EU and US companies in a manner consistent with the EU's data protection schemes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;The Council: Common Position (EC) no. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Article 25 of the Data Protection Directive articulates that cross-border transfer of data can take place only if the "third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection," meaning that the country meets the EU's minimum standards of data protection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The standards include, among many provisions, a component that protects the right to "opt out" of further processing or transmission of personal data, under the assumption that data may not be further processed in ways inconsistent with the intent for which they were collected.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; 

Given the inconsistencies between the EU and the United States on numerous [[digital privacy]] regulations, including the right to be forgotten, Article 25 poses a threat to trans-Atlantic data flows. Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to "opt out" and afford other protections.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Under the pressures of the mass surveillance carried out by the US government on European citizens' data, the Safe Harbor agreement has been invalidated by the [[European_Court_of_Justice|European Union Court of Justice]] in its [[Max Schrems|''Schrems'' case.]] The Safe Harbor agreement has now been replaced by the [[EU-US_Privacy_Shield|Privacy Shield principles]].

{{outofdate|section|date=February 2018}}
The 2012 draft European Data Protection Regulation Article 17 detailed the "right to be forgotten and to erasure".&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;{{Citation |year=2012 |title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) |at=Article 17 "Right to be forgotten and to erasure" |publisher=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 17 individuals to whom the data appertains are granted the right to "obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data, especially in relation to personal data which are made available by the data subject while he or she was a child or where the data is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected for, the subject withdraws consent, the storage period has expired, the data subject objects to the processing of personal data or the processing of data does not comply with other regulation".&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

The EU defines "data controllers" as "people or bodies that collect and manage personal data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/data-collection/index_en.htm |title=Who can collect and process personal data? - Justice |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU General Data Protection Regulation requires data controllers who have been informed that an individual has requested the deletion of any links to or copies of information must "take all reasonable steps, including technical measures, in relation to data for the publication of which the controller is responsible, to inform third parties which are processing such data, that a data subject requests them to erase any links to, or copy or replication of that personal data. Where the controller has authorized a third party publication of personal data, the controller shall be considered responsible for that publication".&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt; In the situation that a data controller does not take all reasonable steps then they will be fined heavily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/march/european-parliament-gives-overwhelming-backing-to-new-eu-data-protection-laws/ |title=European Parliament gives overwhelming backing to new EU data protection laws |publisher=Out-law.com |date=March 12, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union is a highly influential group of states, and this movement towards the right to be forgotten in the EU is a step towards its global recognition as a right. To support this, in 2012 the Obama Administration released a "Privacy Bill of Rights" to protect consumers online, and while this is not quite the strength of the EU law, it is a step towards recognition of the right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/23/fact-sheet-plan-protect-privacy-internet-age-adopting-consumer-privacy-b |title=Fact Sheet: Plan to Protect Privacy in the Internet Age by Adopting a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response by Reputation Management Firms==

Businesses that manage their client's online reputation have responded to the European Court ruling by excercising the right to be forgotten as a means to remove unfavourable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/reputation-vip-online-management-firm-launches-site-assist-googles-forget-form-194998|title=The Inevitable Happened: First Company Provides "Right To Be Forgotten" Removal Service|date=2014-06-25|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One technique used by reputation consulting firms is to submit multiple requests for each link, written with different angles in an attempt to get links removed. Google for example does not limit the number of requests that can be submitted on the removal of a given link.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/technology/european-companies-see-opportunity-in-the-right-to-be-forgotten.html|title=European Companies See Opportunity in the 'Right to Be Forgotten'|last=Scott|first=Mark|date=2014-07-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-03|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticism==
{{outofdate|section|reason=the General Data Protection Regulation is no longer in draft|date=February 2018}}
Major criticisms stem from the idea that the right to be forgotten would restrict the right to freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Eugene Volokh |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |title=Freedom of Speech, Information Privacy, and the Troubling Implications of a Right to Stop People from Speaking about You |year=2000 |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=1049–1124 |doi=10.2307/1229510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Daniel J.

The draft General Data Protection Regulation was written broadly and this has caused concern.&lt;ref name="fleischer"/&gt; It has attracted criticism that its enactment would require data controlling companies to go to great lengths to identify third parties with the information and remove it.&lt;ref name="stanfordlawreview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/right-to-be-forgotten |title=The Right to Be Forgotten |last=Rosen |first=Jeffrey |publisher=Stanford Law Review |volume=64 |issue=88 |date= February 13, 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed regulation has also attracted criticism due to the fact that this could produce a censoring effect in that companies, such as Facebook or Google, will wish to not be fined under the act, and will therefore be likely to delete wholesale information rather than facing the fine, which could produce a "serious chilling effect."&lt;ref name=" stanfordlawreview1"/&gt; In addition to this, there are concerns about the requirement to take down information that others have posted about an individual; the definition of personal data in Article 4(2) includes "any information relating to" the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011 |title=Document 52012PC0011 — Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |at=3.4.1. Chapter I - General Provisions, Article 4 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, critics have claimed, would require companies to take down any information relating to an individual, regardless of its source, which would amount to censorship, and result in the big data companies eradicating a lot of data to comply with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21543489 |title=Privacy laws: Private data, public rules |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-01-28 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such removal can impact the accuracy and ability of businesses and individuals to carry out [[business intelligence]], particularly [[due diligence]] to comply with antibribery, anticorruption, and [[know your customer]] laws.&lt;ref name="WSJ impact on business intelligence"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Jason|title=Some Things Should Not Be 'Forgotten'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jason-wright-some-things-should-not-be-forgotten-1421689011|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=19 January 2015|subscription=yes|quote=Consider the necessity for accurate business intelligence.

Other criticism revolves around the principle of [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zittrain|first1=Jonathan|title=The right to be forgotten ruling leaves nagging doubts|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c5d17a80-0910-11e4-8d27-00144feab7de.html#axzz3gL6XFlzC|accessdate=19 July 2015|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were concerns that the proposed General Data Protection Regulation would result in [[Google]] and other Internet search engines not producing neutral search results, but rather producing biased and patchy results, and compromising the [[integrity]] of Internet-based information.&lt;ref name="stanfordlawreview1"/&gt; To balance out this criticism, the proposed General Data Protection Regulation included an exception "for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression in order to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the rules governing freedom of expression."&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt; Article 80 upheld freedom of speech, and while not lessening obligations on data providers and social media sites, nevertheless due to the wide meaning of "journalistic purposes" allows more autonomy and reduces the amount of information that is necessary to be removed.&lt;ref name="mantelero"/&gt;{{rp|9}} When Google agreed to implement the ruling, European Commission Vice-President [[Viviane Reding]] said, "The Court also made clear that journalistic work must not be touched; it is to be protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/data-protection/news/140602_en.htm | title='Right to be forgotten' and online search engines ruling | publisher=European Commission | date=2014-06-03 | accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Google was criticized for taking down (under the Costeja precedent) a BBC News blog post about [[Stan O'Neal]] by economics editor [[Robert Peston]] (eventually, Peston reported that his blog post has remained findable in Google after all).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28130581 | title=Why has Google cast me into oblivion? | work=BBC News | date=2 July 2014 | accessdate=2014-07-03 | author=Peston, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/the_right_to_be_forgotten_is_already_messing_up_journalism_20140702 | title=The 'Right to Be Forgotten' Is Already Messing Up Journalism | work=Truthdig | date=July 2, 2014 | accessdate=2014-07-03 | author=Scheer, Peter Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these criticisms and Google's action, the company's CEO, [[Larry Page]] worries that the ruling will be "used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things", though has since distanced himself from that position.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/24/google-hauled-in-by-europe-over-right-to-be-forgotten-reaction|title=Google hauled in by Europe over 'right to be forgotten' reaction|author=Samuel Gibbs|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, pianist [[Dejan Lazic]] cited the ''Right To Be Forgotten'' in trying to remove a negative review about his performance from ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

Other criticisms involving the right to be forgotten revolves around the policies for data removal regarding minors. The U.S. has laws in place that protect the privacy of minors.

"A Tory victory on the 8th of June will lead to those youthful indiscretions on Facebook and Twitter being open to erasure. But there are also plans to fine social media firms for not moving at the speed of political opportunism over extreme content."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The United Kingdom has not yet fully adopted the ruling of the [[European Court of Justice]] regarding the right to be forgotten and argued to keep it from going into EU law.{{fact|date=February 2018}} However, in the upcoming elections in the UK laws could be passed to allow minors to remove embarrassing posts or photos on social media that could come back to affect job applications or public image in later life.

[[Theresa May]], the Prime Minister of the UK, has been pushing to extend privacy rights for minors in allowing them to have a right to delete information. The intentions for this extension of privacy are based on the fact that social media sites store years of data that affect minors lives' much later after the information is posted.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-12/may-tells-facebook-to-offer-kids-right-to-delete-information|title=May Tells Facebook to Offer Kids the Right to Delete Information|date=2017-05-12|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; May gave her stance on privacy when she said, "'The Internet has brought a wealth of opportunity but also significant new risks which have evolved faster than society's response to them'".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which is headed by May, has pushed for policies that aggressively removes illegal material from the internet and fines firms that do not take action in removing said material.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In 2015, [[Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés]] (CNIL), the data privacy watchdog of France trird to impose the right globally. CNIL asked [[Google]] to remove data from all versions available in any part of the world. Google and other entities argued that European data regulators should not be allowed to decide what Internet users around the world find when they use a search engine.&lt;ref&gt; [https://previewtech.net/right-to-be-forgotten-globally-google-cnil-france/ France tries to impose ‘Right to be Forgotten’ globally.

[[File:Oblivion Framework Architecture new.png|thumb|right|Conceptual overview of Oblivion]]
Security researchers from CISPA, Saarland University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cispa.saarland|title = CISPA: The Center for IT-Security, Privacy, and Accountability}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Auckland&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/en.html|title = The University of Auckland}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework, called Oblivion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Simeonovski |first=Milivoj | last2=Bendun |first2=Fabian |last3=Asghar |first3=Muhammad Rizwan | last4=Backes |first4=Michael| last5=Marnau |first5=Ninja |last6=Druschel |first6=Peter | eprint=1506.06033 |title=Oblivion: Mitigating Privacy Leaks by Controlling the Discoverability of Online Information |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support the automation of the right to be forgotten in a scalable, provable and privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion is a program that helps to "automate" the process of attempting to verify someone's personal information that could be found in a Google search result."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google gets many take-down requests at a high volume, so Oblivion is able to help with this problem. Researchers and authors behind Oblivion say that "it is essential to develop techniques that at least partly automate this process and are scalable to internet size."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Oblivion helps the humans that operate the forms at Google ensure that ill-intending users cannot "blacklist links to internet sources that do not affect them."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, tests have proven that Oblivion handles requests at a rate of 278 per second.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The software allows Google, the government, and the user to work together to get content removed quickly and for just cause. In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system.

In the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves – not limited to "name, age, and nationality."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an "ownership token"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this "ownership token" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid.

Researchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own "whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Selective perception''' is the tendency not to notice and more quickly forget stimuli that cause emotional discomfort and contradict our prior beliefs. For example, a teacher may have a favorite student because they are biased by [[in-group favoritism]]. The teacher ignores the student's poor attainment. Conversely, they might not notice the progress of their least favorite student.&lt;ref name="Griffin2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ricky W. Griffin|title=Fundamentals of Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fx235bL0HTcC&amp;pg=PA259|date=31 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-62749-4|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
'''Selective perception''' is the process by which individuals perceive what they want to in media messages while ignoring opposing viewpoints. It is a broad term to identify the behavior all people exhibit to tend to "see things" based on their particular [[Framing (social sciences)|frame of reference]]. It also describes how we categorize and interpret sensory information in a way that favors one category or interpretation over another. In other words, selective perception is a form of bias because we interpret information in a way that is congruent with our existing values and beliefs. Psychologists believe this process occurs automatically.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lucas Counselling. (2009, December 29). Psychology Definition Of The Week: Selective Perception. Retrieved March 18, 2013, from https://web.archive.org/web/20120416014147/http://counsellingcentral.com/psychology-definition-of-the-week-selective-perception&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective perception may refer to any number of [[cognitive bias]]es in [[psychology]] related to the way expectations affect [[perception]]. Human judgment and decision making is distorted by an array of cognitive, perceptual and motivational biases, and people tend not to recognise their own bias, though they tend to easily recognise (and even overestimate) the operation of bias in human judgment by others.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Pronin, "[http://web.missouri.edu/~segerti/capstone/Biasinjudgement.pdf Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment]," ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences,'' Volume 11, Issue 1, January 2007, pp. 37–43.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons this might occur might be because people are simply bombarded with too much stimuli every day to pay equal attention to everything, therefore, they pick and choose according to their own needs.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100522194645/http://lilt.ilstu.edu/rrpope/rrpopepwd/articles/perception3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand when and why a particular region of a scene is selected, studies observed and described the eye movements of individuals as they go about performing specific tasks. In this case, vision was an active process that integrated scene properties with specific, goal-oriented oculomotor behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Canosa, R.L. (2009). Real-world vision: selective perception and task. ACM Trans. Appl. Percpt., 6, 2, Article 11, 34 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other studies have shown that students who were told they were consuming [[alcohol]]ic beverages (which in fact were non-alcoholic) perceived themselves as being "[[drunk]]", exhibited fewer physiological symptoms of social stress, and drove a simulated car similarly to other subjects who had actually consumed alcohol. The result is somewhat similar to the [[placebo effect]].{{Fact|reason=What does this have to do with the topic?|date=October 2007}}

In one classic study on this subject related to the [[hostile media effect]] (which is itself an example of selective perception), viewers watched a filmstrip of a particularly violent [[Princeton University|Princeton]]-[[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] [[American football]] game. Princeton viewers reported seeing nearly twice as many rule infractions committed by the Dartmouth team than did Dartmouth viewers. One Dartmouth alumnus did not see any infractions committed by the Dartmouth side and erroneously assumed he had been sent only part of the film, sending word requesting the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Hastorf, A.H. &amp; Cantril, H. (1954). They saw a game: A case study. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 49, 129–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective perception is also an issue for advertisers, as consumers may engage with some ads and not others based on their pre-existing beliefs about the brand. 

Seymour Smith, a prominent advertising researcher, found evidence for selective perception in advertising research in the early 1960s, and he defined it to be "a procedure by which people let in, or screen out, advertising material they have an opportunity to see or hear. They do so because of their attitudes, beliefs, usage preferences and habits, conditioning, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, Theodore and Smith, Seymour.  "Advertising Works—And Advertising Research Does Too." Presentation to [[ESOMAR]]. Spain: 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt; People who like, buy, or are considering buying a brand are more likely to notice advertising than are those who are neutral toward the brand. This fact has repercussions within the field of [[advertising research]] because any post-advertising analysis that examines the differences in attitudes or buying behavior among those aware versus those unaware of advertising is flawed unless pre-existing differences are controlled for. Advertising research methods that utilize a [[longitudinal design]] are arguably better equipped to control for selective perception.  

Selective perceptions are of two types:
* Low level – [[Perceptual vigilance]]
* High level – [[Perceptual defense]]

'''Self-monitoring''' is a concept introduced during the 1970s by [[Mark Snyder (psychologist)|Mark Snyder]], that shows how much people monitor their self-presentations, expressive behavior, and nonverbal [[affective display]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Day and  Schleicher, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings generally differ in substantial ways in their abilities and desires to engage in expressive controls (see [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgy]]).&lt;ref name="Snyder, 1974"&gt;Snyder, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as a [[personality trait]] that refers to an ability to regulate behavior to accommodate social situations. People concerned with their expressive self-presentation (see [[impression management]]) tend to closely monitor their audience in order to ensure appropriate or desired public appearances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Self-monitors try to understand how individuals and groups will perceive their actions. Some [[personality type]]s commonly act spontaneously (low self-monitors) and others are more apt to purposely control and consciously adjust their behavior (high self-monitors).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Recent studies suggest that a distinction should be made between acquisitive and protective self-monitoring due to their different interactions with metatraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilmot|first=Michael P.|last2=DeYoung|first2=Colin G.|last3=Stillwell|first3=David|last4=Kosinski|first4=Michal|date=2016-06-01|title=Self-Monitoring and the Metatraits|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12162/abstract|journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=84|issue=3|pages=335–347|doi=10.1111/jopy.12162|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiates the motive behind self-monitoring behaviours: for the purpose of acquiring appraisal from others (acquisitive) or protecting oneself from social disapproval (protective).

==Historical context==
===Major case studies===
There are many cases in which self-monitoring is used a variable of interest. Many recent studies look into the relationship with on-task behavior, work-place utilization, and leadership positions.

A pilot study regarding on-task behavior was done with two high school students with symptoms of learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Wills. (2014). Implementation of a self-monitoring application to improve on-task behavior: A high school pilot study.&lt;/ref&gt; These students were trained using a self-monitoring application and given prompts and the results showed positive, stable improvements in their on-task behavior after each individual's self-monitoring was increased.

When looking at theoretical and empirical evidence in self-monitoring in the work-place, research indicates that high self-monitors are proficient in meeting the social expectations and increasing their leadership outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Schleicher. (2006). Self-Monitoring at Work: A Motive-Based Perspective.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the study done by Day and Schleicher emphasize that the higher the individual scores on the scale, the more successful the individual tends to be as determined from the criteria of getting along, getting ahead, and making sense.

The relationship between self-monitoring and career mobility in particular was studied with a research pool of Masters of Business Administration graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Kilduff. (1994). Do Chameleons Get Ahead? The Effects of Self-Monitoring on Managerial Careers.&lt;/ref&gt; High self-monitors are reported to be more likely to change employers, change work locations, and achieve promotions in comparison to low self-monitors.

===Controversy and confusion===
Self-monitoring, despite all the research and theory behind it, has been shrouded with controversy and confusion with respect to its actual existence.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, M. &amp; Gangestad, S. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The initial confusion arose because factor analyses were conducted which revealed that the structure of most items of the Self-Monitoring Scale was multifactorial. Three factors appeared necessary to account for the correlations between the items for the measure, interpreted as Acting (e.g. "I would probably make a good actor"), Extraversion (e.g. "In a group of people, I am rarely the center of attention"), and Other-Directedness (e.g. "I guess I put on a show to entertain or impress other people") (Snyder, M. &amp; Gangestad, S. (2000)). Though these factor analyses are used as instruments to measure the level of self monitoring, they have prompted the question of the existence of self-monitoring. Mark Snyder and Steven W. Gangestad, (2000) argued through a series of quantitative experiments that it is indeed a real unitary phenomenon by showing that external criterion measures representing a wide array of phenomena relating to expressive control all point to self-monitoring as a real causal phenomena.

Additionally, they argue that the external criterion variables are generally most directly tapped by the Self-Monitoring Scale rather than being tapped by the measures of Extraversion, Social [[Surgency]], or Other-Directedness, meaning that Self-Monitoring can better describe the factors that contribute to a person's personality than the combination of these. Measures of these three factors relate to the self-monitoring criterion only with respect to the fact that they have similar variance with the self-monitoring dimension, with Other-Directedness being the most highly related to Self-Monitoring. Hence, through answering these two questions, doubts regarding the existence of the Self-Monitoring phenomena were clearly dispelled.

==Scale==
Snyder's self monitoring scale was developed in 1974. It measures whether or not an individual has the will and ability to change how they are perceived by utilizing impression management in various social interactions. The score is based on twenty five questions that the individual answers according to their thought process and is used to determine how an individual may manipulate nonverbal signals and adjusts theirs actions according to a situation. The score is calculated based on how the individuals responds to True and False questions.

===Low self monitors===
Low self-monitors tend to exhibit expressive controls congruent with their own internal states; i.e. [[beliefs]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[dispositions]] regardless of social circumstance. Low self-monitors are often less observant of social context and consider expressing a self-presentation dissimilar from their internal states as a falsehood and undesirable.&lt;ref name="sandg02"&gt;Snyder &amp; Gangestad, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; People who are unwilling to self-monitor and adjust their behavior accordingly are often aggressive, uncompromising, and insistent with others. This may make them more prone to condemnation, rejection, and the possible consequent feelings of anger, anxiety, guilt, low self-concept, isolation, and depression. Even the occasional indiscretion can make social situations awkward, and could result in the loss of a friend, co-worker, client, or even job. Those who are willing to adjust their behavior will often find that others are more receptive, pleasant, and benevolent towards them.

===High self monitors===
Individuals who closely monitor themselves are categorized as high self-monitors. They often behave in a manner that is highly responsive to social cues and their situational context. High self-monitors can be thought of as social pragmatists who project images in an attempt to impress others and receive positive feedback. In comparison to low self-monitors, high self monitors participate in more expressive control and have concern for situational appropriateness. As these individuals are willing to adjust their behavior, others may perceive them to be more receptive, pleasant, and benevolent towards them.

===Low vs high self monitors===
A low score on the self-monitoring scale can range anywhere from 0-8 and a high score ranges from 15-22.&lt;ref name="Snyder, 1974"&gt;Snyder, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Some traits of high self-monitors include readily and easily modifying their behavior in response to the demands of the situation, whereas low self-monitors care little about modifying their behavior in response to the situation and tend to maintain the same opinions and attitudes regardless of the situation.&lt;ref name="Sanderson, C. A. 2010"&gt;Sanderson, C. A. (2010). Social psychology. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley ;.&lt;/ref&gt;  High self-monitors find it much easier to modify their behavior based on the situation than low self-monitors do. High self-monitors would be more likely to change their beliefs and opinions depending on who they are talking to, while low self-monitors would tend to be consistent throughout all situations. This has been studied mainly in correspondence with relationships. Compared to low self-monitors, high self-monitors will have more dating and sexual partners, are more interested in having sex with people they are not in love with, and are more likely to have had sex with someone only once, as well as be more likely to deceive potential romantic partners.&lt;ref name="Sanderson, C. A. 2010"/&gt; High self-monitors are more likely to choose a romantic partner who is attractive but unsociable, while low self-monitors are more likely to choose a partner who is unattractive but sociable.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Berscheid &amp; Glick, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; High self-monitors are also more likely to take on leadership positions than low self-monitors.&lt;ref&gt;Eby, Cader &amp; Noble, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, for example, differences in self-monitoring based on sexual orientation have been documented in rural areas and small towns but do not seem to exist in the context of large cities, which tend to be more tolerant of minority sexual orientations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Individualistic differences==
{{close paraphrasing|section|source=https://ici.umn.edu/products/impact/182/182.pdf|talk=Individualistic differences|date=December 2017}}
Self-monitoring is useful for students from preschool to adulthood and can be taught to individuals at a variety of levels of cognitive functioning. Self-monitoring interventions foster independent functioning, which allows individuals with disabilities to rely less on prompts from others.&lt;ref&gt;(Koegel, Koegel, Harrower, and Carter, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Self-monitoring interventions are among the most flexible, useful, and effective strategies for students with academic and behavioral difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;(Mitchum, Young, West, &amp; Benyo, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; They have demonstrated efficacy for targeting a range of academic abilities,&lt;ref&gt;(Rock, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; self-help skills,&lt;ref&gt;(Pierce and Schreibman, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; behavioral problems,&lt;ref&gt;(Todd, Horner, and Sugai, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and social behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;(Strain &amp; Kohler, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Students with behavioral and academic difficulties typically have limited awareness and understanding of their own behavior and its effects on others. Self-monitoring interventions equip students to recognize and keep track of their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;(Hoff and DuPaul, 1998; Rhode, Morgan, and Young, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Using these strategies, students can learn to identify and increase positive, pro-social behaviors, the behaviors necessary for success in general education settings. Self-monitoring strategies are individualized plans used to increase independent functioning in academic, behavioral, self-help, and social areas. Rather than focusing on reducing a student’s undesired behavior, self-monitoring strategies develop skills that lead to an increase in appropriate behavior. When self-monitoring skills increase, corresponding reductions in undesired behaviors often occur, even without direct intervention.&lt;ref&gt;(Dunlap, Clarke, Jackson, Wright, 1995; Koegel, Koegel, Harrower, and Carter, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This collateral behavior change allows teachers and parents to address multiple behaviors with one efficient intervention.
The five steps involved in planning a self-monitoring intervention:
# Identify the target behavior.
# Select/design a self-monitoring system.
# Choose reinforcers and how the student will earn them.
# Teach the student to use the system.
# Fade the role of the adult in the intervention.

===Social approach===
It's been argued that [[individualism]] should influence self-monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst et al., (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures high on individualism focus on the self, not others. In [[individualistic culture]]s, knowing the context is not necessary to predict others' behavior, thus people from individualistic cultures are more likely to be low self-monitors. Cultures low on individualism (i.e., [[collectivism|collectivist culture]]s), in contrast, value [[conformity]] to [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroups]] and group memberships. In collectivistic cultures, knowing the context and social status of the other person is essential to predicting his or her behavior. Thus, people from collectivistic cultures are more likely to be high self-monitors.&lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, W. B., Gao, G., Nishida, T., Bond, M. H., Leung, K., Wang, G., et al. (1989). A Cross-cultural Comparison Of Self-monitoring. Communication Research Reports, 6(1), 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Job performance====
It has been shown that there is a significant relation between an individual's performance at his job and his or her ability to change their self-presentation in order to most adapt to the situation. Self-monitoring was most important during early tenure.&lt;ref name="Caldwell 1981"&gt;Caldwell (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; This history of finding individual difference variables that relate to [[job performance]] has been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Bem &amp; Allen (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons why it is difficult to use individual difference variables to predict job performance is because there is failure to consider contextual effects such as informational influence and pressures for conformity. Other difficulties are a result from attempting to use personality measures without having a good understanding of the nature of the job and the individual's development in the job. This results in the individual differences being assessed without fully understanding why they should affect job performance directly or how they may affect an individual's performance when you take into consideration increased job knowledge that an individual may gain through experience.&lt;ref&gt;Salancik and Pfeffer (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

One case that shows how success could be related to individual predispositions is in organizations where individuals hold boundary-spanning positions. Boundary spanners purpose is to filter and transfer information across organizational boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich and Herker, 1977, Tushman, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals that are responsible for this transfer of information may be in a roles both inside and outside the organization. Therefore, they should be able to respond to social and informational stimuli, inside and outside the organization. The nature of this job makes it likely that an individual's performance in this role is likely to be influenced the degree to which that person can perceive, understand and adapt to different social situations as appropriate. In essence, an individual who is a high self-monitor would be better at responding to different social cues and hence be more equipped to transfer information effectively across organizational borders and consequently a higher performer.&lt;ref name="Caldwell 1981"/&gt;

Over time, however, the competitive advantage that high self monitors have over low self monitors reduced as job knowledge increases through experience and poor performers leave boundary spanning roles.&lt;ref name="Snyder, 1974"/&gt;

====Social impacts====
Riggio et al., (1982) suggests that the self-monitoring as monitored by the self-monitoring scale is a multidimensional construct and is composed of many elements central to social interaction. It was determined that the elements of self-monitoring appear to be "charisma", "performance", and "social sensitivity". Therefore, it is determinable that those with high levels of self-monitoring had greater skill at navigating and bridging social situations while in contrast, those with lower levels of self-monitoring may struggle in the same situations.&lt;ref&gt;Riggio and Friedman 1982. The Interrelationships of Self-Monitoring Factors, Personality Traits, and Nonverbal Social Skills&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences between how high self monitors and low self monitors treat relationships and social situations stem from the differences in what they seek to gain out of their social life and their understanding of self. High self-monitors view their self as a product of social interactions and their own adaptability in various social settings. In contrast, low self-monitors view their self as a product of personal dispositions and their effects on social situations. High self-monitors look for friends with similar activity preferences, while low self-monitors look for friends with similar attitudes. High self-monitors also generally end up becoming close to other high self-monitors, and vice versa with low self-monitors.&lt;ref name="Leone 2006"&gt;Leone &amp; Hawkins (2006). Self-Monitoring and Close Relationships&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationships====
High self-monitors look for a social context that allows flexibility and adaptability to play a multitude of roles without role conflict. High self-monitors are more likely to believe in the idea that there are multiple people one can love, and focus on attributes such as physical attractiveness,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Buchanan, 2000; Glick, 1985, Jones, 1993; Snyder, Berscheid, &amp; Glick, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; sex appeal,&lt;ref&gt;(Jones, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; social status, and financial resources.&lt;ref name="Jones, 1993"&gt;Jones, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the attachments high self-monitors form with their significant others are more avoidant, and they can feel uncomfortable with significant others that have higher levels of intimacy than themselves. Low self-monitors on the other hand look for a social context that gives them the freedom and security to express their emotions and dispositions freely without any interpersonal conflicts. They are more likely to believe in the idea of “one true love”, and look for attributes such as personality desirability,&lt;ref&gt;(e.g., Buchanan, 2000; Glick, 1985; Snyder et al., 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; similarity of values and beliefs, and other dispositions like honesty, responsibility, and kindness.&lt;ref name="Jones, 1993"/&gt; This leads to more secure relationships being formed, and level of intimacy is not a problem.&lt;ref&gt;(Gaines et al., 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leone 2006"/&gt;

==Similar processes==
===Self presentation===
There is a strong connection between self-monitoring and [[self-presentation]], as it's proven that people who are high self-monitoring have greater cognitive access to self-presentation related concepts than people who are low self-monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Kearns, McIntyre, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a 100-person experiment, it was found out that high-self monitors more quickly linked positive personality traits to themselves following exposure to impression-related words, proving  high self-monitors possess a heightened capacity to cognitively process self-presentation information. High self-monitors rely on social information to guide their self-presentations since they vary their presentations based on different social cues. They are also, compared to low self-monitors, more likely to recall personal information about an upcoming interaction partner, are better able to judge emotional displays, are more skilled at decoding nonverbal behaviors, show better performance on interpersonal perception tasks, are more focused on their interaction partners, and they seek out and consider more information about an audience when trying to convey a particular identity.

Essentially, Tyler, Kearns and McIntyres argue that high self-monitoring people are more likely to seek out social cues and information through interactions, following which they will employ this information in their behaviour, hence portraying a self presentation or image that they want to. Additionally, they are more sensitive to social cues and social information.  People low in self-monitoring, however, would behave as themselves in most cases and hence not have an option in the self-presentation that they project, as well as being less sensitive to social information present around them.

===Social psychology theory===
There are several theories within [[social psychology]] that are closely related to the self-monitoring construct. [[Icek Ajzen]] argues that subjective norms are an important antecedent to determining behavioral intention in the [[theory of reasoned action]]/[[theory of planned behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; High self-monitors tend to weigh subjective norms more heavily than low self-monitors. Studies that evaluate private attitudes and public actions include Ajzen, Timko and White, 1982; and DeBono and Omoto, 1993. Informational cascades theory is related to observation learning theory which was developed by Bikhchandani, S.; Hirshleifer, D. and Welch, I. (1992) and describes how people will follow, sometimes blindly, the actions of others. The self-monitoring construct would identify that high self-monitors may be more susceptible to [[informational cascades]] and [[herd mentality]]. This can be a problem if a culture of [[groupthink]] is part of the organizations decision making process. High self-monitors are more motivated to attain high social status than low self-monitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=P.|author2=Kim, J. |title=Self-Monitoring, Opinion Leadership and Opinion Seeking: a Sociomotivational Approach |journal=Current Psychology|year=2011|volume=30|pages=203–214|doi=10.1007/s12144-011-9114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research drawing on the [[elaboration likelihood model]] suggests that high self-monitors, more than low self-monitors, react favorably to peripheral processing of advertising images consistent with high social status.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder and DeBono, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeBono and Packer, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shavitt, Lowrey, and Han, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shibboleth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=GT Shibboleth.ogg|ˈ|ʃ|ɪ|b|əl|ɛ|θ|,_|-|ɪ|θ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editors=Peter Roach, James Hartmann and Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=3-12-539683-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Shibboleth}}&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[Convention (norm)|custom]] or tradition, particularly a speech pattern, that distinguishes one group of people (an [[ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]]) from others ([[ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', 8th ed, (Oxford University Press, 1990), 1117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shibboleth shibboleth], accessed online 22 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary'', [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shibboleth shibboleth], accessed online 22 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Shibboleths have been used throughout history in many societies as [[password]]s, simple ways of self-identification, signaling loyalty and affinity, maintaining traditional segregation or keeping out perceived threats.

==Origin==
The term originates from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''shibbólet'' ({{Hebrew|שִׁבֹּלֶת}}), which literally means the part of a plant containing grains, such as an [[Ear (botany)|ear of corn]] or a stalk of [[grain]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Wahrig|Wahrig Deutsches Wörterbuch]], Sixth Edition and {{cite web|work=Meyers Lexikon online |title=Schibboleth |url=http://lexikon.meyers.de/meyers/Schibboleth}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in different contexts, "stream, torrent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[American Heritage Dictionary]], also sometimes rye, Fourth Edition |title=shibboleth |url=http://www.tfd.com/shibboleth}} {{cite web|work=[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary |title=shibboleth |url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/shibboleth}} (this latter meaning is not in use in [[Modern Hebrew]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Isaiah 27:12.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern use derives from an account in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in which pronunciation of this word was used to distinguish [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraimites]], whose dialect used a differently sounding first consonant. The difference concerns the Hebrew letter ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]]'', which is now pronounced as {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (as in '''''[[voiceless postalveolar fricative|sh]]'''oe'').&lt;ref name="HessBlock2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Hess|author2=Daniel I. Block|author3=Dale W. Manor|title=Joshua, Judges, and Ruth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1gzCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT352|date=12 January 2016|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-52759-6|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recorded in the [[Book of Judges]], chapter 12, after the inhabitants of [[Gilead]] inflicted a military defeat upon the invading tribe of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] (around 1370–1070 BCE), the surviving Ephraimites tried to cross the River Jordan back into their home territory and the Gileadites secured the river's fords to stop them.  To identify and kill these Ephraimites, the Gileadites told each suspected survivor to say the word ''shibboleth''. The Ephraimite dialect resulted in a pronunciation that, to Gileadites, sounded like ''sibboleth''.&lt;ref name="HessBlock2016" /&gt;  In the [[King James Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Judges|12:5-6|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anecdote appears thus (with the word already in its current English spelling):
&lt;blockquote&gt;And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;&lt;br /&gt;Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern use==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}

In numerous cases of [[Group conflict|conflict between groups]] speaking different languages or dialects, one side used shibboleths in a way similar to the above-mentioned Biblical use, i.e., to discover hiding members of the opposing group. Modern researchers use the term "shibboleth" for all such uses, whether or not the people involved were using it themselves.

In modern [[American English]], a shibboleth also has a wider meaning, referring to any "in-group" word or phrase that can distinguish members of a group from outsiders – even when not used by a hostile other group. It is also sometimes used in a broader sense to mean [[jargon]], the proper use of which identifies speakers as members of a particular group or subculture.

The term shibboleth can also be extended, as in the discipline of [[semiotics]], to describe non-linguistic elements of culture such as diet, fashion and cultural values.

Cultural [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s and shared experience can also be shibboleths of a sort. For example, people about the same age who are from the same nation tend to have [[Collective memory|the same memories]] of popular songs, television shows, and events from their formative years. [[One-hit wonder]]s prove particularly distinctive. Much the same is true of alumni of a particular school, veterans of military service, and other groups. Discussing such memories is a common way of [[Human bonding|bonding]]. [[In-joke]]s can be a similar type of shared-experience shibboleth.

By analogy with the biblical account, in information technology a [[shibboleth (Shibboleth Consortium)|shibboleth]] is a community-wide password that enables a member of that community to access an online resource without revealing her individual identity.  The origin server can vouch for the identity of the individual user without giving the target server any further identifying information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Technically Speaking: Can You Say "Shibboleth"?|last=Dorman|first=David|date=October 2002|volume=33|issue=9|journal=American Libraries|pages=86–7|publisher=American Library Association|jstor=25648483}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence the individual user does not know the password that is actually employed – it is generated internally by the origin server – and so cannot betray it to outsiders.

Yet another more pejorative usage involves underlining the fact that the original meaning of a symbol has in effect been lost and that the symbol now serves merely to identify allegiance, being described as "nothing more than a shibboleth".

[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]-laureate [[economics|economist]] [[Paul Samuelson]] applied the term "shibboleth" in works including ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' to an idea for which "the means becomes the end, and the letter of the law takes precedence over the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Natural Resources, Uncertainty, and General Equilibrium Systems: Essays in Memory of Rafael Lusky |location= New York |publisher=Academic Press |year= 1977 |pages=175–195 |chapter=When it is ethically optimal to allocate money income in stipulated fractional shares |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UKeJEc46R9AC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=samuelson%20shibboleth%20definition&amp;pg=PR5-IA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |isbn=978-0-12-106150-0 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuelson admitted that "shibboleth" is an imperfect term for this phenomenon, and sometimes used "[[fetish (disambiguation)|fetish]]" as a synonym, though he complained that the latter "has too pejorative a ring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |date=February 1956 |title=Social Indifference Curves |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQQFn8Vk470C&amp;lpg=PA1083&amp;dq=paul%20samuelson%20shibboleth&amp;pg=PA1073#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |accessdate=2011-02-03 |doi=10.2307/1884510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Password for life |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/10/05/art12.asp |first=Anurada |last=Malalasekara |website=Daily News |publisher=Daily News (Sri Lankan State Newspaper) |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{Main|List of shibboleths}}
Shibboleths have been used by different subcultures throughout the world at different times.  Regional differences, level of expertise, and computer coding techniques are several forms that shibboleths have taken.

The legend goes that before the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs|Guldensporenslag (Battle of the Golden Spurs)]] in May 1302, the Flemish slaughtered every Frenchman they could find in the city of [[Bruges]], an act known as the ''[[Bruges Matins (history)|Brugse Metten]]''.&lt;ref name="Devries"&gt;Devries, Kelly. ''Infantry Warfare in the Early 14th Century.'' N.p.: Boydell, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They identified Frenchmen based on their inability to pronounce the Flemish phrase ''{{lang|nl|schilt ende vriend}}'' (shield and friend), or possibly ''{{lang|nl|'s Gilden vriend}}'' (friend of the Guilds). However, many Medieval Flemish dialects did not contain the cluster ''sch-'' either (even today's [[Kortrijk]] dialect has ''sk-''), and Medieval French rolled the r just as Flemish did.&lt;ref name=liberman&gt;Although the website [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003344.html Language Log: Born on the 11th of July] says that the {{IPA|/sχ/}} cluster in ''schild'' that makes it difficult for French-speakers to pronounce had not yet developed in the 14th century, the phrase "{{lang|fr|scilt en vrient}}" is referenced in primary sources such as the Chronique of [[Gilles Li Muisis]] as distinguishing French from Flemish.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'' ({{audio|Nl-Schibbolet-fries.oga|example}}) means "Butter, rye bread and green cheese, whoever cannot say that is not a genuine Frisian" was used by the [[Frisians|Frisian]] [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] during a [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian rebellion]] (1515–1523).

The Dutch used the name of the seaside town of [[Scheveningen]] as a shibboleth to tell Germans from the Dutch ("Sch" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is analyzed as the letter "[[s]]" and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] "ch", producing the [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|[sx]}}, while in [[German language|German]] it is analyzed as the [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] "[[sch (trigraph)|sch]]," pronounced {{IPAblink|ʃ}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://column.emea.nl/?p=3163 "Zonder ons erbij te betrekken"] Retrieved on 23 december 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corstius, H.

In Sardinia 28 April is celebrated as ''sa dii de s'aciappa'' (the day of pursuit and capture) or [[Sa die de sa Sardigna]] (Sardinia's Day). On that date in 1794 people in Cagliari chased suspected officers of the ruling Piedmontese king and asked them to say ''nara cixidi'' (Sardinian for ‘chickpea’), which the Piedmontese could not pronounce. Some 514 officers were thus identified and sent back to the mainland.

In October 1937 the Spanish word for parsley, ''perejil'', was used as a shibboleth to identify Haitian immigrants living along the border in the Dominican Republic. The president of the Dominican Republic, [[Rafael Trujillo]], ordered the execution of these people. It is alleged that between 20,000 and 30,000 individuals were murdered within a few days in the [[Parsley Massacre]], although more recent scholarship and the lack of evidence such as mass graves puts the actual total as low as 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vega|first=Bernardo|title=La matanza de 1937|url=http://www.lalupa.com.do/2012/10/la-matanza-de-1937/|work=La lupa sin trabas|accessdate=7 January 2014|language=Spanish|date=10 October 2012|quote=Durante los meses de octubre y diciembre de 1937, fuentes haitianas, norteamericanas e inglesas ubicadas en Haití dieron cifras que oscilaron entre 1,000 y 12,168|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001432/http://www.lalupa.com.do/2012/10/la-matanza-de-1937/|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Black July]]  riots of Sri Lanka in 1983 many Tamils were massacred by Sinhalese youths. In many cases these massacres took the form of boarding buses and getting the passengers to pronounce words that had hard BAs at the start of the word (like ''Baldiya'' – bucket) and executing the people who found it difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyndman|first1=Patricia|title=Senior Lecturer in Law, University of New South Wales|url=http://blackjuly.info/quotestext.html|publisher=Lawasia Human Rights Standing Committee Report -Democracy in Peril, June 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Tim|title=INSIDER, OUTSIDER: LANGUAGE TESTS AS WEAPONS IN INTERGROUP CONFLICT|journal=Invited address, Language Assessment Ethics Conference, Pasadena, CA|date=May 17, 2002|url=https://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=0bbf678f-9672-48c0-bb76-79bd9912b45c|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320191328/http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=0bbf678f-9672-48c0-bb76-79bd9912b45c|archivedate=March 20, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passport to life|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/10/05/art12.asp|website=Daily News|publisher=Daily News (Sri Lanka's state broadsheet)|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], some United States soldiers in the Pacific theater used the word ''[[Wiktionary:lollapalooza|lollapalooza]]'' as a shibboleth to [[Countersign (military)|challenge]] unidentified persons, on the premise that Japanese people [[Perception of /r/ and /l/ by the Japanese|often pronounce the letter L as R]] or confuse Rs with Ls; the word is also an American colloquialism that even a foreign person fairly well-versed in American English would probably mispronounce or be unfamiliar with.&lt;ref&gt;US Army &amp; Navy, 1942.

Retrieved 10-10-2007&lt;/ref&gt; In Oliver Gramling's ''Free Men are Fighting: The Story of World War II'' (1942) the author notes that, in the war, Japanese spies would often approach checkpoints posing as American or [[Filipino people|Filipino]] military personnel.

During the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachheads in 1944, hand-to-hand fighting occurred throughout the [[hedgerows]] and thick undergrowth of the Norman countryside. British and American troops were told to use the word "Thunderer" as a countersign through the thick foliage. Given the number of syllables and the leading "th" sound, it was believed that the word would invariably be mispronounced by native German speakers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

During [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, use of the name [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute|Derry or Londonderry]] for the province's second-largest city was often taken as an indication of the speaker's political stance, and as such frequently implied more than simply naming the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4887352.stm |title=Court to rule on city name |work=BBC News |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronunciation of the letter [[H]] is a related shibboleth, with Catholics and Protestants often [[H#Name in English|pronouncing the letter differently]].
 
In Australia and New Zealand, the words "fish and chips" are often used to highlight the difference in each country's short-i vowel sound [ɪ] and asking someone to say the phrase can identify which country they are from. Australian English has a higher forward sound [i], close to the y in happy and city, while New Zealand English has a lower backward sound [ɘ], a slightly higher version of the a in about and comma. Thus, New Zealanders hear Australians say "feesh and cheeps," while Australians hear New Zealanders say "fush and chups."

==Furtive shibboleths==
A "furtive shibboleth" is a type of a shibboleth which identifies individuals as being part of a group not based on their ability to pronounce one or more words, but on their ability to recognize a seemingly-innocuous phrase as a secret message. For example, members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] sometimes refer to themselves as "a friend of Bill W.", which is a reference to AA's founder, [[Bill W.|William Griffith Wilson]]. To the unindoctrinated, this would seem like a casual – if off-topic – remark, but other AA members would understand its meaning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Similarly, during [[World War II]], a homosexual [[United States Navy|US sailor]] might call himself a "[[friend of Dorothy]]", a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of a stereotypical affinity for [[Judy Garland]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. This code was so effective that even after the higher command learned that the phrase was a way for gay sailors to identify each other, they failed to recognize its origins, and purportedly invested a great deal of time and effort into hunting down this "Dorothy," whom they assumed to be an actual woman who was somehow assisting and organizing homosexual servicemen.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==In art==
Colombian conceptual artist [[Doris Salcedo]] created a work titled ''[[Shibboleth (artwork)|Shibboleth]]'' at [[Tate Modern]], London, in 2007–2008. The piece consisted of a 548-foot-long crack that bisected the floor of the Tate's lobby space.

Salcedo said of the work:
{{quote|It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. It is the experience of a Third World person coming into the heart of Europe. For example, the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Alberge, Dalya |title= Welcome to Tate Modern's floor show – it's 548 foot long and is called Shibboleth |work=The Times |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In fiction==
In an episode of ''[[The West Wing]]'' titled "[[Shibboleth (The West Wing)|Shibboleth]]", [[Josiah Bartlet|President Bartlet]] discusses the meaning of the word at length.

The term '''''shooting bias''''', also known as "'''shooter bias'''", is a form of [[implicit bias|implicit]] racial [[bias]] which refers to the tendency among the police to shoot black civilians rather than white civilians, even when they are unarmed.

The probability of being shot by the police depends on factors such as ethnicity, location, the income of the neighborhood and whether or not the person is carrying a weapon&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as the emotions shown by the victim.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kubota|first=Jennifer T.|last2=Ito|first2=Tiffany A.|title=The role of expression and race in weapons identification|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0038214|journal=Emotion|language=en|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1115–1124|doi=10.1037/a0038214|pmc=4235656|pmid=25401289|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problems with police reporting practices ===
Police data could be biased due to police reporting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klinger|first=David A.|date=2011-12-13|title=On the Problems and Promise of Research on Lethal Police Violence|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088767911430861|journal=Homicide Studies|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=78–96|doi=10.1177/1088767911430861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departments can voluntary include [[Justifiable homicide|justifiable homicides]] in the crime statistics of the [[Uniform Crime Reports|FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports]], which means that a lot of departments don't provide data at all.

Newspapers like ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have started gathering a database of [[Lists of killings by law enforcement officers|fatal police shootings]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database|title=The Counted: people killed by police in the United States – interactive|last=Swaine|first=Jon|last2=Laughland|first2=Oliver|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30|last3=Lartey|first3=Jamiles|last4=Davis|first4=Kenan|last5=Harris|first5=Rich|last6=Popovich|first6=Nadja|last7=Powell|first7=Kenton|last8=team|first8=Guardian US interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/|title=Police shootings 2017 database|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing that in 2015 twice as many civilians had been fatally shot than the FBI's data suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-are-fatally-shooting-people-at-twice-the-rate-reported/article_828cd4cf-5d87-581d-b3b8-e93aefddebd5.html|title=Police are fatally shooting people at twice the rate reported by FBI, analysis finds|last=Post|first=Washington|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An FBI working group has started working on a proposal for making the reports more accurate, but they would still rely on voluntary data and therefore wouldn't fix the main reporting issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/fbi-to-sharply-expand-system-for-tracking-police-shootings/article_67fa6d49-f54c-554d-a591-b33bad32fe05.html|title=FBI to sharply expand system for tracking police shootings|last=Post|first=Kimberly Kindy Washington|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative database by ''The Guardian'' ===
The database developed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' is currently the largest database on fatal shootings available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hehman|first=Eric|last2=Flake|first2=Jessica K.|last3=Calanchini|first3=Jimmy|date=2017-07-27|title=Disproportionate Use of Lethal Force in Policing Is Associated With Regional Racial Biases of Residents|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1948550617711229|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|language=en|pages=1948550617711229|doi=10.1177/1948550617711229|issn=1948-5506}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gather data through police reports, monitoring of regional news, fact-checked witness statements and other crowdsourced police fatality databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/about-the-counted|title=About The Counted: why and how the Guardian is counting US police killings|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of deaths ===
In 2016, ''The Guardian'' counted 1093 people&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; who were killed by the police in the United States. Out of these 574 were white and 266 were black. 95 of the white victims were unarmed, 42 of the black victims were unarmed.

More white than black people are shot. It is important to distinguish to differentiate between the number of deaths of an ethnic group and the likelihood of being shot by police. The likelihood of being shot as a black rather than a white person is higher, whether the victim is armed or not.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Prominent examples of unarmed black civilians being fatally shot by the police include: 

* November 22, 2014: [[Tamir Rice]] (Cleveland) was killed by police officers at the age of 12 because they mistook his toy gun, which lacked the orange safety feature marking it as a replica and not a true firearm, for a real weapon.

== Likelihood of being shot: Black vs. White ==
A study carried out at the [[University of California]] found "evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Cody T.|date=2015-11-05|title=A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011–2014|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141854|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4634878|pmid=26540108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the probability of being shot by the police as a black, unarmed person versus as a white, unarmed person was 3.49 times higher. Unarmed Hispanics' likelihood to be shot was 1.67 times higher than for unarmed Whites.

The number vary greatly depending on the county, sometimes reaching a probability of 20 to 1 or more for unarmed blacks to be shot. There are several maps that showcase the [https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/ distribution of fatal shootings across the country].

Contrary to popular belief, crime rate was not associated with likelihood of being shot in this study.

== Factors that influence decision to shoot ==

=== List of empirically researched factors ===
Empirical research suggests the following factors to influence the decision to shoot:

* Status armed/unarmed&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Gender (men are more likely to be shot)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-white|title=Deadly Force, in Black and White|last=Sagara|first=Ryan Gabrielson, Ryann Grochowski Jones, Eric|date=2014-10-10|work=ProPublica|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Implicit racial bias ====
An implicit [[Bias|racial bias]] refers to unintentional judgments a person makes of a group (e.g. good/bad) of a certain ethnicity. So a person who shows implicit racial bias might not be aware of it. Police officers have been found to show a racial bias against black people in the decision to shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Joshua|last2=Park|first2=Bernadette|last3=Judd|first3=Charles M.|last4=Wittenbrink|first4=Bernd|last5=Sadler|first5=Melody S.|last6=Keesee|first6=Tracie|title=Across the thin blue line: Police officers and racial bias in the decision to shoot|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1006|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=92|issue=6|pages=1006–1023|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1006|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the studies, researchers investigated how stereotypes affected police officers' decisions to shoot. They used a video game and exposed their participants to pictures of either Whites or Non-Whites who were armed or unarmed. During this video game, the participants were asked to choose between "shoot" or "don't shoot" as quickly as possible. The results were that the participants shot armed black people faster than armed white people and chose "don't shoot" faster for unarmed white than unarmed black persons.

The authors explained those findings by the activation of stereotype thinking which lead white people to associate black people with danger. Because of this stereotype, the participants expected blacks to carry a gun and therefore were quicker to make the "shooting" decision.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Correll, J., Park, B., Judd, C.

==== Location and context ====
The American police officers live and work in a society full of prejudices against minorities. In addition, police officers usually deal with high crime rates in minority neighborhoods. These experiences reinforce their existing prejudices by ignoring that most people with a non-white ethnic background don’t become criminals. This leads to discrimination against minorities. Other factors that lead to discrimination by the police are institutionalized language barriers between police and some ethnic groups, experiences with disrespectful or hostile residents in certain minority neighborhoods and low punishment for police officers who misbehave towards minorities.

Those prejudices by the police are of course being noticed by the groups of minorities. So in return, the groups believe that the officers have prejudices against them. This might lead to the findings that Non-Whites are more likely to behave disrespectfully or to insult officers.

To sum up, there may exist a mutual influence between the prejudices that police officers have against minorities and the prejudices that minorities have against officers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. (1996).

=====  Examples that showcase prejudices among police officers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; =====
*Disruptive actions by the police like stopping and questioning citizens on the street are more common in minority neighborhoods
*More cases of Non-Whites are being dropped than of Whites. This is because the reasons for arresting them were too weak and unjustified in the first place.
*American police officers shoot more easily Non-Whites than Whites

== Ways to reduce shooting bias ==
Possibly the biggest change could be made by holding police officers accountable for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/06/i-was-a-st-louis-cop-my-peers-were-racist-and-violent-and-theres-only-one-fix/|title=Being a cop showed me just how racist and violent the police are.

Knowing the factors that influence police officers decisions to shoot there are a few possible solutions for reducing shooting bias. The main factor is implicit racial bias, which in turn is exuberated by certain factors that could be addressed.

Diversity in police departments might not reduce shooting bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Brad W.|date=2003-05-01|title=The Impact of Police Officer Diversity on Police-Caused Homicides|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-0072.t01-1-00009/abstract|journal=Policy Studies Journal|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=147–162|doi=10.1111/1541-0072.t01-1-00009|issn=1541-0072}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reducing fatigue might lower the impact of racial bias on the decision to shoot.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Changing the training of police officers so as to not showcase black armed targets more often than white ones could help reduce racial bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sim|first=Jessica J.|last2=Correll|first2=Joshua|last3=Sadler|first3=Melody S.|date=2013-03-01|title=Understanding Police and Expert Performance: When Training Attenuates (vs. Exacerbates) Stereotypic Bias in the Decision to Shoot|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167212473157|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=291–304|doi=10.1177/0146167212473157|pmid=23401478|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plant|first=E.

Training police officers in making decisions under stress as well as assigning officers to certain locations so they can become familiar with its residents could reduce the numbers of civilians killed, says Richmond's police chief, Chris Magnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6111457/example-good-police-relations-cops-killing-outreach-culture-training|title=How to not shoot civilians: 9 community policing tips from a chief who got it right|last=Lind|first=Dara|date=2014-09-18|website=Vox|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=June 2012}}
{{italic title|string=fire}}
'''"Shouting ''fire'' in a crowded theater"''' is a popular [[metaphor]] for speech or actions made for the principal purpose of creating unnecessary panic. The phrase is a paraphrasing of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]'s [[legal opinion|opinion]] in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' in 1919, which held that the defendant's speech in opposition to the [[conscription|draft]] during [[World War I]] was not protected [[freedom of speech|free speech]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

The paraphrasing differs from Holmes's original wording in that it typically does not include the word ''falsely'', while also adding the word "crowded" to describe the theatre. The original wording used in Holmes's opinion ("falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic") highlights that speech that is dangerous {{em|and}} false is not protected, as opposed to speech that is dangerous but also true.

==The ''Schenck'' case==
{{main|Schenck v. United States}}
===Decision===
Holmes, writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that it was a violation of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] (amended by the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]), to distribute flyers opposing the draft during [[World War I]]. Holmes argued this abridgment of free speech was permissible because it presented a "[[clear and present danger]]" to the government's recruitment efforts for the war. Holmes wrote:
{{quote|The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. [...] The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.}}
===Legacy===
The First Amendment [[Holding (law)|holding]] in ''Schenck'' was later partially [[Judicial review in the United States|overturned]] by ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' in 1969, which limited the scope of banned speech to that which would be directed to and likely to incite [[imminent lawless action]] (e.g. a [[riot]]). The test in ''Brandenburg'' is the current Supreme Court jurisprudence on the ability of government to proscribe speech after that fact. Despite ''Schenck'' being limited, the phrase "shouting ''fire'' in a crowded theater" has since come to be known as synonymous with an action that the speaker believes goes beyond the rights guaranteed by free speech, reckless or malicious speech, or an action whose outcomes are obvious.

===Criticism===
[[File:Freedom of speech in war times.djvu|right|thumb|180px|page=6|A version of Chafee's article]]

Christopher M. Finan, Executive Director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, writes that Justice Holmes began to doubt his decision due to criticism received from free-speech activists. He also met the legal scholar [[Zechariah Chafee]] and discussed his ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' article "Freedom of Speech in War Times".&lt;ref name=fenan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chafee |first=Zechariah |authorlink=Zechariah Chafee |coauthors= |year=1919 |month= |title=Freedom of Speech in Wartime |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=932&amp;ndash;973 |doi=10.2307/1327107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Finan, Holmes's change of heart influenced his decision to join the minority and dissent in the ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'' case. Abrams was deported for issuing flyers saying the US should not intervene in the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Holmes and Brandeis said that "a silly leaflet by an unknown man" should not be considered illegal.&lt;ref name=fenan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William E. Leuchtenburg, ''The Perils of Prosperity, 1914-32'' (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1958), 43&lt;/ref&gt; Chafee argued in ''Free Speech in the United States'' that a better analogy in ''Schenk'' might be a man who stands in a theatre and warns the audience that there are not enough fire exits.&lt;ref name="chafee"&gt;{{cite book |title=Free Speech in the United States |last=Chafee |first=Zechariah |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1067 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zinn"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vu-hxQypyjkC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;lpg=PA366&amp;dq=%22PEOPLE%27S+HISTORY+OF+THE+UNITED+STATES%22+%22oliver+wendell+holmes%22+fire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1TthSKTrty&amp;sig=nfYUz_XZHPSOnXpXViLKyaLw5ig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enriT_iaAaOU2wWfprXlCw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A People's History of the United States |last=Zinn |first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Zinn |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |date=August 2, 2005 |page=366 |isbn=0060838655 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introductory remarks to a 2006 debate in defense of free speech, writer [[Christopher Hitchens]] parodied the Holmes judgement by opening "{{em|Fire!}} Fire, fire ... fire. Now you've heard it", before condemning the famous analogy as "the fatuous verdict of the greatly over-praised Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes." Hitchens argued that the socialists imprisoned by the court's decision "were the ones shouting fire when there really {{em|was}} a fire in a very crowded theatre indeed.... [W]ho's going to decide?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Hg-Y7MugU |title=Christopher Hitchens -- Free Speech Part 1 |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Hitchens |publisher=[[YouTube]] |time=00:00:00 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents.ariadacapo.net/borrowed/2006_11_christopher_hitchens/christopher_hitchens_2006_11_talk_transcript.pdf |title=Fire in a Crowded Theatre |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |date=November 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literal examples==
People have indeed falsely shouted "Fire!" in crowded public venues and caused panics on numerous occasions, such as at the [[Royal Surrey Gardens]] Music Hall of London in 1856, a theater in New York's [[Harlem]] neighborhood in 1884,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times
| page = 4
| title=A Cry of Fire in a Crowded Theater.
| date=September 25, 1884
| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/09/25/109777936.pdf
| format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Italian Hall disaster]] of 1913, which left 73 dead. In the [[Shiloh Baptist Church disaster]] of 1902, over 100 people died when "fight" was misheard as "fire" in a crowded church causing a panic and stampede.

In contrast, in the [[Brooklyn Theatre fire]] of 1876, the actors initially falsely claimed that the fire was part of the performance, in an attempt to avoid a panic. However, this delayed the evacuation and made the resulting panic far more severe.

The '''Smolin Gallery''' was an [[avant-garde]] art venue and gallery on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="Diggory2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diggory|first=Terence|title=Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgsgw2xe-F0C&amp;pg=PT310|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1905-2|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its peak in the 1960s. It was known for its involvement with [[installation art]], [[performance art]] and experimental art, and was best known for the [[Allan Kaprow]] assemblage performance of September 11–12, 1962 entitled "Words",&lt;ref name="Hendricks2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendricks|first=Geoffrey|title=Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia, and Rutgers University, 1958–1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40Qd97UAHPoC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3303-2|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be the first allowing the audience to participate in an art gallery context. Kaprow "used two continual rolls of cloth with words from poems, newspapers, comic and telephone books" during which the audience were asked to "tear off the words, staple them together, write notes, even attack and hack them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/46882/happenings-new-york-1958-1963-pace-gallery/|title=When New York Was Really Happening|publisher=Hyperallergic.com|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal fragments were pasted on the walls from floor to ceiling.&lt;ref name="BanesBaryshnikov2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banes|first1=Sally|last2=Baryshnikov|first2=Mikhail|title=Reinventing Dance in the 1960s: Everything was Possible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY-BBzFGOpAC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2003|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-18014-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1963, [[Lima Towle|Lima]] and [[Tony Towle]] gave their first public recital at the gallery.&lt;ref name="Diggory2009"/&gt; 

In May 1963 the Smolin Gallery sponsored innovative [[Wolf Vostell]] events on TV. ''Do it yourself Dé-coll/age'' featured visitors to the gallery who were encouraged to use their own DIY liquids to create poster art on the walls and Wolf Vostells [[installation art|installation]] ''Television Décollage'' (''6 TV Dé-coll/age'') was shown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage Wolf Vostell, ''Television Décollage'' (''6 TV dé-coll/age''), 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salter2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salter|first=Chris|title=Entangled: Technology and the Transformation of Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBJbIP0fMr0C&amp;pg=PA122|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-19588-1|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gallery sponsored the ''Yam Festival'' and served as an information center during the event. The ''Yam Festival'', held at [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]s farm, in  [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] was venue on May 19, 1963 to actions and [[Happening]]s by artists including [[Dick Higgins]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[La Monte Young]] and [[Wolf Vostell]] who made the happening ''TV Burying''.&lt;ref name="Banes1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banes|first=Sally|title=Democracy's Body: Judson Dance Theater, 1962–1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeJm6G8-T3cC&amp;pg=PA131|year=1983|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-1399-1|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/tv-burying/images/2/ Wolf Vostell, ''TV Burying'', 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22052">In [[sociology]], '''social complexity''' is a [[conceptual framework]] used in the [[analysis]] of society. Contemporary definitions of [[complexity]] in the [[science]]s are found in relation to [[systems theory]], in which a [[phenomenon]] under study has many parts and many possible arrangements of the relationships between those parts. At the same time, what is complex and what is simple is relative and may change with time.&lt;ref&gt;Waldrop, M. Mitchell (1992.) ''Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos.'' New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current usage of the term "complexity" in the field of sociology typically refers specifically to theories of society as a [[complex adaptive system]]. However, social complexity and its [[emergence|emergent]] properties are central recurring themes throughout the historical development of [[Social philosophy|social thought]] and the study of [[social change]].&lt;ref name="CCS-MMT"&gt;Eve, Raymond, Sara Horsfall and Mary E. Lee (eds.) (1997). ''Chaos, Complexity and Sociology: Myths, Models, and Theories.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of sociology|early founders]] of [[sociological theory]], such as [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], and [[Georg Simmel]], all examined the exponential growth and increasing interrelatedness of social encounters and [[Social exchange theory|exchanges]]. This emphasis on [[interconnectivity]] in social relationships and the emergence of new properties within society is found in [[Social theory|theoretical thinking]] in multiple [[Subfields of sociology|areas of sociology]].&lt;ref name="AGid-79"&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1979). ''Central problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure and Contradiction in Social Analysis.'' London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; As a theoretical tool, social complexity theory serves as a basis for the connection of [[Microsociology|micro-]] and [[Macrosociology|macro]]-level social phenomena, providing a [[wikt:meso-|meso-]]level or [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range]] theoretical platform for [[hypothesis]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;Freese, Lee (1980). "Formal Theorizing." ''Annual Review of Sociology'', 6: 187–212 (August 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, B. P. (1989). ''Developing sociological knowledge: theory and method'' (2nd ed.). Chicago: Nelson–Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Research methods#Research methods|Methodologically]], the concept of social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local ([[Microsociology|micro]]) and global ([[Macrosociology|macro]]) phenomena in sociological research.&lt;ref name="CCS-MMT" /&gt;

==Theoretical background==
[[File:Penrose tiling.gif|thumb|Illustration of complexity ([[Penrose tiling]] [[fractal]])]]
The American sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] carried on the work of the early founders mentioned above in his early (1937) work on [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]].&lt;ref name="Parsons-a"&gt;Parsons, Talcott ([1937] 1949). ''The Structure of Social Action: A Study in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of European Writers''. New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951, Parsons places these earlier ideas firmly into the realm of formal [[systems theory]] in ''The Social System''.&lt;ref name="Parsons-b"&gt;Parsons, Talcott (1951). ''The Social System''. New York, NY: The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several decades, this synergy between general [[systems thinking]] and the further development of [[social system]] theories is carried forward by Parson's student, [[Robert K. Merton]], and a long line of others, in discussions of theories of the [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range]] and [[Structure and agency|social structure and agency]]. During part of this same period, from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, discussion ensues in any number of other research areas about the properties of systems in which strong correlation of sub-parts leads to observed behaviors variously described as [[autopoiesis|autopoetic]], [[self-organization|self-organizing]], [[Dynamical system|dynamical]], [[turbulent]], and [[Chaotic system|chaotic]]. All of these are forms of system behavior arising from mathematical [[Complexity science|complexity]]. By the early 1990s, the work of social theorists such as [[Niklas Luhmann]]&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, Niklas (1990.) ''Essays on Self-Reference'', New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; began reflecting these themes of complex behavior.

One of the earliest usages of the term "complexity", in the [[Social science|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]], to refer specifically to a [[complex system]] is found in the study of [[Complexity theory and organizations|modern organizations]] and [[management studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Kiel, L. Douglas (1994). ''Managing Chaos and Complexity in Government: A New Paradigm for Managing Change, Innovation and Organizational Renewal.'' Jossey-Bass: San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; However, particularly in management studies, the term often has been used in a [[metaphor]]ical rather than in a [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] or [[quantitative property|quantiative]] theoretical manner.&lt;ref name="CCS-MMT" /&gt; By the mid-1990s, the "complexity turn"&lt;ref name=Urry&gt;Urry, John (2005). "The Complexity Turn." ''Theory, Culture and Society'', 22(5): 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; in social sciences begins as some of the same tools generally used in [[complexity science]] are incorporated into the social sciences. By 1998, the international, electronic periodical, ''[[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]'', had been created. In the last several years, many publications have presented overviews of complexity theory within the field of sociology. Within this body of work, connections also are drawn to yet other theoretical traditions, including [[constructivist epistemology]] and the philosophical positions of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]] and [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]].

==Methodologies==
Methodologically, social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research.&lt;ref name="CCS-MMT"/&gt; The very idea of social complexity arises out of the [[Historical comparative research|historical-comparative]] methods of early sociologists; obviously, this method is important in developing, defining, and refining the theoretical construct of social complexity. As complex social systems have many parts and there are many possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiated]]&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, Niklas (1982). ''The Differentiation of Society.'' New York, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by the researcher according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses.

At the most localized level of analysis, [[ethnographic]], [[Participant observation|participant-]] or non-participant observation, [[content analysis]] and other [[qualitative research]] methods may be appropriate. More recently, highly sophisticated [[quantitative research]] methodologies are being developed and used in sociology at both local and global [[level of analysis|levels of analysis]]. Such methods include (but are not limited to) [[bifurcation diagram]]s, [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] modeling, and [[Computational sociology|computational]] models including [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] programming, [[sociocybernetics]] and other methods of [[social simulation]].

===Complex social network analysis===
{{Main|Dynamic network analysis}}
Complex [[social network]] analysis is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. [[Dynamic network analysis]] brings together traditional [[social network analysis]], [[link analysis]] and [[multi-agent system]]s within [[network science]] and [[network theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Kathleen M. (2003), "Dynamic Network Analysis." ''Dynamic Social Network Modeling and Analysis: Workshop Summary and Papers'', Ronald Breiger, Kathleen Carley, and Philippa Pattison (eds.), National Research Council (Committee on Human Factors): Washington, D.C.: 133–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of key concepts and methods in [[social network analysis]], [[agent-based modeling]], theoretical [[physics]], and modern [[mathematics]] (particularly [[graph theory]] and [[fractal geometry]]), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis are coming out of the work of [[Duncan Watts]], [[Albert-László Barabási]], [[Nicholas A. Christakis]], [[Kathleen Carley]] and others.

New methods of global network analysis are emerging from the work of [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] and the sociological study of globalization, linked to the work of [[Manuel Castells]] and the later work of [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]. Since the late 1990s, Wallerstein increasingly makes use of complexity theory, particularly the work of [[Ilya Prigogine]].&lt;ref&gt;Barabási, Albert-László (2003). ''Linked: The New Science of Networks.'' Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Linton C. (2004). ''The Development of Social Network Analysis: A Study in the Sociology of Science.'' Vancouver Canada: Empirical Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Duncan J. (2004). "The New Science of Networks." ''Annual Review of Sociology'', 30: 243–270.&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic social network analysis is linked to a variety of methodological traditions, above and beyond [[systems thinking]], including [[graph theory]], traditional [[social network]] analysis in sociology, and [[mathematical sociology]]. It also links to [[chaos theory|mathematical chaos]] and [[complex dynamics]] through the work of [[Duncan Watts]] and [[Steven Strogatz]], as well as fractal geometry through [[Albert-László Barabási]] and his work on [[scale-free networks]].

===Computational sociology===
{{Main|Computational sociology}}
The development of [[computational sociology]] involves such scholars as [[Nigel Gilbert]], [[Klaus G. Troitzsch]], [[Joshua M. Epstein]], and others. The foci of methods in this field include [[social simulation]] and [[data-mining]], both of which are sub-areas of computational sociology. Social simulation uses computers to create an artificial laboratory for the study of complex social systems; [[Data mining|data-mining]] uses machine intelligence to search for non-trivial patterns of relations in large, complex, real-world databases. The emerging methods of [[socionics]] are a variant of computational sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Nigel and Klaus G. Troitzsch (2005). ''Simulation for Social Scientists'', 2nd Edition. New York, NY: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epstein07&gt;Epstein, Joshua M. (2007). ''Generative Social Science: Studies in Agent-Based Computational Modeling''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational sociology is influenced by a number of micro-sociological areas as well as the macro-level traditions of systems science and systems thinking. The micro-level influences of [[symbolic interactionism|symbolic interaction]], [[exchange theory|exchange]], and [[rational choice theory|rational choice]], along with the micro-level focus of computational political scientists, such as [[Robert Axelrod]], helped to develop computational sociology's [[:wikt:bottom-up|bottom-up]], [[agent-based]] approach to modeling complex systems. This is what [[Joshua M. Epstein]] calls [[generative science]].&lt;ref name=epstein07 /&gt; Other important areas of influence include [[statistics]], [[mathematical modeling]] and computer [[simulation]].

===Sociocybernetics===
{{Main|Sociocybernetics}}
[[Sociocybernetics]] integrates sociology with [[second-order cybernetics]] and the work of [[Niklas Luhmann]], along with the latest advances in [[complexity science]]. In terms of scholarly work, the focus of sociocybernetics has been primarily conceptual and only slightly methodological or empirical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geyer, Felix]] and [[Johannes van der Zouwen]] (1992). "Sociocybernetics." ''Handbook of Cybernetics'', C.V. Negoita (ed.): 95–124. New York: Marcel Dekker.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocybernetics is directly tied to [[Systems thinking|systems thought]] inside and outside of sociology, specifically in the area of second-order cybernetics.

==Areas of application==
As a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range]] theoretical platform, social complexity can be applied to any research in which [[social interaction]] or the outcomes of such interactions can be observed, but particularly where they can be [[Measurement|measured]] and expressed as [[Continuous function (set theory)|continuous]] or [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] data points. One common criticism often cited regarding the usefulness of complexity science in sociology is the difficulty of obtaining adequate data.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Peter (2001). "Complexity Theories, Social Theory, and the Question of Social Complexity." ''Philosophy of the Social Sciences'', 31(3): 323–360.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, application of the concept of social complexity and the analysis of such complexity has begun and continues to be an ongoing field of inquiry in sociology. From [[childhood]] friendships and [[teen pregnancy]]&lt;ref name="CCS-MMT" /&gt; to [[criminology]]&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Ju-Sung. (2001). "Evolving Drug Networks." [http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)] Conference Presentation (unpublished).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[counter-terrorism]],&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Kathleen (2003). "Destabilizing Terrorist Networks." ''Proceedings of the 8th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium''. Conference held at the National Defense War College: Washington D.C., Evidence Based Research, Track 3. [http://www.dodccrp.org/events/2003/8th_ICCRTS/pdf/021.pdf (Electronic Publication).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041218014917/http://www.dodccrp.org/events/2003/8th_ICCRTS/pdf/021.pdf |date=2004-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; theories of social complexity are being applied in almost all [[Subfields of sociology|areas of sociological research]].

In the area of [[Communications theory|communications research]] and [[informetrics]], the concept of self-organizing systems appears in mid-1990s research related to scientific communications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Loet Leydesdorff|Leydesdorff, Loet]] (1995). ''The Challenge of Scientometrics: The development, measurement, and self-organization of scientific communications''. Leiden: DSWO Press, Leiden University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientometrics]] and [[bibliometrics]] are areas of research in which discrete data are available, as are several other areas of social communications research such as [[sociolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="CCS-MMT" /&gt; Social complexity is also a concept used in [[semiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrov, Vladimir and Robert Woog (1997). "Studying Social Complexity: From Soft to Virtual Systems Methodology." [http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/11-6-5.pdf Complex Systems, 11:(6)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decade of the 21st century, the diversity of areas of application has grown&lt;ref&gt;Saberi, Mohammad Karim, Alireza Isfandyari-Moghaddam and Sedigheh Mohamadesmaeil (2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">The term '''social procedure''' is sometimes applied to any of the procedures carried out by people in various areas of society, such as legislative assemblies, judicial systems, and resource arbiters, such as banks or other lending organizations.  It has been described as [[social software (social procedure)|social software]] and indeed does resemble software. 

Social procedures include as a subset procedures which are at the foundation of our society, such as [[procedural law]].  Similarly many social procedures are explicitly designed to ensure fair treatment to individuals or corporations, as official records of parliamentary debates show. 

Multiple social procedures can serve to achieve the same end. Justice, as an example, in the U.S. achieved through the use of 2 adversarial lawyers, a neutral judge, and a jury of peers. In Canada, the judge is less neutral. This subtle difference in programming has an effect on the justice outcome.

Though game theory is a highly technical subject with no special attention to sports, an example of a social procedure designed to help make a sporting system more fair is the [[Major League Baseball Draft]] whereby the teams which performed the worst in the last season get the first choice of players for the new season.

There is a project called A Formal Analysis of Social Procedures underway at the Tilburg Center for Logic and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS) under the direction of E. Pacuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ai.stanford.edu/~epacuit/vidi/ TiLPS Project: A Formal Analysis of Social Procedures, Dr. E. Pacuit, project leader.]&lt;/ref&gt; This interdisciplinary project looks at social procedures undertaken by rational and not-so-rational people, and the complex phenomena arising when the people involved in such procedures interact.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16492">{{for|the [[stiffness]] to weight ratio|specific modulus}}
The '''specific strength''' is a material's [[Strength of materials|strength (force per unit area at failure)]] divided by its [[density]].  It is also known as the '''strength-to-weight ratio''' or '''strength/weight ratio'''. In fiber or textile applications, [[Tenacity (textile strength)|tenacity]] is the usual measure of specific strength. The SI unit for specific strength is [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] [[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/[[kilogram|kg]], or [[Newton (unit)|N]]·m/kg, which is [[Dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] to m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, though the latter form is rarely used.

Another way to describe specific strength is '''breaking length''', also known as '''self support length''': the maximum length of a vertical column of the material (assuming a fixed cross-section) that could suspend its own weight when supported only at the top. For this measurement, the definition of [[weight]] is the force of [[gravity]] at the Earth's surface ([[standard gravity]], 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) applying to the entire length of the material, not diminishing with height. This usage is more common with certain specialty fiber or textile applications.

The materials with the highest specific strengths are typically fibers such as [[carbon fiber]], [[glass fiber]] and various polymers, and these are frequently used to make [[composite material]]s (e.g.  [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber-epoxy]]). These materials and others such as [[titanium]], [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]] and high strength steel alloys are widely used in [[aerospace]] and other applications where weight savings are worth the higher material cost.

Note that strength and stiffness are distinct. Both are important in design of efficient and safe structures.

==The 'Yuri' and space tethers==
The [[International Space Elevator Consortium]] has proposed the "Yuri" as a name for the SI units describing specific strength.  Specific strength is of fundamental importance in the description of [[space elevator]] cable materials. One Yuri is conceived to be the SI unit for yield stress (or breaking stress) per unit of density of a material under tension.  So, the units for one Yuri are ''Pa m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; / kg''.  This unit is equivalent to one [[Newton (unit)|N]] [[meter|m]] / [[kilogram|kg]], which is the breaking/yielding ''force'' per ''linear'' density of the cable under tension.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160114223616/http://www.isec.org/images/StrongTetherChallenge/2013/Handbook-ts2013.rev0.pdf Strong Tether Challenge 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isec.org/sec/index.php/about-the-space-elevator/terminology#MegaYuri|title=Terminology|author=Super User|work=isec.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527065913/http://www.isec.org/sec/index.php/about-the-space-elevator/terminology#MegaYuri|archivedate=2012-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A functional [[space elevator]] would require a tether of 30-80 MegaYuri (corresponding to 3100–8200&amp;nbsp;km of breaking length).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keithcu.com/wiki/index.php/Specific_Strength_in_Yuris|title=Specific Strength in Yuris|work=keithcu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental limit on specific strength==
The null [[energy condition]] places a fundamental limit on the specific strength of any material.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012"/&gt; The specific strength is bounded to be no greater than c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ~ {{val|9|e=13}}[[Kilonewton|kN]]·[[Metre|m]]/[[Kilogram|kg]], where c is the [[speed of light]]. This limit is achieved by electric and magnetic field lines, [[QCD string|QCD flux tubes]], and the fundamental strings hypothesized by [[string theory]].

==Tenacity (tensile strength)==
{{About|the measure of textile strength|the geologic term|Tenacity (mineralogy)|the herbicide|Mesotrione|other uses|Tenacious (disambiguation){{!}}Tenacious}}

'''Tenacity''' is the customary measure of [[Strength of materials|strength]] of a [[fiber]] or [[yarn]]. In the U.S. it is usually defined as the ultimate (breaking) force of the fiber (in [[gram]]-force units) divided by the [[Units of textile measurement#Denier|denier]].
Because denier is a measure of the linear density, the tenacity works out to be not a measure of force per unit area, but rather a quasi-dimensionless measure analogous to specific strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Polymer Systems |first=Ferdinand |last=Rodriguez |page=282 |publisher=Hemisphere Publishing |location=New York |year=1989 |edition=3rd |isbn=9780891161769 |oclc=19122722}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tenacity of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1 {\rm \, g} \cdot 9.80665 {\rm \, m s^{-2}}}{1 {\rm \, g}/9000 {\rm \, m}}=\frac{9.80665 {\rm \, m s^{-2}}}{1/9000 {\rm \, m}}=9.80665  {\rm \, m s^{-2}} \, 9000 {\rm \, m} = 88259.85  {\rm \, m^2 s^{-2}}=88259.85 {\rm \, Yuri}=88.25985 {\rm \, kYuri} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11212">'''Strategic environmental assessment''' ('''SEA''') is a systematic [[decision support]] process, aiming to ensure that environmental and possibly other sustainability aspects are considered effectively in policy, plan and program making. In this context, following Fischer (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, T. B. (2007). Theory and Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; SEA may be seen as:

*a structured, rigorous, participative, open and transparent [[environmental impact]] assessment (EIA) based process, applied particularly to plans and programmes, prepared by public planning [[authorities]] and at times private bodies,
*a participative, open and transparent, possibly non-EIA-based process, applied in a more flexible manner to policies, prepared by public planning authorities and at times private bodies,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008. Strategic Environmental Assessment for Policies : An Instrument for Good Governance. © Washington, DC : World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6461&lt;/ref&gt;
*a flexible non-EIA based process, applied to legislative proposals and other policies, plans and programmes in political/cabinet decision-making.

Effective SEA works within a structured and tiered decision framework, aiming to support more effective and efficient decision-making for sustainable development and improved governance by providing for a substantive focus regarding questions, issues and alternatives to be considered in policy, plan and programme (PPP) making.

SEA is an [[evidence-based]] instrument, aiming to add scientific rigour to PPP making, by using suitable assessment methods and techniques. Ahmed and Sanchez Triana (2008) developed an approach to the design and implementation of public policies that follows a continuous process rather than as a discrete intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008. Strategic Environmental Assessment for Policies : An Instrument for Good Governance. © Washington, DC : World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6461&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[European Union Directive on Environmental Impact Assessments]] (85/337/EEC, known as the ''[[Environmental impact assessment|EIA]] Directive'') only applied to certain projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0337:EN:HTML Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the Assessment of the Effects of Certain Public and Private Projects on the Environment] (1985-06-27) from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex]&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as deficient as it only dealt with specific effects at the local level whereas many environmentally damaging decisions had already been made at a more strategic level (for example the fact that new infrastructure may generate an increased demand for travel).

The concept of strategic assessments originated from regional development / land use planning in the developed world. In 1981 the ''U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department'' published the ''Area-wide Impact Assessment Guidebook''. In Europe the  ''[[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]]'' the so-called ''[[Espoo]] Convention'' laid the foundations for the introduction of SEA in 1991. In 2003, the Espoo Convention was supplemented by a [[Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment]].

The [[European SEA Directive 2001/42/EC]] required that all member states of the [[European Union]] should have ratified the Directive into their own country's law by 21 July 2004.&lt;ref name=Directive&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council] (2001-06-27) from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex]&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries of the EU started implementing the land use aspects of SEA first, some took longer to adopt the directive than others, but the implementation of the directive can now be seen as completed. Many EU nations have a longer history of strong Environmental Appraisal including [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. The newer member states to the EU have hurried in implementing the directive.

==Relationship with environmental impact assessment==
For the most part, an SEA is conducted before a corresponding EIA is undertaken. This means that information on the environmental impact of a plan can cascade down through the tiers of decision making and can be used in an EIA at a later stage. This should reduce the amount of work that needs to be undertaken. A handover procedure is foreseen.

==Aims and structure==
The SEA Directive only applies to plans and programmes, not policies, although policies within plans are likely to be assessed and SEA can be applied to policies if needed and in the UK certainly, very often is.

The structure of SEA (under the Directive) is based on the following phases:
* "Screening", investigation of whether the plan or programme falls under the SEA legislation,
* "Scoping", defining the boundaries of investigation, assessment and assumptions required,
* "Documentation of the state of the environment", effectively a ''baseline'' on which to base judgments,
* "Determination of the likely (non-marginal) environmental impacts", usually in terms of Direction of Change rather than firm figures,
* Informing and consulting the public,
* Influencing "Decision taking" based on the assessment and,
* Monitoring of the effects of plans and programmes after their implementation.

The EU directive also includes other impacts besides the environmental, such as material assets and archaeological sites. In most western European states this has been broadened further to include economic and social aspects of [[sustainability]].

SEA should ensure that plans and programmes take into consideration the environmental effects they cause. If those environmental effects are part of the overall decision taking it is called ''Strategic Impact Assessment''.

==In the European Union==
SEA is a legally enforced assessment procedure required by Directive 2001/42/EC (known as the SEA Directive).&lt;ref name=Directive/&gt; The SEA Directive aims at introducing systematic assessment of the environmental effects of strategic land use related plans and programs. It typically applies to regional and local, development, waste and transport plans, within the European Union. Some plans, such as finance and budget plans or civil defence plans are exempt from the SEA Directive, it also only applies to plans that are required by law, which excludes national government's plans and programs, as their plans are 'voluntary', whereas local and regional governments are usually required to prepare theirs.

===United Kingdom===
SEA within the UK is complicated by different Regulations, guidance and practice between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In particular the SEA Legislation in Scotland (and in Northern Ireland, which specifically refers to the Regional Development Strategy) contains an expectation that SEA will apply to strategies as well as plans and programmes. In the UK, SEA is inseparable from the term '[[sustainability]]', and an SEA is expected to be carried out as part of a wider [[Sustainability Appraisal]] (SA), which was already a requirement for many types of plan before the SEA directive and includes social, and economic factors in addition to environmental. Essentially an SA is intended to better inform decision makers on the sustainability aspects of the plan and ensure the full impact of the plan on sustainability is understood.

The United Kingdom in its strategy for sustainable development, ''A Better Quality of Life'' (May 1999), explained sustainable development in terms of four objectives. These are:

*social progress which recognises the needs of everyone
*effective protection of the environment
*prudent use of natural resources
*maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment.

These headline objectives are usually used and applied to local situations in order to assess the impact of the plan or program.

==Internationally==

===The pan-European region===
The [[Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment]] was negotiated by the member States of the [[UNECE]] (in this instance Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia). It required ratification by 16 States to come into force, which it did in July 2010. It is now open to all [[UN]] Member States. Besides its potentially broader geographical application (global), the Protocol differs from the corresponding European Union Directive in its non-mandatory application to policies and legislation – not just plans and programmes. The Protocol also places a strong emphasis on the consideration of health, and there are other more subtle differences between the two instruments.

===New Zealand===
SEA in New Zealand is part of an integrated planning and assessment process and unlike the US is not used in the manner of [[Environmental impact assessment]].  The [[Resource Management Act 1991]] has, as a principal objective, the aim of sustainable management. SEA is increasingly being considered for transportation projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/rma/roading-delays-feb03.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
===The OECD DAC – SEA in development co-operation===
[[Development assistance]] is increasingly being provided through strategic-level interventions, aimed to make aid more effective. SEA meets the need to ensure environmental considerations are taken into account in this new aid context. Applying SEA to development co-operation provides the environmental evidence to support more informed decision making, and to identify new opportunities by encouraging a systematic and thorough examination of development options.

The [[OECD]] [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) Task Team on SEA has developed [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/21/37353858.pdf guidance] on how to apply SEA to development co-operation. The document explains the benefits of using SEA in development co-operation and sets out key steps for its application, based on recent experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">In [[decision theory]], the '''sure-thing principle''' states that a decision maker who would take a certain action if he knew that event ''E'' has occurred, and also if he knew that the negation of ''E'' has occurred, should also take that same action if he knows nothing about ''E''.

The principle was coined by [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|L.J. Savage]]:&lt;ref&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954), ''The foundations of statistics''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=A businessman contemplates buying a certain piece of property. He considers the outcome of the next presidential election relevant. So, to clarify the matter to himself, he asks whether he would buy if he knew that the Democratic candidate were going to win, and decides that he would. Similarly, he considers whether he would buy if he knew that the Republican candidate were going to win, and again finds that he would. Seeing that he would buy in either event, he decides that he should buy, even though he does not know which event obtains, or will obtain, as we would ordinarily say. It is all  too seldom that a decision can be arrived at on the basis of this principle, but except possibly for the assumption of simple ordering, I know of no other extralogical principle governing decisions that finds such ready acceptance.|source=p. 21}}

He formulated the principle as a [[Strategic dominance|dominance principle]], but it can also be framed probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Jeffrey |jstor=192456 |title=The Sure Thing Principle |journal=Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association |volume=2 |year=1982 |pages=719-730}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeffrey&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt; and later Pearl&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Savage's principle is only valid when the probability of the event considered (e.g., the winner of the election) is unaffected by the action (buying the property). Under such conditions, the sure-thing principle is a theorem in the ''do''-calculus&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Bayes networks]]). Blyth&lt;ref name="blyth-72"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blyth|first1=C.|title=On Simpson's paradox and the sure-thing principle|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=1972|volume=67|pages=364–366|doi=10.2307/2284382}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed a counterexample to the sure-thing principle using sequential sampling in the context of [[Simpson's paradox]], but this example violates the required action-independence provision.&lt;ref name=pearl-2015-r466&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=The sure-thing principle|url=http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r466.pdf|website=UCLA Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Technical Report R-466|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is closely related to [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], and equivalent under the axiom of truth (everything the agent knows is true).&lt;ref&gt;Samet, Dov.  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~samet/papers/the-sure-thing-principle.pdf "The sure-thing principle and independence of irrelevant knowledge". Israel Institute of Business Research, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is similarly targeted by the [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg]] and [[Allais paradox|Allais paradoxes]], in which actual people's choices seem to violate this principle.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt;

[[General]] [[Medals of Myanmar|Thura]] '''Tin Oo''' ({{lang-my|တင်ဦး}}, {{IPA-my|tɪ̀ɴ ʔú|IPA}}; born 3 March 1927 in [[Pathein]], often referred to as '''U Tin Oo''') is a [[Myanmar|Burmese]] politician, activist and retired general in the [[Tatmadaw|armed forces of Union of Myanmar]] who is currently the Patron of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) in [[Myanmar]].

== Military career==
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;DSHMRI Archives&lt;/ref&gt;
Tin Oo joined the [[Tatmadaw|army]] on 26 February 1946 as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in [[Burma Rifles]] [[Battalion]].  He reached the ranks of [[Lieutenant]] on 7 January 1947, [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] on 27 September 1948 and served as executive officer at Armed Forces Training Headquarters.  On 22 June 1949, he was transferred to No.1 Burma Rifles Battalion as [[Company Commander]].  He was promoted to the rank of [[Major]] on 25 January 1950 and became Deputy [[Battalion Commander]] (2IC) of No.1 Burma Rifles Battalion and took over the position of acting [[Battalion Commander]] on 27 November 1951.

Tin Oo was promoted to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] on 21 January 1954 and became Commander of 4th [[Infantry]] [[Brigade]] on 30 May 1957.  He was then transferred to Army Officer Training School as [[Commandant]] on 13 September 1957.  Throughout 1958 and 1961, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Tin Oo served as Battalion Commander for  No. 14 [[Infantry]] [[Battalion]] (from 18 November 1958), No. 2 Burma Rifle Battalion (from 16 February 1961) and after his promotion as [[Colonel]], he became acting Commander for No. 13 [[Infantry]] [[Brigade]] (from 20 February 1961).

He was then given the command of South West Regional Military Command and promoted to the rank of [[Colonel]] on 14 February 1963.  On 19 September 1964 he became Commander of Central Regional Military Command.  He was then promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier General]] and became Deputy Chief of Staff ([[Tatmadaw|Army]]) on 20 April 1972.  On 8 March 1974 he was promoted to the rank of [[General]] and became [[Commander in Chief]] of Tatmadaw.  He was armed forces Commander in Chief during the bloody crackdown on student protests surrounding the funeral of former UN Secretary General U Thant.

During his military career, [[General]] Tin Oo was awarded with [[Medals of Myanmar|Thuya]] medal, prestigious award for gallantry and bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of [[Myanmar Armed Forces]]. He led both tactical and strategic campaigns against the Karen National Union as well as the Communist Party of Burma and various ethnic armed groups, especially in the north and east of the country.

== Forced retirement, accusations and imprisonment ==
On 6 March 1976, As per Order no. 26/76 issued by the Council of State, Tin Oo was forced to retired from his position as [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Tatmadaw|Armed Forces of Burma]].  According to the official explanation released by the then ruling party, [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]], General Tin Oo was forced to retire because Dr. Daw Tin Moe Wai, his wife, broke the rules and regulations laid down for the spouses of commanding officers of the Tatmadaw by accepting numerous bribes, thus affecting General Tin Oo's position as [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Myanmar Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].

After his forced retirement, he was accused of high treasons against the armed forces ([[Tatmadaw]]), the party (BSPP) and the state.  He was subsequently arrested and tried for the alleged withholding of information concerning a failed coup-d'état against General [[Ne Win]] and the Council of State.  On 11 January 1977, Judge U Ohn Maung, Chairman of Divisional Justice Committee for [[Yangon]] Division sentenced him to 7 years hard labour and imprisonment according to Crime Against State and High Treasons Act 124.  Tin Oo's subsequent appeal for this judgement on 20 August 1977 was summarily dismissed by Judge Soe Hlaing, of Council of People Justice, the equivalent of the Supreme Court, and upheld the judgement handed out by Yangon Division Justice Committee. [[Colonel]] Hla Pe, commander of Northern Regional Command, [[Colonel]] Maung Maung, Colonel General Staff and [[Colonel]] Myo Aung, commandant of the National Defence College were also dismissed and the former two were imprisoned along with [[General]] Tin Oo.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Political career ==
He was released under general amnesty in 1980, after which he studied and received a degree in Law. On 2 September 1988, he became the Vice President of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) and on 20 December, the President of NLD. From 20 July 1989 he was put under house arrest and from 22 December 1989, he was imprisoned for three years.

On 30 May 2003, Tin Oo, travelling with the caravan of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], leader of the NLD, was attacked in the northern village of [[Depayin massacre|Depayin]] by a government-sponsored mob, murdering and wounding many of his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |title=The Depayin Massacre 2 Years On, Justice Denied |accessdate=2007-02-04 |date=2005-05-30 |format=PDF |publisher=ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Myanmar Caucus |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614185341/http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin Oo was taken into detention along with Aung San Suu Kyi and was initially held in prison in [[Kalay]] in northwestern Myanmar. In February 2004 he was brought back to his home in Yangon, where he is actually held under [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/feb/15/yehey/world/20060215wor4.html |title=Myanmar extends Suu Kyi’s detention |accessdate=2007-02-14 |date=2006-02-15 |publisher=AFP/The Manila Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021092057/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/feb/15/yehey/world/20060215wor4.html |archivedate=October 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The junta extended his detention by one year in February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/aviewer.asp?a=6687&amp;z=163 Irrawaddy.org]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008, and 2009. The last of these extensions was in violation of the rule of Burmese law, but no explanation was given by the junta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/myanmar-extends-tin-oos-house-arrest-by-another-year_100154898.html Thaiindian.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from House Arrest on February 13, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8514159.stm|title=Burma frees NLD leader Tin Oo|date=February 13, 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vis5D''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Scientific visualization|visualization system]] used primarily for animated 3D visualization of [[Numerical weather prediction|weather simulations]]. It was the first system to produce fully interactive animated 3D displays of time-dynamic volumetric data sets&lt;ref name=ecmwf/&gt;&lt;ref name=video/&gt; and the first open source 3D visualization system.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt; It is GNU GPL licensed.&lt;ref&gt;http://vis5d.sourceforge.net/doc/license.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Vis5D was created in response to two circumstances:
:1. Output data from weather models and similar simulations are sampled on time sequences of regular 3D grids and are relatively straightforward to visualize.
:2. The appearance in 1988 of commercial workstations such as the [[Stardent|Stellar]] [[GS workstation|GS 1000]] capable of rendering [[Gouraud-shaded]] 3D graphics fast enough for smooth [[animation]].

Vis5D takes its name from its 5D array containing time sequences of 3D spatial grids for a set of physical parameters of the atmosphere or ocean. Its [[graphical user interface]] enables users to select from various ways of visualizing each parameter (e.g., [[ISO surface|iso-surfaces]], plane slices, [[volume rendering]]s), and to select a combination of parameters for view. A key innovation of Vis5D is that it computes and stores the geometries and colors for such graphics over the simulated time sequence, allowing them to be animated quickly so users can watch movies of their simulations.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt; Furthermore, users can interactively rotate the animations in 3D.

Vis5D provides other visualization techniques. Users can drag a 3D cursor to a selected time and location, then trigger the calculation of a forward and backward wind trajectory from that point. Users can drag a vertical bar cursor and see, in another window, a thermodynamic diagram for the selected vertical column of atmosphere. And users can drag a 3D cursor to a selected time and location and read out individual values for parameters at that point. These examples all involve [[direct manipulation interface]]s, as does the placement of plane slices through 3D grids.

Vis5D provides options for memory management, so that very large data sets can be visualized at individual time steps without the need to compute graphics over the simulation's entire time sequence, while smaller data sets can be visualized with full animation. Vis5D also provides an [[API]] enabling developers of other systems to incorporate Vis5D's functionality. This API is the basis of a [[Tcl|TCL]] scripting capability so users can write automated scripts for producing animations.

==History==
Vis5D was first demonstrated, via videotape, at the December 1988 Workshop on Graphics in Meteorology at the [[ECMWF]].&lt;ref name=ecmwf&gt;ECMWF Workshop, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The first live demos were at the January 1989 annual meeting of the [[American Meteorological Society]].

Vis5D running on the GS 1000 was the first visualization system to provide smooth animation of 3D gridded time-sequence data sets with interactive rotation.&lt;ref name=ecmwf/&gt;&lt;ref name=video&gt;Siggraph Video Review 43, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Vis5D was the first [[open-source software|open-source]] 3D visualization system.&lt;ref name=ieee&gt;IEEE Visualization 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Vis5D is a natural for [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] [[virtual reality]] and was adapted to the [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE]] for the VROOM at the 1994 [[Siggraph]] conference.&lt;ref name=cave5d&gt;Hibbard et al, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This became [[Cave5D]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2881">[[Image:Fair Trade Products.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Fair Trade goods sold in an Italian Worldshop]]'''Worldshops''', '''world shops''' or '''Fair Trade Shops''' are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] products. Worldshops also typically organize various  educational Fair Trade activities and play an active role in [[trade justice]] and other North-South political campaigns.

Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks.

Although the movement emerged in [[Europe]] and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]].

== History ==
[[Image:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|Oxfam shop on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]].]]
The start of the movement is usually attributed to the first worldshop in Europe, which was founded by [[Oxfam]] in 1959. The Oxfam shop sold Chinese bric-a-brac that had been sourced from Chinese [[refugees]] that had escaped the [[Chinese civil war|Communist revolution]] to [[Hong Kong]]. However, some sources credit the first fair trade shop that had been opened in the US in 1958, selling [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] needlework.

The shops were not called worldshops at that time, however. [[Alternative trading organisation]]s imported various [[third world]] goods, such as [[sugarcane|cane]] [[sugar]] starting in the 1960s, and still continuing today. These goods were sold in "third world shops" or "developing country shops" (the actual name differing from country to country). The most active organisations were operating in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The term "worldshop" came into existence in the 1990s. In 1994, worldshops organised themselves under the auspices of NEWS, the [[Network of European Worldshops]], who now falls under the [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. The [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fairtrade]] label, which is used on fair trade products, has its roots in the 1980s worldshop movement.

== Aims ==
Worldshops' aim is to make [[trade]] as direct and [[fair trade|fair]] with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees subsistence and positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain.
