      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6659">The '''{{'}}I' and the 'me{{'}}''' are terms central to the [[social philosophy]] of [[George Herbert Mead]], one of the key influences on the development of the branch of [[sociology]] called [[symbolic interactionism]]. The terms refer to the psychology of the individual, where in Mead's understanding, the "me" is the socialized aspect of the person, and the "I" is the active aspect of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind, Self, and Society from the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist|last=Mead|first=George Herbert|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|date=August 15, 1967|isbn=0226516687|location=Chicago|pages=173, 174|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might usefully 'compare Mead's "I" and "me", respectively, with [[Sartre]]'s "choice" and "the [[Situation (Sartre)|situation]]". But Mead himself matched up the "me" with [[Freud]]'s "censor", and the "I" with his "[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]"; and this is psychologically apt'.&lt;ref&gt;Victorino Tejera, ''Semiotics from Pierce to Barthes'' (2001) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

The "Me" is what is learned in interaction with others and (more generally) with the environment: other people's attitudes, once internalized in the self, constitute the ''Me''.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Inghilleri, ''From Subjective Experience to Cultural Change'' (1999) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This includes both knowledge about that environment (including society), but ''also'' about who the person is: their ''sense of self''. "What the individual is for himself is not something that he invented. It is what his [[significant other]]s have come to ...treat him as being."&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1972) p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; This is because people learn to see who they are (man or woman, old or young, etc.) by observing the responses of others themselves or their actions. If others respond to a person as (for instance) a woman, the person develops a sense of herself indeed as a woman.

At the same time, 'the "Me" disciplines the "I" by holding it back from breaking the law of the community'.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Marc Nielson, ''The Norms of Answerability'' (2002) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus very close to the way in a man Freud's 'ego-censor, the conscience...arose from the critical influence of his parents (conveyed to him by the medium of the voice), to whom were added, as time went on, those who trained and taught him and the innumerable and indefinable host of all the other people in his environment—his fellow-men—and public opinion'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 92 and p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; It is 'the attitude of the other in one's own organism, as controlling the thing that he is going to do'.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Morris ed., George Herbert Mead, ''Mind, Self and Society'', (Chicago 1967) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, 'the "I" is the response of the individual to the attitude of the community'.&lt;ref name=Mead&gt;Mead, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The "I" acts creatively, though within the context of the ''me''. Mead notes that "It is only after we have acted that we know what we have done...what we have said."&lt;ref name=Mead /&gt; People, he argues, are not automatons; Mead states that "the "I" reacts to the self which arises though the taking of the attitude of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind, Self, and Society|last=Mead|first=George H.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=174|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not blindly follow rules. They ''construct'' a response on the basis of what they have learned, the "me". Mead highlighted accordingly those values that attach particularly to the "I" rather than to the ''me'', "...which cannot be calculated and which involve a reconstruction of the society, and so of the 'me' which belongs to that society."&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, the "I" and the "me" form the person or the [[self (philosophy)|self]] in Mead's social philosophy. According to Mead, there would be no possibility of personality without both the "I" and the "Me".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind, Self, and Society from the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist|last=Mead|first=George H.|last2=Morris|first2=Charles W.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1967|isbn=0226516687|location=Chicago|pages=182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fusion==

Mead explored what he called 'the fusion of the "I" and the "me" in the attitudes of religion, patriotism, and team work', noting what he called the "peculiar sense of exaltation" that belongs&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; to them. He also considered that 'the idea of the fusion of the "I" and the "me" gives a very adequate explanation of this exaltation...in the aesthetic experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

In everyday life, however, 'a complete fusion of the "I" and the "me" may not be a good thing...it is a dynamic sort of balance between the "I" and the "me" that is required'.&lt;ref&gt;Tejera, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conventionality==

When there is a predominance of the "me" in the personality, 'we speak of a person as a conventional individual; his ideas are exactly the same as those of his neighbours; he is hardly more than a "me" under the circumstances'&lt;ref name="Mead, p. 200"&gt;Mead, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;—"...the shallow, brittle, conformist kind of personality..." that is "''all [[Persona (psychology)|persona]]'', with its excessive concern for ''what people think''."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens, ''On Jung'' (London 1990) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative—and in many ways Mead's ideal—was the person who has a definite personality, who replies to the organized attitude in a way that makes a significant difference. With such a person, the ''I'' is the most important phase of the experience.&lt;ref name="Mead, p. 200"/&gt;

==Dissociation==

Mead recognised that it is normal for an individual to have 'all sorts of selves answering to all sorts of different social reactions', but also that it was possible for 'a tendency to break up the personality' to appear: 'Two separate "me's" and "I's", two different selves, result...the phenomenon of [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] of personality'.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 143-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

[[Walt Whitman]] 'marks off the impulsive "I", the natural, existential aspect of the self, from critical sanction. It is the cultured self, the "me", in Mead's terms, that needs re-mediation'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen John Mark, ''The Pragmatic Whitman'' (2002) p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

'''16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence''' is an international campaign to challenge [[violence against women]] and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action/16-days-of-activism|title=16 days of activism|publisher=UN Women www.unwomen.org|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign runs every year from 25 November, the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]], to 10 December, [[Human Rights Day]]. It was initiated in 1991 by the first Women's Global Leadership Institute, held by the [[Center for Women's Global Leadership]] (CWGL) at [[Rutgers|Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/16_days/en/|title=WHO {{!}} 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN Women"/&gt;

== Themes ==

Every year, the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Campaign either introduces a new theme, or continues an old theme. The theme focuses on one particular area of gender inequality and works to bring attention to these issues and make changes that will have an impact. The Center for Women's Global Leadership sends out a "Take Action Kit" every year, detailing how participants can get involved and campaign in order to make a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://16dayscwgl.rutgers.edu/about/the-annual-themes|title=The Annual Themes|last=|first=|date=|website=The Center for Women's Global Leadership|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two islands where ''P. borbonica agalega'' occurs, are small low coral sand islands. On these islands are mainly coconut tree plantations. The Agalega day gecko is often found on these trees as well as on ''Terminalia spec.'' and mango trees.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
This ''Phelsuma'' species is rather shy.

==Reproduction==

The pairing season is between April and the first weeks of September. During this period, the females lay up to 4 pairs of eggs, often under loose bark of coconut trees. Females often share the same location for their eggs. The young will hatch after approximately 70–100 days, depending on the temperature. The juveniles measure 45–50&amp;nbsp;mm.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 24 and 30&amp;nbsp;°C. During the night the temperature can drop to 18–22&amp;nbsp;°C. The relative humidity should be maintained between 40 and 60% during the day and 75% at night. These animals can be fed with [[cricket]]s,  [[wax moth]]s, [[Tephritidae|fruit flies]], [[mealworm]]s and [[housefly|houseflies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37065">The '''analytic–synthetic distinction''' (also called the '''analytic–synthetic dichotomy''') is a [[Semantics|semantic]] distinction, used primarily in [[philosophy]] to distinguish propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) into two types: '''analytic propositions''' and '''synthetic propositions'''. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref name=Rey/&gt; However, philosophers have used the terms in very different ways. Furthermore, philosophers have debated whether there is a legitimate distinction.

==Kant==
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

===Conceptual containment===
The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] uses the terms "analytic" and "synthetic" to divide propositions into two types. Kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the Introduction to his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781/1998, A6–7/B10–11). There, he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] judgments and defines "analytic proposition" and "synthetic proposition" as follows:
* '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is '''not''' contained in its subject concept but related

Examples of analytic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "All triangles have three sides."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are extended," that is, occupy space. (A7/B11)

Each of these statements is an affirmative subject-predicate judgment, and, in each, the predicate concept is ''contained'' within the subject concept. The concept "bachelor" contains the concept "unmarried"; the concept "unmarried" is part of the definition of the concept "bachelor". Likewise, for "triangle" and "has three sides", and so on.

Examples of synthetic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are alone."
* "All creatures with hearts have kidneys."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are heavy", that is, they experience a gravitational force. (A7/B11)

As with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions, each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment. However, in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept. The concept "bachelor" does not contain the concept "alone"; "alone" is not a part of the ''definition'' of "bachelor". The same is true for "creatures with hearts" and "have kidneys"; even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys, the concept "creature with a heart" does not contain the concept "has kidneys".

===Kant's version and the ''a priori''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''a posteriori'' distinction===
{{main|A priori and a posteriori}}
In the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction, the distinction between [[a priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] and [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] propositions. He defines these terms as follows:
* '''''a priori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does ''not'' rely upon experience. Moreover, the proposition can be validated by experience, but is not grounded in experience. Therefore, it is logically necessary.
* '''''a posteriori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does rely upon experience. The proposition is validated by, and grounded in, experience. Therefore, it is logically contingent.

Examples of ''a priori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "7 + 5 = 12."

The justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience: one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried, nor whether {{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}. (Of course, as Kant would grant, experience is required to understand the concepts "bachelor", "unmarried", "7", "+" and so forth. However, the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction as employed here by Kant refers not to the ''origins'' of the concepts but to the ''justification'' of the propositions. Once we have the concepts, experience is no longer necessary.)

Examples of ''a posteriori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unhappy."
* "Tables exist."

Both of these propositions are ''a posteriori'': any justification of them would require one's experience.

The analytic/synthetic distinction and the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction together yield four types of propositions:
# analytic ''a priori''
# synthetic ''a priori''
# analytic ''a posteriori''
# synthetic ''a posteriori''

Kant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory.  Ruling it out, he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological framework{{mdash}}each, for brevity's sake, becoming, respectively, "analytic", "synthetic a priori", and "empirical" or "a posteriori" propositions. This triad will account for all propositions possible.

===The ease of knowing analytic propositions===
Part of Kant's argument in the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' involves arguing that there is no problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible. To know an analytic proposition, Kant argued, one need not consult experience. Instead, one needs merely to take the subject and "extract from it, in accordance with the principle of contradiction, the required predicate" (A7/B12). In analytic propositions, the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept. Thus, to know an analytic proposition is true, one need merely examine the concept of the subject. If one finds the predicate contained in the subject, the judgment is true.

Thus, for example, one need not consult experience to determine whether "All bachelors are unmarried" is true. One need merely examine the subject concept ("bachelors") and see if the predicate concept "unmarried" is contained in it. And in fact, it is: "unmarried" is part of the definition of "bachelor" and so is contained within it. Thus the proposition "All bachelors are unmarried" can be known to be true without consulting experience.

It follows from this, Kant argued, first: All analytic propositions are ''a priori''; there are no ''a posteriori'' analytic propositions. It follows, second: There is no problem understanding how we can know analytic propositions;  we can know them because we only need to consult our concepts in order to determine that they are true.

===The possibility of metaphysics===
After ruling out the possibility of analytic ''a posteriori'' propositions, and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic ''a priori'' propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of synthetic ''a posteriori'' propositions. That leaves only the question of how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic ''a priori'' propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible.&lt;ref name=Langford1949&gt; See [[Cooper Harold Langford]] (1949)'s ostensive proof: {{cite journal|title= A Proof That Synthetic A Priori Propositions Exist|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|year= 1949 |volume= 46|number= 1| date= 1949-01-06|pages= 20–24 |jstor=2019526 |last1= Langford|first1= C. H.|authorlink1=Cooper Harold Langford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical positivists==

===Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition===
Over a hundred years later, a group of philosophers took interest in Kant and his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions: the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]].

Part of Kant's examination of the possibility of synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge involved the examination of mathematical propositions, such as
* "7 + 5 = 12." (B15–16)
* "The shortest distance between two points is a straight line." (B16–17)

Kant maintained that mathematical propositions such as these are synthetic ''a priori'' propositions, and that we know them. That they are synthetic, he thought, is obvious: the concept "equal to 12" is not contained within the concept "7 + 5";  and the concept "straight line" is not contained within the concept "the shortest distance between two points". From this, Kant concluded that we have knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions.

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s notion of analyticity included a number of logical properties and relations beyond containment: [[symmetry]], [[transitive relation|transitivity]], [[antonymy]], or [[negation]] and so on. He had a strong emphasis on formality, in particular formal definition, and also emphasized the idea of substitution of synonymous terms. "All bachelors are unmarried" can be expanded out with the formal definition of bachelor as "unmarried man" to form "All unmarried men are unmarried", which is recognizable as tautologous and therefore analytic from its logical form: any statement of the form "All ''X'' that are (''F'' and ''G'') are ''F''". Using this particular expanded idea of analyticity, Frege concluded that Kant's examples of arithmetical truths are analytical ''a priori'' truths and ''not'' synthetic ''a priori'' truths.

{{quote|1=Thanks to Frege's logical semantics, particularly his concept of analyticity, arithmetic truths like "7+5=12" are no longer synthetic ''a priori'' but analytical ''a priori'' truths in [[Carnap]]'s extended sense of "analytic".
Hence logical empiricists are not subject to Kant's criticism of Hume for throwing out mathematics along with metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;}}

(Here "logical empiricist" is a synonym for "logical positivist".)

===The origin of the logical positivist's distinction===
The logical positivists agreed with Kant that we have knowledge of mathematical truths, and further that mathematical propositions are ''a priori''. However, they did not believe that any complex metaphysics, such as the type Kant supplied, are necessary to explain our knowledge of mathematical truths. Instead, the logical positivists maintained that our knowledge of judgments like "all bachelors are unmarried" and our knowledge of mathematics (and logic) are in the basic sense the same: all proceeded from our knowledge of the meanings of terms or the conventions of language.

{{quote|Since empiricism had always asserted that ''all'' knowledge is based on experience, this assertion had to include knowledge in mathematics. On the other hand, we believed that with respect to this problem the rationalists had been right in rejecting the old empiricist view that the truth of "&lt;nowiki&gt;2+2=4&lt;/nowiki&gt;" is contingent on the observation of facts, a view that would lead to the unacceptable consequence that an arithmetical statement might possibly be refuted tomorrow by new experiences. Our solution, based upon [[Wittgenstein]]'s conception, consisted in asserting the thesis of empiricism only for factual truth. By contrast, the truths of logic and mathematics are not in need of confirmation by observations, because they do not state anything about the world of facts, they hold for any possible combination of facts.&lt;ref name=Schlipp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;|Rudolf Carnap|Autobiography: §10: Semantics, p. 64}}

===Logical positivist definitions===
Thus the logical positivists drew a new distinction, and, inheriting the terms from Kant, named it the "analytic/synthetic distinction".&lt;ref name=Ebbs/&gt; They provided many different definitions, such as the following:
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose truth depends solely on the meaning of its terms
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is true (or false) by definition
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is made true (or false) solely by the conventions of language

(While the logical positivists believed that the only necessarily true propositions were analytic, they did not define "analytic proposition" as "necessarily true proposition" or "proposition that is true in all possible worlds".)

Synthetic propositions were then defined as:
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition that is not analytic

These definitions applied to all propositions, regardless of whether they were of subject–predicate form. Thus, under these definitions, the proposition "It is raining or it is not raining" was classified as analytic, while for Kant it was analytic by virtue of its logical form. And the proposition "{{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}" was classified as analytic, while under Kant's definitions it was synthetic.

==Two-dimensionalism==
[[Two-dimensionalism]] is an approach to [[semantics]] in [[analytic philosophy]]. It is a theory of how to determine the [[sense and reference]] of a [[word]] and the [[truth-value]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. It is intended to resolve a puzzle that has plagued philosophy for some time, namely: How is it possible to discover empirically that a [[necessary truth]] is [[Truth|true]]? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by [[Robert Stalnaker]], but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including [[David Chalmers]] and [[Berit Brogaard]].

Any given sentence, for example, the words,
:"Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O"

is taken to express two distinct [[proposition]]s, often referred to as a ''primary intension'' and a ''secondary intension'', which together compose its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;

The primary [[intension]] of a word or sentence is its [[sense and reference|sense]], i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of "water" might be a description, such as ''watery stuff''. The thing picked out by the primary intension of "water" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take "water" to mean ''watery stuff'', but, where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, it is not the case that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for that world.

The ''secondary intension'' of "water" is whatever thing "water" happens to pick out in ''this'' world, whatever that world happens to be. So if we assign "water" the primary intension ''watery stuff'' then the secondary intension of "water" is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, since H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is ''watery stuff'' in this world. The secondary intension of "water" in our world is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in every world because unlike ''watery stuff'' it is impossible for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be other than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. When considered according to its secondary intension, "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is true in every world.

If two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language. [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is an example of the ''[[necessary truth|necessary]] [[a posteriori]]'', since we had to discover that water was H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but given that it is true, it cannot be false. It would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, for these are known to be ''identical''.

==Quine's criticisms==
{{See also|Willard Van Orman Quine#Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity}}
[[Rudolf Carnap]] was a strong proponent of the distinction between what he called "internal questions", questions entertained within a "framework" (like a mathematical theory), and "external questions", questions posed outside any framework&amp;nbsp;– posed before the adoption of any framework.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Murzi/&gt; The "internal" questions could be of two types: ''logical'' (or analytic, or logically true) and ''factual'' (empirical, that is, matters of observation interpreted using terms from a framework). The "external" questions were also of two types: those that were confused pseudo-questions ("one disguised in the form of a theoretical question") and those that could be re-interpreted as practical, pragmatic questions about whether a framework under consideration was "more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended".&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; The adjective "synthetic" was not used by Carnap in his 1950 work ''Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology''.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; Carnap did define a "synthetic truth" in his work ''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'': a sentence that is true, but not simply because "the semantical rules of the system suffice for establishing its truth".&lt;ref name=Carnap2/&gt;

The notion of a synthetic truth is of something that is true both because of what it means and because of the way the world is, whereas analytic truths are true in virtue of meaning alone. Thus, what Carnap calls internal ''factual'' statements (as opposed to internal ''logical'' statements) could be taken as being also synthetic truths because they require ''observations'', but some external statements also could be "synthetic" statements and Carnap would be doubtful about their status. The analytic–synthetic argument therefore is not identical with the [[internal–external distinction]].&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt;

In 1951, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published the essay "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" in which he argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is untenable.&lt;ref name=Dogmas/&gt; The argument at bottom is that there are no "analytic" truths, but all truths involve an empirical aspect. In the first paragraph, Quine takes the distinction to be the following:
* analytic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in meanings, independent of matters of fact.
* synthetic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in fact.

Quine's position denying the analytic-synthetic distinction is summarized as follows:
{{quote|It is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic fact. ... Thus one is tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component. Given this supposition, it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null; and these are the analytic statements. But, for all its ''a priori'' reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.&lt;ref name=Quine4/&gt;|Willard v. O. Quine|"Two Dogmas of Empiricism", p. 64}}

To summarize Quine's argument, the notion of an analytic proposition requires a notion of synonymy, but establishing synonymy inevitably leads to matters of fact&amp;nbsp;– synthetic propositions. Thus, there is no non-circular (and so no tenable) way to ground the notion of analytic propositions.

While Quine's rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction is widely known, the precise argument for the rejection and its status is highly debated in contemporary philosophy. However, some (for example, Boghossian&lt;ref name=Boghossian/&gt;) argue that Quine's rejection of the distinction is still widely accepted among philosophers, even if for poor reasons.

===Responses===
[[Paul Grice]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized "Two Dogmas" in their 1956 article "In Defense of a Dogma".&lt;ref name=Defense/&gt; Among other things, they argue that Quine's [[skepticism]] about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask "What does it mean?". If it makes sense to ask "What does it mean?", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question "What does it mean?" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of [[indeterminacy of translation]].

In ''Speech Acts'', [[John Searle]] argues that from the difficulties encountered in trying to explicate analyticity by appeal to specific criteria, it does not follow that the notion itself is void.&lt;ref name=Searle/&gt; Considering the way which we would test any proposed list of criteria, which is by comparing their extension to the set of analytic statements, it would follow that any explication of what analyticity means presupposes that we already have at our disposal a working notion of analyticity.

In "'Two Dogmas' Revisited", [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that Quine is attacking two different notions:&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;
{{quote|It seems to me there is as gross a distinction between 'All bachelors are unmarried' and 'There is a book on this table' as between any two things in this world, or at any rate, between any two linguistic expressions in the world;&lt;ref name=Putnam2/&gt;|Hilary Putnam|''Philosophical Papers'', p. 36}}

Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] by putting synonyms for synonyms is near [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what, however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern a priority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of a priority and sketch a methodology without it.&lt;ref name=Putnam1/&gt;

[[Jerrold Katz]], a one-time associate of [[Noam Chomsky]], countered the arguments of "Two Dogmas" directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.&lt;ref name=Linsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz1/&gt;

In ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis'', [[Scott Soames]] has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective:&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

:All necessary (and all ''a priori'') truths are analytic

:Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity.

It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published "Two Dogmas". Today, however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated. He says: "Very few philosophers today would accept either [of these assertions], both of which now seem decidedly antique."&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

==Peikoff's criticisms==
Philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], in his essay "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy",&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard, "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy" In ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology'' by Ayn Rand, Meridian Press, 1979, p 94 (first published in ''The Objectivist'' May 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; expands upon [[Ayn Rand]]'s analysis. He posits that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the following choice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; if it is about existents, it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logical argument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logic cannot establish it. If you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of your ''concepts'', then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal to your ''percepts'', then you cannot be certain of it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To Peikoff, the critical question is: What is included in the meaning of a concept?  He rejects the idea that some of the characteristics of a concept's referents are excluded from the concept.  Applying Rand's theory&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,'' 2nd edition, Meridian (Penguin Books), 1990 (first published in ''The Objectivist,'' July 1966 - February 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  that a concept is a "mental integration" of similar existents, treated as "units", he argues that concepts stand for and mean the actual existents, including all their characteristics, not just those used to pick out the referents or define the concept. He states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since a concept is an integration of units, it has no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of a concept consists of the units — the existents — which it integrates, including all the characteristics of these units.... The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, does not indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity — or from the concept.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, he argues that there is no valid distinction between "necessary" and "contingent" facts, and that all truths are learned and validated by the same process: the application of logic to perceptual data.  Associated with the analytic-synthetic dichotomy are a cluster of other divisions that Objectivism also regards as false and artificial, such as logical truth vs. factual truth, logically possible vs. empirically possible, and a priori vs. the a posteriori.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12938">'''Auto-Destructive Art''' (ADA) is a form of art coined by [[Gustav Metzger]], an artist born in Bavaria that moved to Britain in 1939. Taking place after [[World War II]], Metzger wanted to showcase the destruction created from the war through his artwork. This movement took place in England and was launched by Metzger in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, S. (2012, November 26). Gustav Metzger: 'Destroy, and you create' Retrieved October 13, 2016, from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/26/gustav-metzger-null-object-robot&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This term was invented in the early 1960s and put into circulation by his article "Machine, Auto-Creative and Auto-Destructive Art" in the summer 1962 issue of the journal ''Ark''.

== History ==
This movement sparked after World War I. Before [[World War I]], artists approached art very traditionally, with paint and paper. As seen in [[Impressionism]] and [[Expressionism]], artwork before war was inspired by everyday life.  After World War I, artists began to introduce new styles of art that used different medias and techniques. [[Cubism]] and [[Dada]]ism were at the heart of these new techniques. Auto-Destructive Art follows these newer techniques by taking everyday objects and causing damage. Destructive art is similar to Dadaism in the way it rejects past concepts in order to not only redefine art, but also to bring light to issues. Although similar to Dadaism, ADA was a movement of its own due to the style and time period. After World War II, many artists turned to [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]], but ADA differed with its focus on destruction.

== Influences ==
Auto-Destructive Art was highly influenced by World War II. After the many casualties and mass destruction, people around the world were distraught and horrified. In comparison to World War I, World War II had a different influence on art due to the extensive use of [[aircraft]] and the introduction of [[nuclear weapon]]s. These weapons greatly inspired artists to approach art using new means such as corrosion, stress, or heat. ADA represents the war and its casualties. Artists in this time period wanted to explore issues in new ways. In order to explore these issues in the industrial society, Metzger encouraged artists to work with scientists and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Beaven, K. (2012, July 16).

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Auto-Destructive Art’s purpose was to draw attention to the destruction of previous beliefs. By allowing stress and natural forces to create damage after an initial mark, the art is auto-created. This represents how man sparked and created destruction. The destruction also represents the chaos caused by the government. [[Politics]] was a major driving force of ADA artists. In interviews, Metzger expressed his dislike of politics and [[commercialism]]. Metzger believed the “aesthetic of revulsion” would add to the idea of the corrupt, [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Home, S. (1988, January 1). The Assault on Culture by Stewart Home chapter on 
auto-destructive art. Retrieved October 18, 2016, from 
https://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/auto.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; By damaging the art itself, Metzger is able to question the idea of what art is. He goes against the idea of [[egocentrism]] in the artistic world. Metzger believed that in order to bring light to the corruption in politics, he must remove himself and his work from the art.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, B. (2009, September 30).

&lt;/ref&gt; This excerpt reflects the idea that many ADA artists shared. They wanted to withdraw from mass production, commercialism, and manufacturing.

== Artists ==
Gustav Metzger grew up during the Holocaust, which greatly inspired his artwork. In 1943, Metzger lost his parents to Nazi attacks. Metzger quotes “Facing up to the Nazis and the powers of the Nazi state coloured my life as an artist,”. Metzger would spark the damage of the art piece to represent mankind’s destruction. He then allowed natural forces to take over which symbolized how mankind’s spark can result in much more destruction than intended. Metzger later used his art to speak out against the violence we do to each other and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Flailing Trees Gustav Metzger. (2009, July 3–19). Retrieved October 26, 2016, from
http://www.mif.co.uk/event/flailing-garden&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2009 piece, ''Flailing Trees'', Metzger uprooted and overturned a series of trees to symbolize the brutalization done to the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, S.

Along with Metzger, [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] was another influential destructive artist. Latham had an interest in “temporality” and “time based” destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Iles, C. (2006, April). Book smart: Chrissie Iles on John Latham. Retrieved October 26, 2016, from

&lt;/ref&gt; His most recognized piece was the ''Skoob Tower Ceremonies''. Latham used stacks of books to create towers that he then set on fire. This demonstration was controversial due to the recent Nazi attacks and book burnings that took place. Latham noted that he was not against the content in the books, but rather the idea that books are the only source of knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;Beaven, K. (2012, July 16).

Artist [[Jean Tinguely]] was also a powerful figure in destructive art with his use of mechanics in 1953. Later in his work, Tinguely wanted to focus on “dematerialization” by creating machines that would eventually destroy themselves.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica (Ed.). (n.d.). Jean Tinguely. Retrieved October 26, 2016, from
https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Tinguely 
&lt;/ref&gt; One very significant piece was ''Homage to New York''. This piece included a machine that created noise, paintings, and smoke before being stopped by a firefighter. The piece was meant to self-destruct and although was not able to complete its actions, still succeeded as an art piece. Tinguely believed this piece symbolized a freeing from material because once the performance was over, it was cleaned up and there was nothing left.&lt;ref&gt;Tinguely, J., &amp; Landy, M. (2009, September 1). Homage to Destruction. Retrieved October 26, 2016, from

&lt;/ref&gt;


Not only was destructive art seen in traditional art, but also performance art. [[Jeff Keen]], a film-maker, included forms of destruction in his “collaged films”. Keen would cut and edit scenes from pop culture, comics, and other films to create “multi-screen projections”. His films were seen as disconnected and jumbled which confused viewers. Keen symbolizes destruction in his cut and edit skills of previous works. By using other sources and editing them together, Keen has destructed the old and created something new.&lt;ref&gt;Beaven, K.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
Many strategies were used to create, or rather destroy art. Metzger used bricks, cloth, and other objects as a base for his work. He then used multiple types of harming materials such as acid or fire to create the destruction. For one piece, Metzger used a nylon sheet and then threw hydrochloric acid on it. Metzger noted that while the acid did destroy the sheet, it also created shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, S. (2012, November 26). Gustav Metzger: 'Destroy, and you create' Retrieved October
13, 2016, from
https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/26/gustav-metzger-null-object-robot

&lt;/ref&gt; This piece did not have a name for it, but was later recreated in 2004 as part of the ''Tate Britain exhibition, Art and the Sixties: This was Tomorrow.''&lt;ref&gt;Watling, L. (2012, January). Recreation of First Public Demonstration of Auto-Destructive Art 1960, remade

http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/metzger-recreation-of-first-public-demonstration-of-auto-destructive-art-t12156/text-summary
&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists explored the use of everyday objects such as books or mechanics. The use of everyday objects added to the concept of how materialism and manufacturing should be destroyed.

== Impact ==
One impact of ADA was the creation of the “[[Destruction in Art Symposium]]”(DIAS). Metzger was against the [[art dealer]] system and aimed to get Auto-Destructive Art publicly funded, but the government would not provide funding. Metzger was against art dealing because dealers were uninterested in the “fundamental technical change”. This resulted in Metzger and John Sharkey to organize DIAS in 1966, which was a volunteer based event that showcased different art forms from diverse individuals across the world. One significant performance at this event was [[Yoko Ono]]’s “Cut” piece.&lt;ref&gt;Home, S. (1988, January 1). The Assault on Culture by Stewart Home chapter on 
auto-destructive art. Retrieved October 18, 2016, from 
https://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/auto.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; In this piece, presented at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1971, Ono sat and allowed the audience to cut away pieces of her clothing. Allowing the audience to cut away her clothing not only represented female vulnerability but also destroyed the traditional relationship between the viewer and the artist.&lt;ref&gt;Yoko Ono’s Cut Piece explained. (n.d.). Retrieved October 27, 2016, from
http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2015/may/18/yoko-ono-s-cut-piece-explained/
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] would later relate [[Instrument destruction|destroying his guitar]] on stage to auto-destructive art. Band member [[Keith Moon]] dramatically followed suit by placing explosives into his drums (at some points nearly blowing himself to pieces).&lt;ref&gt;Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in Washington, D.C., would open an exhibit giving focus to destruction in art. The exhibit “Damage Control: Art and Destruction since 1950”, included a range of art that demonstrates how destruction has impacted art today.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, B. (2012, June 21). UNDER DESTRUCTION. Retrieved October 27, 2016, from
http://www.artnews.com/2012/06/21/under-destruction/&lt;/ref&gt;
Although not highly recognized or taught, Auto-Destructive Art still makes an impact on all types of artists to this day. It continues to inspire artists to disconnect from traditional art styles in order to bring attention to worldly issues.

The [[Sanskrit]] word, '''[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]]''', means 'consciousness' or 'spirit' or 'intelligence' or 'sensation'.

In the [[Upanishads]], it is explained that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the Self, represents itself differently in the seven-fold movement of [[Prakrti]] according to the dominant principle of the consciousness in the individual being. These seven folds of consciousness are – 1) Physical consciousness, 2) Vital consciousness, 3) Mental consciousness, 4) Supra-intellectual consciousness, 5) Consciousness proper to the universal Beatitude or Blissful consciousness, 6) Consciousness proper to the infinite divine self-awareness, and 7) Consciousness proper to the state of pure divine existence. [[Sri Aurobindo]] calls the consciousness proper to the infinite self-awareness as the ''Chaitanya Purusha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads: Texts, Translations and Commentaries|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=45|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=F0IJMaMTf0cC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=chaitanya+in+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V2UsUnHQmogH15yAkAI&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chaitanya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential nature of [[Brahman]] as revealed in deep sleep and Yoga is Chaitanya (pure consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mystical Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=S.C.Sen|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=178|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xnhNZQJ07DYC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=chaitanya+in+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=imssUtWXLJHRrQfL64CoDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chaitanya%20in%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedantists also speak about the Consciousness or ''Mayaopahita-chaitanya'' that is associated with the indescribable [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] which is responsible for the functions of creation, preservation and dissolution of entire Existence, and about the Consciousness or ''Avidyaopahita-chaitanya'' that is associated with [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]] which causes the wrong identification of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] with the body etc.; after negating both Maya and Avidya, that is, after all distinctions are obliterated, what remains is Pure Consciousness or Chaitanya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani |author=Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan|page=494|url= https://www.amazon.com/Sri-Samkaras-VIVEKACUDAMANI-Chandrasekharendra-Bharati/dp/8172764200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of an object that the mind assumes, after coming into contact with that object or enveloping it, is called ''[[Vritti]]''. The process of enveloping is called ''Vritti-Vyapti''. ''[[Vyapti]]'' is pervasion and the pervasion by the mind of a certain location called the object is ''Vritti-Vyapti''. The awareness that the object is there illuminates the object due to the presence in this moving process called the mind and is called ''phala-vyapti''. It is only because of the consciousness attending on the mind that the object is perceived. [[Vedanta]] says that the object cannot be wholly material and there is no qualitative difference between the object and consciousness which consciousness by coming into contact with the object knows that the object is there which fact implies that consciousness is inherent in the object. This is the ''Vishaya- chaitanya'' or the 'object-consciousness' which does not mean consciousness of the object but the object which is a phase of consciousness which prevails everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from Rig Veda – When Science was Religion|author=Choudur Satyanarayana Murthy|publisher=AuthorHouse|pages=66–67|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kv86C_pd5-YC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Chaitanya+in+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f0YsUpzUD8T_rAemwICgDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chaitanya%20in%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code morphing''' is an approach used in [[obfuscating software]] to protect [[software]] applications from [[reverse engineering]], analysis, modifications, and cracking. This technology protects intermediate level code such as compiled from Java and .NET languages ([[Oxygene (programming language)|Oxygene]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic]], etc.) rather than binary [[object file|object code]]. Code morphing breaks up the protected code into several processor commands or small command snippets and replaces them by others, while maintaining the same end result. Thus the protector obfuscates the code at the intermediate level.

Code morphing is a multilevel technology containing hundreds of unique code transformation patterns. In addition this technology transforms some intermediate layer commands into [[virtual machine]] commands (like [[UCSD p-System|p-code]]). Code morphing does not protect against runtime tracing, which can reveal the execution logic of any protected code.

Unlike other code protectors, there is no concept of code decryption with this method.  Protected code blocks are always in the executable state, and they are executed (interpreted) as transformed code. The original intermediate code is absent to a certain degree, but deobfuscation can still give a clear view of the original code flow.

Code morphing is also used to refer to the [[just-in-time compilation]] technology used in [[Transmeta]] processors such as the [[Transmeta Crusoe|Crusoe]] and [[Transmeta Efficeon|Efficeon]] to implement the [[x86]] instruction set architecture.  

Code morphing is often used in obfuscating the [[copy protection]] or other checks that a program makes to determine whether it is a valid, authentic installation, or an [[Copyright infringement of software|unauthorized copy]], in order to make the removal of the copy-protection code more difficult than would otherwise be the case.

In [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] ''X'' is '''contractible''' if the [[identity function|identity map]] on ''X'' is null-homotopic, i.e. if it is [[homotopic]] to some constant map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Munkres | first=James R. | authorlink=James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hatcher | first=Allen | authorlink=Allen Hatcher | title=Algebraic Topology | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-521-79540-0 | url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, a contractible space is one that can be continuously shrunk to a point within that space.

==Properties==
A contractible space is precisely one with the [[homotopy type]] of a point. It follows that all the [[homotopy group]]s of a contractible space are [[trivial group|trivial]]. Therefore any space with a nontrivial homotopy group cannot be contractible.  Similarly, since [[singular homology]] is a homotopy invariant, the [[Reduced homology|reduced homology groups]] of a contractible space are all trivial.

For a topological space ''X'' the following are all equivalent:
*''X'' is contractible (i.e. the identity map is null-homotopic).
*''X'' is homotopy equivalent to a one-point space.
*''X'' [[deformation retract]]s onto a point. (However, there exist contractible spaces which do not ''strongly'' deformation retract to a point.)
*For any space ''Y'', any two maps ''f'',''g'': ''Y'' → ''X'' are homotopic.
*For any space ''Y'', any map ''f'': ''Y'' → ''X'' is null-homotopic.

The [[cone (topology)|cone]] on a space ''X'' is always contractible. Therefore any space can be embedded in a contractible one (which also illustrates that subspaces of contractible spaces need not be contractible).

Furthermore, ''X'' is contractible [[if and only if]] there exists a [[Deformation retract|retraction]] from the cone of ''X'' to ''X''.

Every contractible space is [[path connected]] and [[simply connected]]. Moreover, since all the higher homotopy groups vanish, every contractible space is [[n-connected|''n''-connected]] for all ''n'' ≥ 0.

==Locally contractible spaces==
A topological space is '''locally contractible''' if every point has a [[local base]] of contractible [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]]s. Contractible spaces are not necessarily locally contractible nor vice versa. For example, the [[comb space]] is contractible but not locally contractible (if it were, it would be locally connected which it is not). Locally contractible spaces are locally ''n''-connected for all ''n'' ≥ 0. In particular, they are [[locally simply connected]], [[Locally connected space|locally path connected]], and [[locally connected]].

==Examples and counterexamples==
*Any [[Euclidean space]] is contractible, as is any [[star domain]] on a Euclidean space.
*The [[Whitehead manifold]] is contractible.
*[[n-sphere|Spheres]] of any finite dimension are not contractible.
*The [[unit sphere]] in an infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]] [[Contractibility of unit sphere in Hilbert space|is contractible]].
*The [[house with two rooms]] is standard example of a space which is contractible, but not intuitively so.
*The [[Dunce hat (topology)|Dunce hat]] is contractible, but not [[Collapse (topology)|collapsible]].
*The cone on a [[Hawaiian earring]] is contractible (since it is a cone), but not locally contractible or even locally simply connected.
*All [[manifold]]s and [[CW complex]]es are ''locally'' contractible, but in general not contractible.
* The [[Warsaw circle]] is obtained by "closing up" the [[topologist's sine curve]] by an arc connecting (0,&amp;minus;1) and (1,sin(1)). It is a one-dimensional continuum whose [[homotopy group]]s are all trivial, but it is not contractible.

[[Image:absolute complement.svg|200px|thumb|In this image, the '''universal set''' U (the entire rectangle) is dichotomized into the two sets A (in pink) and its complement A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; (in grey).]]
A '''dichotomy''' {{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɒ|t|ə|m|i}} is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of a whole (or a set) into two parts (subsets). In other words, this couple of parts must be
* [[jointly exhaustive]]: everything must belong to one part or the other, and
* [[mutually exclusive]]: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts.

Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition.

&lt;!-- this is a confused sentence - clearly ME and JE are NOT mutually exclusive, please re-phrase if you know how it works: 
These two ways to [[partition of a set|partition]] elements are themselves a dichotomy. --&gt;
The two parts thus formed are [[Complement (set theory)|complements]]. In [[logic]], the partitions are [[dual (category theory)|opposites]] if there exists a [[proposition]] such that it holds over one and not the other.

Treating [[continuous variable]]s or multi[[categorical variable]]s as [[binary variable]]s is called [[discretization|dichotomization]]. The [[discretization error]] inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes.

== Etymology ==

The term ''dichotomy'' is from the Greek language {{lang-el|διχοτομία}} ''dichotomía'' "dividing in two" from δίχα ''dícha'' "in two, asunder" and τομή ''tomḗ'' "a cutting, incision".

== Usage and examples==

* The above applies directly when the term is used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], or [[linguistics]]. For example, if there is a concept A, and it is split into parts B and not-B, then the parts form a dichotomy: they are mutually exclusive, since no part of B is contained in not-B and vice versa, and they are jointly exhaustive, since they cover all of A, and together again give A.
* In [[set theory]], a dichotomous relation ''R'' is such that either ''aRb'', ''bRa'', but not both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komjath|first1=Peter|last2=Totik|first2=Vilmos|title=Problems and Theorems in Classical Set Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbCmt-2NxtIC&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;ots=_iKgXwG7Qa&amp;dq=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;pg=PA497#v=onepage&amp;q=dichotomous%20relation%20set%20theory&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=17 September 2014|pages=497|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[statistics]], dichotomous data may only exist at first two [[levels of measurement]], namely at the [[nominal scale|nominal]] level of measurement (such as "British" vs "American" when measuring nationality) and at the [[ordinal scale|ordinal]] level of measurement (such as "tall" vs "short", when measuring height). A variable measured dichotomously is called a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. 
* In the [[classification of mental disorders]] in [[psychiatry]] or [[clinical psychology]], dichotomous classification or [[categorization]] refers to the use of cut-offs intended to separate disorder from non-disorder at some level of abnormality, severity or disability.
* A [[false dichotomy]] is an [[informal fallacy]] consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions: it is not jointly exhaustive and/or not mutually exclusive. In its most common form, two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive, when in fact other alternatives are possible. In some cases, they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground (see also [[undistributed middle]]).
* The divine dichotomy is mentioned in the ''[[Conversations With God]]'' series of books by religious author [[Neale Donald Walsch]].
* In economics, the [[classical dichotomy]] is the division between the real side of the economy and the monetary side. According to the classical dichotomy, changes in monetary variables do not affect real values such as output, employment, and the real interest rate. Money is therefore neutral in the sense that its quantity cannot affect these real variables.
* In [[biology]], a dichotomy is a division of organisms into two groups, typically based on a characteristic present in one group and absent in the other. Such dichotomies are used as part of the process of identifying species, as part of a [[dichotomous key]], which asks a series of questions, each of which narrows down the set of organisms. A well known dichotomy is the question "does it have a backbone?" used to divide species into [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
* In [[botany]], a dichotomy is a mode of branching by repeated [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] - thus a focus on branching rather than on division.
* In [[computer science]], more specifically in programming-language engineering, dichotomies are fundamental dualities in a language's design. For instance, [[C++]] has a dichotomy in its memory model (heap versus stack), whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system (references versus primitive data types).
* In the anthropological field of [[theology]] and in [[philosophy]], dichotomy is the belief that humans consist of a soul and a body. (See [[Mind-body dichotomy]].) This stands in contrast to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]].
* Perceived dichotomies are common in Western thought. [[C. P. Snow]] believes that Western society has become an argument culture ([[The Two Cultures]]). In ''The Argument Culture'' (1998), [[Deborah Tannen]] suggests that the dialogue of Western culture is characterized by a warlike atmosphere in which the winning side has truth (like a trophy). Such a dialogue virtually ignores the middle alternatives.
* In [[sociology]] and [[semiotics]], dichotomies (also sometimes called 'binaries' and/or 'binarisms') are the subject of attention because they may form the basis to divisions and inequality. For example, the [[Domestic-public dichotomy|domestic–public dichotomy]] divides men's and women's roles in a society; the [[East-West dichotomy]] contrasts the [[Orient]] and the [[Western world|Occident]]. Some social scientists attempt to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] dichotomies in order to address the divisions and inequalities they create: for instance [[Judith Butler]]'s deconstruction of the [[gender]]-dichotomy (or [[gender binary]]) and [[Val Plumwood]]'s deconstruction of the human-[[social environment|environment]] dichotomy.
* The [[I Ching]] and [[taijitu]] represent the yin yang theories of traditional [[Chinese culture]]. However, these do not represent a true dichotomy as the symbol incorporates a portion of each in the other, representing a dialectic.
* In [[dialectical behavioral therapy]], a treatment shown to have some success in treating some clients with [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], an essential tool used is based on the idea of dichotomy. Dichotomy, in this case, is a self-defeating behavior using "all-or-nothing" or [[splitting (psychology)|"black-and-white" thinking]]. The therapy teaches the patient how to change the dichotomy to a more "[[dialectical]]" (or "seeing the middle ground") way of thinking.
* One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification - classifying objects by recursively splitting them into two groups until all are separated and in their own unique category.
* [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/mwc/16540/dichotomy Astronomy] defines a dichotomy as "the phase of the moon or an inferior planet in which half its disk appears illuminated".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8705">'''Distinction bias''', a concept of [[decision theory]], is the tendency to view two options as more distinctive when evaluating them simultaneously than when evaluating them separately.

One writer has presented what he called "a simplistic view" of distinction bias: When asked if someone would like an apple, they may say "Yes". So, an apple is placed before them and they begin to eat it and are happy. But what if two apples were placed on the table - one was the one they would have happily eaten and the other which is slightly fresher looking. The individual will choose the fresher apple and eat it and be happy but if asked, "would you have enjoyed eating that other apple", they would likely say "No". Even though in the alternate, no-choice reality they were perfectly happy with the apple. Moreover, if presented with five apples on a table, they might examine each apple so that they would be sure they had the best one, even though the time spent making that decision would be wasted. The reason for this is that distinction bias causes individuals to "over-examine and over-value the differences between things as we scrutinize them."&lt;ref name="Real Decisions or Reflexive Nitpicking"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Jim|title=Real Decisions or Reflexive Nitpicking: Distinction Bias|url=http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2011/07/real-decisions-or-reflexive-nitpicking-distinction-bias.html|publisher=Our Founder|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hsee and Zhang ==
The concept of the distinction bias was advanced by Christopher K. Hsee and Jiao Zhang of the [[University of Chicago]] as an explanation for differences in evaluations of options between joint evaluation mode and separate evaluation mode (2004). Evaluation mode is a contextual feature in decision making. Joint evaluation mode is when options are evaluated simultaneously, and separate evaluation mode is when each option is evaluated in isolation (e.g., Hsee, 1998; Hsee &amp; Leclerc, 1998). Research shows that evaluation mode affects the evaluation of options, such that options presented simultaneously are evaluated differently from the same options presented separately.

Hsee and Zhang (2004) offered a number of potential explanations for this change in preferences from joint evaluation to separate evaluation, including the distinction bias. The distinction bias suggests that comparing two options, as done in joint evaluation, makes even small differences between options salient. In other words, viewing options simultaneously makes them seem more dissimilar than when viewing and evaluating each in isolation.

When predictions or choices are made, explained Hsee and Zhang in their 2004 paper, people are often in the joint evaluation (JE) mode but when people experience an event, they are often in the single evaluation (SE) mode. The 'utility function' of an attribute can vary between single evaluation and joint evaluation. When people in joint evaluation make predictions or decisions for events to be experienced in single evaluation, they often resort to their joint evaluation preferences rather than single evaluation preferences and over-predict the difference that different values of an attribute will lead their happiness in single evaluation. This over-prediction is referred to as the distinction bias.&lt;ref name="Hsee &amp; Zhang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsee|first1=Christopher|last2=Zhang|first2=Jiao|title=Distinction Bias: Misprediction and Mischoice Due to Joint Evaluation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2004|volume=86|issue=5|pages=680–695|ssrn=929932|accessdate=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.680|pmid=15161394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and applications==
For example, when televisions are displayed next to each other on the sales floor, the difference in quality between two very similar, high-quality televisions may appear great. A consumer may pay a much higher price for the higher-quality television, even though the difference in quality is imperceptible when the televisions are viewed in isolation. Because the consumer will likely be watching only one television at a time, the lower-cost television would have provided a similar experience at a lower cost.

The same calculus can apply when one is choosing between a cheaper store-brand food product and a more expensive brand-name product. In many cases, the difference in taste between the two products would not be worth the difference in price. If the products were sampled in isolation, the difference in taste would be unnoticeable or negligible; consequently, the difference in price, not the difference in taste, ought to determine which choice the consumer makes. In 2010, a magazine asked consumers to try 12 brands of baked beans. Branston won the taste test, followed by Asda, Morrisons, and Heinz. The Morrisons beans, in other words, were preferred over the Heinz beans, even though, as it happened, they were half the price.&lt;ref name="How To Get Your Own Way"&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Get Your Own Way (Critical Thinking)|url=http://www.howtogetyourownway.com/biases/distinction_bias.html|website=How To Get Your Own Way|publisher=How To Get Your Own Way|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One writer has discussed the distinction bias in connection with such matters as choosing a job or a house. When making a choice between an interesting job that pays $60,000 a year and a boring job that pays $70,000 a year or a choice between two equally priced houses, one of them larger but farther from work, the average individual is likely to make false assumptions – for example, that $70,000 will make them feel exactly one-sixth better than $60,000, or that 4,000 square-foot house is one-third better than a 3,000 square-foot house. In reality, on average, we don't actually feel one-sixth better having the extra money or one-third better having the extra space. The more sensible approach, the writer advises in accordance with the research of Hsee and Zhang, is to avoid comparing two jobs, or houses, directly. Instead, consider each job, or house, individually and make an overall assessment of each one on its own, and then compare assessments, which allows them to make a choice that accurately predicts future experience.&lt;ref name="Spring"&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Avoid Choosing the Wrong Job or House: Fight the Distinction Bias|url=http://www.spring.org.uk/2008/05/how-to-avoid-choosing-wrong-job-or.php|publisher=Psyblog|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further studies==
In 2009, Margaret E. Brooks, Ashley M. Guidroz, and Madhura Chakrabarti reported on two studies in which they had examined the reactions of job applicants to alternative approaches to diversity in employment decisions. The applicants preferred the so-called holistic approaches, and the magnitude of their preference was considerably greater when both approaches were evaluated simultaneously. The researchers found that the results, which they viewed as important for "applicant reactions research, human resource decision making, and policy formation", were consistent with distinction bias.&lt;ref name="International Journal of Selection and Assessment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Margaret|last2=Guidroz|first2=Ashley M.|last3=Chakrabarti|first3=Madhura|title=Distinction Bias in Applicant Reactions to Using Diversity Information in Selection|journal=International Journal of Selection and Assessment|date=12 November 2009|volume=17|issue=4|pages=377–390|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2389.2009.00480.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}

&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|date=November 2017}} Doubt on an [[emotion]]al level is indecision between [[belief]] and [[wikt:disbelief|disbelief]]. It may involve [[uncertainty]], [[distrust]] or lack of conviction on certain [[fact]]s, actions, motives, or [[Decision making|decisions]]. Doubt can result in delaying or rejecting relevant action out of concern for mistakes or missed opportunities.

[[File:Mr Pipo Think 03.svg|thumbnail|Doubt]]

==Definition==
The concept of doubt as a suspense between two contradictory propositions covers a range of phenomena: on a level of the mind it involves reasoning, examination of facts and evidence and on an emotional level believing and disbelieving

In premodern theology doubt was "the voice of an uncertain conscience" and  important to realize, because when in doubt "the safer way is not to act at all".

==Impact on society==
Doubt sometimes tends to call on [[reason]]. Doubt may encourage people to [[procrastination|hesitate]] before acting, and/or to apply more [[rigour|rigorous]] methods. Doubt may have particular importance as leading towards disbelief or non-acceptance.

[[Politics]], [[ethics]] and [[law]], with decisions that often determine the course of individual [[personal life|life]], place great importance on doubt, and often foster elaborate [[adversarial process]]es to carefully sort through all available evidence.

Societally, doubt creates an atmosphere of distrust, being accusatory in nature and ''de facto'' alleging either foolishness or deceit on the part of another. Such a stance has been fostered in Western European society since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in opposition to [[tradition]] and [[authority]].

==Psychology==
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalytic theory]] attributes doubt (which may be interpreted as a symptom of a [[phobia]] emanating from the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]) to [[childhood]], when the ego develops. Childhood experiences, these theories maintain, can plant doubt about one's abilities and even about one's very [[Personal identity|identity]].

[[Cognitive]] mental as well as more [[spirituality|spiritual]] approaches abound in response to the wide variety of potential causes for doubt. [[Behavioral therapy]] — in which a person systematically asks his own [[mind]] if the doubt has any real basis — uses rational, [[Socratic method]]s. This method contrasts to those of say, the [[Buddhist]] faith, which involve a more [[esoteric]] approach to doubt and inaction. Buddhism sees doubt as a negative attachment to one's perceived [[past]] and [[future]]. To let go of the personal [[history]] of one's life (affirming this release every day in [[meditation]]) plays a central role in releasing the doubts — developed in and attached to — that history.

Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[René Descartes|Descartes]] employed [[Cartesian doubt]] as a pre-eminent methodological tool in his fundamental philosophical investigations.
Branches of philosophy like [[logic]] devote much effort to distinguish the dubious, the [[probability|probable]] and the certain. Much of illogic rests on dubious assumptions, dubious data or dubious conclusions, with [[rhetoric]], [[whitewash (censorship)|whitewashing]], and [[deception]] playing their accustomed roles.

==Theology==
[[File:Caravaggio - The Incredulity of Saint Thomas.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''[[Doubting Thomas|The Incredulity of Saint Thomas]]'' by [[Caravaggio]].]]

Doubt that god(s) exist may form the basis of [[agnosticism]] — the belief that one cannot determine the existence or non-existence of god(s). It may also form other brands of [[skepticism]], such as [[Pyrrhonism]], which do not take a positive stance in regard to the existence of god(s), but remain negative. Alternatively, doubt over the existence of god(s) may lead to acceptance of a particular religion: compare [[Pascal's Wager]]. Doubt of a specific theology, scriptural or deistic, may bring into question the truth of that theology's set of beliefs. On the other hand, doubt as to some doctrines but acceptance of others may lead to the growth of [[heresy]] and/or the splitting off of [[sect]]s or groups of thought. Thus [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestants]]  doubted [[papal authority]], and substituted alternative methods of governance in their new (but still recognizably similar) churches.

[[Christianity]] often debates doubt in the contexts of [[salvation]] and eventual redemption in an [[afterlife]]. This issue has become particularly important in [[Protestantism]], which requires ''only'' the acceptance of [[Jesus]], though more contemporary versions have arisen within the Protestant churches that resemble [[Catholicism]].
[[File:Rae, Henrietta - Doubts - 1886.jpg|thumb|180px|''Doubts'', by [[Henrietta Rae]], 1886]]

Doubt as a path towards (deeper) [[belief]] lies at the heart of the story of Saint [[Thomas the Apostle]]. Note in this respect the theological views of [[Georg Hermes]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the starting-point and chief principle of every science, and hence of theology also, is not only methodical doubt, but positive doubt. One can believe only what one has perceived to be true from reasonable grounds, and consequently one must have the courage to continue doubting until one has found reliable grounds to satisfy the reason.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialists]] such as [[Søren Kierkegaard]] suggest that for one to truly have belief in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the belief would have no real substance. Belief is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to pragmatically justify the kind of total commitment involved in true theological belief or romantic love. Belief involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have belief is at the same time to have doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', ed. by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, v. 1, Princeton University Press, 1992, pp. 21–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Soren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'', trans. Hong and Malantschuk, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Most [[criminal law|criminal]] cases within an [[adversarial system]] require that the prosecution proves its contentions [[beyond a reasonable doubt]] — a doctrine  also called the "[[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]]". This means that the State must present propositions which preclude "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a [[reasonable person]] as to the guilt of defendant. Some doubt may persist, but only to the extent that it would ''not'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief in the defendant's guilt.  If the doubt raised ''does'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief, the jury is not satisfied beyond a "reasonable doubt".  The [[jurisprudence]] of the applicable jurisdiction usually defines the precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" for such purposes.

==Science==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection.
—[[Henri Poincaré]], Science and Hypothesis (1905) (from Dover abridged edition of 1952)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[scientific method]] regularly quantifies doubt, and uses it to determine whether [[further research is needed]]. [[Isaac Azimov]], in his essay collection ''[[Fact and Fancy]]'', described science as a system for causing and resolving intelligent doubt.&lt;ref&gt;http://patduffyhutcheon.com/humanist%20articles/asimov.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
Flying monkeys can be anyone who believes the narcissist's [[false self|fake persona]] including the narcissist's spouse, child, friend, sibling or cousin.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than Selfish&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Atkinson, flying monkeys are usually unwittingly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] people who believe the [[Smear campaign|smears]] about the victim although they may be another narcissist working in tandem.&lt;ref name=Atkinson/&gt;

According to [[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin]], proxy abusers can be:&lt;ref name=Vaknin&gt;Vaknin S (2010) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0aOH6kw9ug Abuse By Proxy: From Smear Campaigns to 3rd-party Stalking and Abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* the abuser's associates
* the victim's associates – manipulated to side with the abuser.
* authority and institutional figures – manipulated to side with the abuser.

==Tactics==
The flying monkey does the narcissist’s bidding to inflict additional torment to the target. It may consist of spying, spreading [[gossip]], threatening, painting the narcissist as the victim ([[victim playing]]) and the target as the perpetrator ([[victim blaming]]). Despite this, the narcissist does not hesitate to make flying monkeys his or her [[scapegoating|scapegoats]] when and if needed.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, J., [http://facesofnarcissism.com/2015/03/23/472/ Are you being used as a flying monkey for a narcissist?] 23 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The flying monkeys may make it seem like the narcissist is not really involved. They are likely to have no idea that they are being used.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

Multiple flying monkeys are likely to act as a [[mobbing]] force against a victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flyingmonkeysdenied.com Flying Monkeys Denied] [[C-PTSD]] and Narcissistic Abuse Recovery Website&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[divorce]] conflicts, the children can be used by one party as a weapon against the other party.&lt;ref name=Vaknin/&gt;

==Motivation==
The motives behind the narcissist's support group can be multiple. Service providers may be seduced by the [[Narcissistic charm|narcissist's charm]] into taking a one-sided perspective.&lt;ref&gt;S. Nightshade, ''A Pre-Book and a Victim's Guide to Surviving the Narcissist'' (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Family members may in good faith attempt to sort out the "[[Identified patient|problematic one]]".&lt;ref&gt;M. McGoldrick, ''You Can Go Home Again'' (London 1995) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; The [[codependent]] may seek to participate in the narcissist's [[omnipotence]], or use them as sanction for their own aggressive instincts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 510 and p. 498-500&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, others may simply be swept up by force of personality to [[Definition of the situation|define the situation]] along the narcissist's own lines.&lt;ref&gt;F.

[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|The unique factorization theorem was proved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''.&lt;ref name="Gauss1801.loc=16"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gauss|Clarke|1986|loc=Art. 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Gauss used the fundamental theorem for proving the [[law of quadratic reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gauss|Clarke|1986|loc=Art. 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[number theory]], the '''fundamental theorem of arithmetic''', also called the '''unique factorization theorem''' or the '''unique-prime-factorization theorem''', states that every [[integer]] greater than 1&lt;ref&gt;Using the [[empty product|empty product rule]] one need not exclude the number 1, and the theorem can be stated as: every positive integer has unique prime factorization.&lt;/ref&gt; either is a [[prime number]] itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers and that, moreover, this representation is unique, [[up to]] (except for) the order of the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hardy|Wright|2008|loc=Thm 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

:1200 = 2{{sup|4}} × 3{{sup|1}} × 5{{sup|2}} = 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 2 = ...

The theorem says two things for this example: first, that 1200 {{em|can}} be represented as a product of primes, and second, that no matter how this is done, there will always be exactly four 2s, one 3, two 5s, and no other primes in the product.

The requirement that the factors be prime is necessary: factorizations containing [[composite number]]s may not be unique (e.g., 12 = 2 × 6 = 3 × 4).

This theorem is one of the main [[Prime number#Primality of one|reasons why 1 is not considered a prime number]]: if 1 were prime, then factorization into primes would not be unique; for example, {{nowrap|1=2 = 2 × 1 = 2 × 1 × 1 = ...}}

==Euclid's original version==

Book VII, propositions 30, 31 and 32, and Book IX, proposition 14 of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' are essentially the statement and proof of the fundamental theorem.

{{Quotation|
If two numbers by multiplying one another make some
number, and any prime number measure the product, it will
also measure one of the original numbers.
|Euclid|[[#CITEREFEuclidHeath1956|Elements Book VII]], Proposition 30}}

(In modern terminology: if a  prime ''p'' divides the product ''ab'', then ''p'' divides either ''a'' or ''b'' or both.) Proposition 30 is referred to as [[Euclid's lemma]], and it is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

{{Quotation|
Any composite number is measured by some prime number.
|Euclid|[[#CITEREFEuclidHeath1956|Elements Book VII]], Proposition 31}}

(In modern terminology: every integer greater than one is divided evenly by some prime number.) Proposition 31 is proved directly by [[Proof by infinite descent|infinite descent]].

{{Quotation|
Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number.
|Euclid|[[#CITEREFEuclidHeath1956|Elements Book VII]], Proposition 32}}

Proposition 32 is derived from proposition 31, and proves that the decomposition is possible.

{{Quotation|
If a number be the least that is measured by prime numbers, it will not be measured by any
other prime number except those originally measuring it.
|Euclid|[[#CITEREFEuclidHeath1956|Elements Book IX]], Proposition 14}}

(In modern terminology: a [[least common multiple]] of several prime numbers is not a multiple of any other prime number.) Book IX, proposition 14 is derived from Book VII, proposition 30, and proves partially that the decomposition is unique – a point critically noted by [[André Weil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Weil|2007|p=5}}: "Even in Euclid, we fail to find a general statement about the uniqueness of the factorization of an integer into primes; surely he may have been aware of it, but all he has is a statement (Eucl.IX.I4) about the l.c.m. of any number of given primes."&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in this proposition the exponents are all equal to one, so nothing is said for the general case.

Article 16 of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]' ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' is an early modern statement and proof employing [[modular arithmetic]].&lt;ref name="Gauss1801.loc=16" /&gt;

==Applications==
===Canonical representation of a positive integer=== &lt;!-- Redirect [[Canonical form]] links here --&gt;

Every positive integer ''n'' &gt; 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers:
:&lt;math&gt;
n
= p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2} \cdots p_k^{n_k}
= \prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{n_i}
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap begin}}''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;{{nowrap end}} are primes and the ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive integers. This representation is commonly extended to all positive integers, including 1, by the convention that the [[empty product]] is equal to 1 (the empty product corresponds to ''k'' = 0).

This representation is called the '''canonical representation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''n'', or the '''standard form'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hardy|Wright|2008|loc=§ 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''n''.  For example,

:999 = 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×37,
:1000 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,
:1001 = 7×11×13.

Note that factors ''p''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 may be inserted without changing the value of ''n'' (e.g., 1000 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×3&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;×5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;br&gt;In fact, any positive integer can be uniquely represented as an [[infinite product]] taken over all the positive prime numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;
n=2^{n_1}3^{n_2}5^{n_3}7^{n_4}\cdots=\prod_{i=1}^\infty p_i^{n_i},
&lt;/math&gt;
where a finite number of the ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive integers, and the rest are zero. Allowing negative exponents provides a canonical form for positive [[rational number]]s.

===Arithmetic operations===
The canonical representations of the product, [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD), and [[least common multiple]] (LCM) of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' can be expressed simply in terms of the canonical representations of ''a'' and ''b'' themselves:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
 a\cdot b &amp;{}={} 2^{a_1+b_1}3^{a_2+b_2}5^{a_3+b_3}7^{a_4+b_4}\cdots
   &amp;&amp;{}={} \prod p_i^{a_i+b_i},\\
 \gcd(a,b) &amp;{}={} 2^{\min(a_1,b_1)}3^{\min(a_2,b_2)}5^{\min(a_3,b_3)}7^{\min(a_4,b_4)}\cdots
   &amp;&amp;{}={} \prod p_i^{\min(a_i,b_i)},\\
 \operatorname{lcm}(a,b) &amp;{}={} 2^{\max(a_1,b_1)}3^{\max(a_2,b_2)}5^{\max(a_3,b_3)}7^{\max(a_4,b_4)}\cdots
   &amp;&amp;{}={} \prod p_i^{\max(a_i,b_i)}.
 \end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

However, [[integer factorization]], especially of large numbers, is much more difficult than computing products, GCDs, or LCMs.  So these formulas have limited use in practice.

===Arithmetic functions===
{{Main article|Arithmetic function}}

Many arithmetic functions are defined using the canonical representation. In particular, the values of [[additive function|additive]] and [[multiplicative function|multiplicative]] functions are determined by their values on the powers of prime numbers.

==Proof==
The proof uses [[Euclid's lemma]] (''Elements'' VII, 30): if a prime ''p'' [[Divisor|divides]] the product of two [[natural number]]s ''a'' and ''b'', then ''p'' divides ''a'' or ''p'' divides ''b''.

===Existence===
We need to show that every integer greater than 1 is either prime or a product of primes.
For the base case, note that 2 is prime.
By [[strong induction]]: assume true for all numbers between 1 and ''n''. If ''n'' is prime, there is nothing more to prove. Otherwise, there are integers ''a'' and ''b'',  where ''n'' = ''ab'' and {{nowrap begin}}1 &lt; ''a'' ≤ ''b'' &lt; ''n''.{{nowrap end}}
By the induction hypothesis,
{{nowrap begin}}''a'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;{{nowrap end}}
and
{{nowrap begin}}''b'' = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;{{nowrap end}} are products of primes. But then
{{nowrap begin}}''n'' = ''ab'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;{{nowrap end}} is a product of primes.

===Uniqueness===
Assume that ''s'' &gt; 1 is the product of prime numbers in two different ways:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s
&amp;=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m \\
&amp;=q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

We must show ''m'' = ''n'' and that the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are a rearrangement of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

As ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; divides ''s'', [[Euclid's lemma]] implies that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; divides one of the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;; relabeling the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; if necessary, say that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; divides ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is prime, so its only divisors are itself and 1. Therefore, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{s}{p_1}
&amp;=p_2 \cdots p_m \\
&amp;=q_2 \cdots q_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Reasoning the same way, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must equal one of the remaining ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Relabeling again if necessary, say ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{s}{p_1 p_2}
&amp;=p_3 \cdots p_m \\
&amp;=q_3 \cdots q_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be done for each of the ''m'' ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s, showing that ''m'' ≤ ''n'' and every ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Applying the same argument with the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;'s and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;'s reversed shows ''n'' ≤ ''m'' (hence  ''m'' = ''n'') and every ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Elementary proof of uniqueness===
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can also be proved without using Euclid's lemma, as follows:

Assume that ''s'' &gt; 1 is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways. If ''s'' were prime then it would factor uniquely as itself, so there must be at least two primes in each factorization of ''s'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s
&amp;=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_m \\
&amp;=q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If any ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; then, by cancellation, ''s''/''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''/''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; would be another positive integer, different from s, which is greater than 1 and also has two distinct factorizations. But ''s''/''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is smaller than ''s'', meaning ''s'' would not actually be the smallest such integer. Therefore every ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; must be distinct from every ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Without loss of generality, take ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (if this is not already the case, switch the ''p'' and ''q'' designations.) Consider

:&lt;math&gt;t = (q_1 - p_1)(q_2 \cdots q_n),&lt;/math&gt;

and note that 1 &lt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''t'' &lt; ''s''. Therefore ''t'' must have a unique prime factorization. By rearrangement we see,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
t
&amp;= q_1(q_2 \cdots q_n) - p_1(q_2 \cdots q_n) \\
&amp;= s - p_1(q_2 \cdots q_n) \\
&amp;= p_1((p_2 \cdots p_m) - (q_2 \cdots q_n)).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''u'' = ((''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) - (''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is positive, for if it were negative or zero then so would be its product with ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, but that product equals ''t'' which is positive. So ''u'' is either 1 or factors into primes. In either case, ''t'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''u'' yields a prime factorization of ''t'', which we know to be unique, so ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; appears in the prime factorization of ''t''.

If (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) equaled 1 then the prime factorization of ''t'' would be all ''q'''s, which would preclude ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from appearing. Thus  (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not 1, but is positive, so it factors into primes: (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;). This yields a prime factorization of

:&lt;math&gt;t = (r_1 \cdots r_h)(q_2 \cdots q_n),&lt;/math&gt;

which we know is unique. Now, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; appears in the prime factorization of ''t'', and it is not equal to any ''q'', so it must be one of the ''r'''s. That means ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a factor of (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), so there exists a positive integer ''k'' such that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''k'' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;p_1(k+1) = q_1.&lt;/math&gt;

But that means ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has a proper factorization, so it is not a prime number. This contradiction shows that ''s'' does not actually have two different prime factorizations. As a result, there is no smallest positive integer with multiple prime factorizations, hence all positive integers greater than 1 factor uniquely into primes.

==Generalizations==
The first generalization of the theorem is found in Gauss's second monograph (1832) on [[biquadratic reciprocity]]. This paper introduced what is now called the [[ring theory|ring]] of [[Gaussian integer]]s, the set of all [[complex number]]s ''a'' + ''bi'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers. It is now denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[i].&lt;/math&gt; He showed that this ring has the four units ±1 and ±''i'', that the non-zero, non-unit numbers fall into two classes, primes and composites, and that (except for order), the composites have unique factorization as a product of primes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFGauss1832|Gauss, BQ, §§ 31–34]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in 1844 while working on [[cubic reciprocity]], [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] introduced the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\omega]&lt;/math&gt;, where   &lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\omega^3=1 &lt;/math&gt; is a cube [[root of unity]]. This is the ring of [[Eisenstein integer]]s, and he proved it has the six units &lt;math&gt;\pm 1, \pm\omega, \pm\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; and that it has unique factorization.

However, it was also discovered that unique factorization does not always hold. An example is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt;. In this ring one has&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hardy|Wright|2008|loc=§ 14.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
6=
2\cdot 3=
(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5}).
&lt;/math&gt;

Examples like this caused the notion of "prime" to be modified. In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product, e.g., 2 = ''ab'', then one of ''a'' or ''b'' must be a unit. This is the traditional definition of "prime". It can also be proven that none of these factors obeys Euclid's lemma; e.g.,
2 divides neither (1 + {{sqrt|&amp;minus;5}}) nor (1 &amp;minus; {{sqrt|&amp;minus;5}}) even though it divides their product 6. In [[algebraic number theory]] 2 is called '''irreducible''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; (only divisible by itself or a unit) but not '''prime''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; (if it divides a product it must divide one of the factors). The mention of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; is required because 2 is prime and irreducible in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}.&lt;/math&gt; Using these definitions it can be proven that in any ring a prime must be irreducible. Euclid's classical lemma can be rephrased as "in the ring of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; every irreducible is prime". This is also true in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[i]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\omega],&lt;/math&gt; but not in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}].&lt;/math&gt;

The rings in which factorization into irreducibles is essentially unique are called [[unique factorization domain]]s. Important examples are [[polynomial ring]]s over the integers or over a [[field (mathematics)|field]], [[Euclidean domain]]s and [[principal ideal domain]]s.

In 1843 [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] introduced the concept of [[ideal number]], which was developed further by [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] (1876) into the modern theory of [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideals]], special subsets of rings. Multiplication is defined for ideals, and the rings in which they have unique factorization are called [[Dedekind domain]]s.

There is a version of [[ordinal arithmetic|unique factorization for ordinals]], though it requires some additional conditions to ensure uniqueness.

In [[continuum mechanics]], the '''generalized Lagrangian mean''' ('''GLM''') is a formalism – developed by {{harvs|txt=yes|last1=Andrews|first1=D.G.|last2=McIntyre|year=1978a|first2=M.E.|year2=1978b}} – to unambiguously split a motion into a [[average|mean part]] and an [[oscillation|oscillatory part]]. The method gives a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian description]] for the [[fluid flow|flow]] [[field (physics)|field]], but appointed to fixed [[Eulerian coordinates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Craik|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In general, it is difficult to decompose a combined wave–mean motion into a mean and a wave part, especially for flows bounded by a wavy surface: e.g. in the presence of [[surface gravity wave]]s or near another undulating bounding surface (like atmospheric flow over mountainous or hilly terrain). However, this splitting of the motion in a wave and mean part is often demanded in [[mathematical model]]s, when the main interest is in the mean motion – slowly varying at scales much larger than those of the individual undulations. From a series of [[postulate]]s, {{harvtxt|Andrews|McIntyre|1978a}} arrive at the (GLM) formalism to split the flow: into a generalised Lagrangian mean flow and an oscillatory-flow part.  

The GLM method does not suffer from the strong drawback of the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian specification of the flow field]] – following individual [[fluid parcel]]s – that Lagrangian positions which are initially close gradually drift far apart. In the Lagrangian frame of reference, it therefore becomes often difficult to attribute Lagrangian-mean values to some location in space.

The specification of mean properties for the oscillatory part of the flow, like: [[Stokes drift]], [[wave action (continuum mechanics)|wave action]], [[pseudomomentum]] and [[pseudoenergy]] – and the associated [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s – arise naturally when using the GLM method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|McIntyre|1978b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McIntyre|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLM concept can also be incorporated into [[variational principle]]s of fluid flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Holm|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2054">In [[category theory]] in [[mathematics]] a '''family of generators''' (or '''family of separators''') of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; is a collection &lt;math&gt;\{G_i\in Ob(\mathcal C)|i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; of objects, indexed by some set ''I'', such that for any two morphisms &lt;math&gt;f, g: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;f\neq g&lt;/math&gt; then there is some ''i∈I'' and morphism &lt;math&gt;h : G_i \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, such that the compositions &lt;math&gt;f \circ h \neq g \circ h&lt;/math&gt;. If the family consists of a single object ''G'', we say it is a '''generator''' (or '''separator'''). 

Generators are central to the definition of [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]].

The [[dual (category theory)|dual]] concept is called a '''cogenerator''' or '''coseparator'''.

==Examples==
* In the category of [[abelian groups]], the group of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z&lt;/math&gt; is a generator: If ''f'' and ''g'' are different, then there is an element &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \neq g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z \rightarrow X,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;n \mapsto n \cdot x&lt;/math&gt; suffices.
* Similarly, the one-point [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a generator for the [[category of sets]]. In fact, any nonempty set is a generator.
* In the category of sets, any set with at least two objects is a cogenerator.
* In the category of modules over a ring R, a generator in a finite direct sum with itself contains an isomorphic copy of R as a direct summand.  Consequently, a generator module is faithful, i.e. has zero [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12955">'''Golden City''' is a fictional city that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], and is part of the [[Comics Greatest World]] imprint.
It was created by [[Team CGW]].
Golden City first appeared in ''Comics' Greatest World: Golden City'' Week 1, in 1993.  It is the home and base of operations for [[Catalyst: Agents of Change]].

== Location ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;A small West Coast town turned burgeoning superhero Utopia; transformed by a young superwoman's extraordinary vision.  No crime, no poverty, no pollution.  An exclusive community; progressive, clean, and efficiently run.  Golden City is the best of humanity personified; home to the gods.

But there is trouble in this paradise: dreamers, the homeless, the hopeless, and the dying all see Golden City as their personal panacea.  Roads are backed up for miles in all directions with those who want to move to Golden City.{{ref|[1]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Golden City is located in northwestern California. 
In the Comics' Greatest World Sourcebook, it is said to be on West Coast of the United States. 
The Titan Special confirmed this and showed it to be near the Oregon border.

== History ==
This character history covers the entire published history of the Dark Horse Comics and Comics' Greatest World environ Golden City.

=== Grace ===
{{main|Grace (Dark Horse Comics)}}
'''Golden City''' was originally just another small American town on the California coast, but that was before the woman called '''Grace''' arrived. 
Becoming the town's mayor and "founding mother," Grace turned Golden City into a "megalopolis" and "a contemporary utopia" {{ref|[2]}}.

At one point it is said Grace was one of the first "magick people," rising out of "their midst to lead them" {{ref|[3]}}.
However, this is stated in a fairy tale being told by a woman to her son.
On a side note, if the information in the fairy tale can be taken at face value, Titan was not the first hero to join Grace in Golden City.

=== Titan and Golden Boy ===
{{main|Titan (Dark Horse Comics)}}
Frank Wells, a teenage runaway and metahuman, finds his way to Golden City and is trained by Grace to become '''Titan'''.
He was eventually given a boy sidekick named Elmore Meyer AKA '''Golden Boy'''.

Golden Boy was a public relations tool and having no apparent powers, he was more of a liability than an aid to Titan. 
On Golden Boy's first solo mission he was captured and tortured, resulting in the loss of an eye. 
Grace then retired the boy, having his mind erased by her aide '''Madison'''.

Over the next few years, Titan proved himself, but as he saw it "in the end, Grace betrayed me... betrayed Titan!" {{ref|[4]}}. 
The betrayal came with Grace's announcement to the world of a hero for the new age of Golden City, '''Rebel'''.

===Catalyst===
{{main|Catalyst: Agents of Change}}
'''Warmaker''', a former United States soldier turned supervillain, is sent by the government to be imprisoned in The Vault, a super-prison located in Golden City. 
He escapes (or is allowed to escape by Grace) and begins a rampage.

He faces the heroes of Golden City, including newcomers '''Mecha''' and '''Ruby''', causing massive amounts of destruction to the city, until Grace arrives to face him. 
She easily defeats Warmaker, but Titan attacks him for no reason. 
Warmaker strikes Titan knocking him into '''Rhapsody''', the local healer, who falls into a crater and is killed.

Grace uses Warmaker's escape and the death of Rhapsody as a rallying point and announces Golden City’s secession from the United States.

=== War of Secession ===
After Grace refuses to kill '''Vortex''', the US Army attacks.  
The heroes of Golden City, now officially teamed together as '''Catalyst''', battle both ground troops and aircraft while simultaneously protecting the city and its citizens from debris and fallout from the radioactive weapons being used by the army.

An armored super-soldier called Grenade is sent in by the army. 
He battles and is defeated by Titan, Warmaker, and Ruby, before self destructing releasing radiation into the wheat field battleground. 
Negative media coverage forces the government to reach a settlement with Grace.

=== Will To Power ===
{{main|Will to Power (comics)}}
Titan leaves the team to work for the government. 
This begins a downward spiral for him and he becomes progressively more and more demented. 
Grace takes the command of the situation placing Titan in the Vault. 
He escapes and confronts the Catalyst team.

Realizing they are outgunned, Grace sends Titan to face down the man from the '''Vortex'''. 
Then, she teleports to Cinnabar Flats to warn Vortex of Titan’s impending arrival. 
Vortex kills Titan as vengeance for the death of Lt. Anderson, his friend. 
Taking Anderson’s body, he reenters the vortex, leaving Grace to safeguard his base.

=== Law ===
{{main|Law (comics)}}
Having faked the death of Grace, the villain '''Law''' manipulates his way into power as Golden City's new ruler. He slowly weeds out Grace loyalists, killing Madison and driving Mecha and Warmaker out of Golden City.

Law then has a large gate built at the entrance to Golden City, this '''Judgment Gate''' is powered by "the essence of the Maelstrom" and will mutate, enhance or kill all that pass through it {{ref|[5]}}. Less than 10% of those who pass through the gate are enhanced.

He then has the President of the United States kidnapped and imprisoned in The Vault, as well as annexed the state of California as a refuge for all those enhanced by the Maelstrom.

Before the full extent of Law's plans is revealed he is killed by a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]], commonly known as one of the aliens from the Predator movies. 
Grace and her allies then begin the task of "putting Golden City back together" {{ref|[6]}}.

==Notable Citizens==
===City Officials===
*[[Grace (Dark Horse Comics)|Grace]]: The mayor and later monarch of Golden City. She is the founder and leader of Catalyst and a formidable hero in her own right.
*Madison: Grace's second in command and the apparent leader of the council. Madison is a telepath and has the ability to control other people's minds. He is killed by the madman Law in his takeover of Golden City.
*The Council: The ruling body of Golden City in the weeks after the disappearance of Grace. They are killed by agents of Law when they refuse to make him the dictator of Golden City.
*[[Law (comics)|Law]]: Grace's Replacement as monarch of Golden City. He is a villain who uses treachery and murder to rise to power. He is killed by a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]].
*Phillip: Law's right-hand man.

=== Members of Catalyst ===
*[[Titan (Dark Horse Comics)|Titan]]: One of Golden City's first heroes, an egomaniac. After leaving Golden City he becomes more and more a loose cannon, eventually becoming a villain.
*Mecha (Art Thomason): a non-enhanced human and former United States soldier bonded with the battle armour of Vortex.
*Ruby (Real name unknown): A young woman with the ability to disintegrate anything she touches.
*Rebel (Matt and Mark Morrissette): Identical twins who share an energy absorbing power.  Matt is more controlled, where Mark is a loose cannon.
*Warmaker (Elvis Westbury): US soldier turned criminal turned hero.
He has a nano-technology based battle suit which generates weapons for him.

=== Villains ===
*Golden Boy: Titan's former side-kick.
Became a villain after a botched mindwipe from Madison. He is killed by the NSC.
*Sabrinna: A chronomorph. She aids Law in discrediting Warmaker and later replaces US President Bill Clinton.
*Redline: A speedster, works for Law.
*Pouch: Has the ability to store energy. Transports Maelstrom energy from Nevada to Golden City to power the Judgment Gate, but the process kills him.

=== Civilians ===
*Rhapsody: An enigmatic woman with the ability to heal with the slightest touch.
She was killed during the battle with Warmaker.

== News Outlets ==
*KCGT
*Golden City Guardian

== The Citadel ==
Headquarters of Grace and Catalyst. The Citadel appears to be a large tower set on top of a hill in the center of Golden City. It actually continues down into the hill, going down at least to the hill's base. There are many labs and living quarters, as well as '''The Vault''', a metahuman prison, located within the bowels of the Citadel.

== The Vault ==
Super-prison located under The Citadel. In later appearances it is called Citadel Prison.

During his control of Golden City, Law had all the prisoners in The Vault executed except for three. 
Of these three, only Ignition is identified.

== The Judgment Gate ==
A mechanical device created by scientists working for Law, it is powered by energies from '''The Maelstrom''' and has one of three effects on all who pass through it: "enhancement, mutation, or death as the Maelstrom energy decides" {{ref|[3]}}.
It is the gateway from the outside world into Golden City open for all who deem themselves worthy to pass through. Only 7.6% of those who pass through the gate gain abilities and of those, most are "insignificant abilities." The rest are killed or mutated, with the mutates executed by Law's troops, "and still they come." {{ref|[7]}}

The '''halo effect''' is a type of immediate judgement discrepancy, or [[cognitive bias]], where a person making an initial assessment of another person, place, or thing will assume ambiguous information based upon [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking, fast and slow|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|year=2013|isbn=978-0-374-53355-7|edition=1st |location=New York|pages=82–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Halo Effect and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers|last=Rosenzweig|first=Philip M.|publisher=Free Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4767-8403-8|location=New York, NY|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lachman|first=Sheldon J.|last2=Bass|first2=Alan R.|date=November 1985|title=A Direct Study of Halo Effect|url=|journal=Journal of Psychology|volume=119 |issue=6|pages=535–540|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simplified example of the halo effect is when an individual noticing that the person in the photograph is attractive, well groomed, and properly attired, assumes, using a mental [[heuristic]], that the person in the photograph is a good person based upon the rules of that individual's social concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thorndike|first=E.L.|date=1920|title=A constant error in psychological ratings.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/apl/4/1/25|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=25–29|doi=10.1037/h0071663|issn=0021-9010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=Richard E.|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|date=1977|title=The halo effect: Evidence for unconscious alteration of judgments.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/35/4/250|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=250–256|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.4.250|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Jeremy L.|last2=Gore|first2=Jonathan S.|date=2016-12-01|title=Is He a Hero or a Weirdo?

The halo effect can also be explained as the behavior (usually unconscious) of using evaluations based on things unrelated, to make judgments about something or someone. The halo effect specifically refers to when this behavior has a positive correlation, such as viewing someone who is attractive as likely to be successful and popular. When this judgement has a negative connotation, such as someone unattractive being more readily blamed for a crime than someone attractive, it is referred to as the [[horn effect]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sigall|first=Harold|last2=Ostrove|first2=Nancy|date=1975-03-01|title=Beautiful but Dangerous: Effects of Offender Attractiveness and Nature of the Crime on Juridic Judgment|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232451231|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=31|issue=3|pages=410–414|doi=10.1037/h0076472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The halo effect was named by psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] in reference to a person being perceived as having a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. He gave the phenomenon its name in his 1920 article [[#CITEREFThorndike1920|"A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings"]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1920-10104-014|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Constant Error", Thorndike set out to replicate the study in hopes of pinning down the bias that he thought was present in these ratings. Subsequent researchers have studied it in relation to [[attractiveness]] and its bearing on the judicial and educational systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thorndike originally coined the term referring only to people; however, its use has been greatly expanded especially in the area of brand marketing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Supporting evidence===
In "A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings", Thorndike asked two commanding officers to evaluate their soldiers in terms of physical qualities (neatness, voice, [[physical attractiveness|physique]], bearing, and energy), intellect, leadership skills, and personal qualities (including dependability, loyalty, responsibility, selflessness, and cooperation).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His goal was to see how the ratings of one characteristic affected other characteristics.

Thorndike's study showed how there was too great a [[Correlation (statistics)|correlation]] in the commanding officers' responses. In his review he stated: "The correlations are too high and too even. For example, for the three raters next studied[,] the average correlation for physique with intelligence is .31; for physique with leadership, .39; and for physique with character, .28".{{Sfnp | Thorndike | 1920 | p = 27}}  The ratings of one of the special qualities of an officer often started a trend in the rating results. If an officer had a particular "negative" attribute given off to the commanding officer, it would correlate in the rest of that soldier's results.

==Cognitive bias==
[[File:Fried Rosenstock L’Artista Santo.jpg|thumb]]
The term "halo" is used in analogy with the religious concept: a glowing circle crowning the heads of saints in countless medieval and Renaissance paintings, bathing the saint's face in heavenly light. The observer may be subject to overestimating the worth of the observed by the presence of a quality that adds light on the whole like a halo. In other words, observers tend to bend their judgement according to one patent characteristic of the person (the "halo"), generalizing towards a judgement of that person's character (e.g., in the literal hagiologic case, "entirely good and worthy").

The effect works in both positive and negative directions (and is hence sometimes called the [[Bias#Horn effect|horns and halo effect]]). If the observer likes one aspect of something, they will have a positive predisposition toward everything about it. If the observer dislikes one aspect of something, they will have a negative predisposition toward everything about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Horns and halo effect|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/horns+and+halo+effect|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of attractiveness==
A person's attractiveness has also been found to produce a halo effect. Attractiveness provides a valuable aspect of the halo effect to consider because of its multifaceted nature; attractiveness may be influenced by several specific traits.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Halo Effect|last=LeClaire|first=Anne|publisher=Lake Union Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These perceptions of attractiveness may affect judgments tied to personality traits. Physical attributes contribute to perceptions of attractiveness (e.g., weight, hair, eye color). For example, someone who is perceived as attractive, due in part to physical traits, may be more likely to be perceived as kind or intelligent. The role of attractiveness in producing the halo effect has been illustrated through a number of studies. Recent research, for example, has revealed that attractiveness may affect perceptions tied to life success and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1023/A:1023582629538|title=Weight Halo Effects: Individual Differences in Perceived Life Success as a Function of Women's Race and Weight|year= 2003|last1= Wade | first1 = T Joel|last2=DiMaria|first2=Cristina |journal=Sex Roles|volume=48|issue=9/10|pages=461–465}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, attractiveness was correlated with weight, indicating that attractiveness itself may be influenced by various specific traits.  Included in the personality variables were trustworthiness and friendliness.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People perceived as being more attractive were more likely to be perceived as trustworthy and friendly.  What this suggests is that perceptions of attractiveness may influence a variety of other traits, which supports the concept of the halo effect.

===On personality===
{{Harvtxt | Dion | Berscheid | Walster | 1972}} conducted a study on the relationship between attractiveness and the halo effect. Sixty students, thirty male and thirty female) from the [[University of Minnesota]] took part in the experiment. Each subject was given three different photos to examine: one of an attractive individual, one of an individual of average attractiveness, and one of an unattractive individual.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Jean-Claude|date=|title=2010|url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1990/A1990EH31100001.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants judged the photos' subjects along 27 different personality traits (including altruism, conventionality, self-assertiveness, stability, emotionality, trustworthiness, [[extraversion]], kindness, and sexual promiscuity). Participants were then asked to predict the overall happiness the photos' subjects would feel for the rest of their lives, including marital happiness (least likely to get divorced), parental happiness (most likely to be a good parent), social and professional happiness (most likely to experience life fulfillment), and overall happiness. Finally, participants were asked if the subjects would hold a job of high status, medium status, or low status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Results showed that most of the participants overwhelmingly believed more attractive subjects have more socially desirable personality traits than either averagely attractive or unattractive subjects. Participants also believed that attractive individuals would lead happier lives in general, have happier marriages, and have more career success than the others. Also, results showed that attractive people were believed to be more likely to hold secure, prestigious jobs compared to unattractive individuals. Participants however believed that attractive individuals would be worse parents than both average attractive and unattractive individuals.

===Academics and intelligence===
A study by {{harvtxt|Landy|Sigall|1974}} demonstrated the Halo Effect, looking at judgments of intelligence and competence on academic tasks. Sixty male undergraduate students rated the quality of essays which included both well and poorly written samples. One third were presented with a photo of an attractive female as author, another third with that of an unattractive female as author, and the last third were shown neither. In average most of the participants gave significantly better writing evaluations for the more attractive author. On a scale of 1 to 9, the well-written essay by the attractive author received an average of 6.7 while the unattractive author received a 5.9 (with a 6.6 as a control). The gap was larger on the poor essay: the attractive author received an average of 5.2, the control a 4.7, and the unattractive a 2.7, suggesting readers are generally more willing to give physically attractive people the benefit of the doubt when performance is below standard than others.

Research conducted by Moore, Filippou, &amp; Perrett (2011),&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=F. R.|last2=Filippou|first2=D.|last3=Perrett|first3=D. I.|date=2011-09|title=Intelligence and attractiveness in the face: Beyond the attractiveness halo effect|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Psychology|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=205–217|doi=10.1556/jep.9.2011.3.2|issn=1789-2082}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought residual cues to [[intelligence]] in female and male faces while attempting to control for the [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]] halo effect. Over 300 photographs of Caucasian British college students were rated for perceived intelligence. The photographs that were scored lowest in low perceived intelligence were used to create a low-intelligence composite face and those photographs that were scored highest for high perceived intelligence were used to create a high-intelligence composite face. Both female and male, of high- and low- perceived intelligence were created resulting in four groups of composite faces. Participants for the study were recruited online; 164 female and 92 male [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] residents of the UK rated each of the composite faces for intelligence and attractiveness. Of the female composites, attractiveness seemed to be controlled as both the high- and low- perceived intelligence groups were rated as equally attractive. However, of the male face composites, the high-perceived intelligence group was rated as significantly more attractive than the low-perceived intelligence group, suggesting that either the authors could not adequately control for the attractiveness halo effect for the male composite photographs or that intelligence is an integral factor of attractiveness in high intelligent male faces. The second part of the study found that the composites in the high-perceived intelligence group were rated highest in the factors of friendly and funny as markers of intelligence in both the female and male group. While intelligence does not seem to be a factor that contributes to attractiveness in women, with regards to men, attractive faces are perceived to be more intelligent, friendly, and funny by women and men.

===Political effects===
A study by {{Harvtxt | Verhulst | Lodge | Lavine | 2010}} found that attractiveness and familiarity are strong predictors of decisions regarding who is put in a position of leadership.  Judgments made following one-second exposures to side-by-side photos of two US congressional candidates were reasonably predictive of election outcomes. Attractiveness and familiarity were correlated with competence in this study. Candidates who appeared more attractive and familiar were also seen as more competent and were found more likely to be elected.  Similar studies {{Harv | Palmer | Peterson | 2012}} found that even when taking factual knowledge into account, candidates who were rated as more attractive were still perceived as more knowledgeable.  These results suggest that the halo effect greatly impacts how individuals perceive political knowledge and it demonstrates the powerful influence of the halo effect in politics.

===The judicial context===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
Study results showing the influence of the halo effect in the judicial context exist:

*{{Harvtxt | Efran | 1974}} found subjects were more lenient when sentencing attractive individuals than unattractive ones, even though exactly the same crime was committed. The researchers attributed the result to a societal perception that people with a high level of attractiveness are seen as more likely to have successful futures due to corresponding socially desirable traits.
*{{Harvtxt | Monahan | 1941}} studied social workers who were accustomed to interacting with a diverse range of people and found that the majority experienced difficulty when asked to consider that a beautiful person was guilty of a crime.
*A study presented two hypothetical crimes: a [[burglary]] and a [[confidence trick|swindle]]. The burglary involved a woman illegally obtaining a key and stealing $2,200; the swindle involved a woman manipulating a man to invest $2,200 in a nonexistent corporation.  The results showed that when the offense was not related to attractiveness (as in the burglary) the unattractive defendant was punished more severely than the attractive one. However, when the offense was related to attractiveness (the swindle), the attractive defendant was punished more severely than the unattractive one.  The study imputes that the usual leniency given to the attractive woman (as a result of the halo effect) was negated or reversed when the nature of the crime involved her looks.&lt;ref name="ostrove_sigall1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostrove|first1=Nancy|last2=Sigall|first2=Harold|year=1975|title=Beautiful but Dangerous: Effects of Offender Attractiveness and Nature of the Crime on Juridic Judgment|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harold_Sigall/publication/232451231_Beautiful_but_dangerous_Effects_of_offender_attractiveness_and_nature_of_crime_on_juridic_judgment/links/542b0bab0cf29bbc126a7dbc.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=31|issue=3|pages=410–14|doi=10.1037/h0076472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences===
A study by {{harvtxt|Kaplan|1978}} yielded much of the same results as are seen in other studies focusing on the halo effect—attractive individuals were rated more highly in qualities such as creativity, intelligence, and sensitivity than unattractive individuals. However, in addition to these results Kaplan found that some women were influenced by the halo effect on attractiveness only when presented with members of the opposite sex. When presented with an attractive member of the same sex, the effect was attenuated for some women. {{harvtxt|Dermer|Thiel|1975}} continue this line of research, going on to demonstrate that jealousy of an attractive individual has slight effect in evaluation of that person. Their work shows this to be more prevalent among females than males, with some females being less influenced by the halo effect. Later research by Moore, Filippou, &amp; Perrett (2011)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was able to control for attractiveness in composite photographs of females who were perceived to be of high or low intelligence, while showing that the attractiveness halo effect was seen in high intelligent male composite faces by heterosexual residents of the UK. Either the halo effect is negated by feelings of jealousy in women&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; or the halo effect is lessened when women are looking at same sex individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert M.|date=1978-04-01|title=Is beauty talent? Sex interaction in the attractiveness halo effect|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=195–204|doi=10.1007/BF00287500|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the attractiveness halo effect can be controlled for in women&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; it appears that there is a difference in affect produced by the attractiveness halo effect at least between binary genders.

===Possible cause===

{{harvtxt|Kanazawa|Kovarb|2004}} have reasoned that if the following four assumptions were true, beautiful people are indeed likely to be more intelligent and provided empirical evidence for these assumptions.
# More intelligent men are more likely to attain higher status. 
# Higher-status men are more likely to mate with more beautiful women. 
# Intelligence is heritable. 
# Beauty is heritable.

==The reverse halo effect==
The reverse halo effect occurs when positive evaluations of an individual cause negative consequences. Dermer and Thiel (1975) had female undergraduates rate pictures of highly attractive, moderately attractive, and unattractive females and evaluate them on a number of dimensions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dermer|first1=Marshall|last2=Thiel|first2=Darrel|title=When Beauty May Fail|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1975|volume=31|issue=6|pages=1168–1176|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.552.3491&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=21 October 2017|doi=10.1037/h0077085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hypothesis that jealousy would moderate attractiveness ratings was partially supported. Unattractive raters did not rate attractive females as highly, and thought that they would be less competent parents and more likely to cheat. A follow up study with both men and women participants supported this, as well as showing that attractive women were expected to be conceited and have a higher socioeconomic status. Eagly et al. (1991) also commented on this phenomenon, showing that more attractive individuals of all sexes were expected to be higher in vanity and possibly egotistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=Alice H.|last2=Ashmore|first2=R.D.|last3=Makhijani|first3=M.G.|last4=Longo|first4=L.C.|title=What is Beautiful is Good, But...

==The horn effect==
The [[horn effect]] occurs when people allow an undesirable trait to influence their evaluation of other traits.&lt;ref name=nisbett&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nisbett | first1 = Richard E | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Timothy D | year= 1977 |title= The halo effect: Evidence for unconscious alteration of judgments |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume =35 |issue=4 |pages=250–56 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.4.250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote of the devil effect in relation to [[Hugo Chavez]]: "Some leaders can become so demonized that it's impossible to assess their achievements and failures in a balanced way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Glennie|first=Jonathan|title=Hugo Chávez's reverse-halo effect|url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/03/hugo-chavez-reverso-halo-effect |newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When someone is seen in a negative light, anything they do that is negative is exemplified, while the positive things they do are not seen, or are doubted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Education==
{{harvtxt|Abikoff|Courtney | Pelham | Koplewicz |1993}} found the halo effect is also present in the classroom. In this study, both regular and [[special education]] elementary school teachers watched videotapes of what they believed to be children in regular 4th-grade classrooms. In reality, the children were actors, depicting behaviors present in [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), or standard behavior. The teachers were asked to rate the frequency of hyperactive behaviors observed in the children. Teachers rated hyperactive behaviors accurately for children with ADHD; however, the ratings of hyperactivity were much higher for the children with ODD-like behaviors, showing a halo effect for children with ODD.

{{Harvtxt | Foster | Ysseldyke | 1976}} also found the halo effect present in teachers' evaluations of children. Regular and special education elementary school teachers watched videos of a normal child whom they were told was either emotionally disturbed, possessing a learning disorder, mentally retarded, or "normal". The teachers then completed referral forms based on the child's behavior. The results showed that teachers held negative expectancies toward emotionally disturbed children, maintaining these expectancies even when presented with normal behavior. In addition, the mentally retarded label showed a greater degree of negative bias than the emotionally disturbed or learning disabled.

===Observations===

"In the classroom, teachers are subject to the halo effect rating error when evaluating their students. For example, a teacher who sees a well-behaved student might tend to assume this student is also bright, diligent, and engaged before that teacher has objectively evaluated the student's capacity in these areas. When these types of halo effects occur, they can affect students' approval ratings in certain areas of functioning and can even affect students' grades."
(Rasmussen, Encyclopedia of Educational Psychology, Volume 1, 2008)

"In the work setting, the halo effect is most likely to show up in a supervisor's appraisal of a subordinate's [[job performance]]. In fact, the halo effect is probably the most common bias in [[performance appraisal]]. Think about what happens when a supervisor evaluates the performance of a subordinate. The supervisor may give prominence to a single characteristic of the employee, such as enthusiasm, and allow the entire evaluation to be colored by how he or she judges the employee on that one characteristic. Even though the employee may lack the requisite knowledge or ability to perform the job successfully, if the employee's work shows enthusiasm, the supervisor may very well give him or her a higher performance rating than is justified by knowledge or ability."
(Schneider, F.W., Gruman, J. A., &amp; Coutts, L. M., Applied Social Psychology, 2012)

==Branding==
The term halo effect is used in [[marketing]] to explain customer bias toward certain products because of favorable experience with other products made by the same company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/halo-effect.asp|title=Halo Effect|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2008-10-27|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The halo effect is also present in the field of [[brand marketing]]. One common halo effect is when the perceived positive features of a particular item extend to a broader brand. A notable example is the manner in which the popularity of Apple's [[iPod]] generated enthusiasm for the corporation's other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple shares surfs on big profits|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4172211.stm |accessdate=18 January 2012|newspaper= BBC News|date= 13 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A halo effect with regard to health, dubbed a "health halo", is used in [[food marketing]] to increase sales of a product; it can result in increased consumption of the product in the halo which may be unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Provencher|first1=V|last2=Jacob|first2=R|title=Impact of Perceived Healthiness of Food on Food Choices and Intake|journal=Current Obesity Reports|date=March 2016|volume=5|issue=1|pages=65–71|doi=10.1007/s13679-016-0192-0|pmid=26820622|hdl=20.500.11794/13474}} [https://corpus.ulaval.ca/jspui/bitstream/20.500.11794/13474/1/Provencher%20V%20-%20Current%20Obesity%20Reports%202015.pdf Open access preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polivy|first1=J|title=What's that you're eating?

The term "halo effect" has also been applied to [[human rights organization]]s that have used their status to move away from their stated goals. Political scientist [[Gerald Steinberg]] has claimed that [[NGO|non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]] take advantage of the halo effect and are "given the status of impartial moral watchdogs" by governments and the [[news media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Jeffray|first = Nathan |title=Interview: Gerald Steinberg|url = http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/33415/interview-gerald-steinberg |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Balanson| first = Naftali | title= The 'halo effect' shields NGOs from media scrutiny|url= http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=110648 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ronald McDonald House, a widely known NGO, openly celebrates the positive outcomes it receives from the halo effect. The web page for the Ronald McDonald House in Durham, North Carolina, states that 95% of survey participants were aware of Ronald McDonald House Charities. This awareness is attributed to the halo effect, as employees, customers, and stakeholders are more likely to be involved in a charity that they recognize and trust, with a name and logo that are familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronaldhousedurham.org/page/corporate-donors|last = Jones |first= Nancy|title= Corporate Donors| publisher = Ronald House Durham | accessdate= 26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brand's halo effect can protect its reputation in the event of a crisis. An event that is detrimental to a brand that is viewed favorably would not be as threatening or damaging to a brand that consumers view unfavorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Coombs|first1 =Timothy W | last2  = Holladay | first2 =Sherry J|journal=Journal of Communication Management|year=2006|volume=10|issue= 2|pages = 123–37 |doi=10.1108/13632540610664698 |title=Unpacking the halo effect: reputation and crisis management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Klein|first1 =Jill| first2 = Niraj | last2 = Dawar|title= Evaluations in a Product-Harm Crisis| journal= International Journal of Research in Marketing | year= 2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=203–17|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2003.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other use==
===Non-psychology/business use===
Non-psychology/business use of the term "halo effect" can refer to the monetary value of expenditures either in subsequent time periods.&lt;ref&gt;1966,"The Marketing Game" - a textbook and a software package. They referred to the future monetary value of a marketing expenditure that has subsequently been reduced as "Halo effect."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Halo effect on the dead ==
Often, a person's character is perceived in a more positive light after their death. An example of this is what took place after [[Michael Jackson]] died in 2009. Before Jackson's death, he was only a few years removed from accusations of sexual molestation of minors. The public deemed him a "child molester" and "sex offender". However, since his death discussion of sexual misconduct has subsided and public perception mainly focuses on his success and status as the King of Pop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/natural-history-the-modern-mind/200907/the-halo-effect-in-overdrive|title=The Halo Effect in Overdrive|last=Goetz|first=Andrew|date=7/2/2009|website=Psychology Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=this needs more academic sourcing|date=June 2018}}

==Further research findings==
{{harvtxt|Murphy|Jako|Anhalt|1993}} argue: "Since 1980, there have been a large number of studies dealing directly or indirectly with halo error in rating. Taken together, these studies suggest that all seven of the characteristics that have defined halo error for much of its history are problematic and that the assumptions that underlie some of them are demonstrably wrong." Their work claims that the assumption that the halo effect is always detrimental is incorrect, with some halo effects resulting in an increase in the accuracy of the rating, in their opinion. Additionally, they discuss the idea of "true halo"—the actual correlation between, for example, attractiveness and performance as an instructor—and "illusory halo" that refers to cognitive distortions, errors in observation and judgement, and the rating tendencies of the individual rater. They claim that any true differentiation between true and illusory halos is impossible in a real-world setting, because the different ratings are strongly influenced by the specific behaviors of the person observed by the raters.

A study by {{harvtxt|Forgas|2011}} states that one's mood can affect the degree of the halo effect's influence. When someone is in a favorable mood, the halo effect is more likely to be influential—this was demonstrated by study participants choosing between pictures of an elderly man with a beard and a young woman, and deciding which subject possessed more philosophical attributes. Additionally, when asked to list the happy times in their life, the halo effect was more evident in the perceptions of the participants. Forgas's study suggests that when one is gauging the extent of the halo effect in a situation, one must consider the emotional state of the person making the judgment.

'''Hysteria''' colloquially means ungovernable [[emotion]]al excess. Generally, modern medical professionals have abandoned using the term "hysteria" to denote a diagnostic category, replacing it with more precisely defined categories, such as [[somatization disorder]]. In 1980, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] officially changed the diagnosis of "hysterical neurosis, conversion type" to "[[conversion disorder]]".

While the word ''hysteria'' originates from the Greek word for [[uterus]], ''hystera'' (ὑστέρα), the word itself is not an ancient one, and the term "hysterical suffocation"  – meaning a feeling of heat and inability to breathe, was instead used in ancient Greek medicine. This suggests an entirely physical cause for the symptoms but, by linking them to the uterus, suggests that the disorder can only be found in women.&lt;ref name="gilman1993"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilman|first1=Sander L.|last2=King|first2= Helen|last3=Porter|first3=Roy|last4=Rousseau|first4=G.S.|last5=Showalter|first5=Elaine|date=1993|title=Hysteria Beyond Freud|url=|location=Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press|page=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, hysteria was thought to manifest itself in women ([[female hysteria]]) with a variety of symptoms, including: [[anxiety]], shortness of breath, [[fainting]], [[insomnia]], [[irritability]], nervousness, as well as sexually forward behaviour.&lt;ref name="maines"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The technology of Orgasm: ‘Hysteria’, the Vibrator, and Women’s Sexual Satisfaction|last=Maines|first=Rachel|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms mimic symptoms of other more definable diseases and create a case for arguing against the validity of hysteria as an actual disease, and it is often implied that it is an umbrella term for an indefinable illness.&lt;ref name="gilman1993" /&gt; Through to the 20th century, however, the label hysteria was applied to a mental, rather than uterine or physical, affliction. Hysteria is no longer thought of as a real ailment.&lt;ref name="carta"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women and Hysteria In Mental Health|last2=Fadda|first2=Bianca|date=October 19, 2012|journal= Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health|last3=Rappeti|first3=Mariangela|last4=Tasca|first4=Cecilia|last1=Carta|first1=Mauro Giovanni|pmc=3480686|pmid=23115576|doi=10.2174/1745017901208010110|volume=8|pages=110–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage, the term ''hysteria'' connotes mass panic ([[mass hysteria]]). Hysteria was often associated with events such as the [[Salem witch trials]], or [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The term ''hysterical'', applied to an individual, can mean that he or she is emotional or irrationally upset; applied to a situation that does not involve panic, it means that situation is uncontrollably amusing (the connotation being that it invokes hysterical laughter).

The '''International Abolitionist Federation''' ('''IAF'''; {{lang-fr|Fédération abolitioniste internationale}}), founded in Liverpool in 1875, aimed to abolish state regulation of [[prostitution]] and fought the international [[human trafficking|traffic in women]] in prostitution. It was originally called the '''British and Continental Federation for the Abolition of Prostitution'''.{{efn|Sources disagree about the original name. One source says it was the "British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of the Government Regulation of Vice".{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}} Another calls it the "British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution".{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=25}}
Others call it the "British and Continental (later International) Federation for the Abolition of Governmental (later State) Regulation of Vice".{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=32}} }}

The federation was active in Europe, the Americas, and the European colonies and mandated territories. It felt that state regulations encouraged prostitution while having the effect of enslaving women in prostitution.
It felt that the solution lay in [[moral education]], [[empowerment]] of women through the right to acquire skills and work, and marriage.
The federation experienced opposition from the authorities in Europe and the colonies, who were unwilling to relinquish control, and from reformers who wanted to suppress traffic of women but were less concerned with their welfare.
After [[World War I]] (1914–18), the IAF was involved in discussions about [[League of Nations]] conventions on the issues, and after [[World War II]] (1939–45), about [[United Nations]] conventions.
In later years, the main focus was on eliminating unjust regulations that violated [[women's rights]].

Regulation of prostitution in the 19th century typically consisted of policing, brothel licenses, red light districts, registration and forced medical examination of women in prostitution, and forced hospitalization of women in prostitution suffering from sexually transmitted diseases.
Abuses included police corruption, registration of underage girls, forced registration of vulnerable women, debt bondage and other ways in which women in brothels were exploited, as well as regulations and other practices that prevented women from leaving prostitution. In the colonies and mandated territories, the regulations were often related to military conquest and control.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}

[[File:Josephine Butler.jpg|thumb| [[Josephine Butler]], founder of the IAF]]
The English feminist [[Josephine Butler]] (1828–1906), who came from a family involved in the abolition of slavery, believed that forced vaginal examination of women suspected of prostitution violated their basic legal rights. She argued that women lacked sexual autonomy because they were excluded from higher education, professional training, and paid employment and therefore had to choose between marriage or prostitution. Either way, their condition was no different from that of a slave. 
Butler published many articles on the subject.{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=32}}
She toured Europe in 1874 and 1875 to raise support for an international abolitionist movement.
In Italy she was able to talk with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].{{sfn|Picarelli|2008|p=216}}

==Beliefs==

Butler and the pastors and friends who joined her at first campaigned for the "freedom and purity of our English Commonwealth", with which  
they alluded to the liberty of women and to morality and the family. They were against extra-marital sex but also against celibacy, which they felt leads to depravity.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=217}}
The solution was marriage.
In 1882, Butler said, "The best of the restrictions imposed by law is that which encourages and, if necessary, forces citizens of both sexes to practice self-respect."{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=217}}

The abolition campaign rested on two main arguments. The first was "scientific evidence" that state regulation was ineffective and even harmful.
The second was that regulation was unacceptable even it were effective in terms of administration and health because it violated human liberty.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}
The abolitionists supported the civil rights of women in prostitution and denied that the state had the right to organize prostitution.
Abolitionists were against the abuses inherent in state regulations and against restrictions on the basic freedoms of women in prostitution, such as their right to freedom of movement and to voluntary medical examination.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
Butler asserted that regulation deprived women of the rights bestowed by the [[Magna Carta]] and the writ of [[habeas corpus]].{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}

The abolitionists pointed out the double standard of contemporary sexual morality due to which women's bodies were policed and controlled but their male customers were not regulated.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
They pointed out that this resulted in a double injustice "because it is unjust to punish the sex who are the victims of a vice, and leave unpunished the sex who are the main cause both of its vice and its dreaded consequences". Men both caused prostitution and enforced the system that shamed and punished the women who were its victims.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=37}}
The IAF said, "The social rehabilitation of prostitutes cannot solve the problem of prostitution unless other factors influence the causes of prostitution ... Too often prostitutes are subjected to a disguised form of imprisonment, on the pretext of rehabilitation, in spite of laws which do not state prostitution to be an offence."{{sfn|Roth|2011|p=51}}
The IAF felt that treating prostitution as a legal or tolerated institution was "a hygienic mistake, a social injustice, a moral outrage, and a judicial crime".{{sfn|Gorman|2012|p=53}}

The abolitionists also thought the trafficking of women would be reduced by the abolition of state-regulated prostitution.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=8}}
They were uneasy about cooperating on measures against the white slave traffic with governments that regulated prostitution because they saw the governments as hypocritical in maintaining a system that created demand for the trafficked women.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=64}}

In the late 19th century, most IAF activists did not have the right to vote because [[women's suffrage]] only existed in very few countries.
They faced disapproval of open discussion of sexual matters by women. Their efforts to organize were sometimes countered by police repression.
The movement struggled to maintain coherence despite the different priorities and beliefs of its members and despite the continued expansion of the colonial and imperial system.
The IAF tried to be independent of any particular political, philosophical, religious, or ethnic ties but was in practice dominated by Europeans.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
The federation often looked to socialists for support, stressing the economic causes of prostitution among women unable to find other employment.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=64}}

==International meetings==
[[File:James Stansfeld, Vanity Fair, 1869-04-10.jpg|thumb|[[James Stansfeld]], general secretary of the federation]]
Various groups in different countries agitated against sexual slavery in the 1870s.
They formed an international federation thanks to the activity of Josephine Butler and a few other feminist leaders.{{sfn|Picarelli|2008|p=148}}
The first meeting of the British branch was held in Liverpool in March 1875 and was attended by Italian representatives.{{sfn|Picarelli|2008|p=216}}
The movement soon spread to other European countries, to European colonies or client states (India, Egypt, and the Dutch East Indies), and to the Americas.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
A pan-European international congress with six or seven hundred attendees was held in Geneva from 17 to 22 September 1877.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}
The British, Continental, and General Federation for the Abolition of the Government Regulation of Vice was established at this meeting.{{sfn|Picarelli|2008|p=148}}

The supporters of the federation included a range of women including doctors, religious reformers, and feminists who were also active in organizations such as the [[International Council of Women]] and the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]]. The federation was also supported by liberal or socialist men.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
It was one of the first unofficial international societies for social and legal reform.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=35}}
The resolutions stressed the importance of self-control, denied that debauchery was inevitable, decried impurity in both men and women, and called for the police to ensure that decency be respected in the street. They also said that "[c]ompulsory registration is an affront to liberty and to common law". There was thus tension between the disapproval of extramarital relations and the demand for women's liberty.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}
The International Union of Friends of Young Women was founded at this congress. This was a Protestant association that gave assistance to emigrating girls and women in an effort to prevent their sexual exploitation.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=44}}

The federation helped the national abolitionist organizations to communicate and make connections, but activity at the international level was difficult due to the profound differences between the different countries. These included "[t]he differences of language, of national and social traditions, of the state of public opinion and of the laws—and above all, the differences in the status of women".{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=35}}
At the international level, the focus had to be strictly on the repeal of state laws and regulations regarding prostitution.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}

The first annual conference of the federation was held in Paris from 24 to 25 September 1878 in a mood of optimism.
[[James Stansfeld]] (1820–1898), the general secretary, had been received by [[Émile Deshayes de Marcère]], the French minister of the interior.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}
The second congress of the federation, held in Genoa from 27 September to 4 October 1880, was attended by [[Yves Guyot]] and Emilie and Auguste de Morsier. The resolutions of this congress show that the liberal position had triumphed. 
There was no mention of repression of illicit sexuality, only demands for guarantees of individual liberty, the rule of law, and the abolition of the regulation of prostitution.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=219}}
The British, Continental, and General Federation for the Abolition of Regulated Prostitution held its fifth conference in Geneva in 1889, where it solemnly denounced the international white slave trade.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=278}}{{efn|The term "white slave trade" was generally used before [[World War I]] and implied a primary concern with European women in prostitution.
The more general term "traffic in women" only came into widespread use in the inter-war period.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}} }}
The federation moved its headquarters to Geneva in 1898.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
It became the International Abolitionist Federation in 1902.{{sfn|Fauré|2004|p=490}}

==Local abolitionist movements==

===Britain===
[[File:Alison Neilans (1884-1942).jpg|thumb|[[Alison Neilans]] was the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene (AMSH) general secretary in the 1920s.]]
In the 1870s Butler helped organize the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. 
The [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] had extended British regulations of women in prostitution in military areas to cover the whole country.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=44}}
The British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution: British Branch was formed in Liverpool on 19 March 1875.{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=25}}
The reformers used the name "abolition" as a reference to the earlier movement to abolish slavery, since they considered that state-regulated prostitution was a form of slavery of women.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
The British branch was based in Liverpool and had an office in Westminster, London.{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=26}}
[[James Stansfeld]] was president, Josephine Butler secretary and Henry Wilson corresponding secretary. 
Later William Crosfield was made treasurer and James Stuart replaced Wilson.{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=25}}

The British association saw prostitution as part of the larger issue of social morality and the position of women.
Butler was also active in the suffrage movement.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}
The concept that regulation was acceptable in the colonies but not in Europe was completely rejected since the arguments against regulation were considered to be based on universal principles. British reformers also worked in Australia, Ceylon, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, India, Malta, Singapore and South Africa.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}
In 1886 the British Contagious Diseases Act was repealed, a victory for the abolitionists.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=35}}
This was followed by a large meeting to which delegates came from Europe and America to "consolidate the attack on regulation throughout the world".{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=35}}

After the Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed the branch concentrated on eliminating regulation of prostitution in the British Empire, and in India in particular. In 1890 it changed its name to the British Committee for the Abolition of the State Regulation of Vice in India and throughout the British Dominions.
In 1897 the branch re-launched the ''Shield'', a periodical that had supported repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act, after this act was re-enacted in India. In 1915 the branch merged with the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts to form the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene (AMSH).{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=26}}
The international abolitionist [[Alison Neilans]] (1884–1942)  was the AMSH general secretary in the 1920s.{{sfn|Gorman|2012|p=53}}
The AMSH was a member of the IAF.{{sfn|Gorman|2012|p=71}}

===Netherlands===

Protestant reformers in the Dutch Réveil movement were concerned about the spread of municipal regulation between 1852 and 1877. They published translations of Butler's writings, and ran asylums for women in prostitution. Their main leader was the Reverend [[Hendrik Pierson]]. He met Butler at the 1877 congress in Geneva and was persuaded to join the IAF despite his misgivings about the secular nature of the organization and the influence of socialist feminists.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=96}}
In 1889 the Dutch Women's Union, which considered itself an offshoot of the IAF, had 3,000 members working for abolition of regulation and trying to prevent prostitution by assisting young women who were traveling. By the end of the 19th century the Dutch Women's Union had 5,000 members.
The feminist and physician [[Aletta Jacobs]] signed up to the cause of abolition.
Later she was one of the founders of the [[International Women's Suffrage Alliance]], 
Pierson became president of the IAF in 1898.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=98}}

===France===
[[File:Deraismes.jpg|thumb|[[Maria Deraismes]] (1828–1894) was an early Abolitionist leader in France]]
On 15 November 1876 Albert Caise, a founder of the ''Journal des femmes'', launched a petitition that called for brothels to be closed, the vice squad abolished, laws passed against provocation on public streets, more dispensaries and the return of women in prostitution to the rule of common law. The petition also called for free, compulsory education and new regulation of women's work.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=231}}
Butler saw Paris as "the great Babylon."{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=217}}
In January 1877 Butler traveled to Paris with the main IAF representatives to launch a campaign against the actions of the vice squad, and spoke at various meetings. In her view the French Contagious Diseases Act, and the resulting "French system," caused enslavement of women and encouraged male immorality. She was against the "fetishism of socialist State worship" as well as "medical domination and legislative tyranny."{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=216}}

In an ordinance of 16 June 1879 the police authorized establishment of a French section of the British and Continental Federation, called the ''Association pour l'abolition de la prostitution réglementée'', with [[Victor Schœlcher]] (1804–1893) as president. The association included feminists, radicals and abolitionists.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}
The most active organizers of the French Association for the Abolition of Official Prostitution were the feminist leaders [[Maria Deraismes]], [[Emilie de Morsier]] and [[Caroline de Barrau]].{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=231}}
Josephine Butler visited Paris in April 1880. A meeting on 10 April 1880 was attended by about 2,000 people, mostly of the lower classes, including leaders of the extreme left in Paris. 
The speeches reflected the growing influence of the feminist movement.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}

By the end of 1896 the abolitionist movement on France was moribund. Some of the members left the British and Continental Federation and formed a new ''Ligue française pour le relèvement de la moralité publique''. The new league called for abolition of the vice squad and the regulations that dishonored the police, compromised the magistrates and established inequality between men and women. The league was also concerned with fighting alcoholism, the white slave trade, immoral literature and license on the streets.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=312}}

In 1897 Butler visited France, and a group led by Auguste de Morsier initiated re-foundation of a French branch of the IAF. 
The new organization was represented officially at the international abolitionist conference in London in 1898.
Between 1898 and 1907 the abolitionist movement in France revived, led first by Auguste de Morsier and then by [[Ghénia Avril de Sainte-Croix]] (1855–1939).{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=312}}{{efn|Ghénia Avril de Sainte-Croix, a secular feminist and journalist, remained active in the movement until the mid-1930s.
She had met Butler at the 1898 IAF congress in London. She became secretary-general of the French branch of the IAF in 1900.
She later became chairperson of the committee on trafficking of the [[International Council of Women]].{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=116}} }}
In this period the IAF gained fresh support from periodicals. The ''Revue de morale sociale'' was dedicated to abolition.
A major conference was held in Lyons in 1901 at the height of the campaign.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=312}}

===Germany===
The first effective chapter of the IAF in Germany was organized in 1880 in Berlin, led by [[Gertrude Guillaume-Schack]].
Liberal Protestant activists in Germany were in close contact with the IAF, and [[Ludwig Weber (pastor)|Ludwig Weber]] (1846–1922) was on the IAF executive commission until 1887. However, the conservative Protestants had difficulty with the dominant liberal view that an individual had the right to do whatever they wanted with their body as long as they did not harm or affect the rights of others.
The liberals thought the state should defend the rights of citizens but should not impose any particular religious or moral values, while the conservatives thought "the state is the guardian of God's commandments." Conservatives were also unable to accept the outspoken role that women played in the IAF, feeling it was for men to take the initiative.{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=16}}

[[File:Anna Pappritz in 1904.jpg|thumb| [[Anna Pappritz]] of Germany in 1904]]
In 1898 local associations of the IAF were formed by German women in several cities to fight against brothels and police control over women in prostitution.{{sfn|Janz|Schonpflug|2014|p=203}}
In 1899 [[Anna Pappritz]] (1861–1939) of Berlin met Butler at the International Women's Congress in London.{{sfn|Pappritz|1984|p=58}}
That year she founded and became chairperson of the Berlin branch of the IAF.{{sfn|Reinert|2001|pp=55ff}}
Anna Pappritz and [[Katharina Scheven]] became the two most influential leaders of the German branch of the IAF (DZIAF).{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=88}}
From 1902 to 1914 Pappritz and Scheven edited the DZIAF magazine ''Der Abolitionist''.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=78}}

The pre-war campaign of the DZIAF was largely ineffective. 
Attempts to revise the laws related to prostitution were abandoned with the outbreak of [[World War I]] (1914–18).{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=125}}
Eventually the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33) passed the 1927 Law to Combat Venereal Disease, which abolished state regulation of prostitution.
The Berlin chapter of the IAF, later called the League for Protection of Women and Youth (''Bund für Frauen- und Jugendschutz''), was dissolved in 1933.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=78}}

===Colonies and mandated territories===

By the mid 1920s Australia had in practice been regulating prostitution in Queensland and Western Australia for decades, and was under growing international pressure to abolish these regulations. 
The IAF significantly affected Australian policy and policing, although the country would resist signing the United Nations abolitionist conventions until the 1970s.{{sfn|Boris|Janssens|1999|p=116}}
The question of trafficking was raised in Australia in 1927, with foreigners blamed. 
The Attorney General's Department recommended deporting any foreign women in prostitution.{{sfn|Boris|Janssens|1999|p=115}}
However, although the IAF would not object to measures against men involved in trafficking, their position on excluding or repatriating foreign women in prostitution was less clear cut.{{sfn|Boris|Janssens|1999|p=116}}
Repressive measures meant "The prostitute was being considered as a special class which could be driven from place to place." 
The effect of forced repatriation was to cause considerable economic loss to the women, who arguably would have to work longer in prostitution as a result.{{sfn|Boris|Janssens|1999|p=117}}

In some areas under the control of the European powers there were high levels of foreign women among the women in prostitution, but after [[World War I]] the number of European women declined in areas such as Indochina and the Levant. When the IAF secretary visited Beirut in 1931 she reported that 14% of registered women in prostitution were foreign.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=31}}
The British branch of the IAF showed the clear connection between regulation and trafficking when it quoted the governor of Somaliland saying in 1936, "It will be necessary to regulate in all centers of the Italian African colonies a sufficiently large and often renewed supply of white women of another quality than honest women. They must be white women but not Italian—Italian women of that class should never be allowed to pass the frontiers of our Empire: it is an elementary question of prestige in relation to the natives."{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=34}}

==After World War II==

After [[World War II]] (1939–45) anti-slavery organizations such as the IAF continued to document the traffic in women and girls for the purpose of prostitution or marriage, but operated at the "bottom of the UN human rights hierarchy".{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=93}}
In December 1947 representatives of the IAF were among those who provided input into drafting the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].{{sfn|Morsink|2011|p=9}}
The United Nations' 1949 [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] was only ratified by a few states since most would have had to first change their laws related to prostitution.{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=93}}

In 1954, the British put forward a draft convention on slavery for the United Nations, which formed the basis for the 1956 [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]], the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery.{{sfn|Allain|2008|p=249}}
The IAF was involved in discussions of the wording, as were other NGOs such as the Women's International Organization and the [[Anti-Slavery Society]]. The IAF was generally opposed to efforts that might weaken the language, which called for abolition of slavery as soon as possible.{{sfn|Allain|2008|pp=251ff}}
In 1974, the UN Commission of Human Rights set up the Working Group on Slavery, in which the IAF participated.{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=94}}
The working group discussed female genital mutilation, which the IAF argued fitted the definition of slavery since the women affected had lost control of their bodies.
Since the main support for the practice came from the mothers of the women, who were certainly not slaves, the working group eventually dropped the issue.{{sfn|Miers|2003|p=416}}
In 1985, the IAF provided information to the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.{{sfn|Ramcharan|1989|p=195}}

The federation held its 29th international congress in September 1987 in Vienna, Austria.{{sfn|Barry|1996|p=358}}
In France it was associated with organizations that gave shelter and retraining to women in prostitution so they could enter a new occupation.{{sfn|Barry|1996|p=289}}
The IAF was involved in the formulation of the United Nations 2000 protocol on trafficking in persons, joining with organizations such as the US-based Coalition Against Trafficking in Persons and the [[European Women's Lobby]]. A compromise had to be made with anti-abolitionist NGOs and supporters of sex workers' rights, and the agreed formula therefore restricted the definition to cases involving coercion or deception. 
It was extended to cover trafficking for other purposes, marking a shift from women's sexuality and morality to a focus on crime and working conditions.{{sfn|Territo|Kirkham|2010|p=351}}

==Opposing views==
[[File:Lady Henry Somerset.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Henry Somerset]] of the WCTU favored regulation in India]]
Authorities in the European countries and their colonial territories often saw abolition of regulations as a threat to their authority.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
Male-led "purity reformers" also saw no need to protect the rights of women in prostitution.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
In 1899 the purity reformers founded the International Bureau for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic (later Traffic in Women and Children, then Traffic in Persons).
These later changes in name reflected shifts in focus to include non-white women and boys being trafficked for prostitution.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=6}}
The International Bureau felt the state should have control over the sexual activities of which they disapproved, but avoided the question of regulation. Each national committee of the Bureau wanted to protect the women of their own country from export to foreign brothels, and to criminalize women imported from other countries.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=8}}
The state authorities preferred to work with the International Bureau, which did not challenge their authority to prosecute unregistered women in prostitution and brothels, to import voluntary prostitutes and to deport foreign women in prostitution.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=9}}

The movement also had to address women who thought regulations should be reformed rather than abolished. 
These women, often from the upper classes, thought greater control of prostitution would reduce the health risks from sexually transmitted diseases, both for the men buying sex and for their wives, and reduced the risk of women being attacked by men unable to find an outlet for their sexual urges.
Thus [[Lady Henry Somerset]], first vice-president of the [[World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], advocated reforming regulations in India rather than abolishing them. 
IAF activists in all countries were consistently opposed to such a position.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
Supporters of regulation were able to show statements from women in prostitution that they felt safer in brothels than on the streets, health checks let them gain business by showing clients they had a clean bill of health, and government regulation removed the stigma of their occupation. Abolitionists said these were exceptional cases. Interviews by IAF and Women's Christian Temperance Union reformers in India in the late 19th century showed that women in prostitution serving the troops detested the compulsory medical checks.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=27}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2628">'''Judicial deference''' is the condition of a court yielding or submitting its judgment to that of another legitimate party, such as the [[executive branch]] in the case of [[National security|national defense]]. It is most commonly found in countries, such as the United Kingdom, which lack an [[constitution#Entrenchment|entrenched constitution]], as the essential purpose of such documents is to limit the power of the [[legislature]].

== United Kingdom ==
In ''Regina v. Director of Public Prosecutions Ex Parte Kebeline and Others'' [1999], [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]] explained that courts should "defer, on democratic grounds, to the considered opinion of the elected body as to where the balance is to be struck between the rights of the individual and the needs of society". Nevertheless, the doctrine has been criticised for representing a way in which the courts should act obediently to the [[British Parliament]] to uphold the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]].

However, any suggestions that the [[House of Lords]] was being unduly servile to Parliament were overturned by ''A v Home Secretary'' [2005]. In the case, detainees imprisoned without charge under section 23 of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]], on the grounds that they posed a threat to national security, appealed successfully against their detention. The court held that the powers of detention without charge had discriminatory impact (Articles 5 and 14 of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]).

== United States ==
There are some examples of judicial deference in the United States, despite its entrenched constitution. For example, in [[immigration law]], the [[judiciary]] has historically sought to allow the explicit constitutional authority of the [[US Congress]]. An example is [[US Supreme Court]] decision ''Fiallo v. Bell'' (1977).

The same restraint is requested in [[foreign affairs]] as [[justiciability|not-judicable]] matters,&lt;ref&gt;Kirk A. Randazzo, ''Defenders of Liberty or Champions of Security? Federal Courts, the Hierarchy of Justice, and U.S. Foreign Policy'', 1438430477, 9781438430478, SUNY Press 	2010.&lt;/ref&gt; to safeguard the executive branch.

'''''Kanji''''' ({{lang|ja|漢字}}; [[Help:IPA/Japanese|[kã̠ɴʑi]]] {{Audio|ja-kanji.ogg|listen|help=no}}) are the adopted [[logographic]] [[Chinese characters]] that are used in the [[Japanese writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Insup|last2=Taylor|first2=Maurice Martin|title=Writing and literacy in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese|year=1995|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company| location=Amsterdam| isbn=90-272-1794-7| page=305| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDw4gBaPjZgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are used alongside the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] syllabic scripts ''[[hiragana]]'' and ''[[katakana]]''.

==History==
[[File:Nihonshoki tanaka version.jpg|thumb|''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720 AD), considered by historians and archaeologists as the most complete extant historical record of ancient Japan, was written entirely in kanji.]]
[[Chinese character]]s first came to [[Japan]] on official seals, letters, swords, coins, mirrors, and other decorative items imported from [[China]]. The earliest known instance of such an import was the [[King of Na gold seal]] given by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] to a [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] emissary in 57 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Gold Seal (Kin-in)| url =http://museum.city.fukuoka.jp/en/exhibition.html | publisher=Fukuoka City Museum |accessdate =September 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese coins from the first century AD have been found in [[Yayoi-period]] archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="miyake8"&gt;Miyake (2003), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Japanese of that era probably had no comprehension of the script, and would remain illiterate until the fifth century AD.&lt;ref name="miyake8" /&gt; According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and ''[[Kojiki]]'', a semi-legendary scholar called [[Wani (scholar)|Wani]] ({{nihongo|王仁}}) was dispatched to Japan by the [[Baekje|Kingdom of Baekje]] during the reign of [[Emperor Ōjin]] in the early fifth century, bringing with him knowledge of [[Confucianism]] and Chinese characters.&lt;ref name="miyake9"&gt;Miyake (2003), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Japanese documents were probably written by bilingual Chinese or Korean officials employed at the [[Yamato period|Yamato]] court.&lt;ref name="miyake8" /&gt; For example, the diplomatic correspondence from [[Five kings of Wa|King Bu of Wa]] to [[Emperor Shun of Liu Song]] in 478 has been praised for its skillful use of [[allusion]]. Later, groups of people called ''fuhito'' were organized under the monarch to read and write [[Classical Chinese]]. During the reign of [[Empress Suiko]] (593–628), the Yamato court began sending full-scale diplomatic missions to China, which resulted in a large increase in Chinese literacy at the Japanese court.&lt;ref name="miyake9" /&gt;

In ancient times paper was so rare that people stenciled kanji onto thin, rectangular strips of wood. These wooden boards were used for communication between government offices, tags for goods transported between various countries, and the practice of writing. The oldest written kanji in Japan discovered so far was written in ink on wood as a wooden strip dated to the 7th century. It is a record of trading for cloth and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =Kanji History in Japan| url = https://ateliers-japon.com/#home | publisher=Les Ateliers de Japon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese language had no written form at the time Chinese characters were introduced, and texts were written and read only in Chinese. Later, during the [[Heian period]] (794–1185), however, a system known as ''[[kanbun]]'' emerged, which involved using Chinese text with [[diacritical mark]]s to allow Japanese speakers to restructure and read Chinese sentences, by changing word order and adding particles and verb endings, in accordance with the rules of [[Japanese grammar]].

Chinese characters also came to be used to write Japanese words, resulting in the modern kana syllabaries. Around 650 AD, a writing system called ''[[man'yōgana]]'' (used in the ancient poetry anthology ''[[Man'yōshū]]'') evolved that used a number of Chinese characters for their sound, rather than for their meaning. Man'yōgana written in [[Grass script|cursive style]] evolved into ''[[hiragana]]'', or ''[[hiragana|onna-de]]'', that is, "ladies' hand,"&lt;ref&gt;Hadamitzky, Wolfgang and Spahn, Mark (2012), ''Kanji and Kana:  A Complete Guide to the Japanese Writing System'',  Third Edition, Rutland, VT:  Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|4805311169}}. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; a writing system that was accessible to women (who were denied [[higher education]]). Major works of [[Heian-era]] [[literature]] by women were written in hiragana. ''[[Katakana]]'' emerged via a parallel path: [[monastery]] students simplified ''man'yōgana'' to a single constituent element. Thus the two other writing systems, hiragana and katakana, referred to collectively as ''[[kana]]'', are descended from kanji.

In modern Japanese, kanji are used to write parts of the language (usually [[content word]]s) such as [[noun]]s, [[adjective]] [[word stem|stems]], and [[verb]] [[word stem|stems]], while hiragana are used to write [[inflection|inflected]] verb and adjective endings and as [[phonetic complement]]s to disambiguate readings (''[[okurigana]]''), [[grammatical particle|particles]], and miscellaneous words which have no kanji or whose kanji is considered obscure or too difficult to read or remember. [[Katakana]] are mostly used for representing [[onomatopoeia]], [[gairaigo|non-Japanese loanwords]] (except those borrowed from [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese]]), the names of plants and animals (with exceptions), and for emphasis on certain words.

==Orthographic reform and lists of kanji==
{{Main|Japanese script reform}}
[[File:Yōshū Chikanobu Shin Bijin No. 20.jpg|thumb|left|A young woman practicing kanji. [[Ukiyo-e]] woodblock print by [[Toyohara Chikanobu|Yōshū Chikanobu]], 1897]]
In 1946, following [[World War II]] and under the [[Occupation of Japan|Allied Occupation of Japan]], the Japanese government, guided by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] instituted a series of [[orthography|orthographic]] reforms. This was done with the goal of facilitating learning for children and simplifying kanji use in literature and periodicals.
The number of characters in circulation was reduced, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established.
Some characters were given simplified [[glyph]]s, called {{nihongo||新字体|[[shinjitai]]}}. Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged.

These are simply guidelines, so many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used; these are known as {{Nihongo||表外字|[[hyōgaiji]]}}.

===Kyōiku kanji===
{{Main|Kyōiku kanji}}
The {{Nihongo||教育漢字|kyōiku kanji|{{abbr|lit.|literally}} "education kanji"}} are 1,006 characters that Japanese children learn in elementary school. Originally the list only contained 881 characters. This was expanded to 996 characters in 1977. It was not until 1982 the list was expanded to its current size. The grade-level breakdown of these kanji is known as the {{Nihongo||学年別漢字配当表|gakunen-betsu kanji haitōhyō}}, or the ''gakushū kanji''.  ([[:ja:学年別漢字配当表]])

===Jōyō kanji===
{{Main|Jōyō kanji}}
The {{Nihongo||常用漢字|jōyō kanji|regular-use kanji}} are 2,136 characters consisting of all the ''Kyōiku kanji'', plus 1,130 additional kanji taught in junior high and high school.&lt;ref&gt;Tamaoka, K., Makioka, S., Sanders, S. &amp; Verdonschot, R.G. (2017). www.kanjidatabase.com: a new interactive online database for psychological and linguistic research on Japanese kanji and their compound words. Psychological Research, 81, 696-708.&lt;/ref&gt; In publishing, characters outside this category are often given ''[[furigana]]''. The ''jōyō kanji'' were introduced in 1981, replacing an older list of 1,850 characters known as the {{Nihongo||当用漢字|[[tōyō kanji]]|general-use kanji}}, introduced in 1946. Originally numbering 1,945 characters, the ''jōyō kanji'' list was extended to 2,136 in 2010. Some of the new characters were previously ''Jinmeiyō kanji''; some are used to write prefecture names: {{Nihongo2|阪}}, {{Nihongo2|熊}}, {{Nihongo2|奈}}, {{Nihongo2|岡}}, {{Nihongo2|鹿}}, {{Nihongo2|梨}}, {{Nihongo2|阜}}, {{Nihongo2|埼}}, {{Nihongo2|茨}}, {{Nihongo2|栃}} and {{Nihongo2|媛}}.

===Jinmeiyō kanji===
{{Main|Jinmeiyō kanji}}
Since September 27, 2004, the {{Nihongo||人名用漢字|jinmeiyō kanji|kanji for use in personal names}} consist of 3,119 characters, containing the ''jōyō kanji'' plus an additional 983 kanji found in people's names. There were only 92 kanji in the original list published in 1952, but new additions have been made frequently. Sometimes the term ''jinmeiyō kanji'' refers to all 3,119, and sometimes it only refers to the 983 that are only used for names.

===Hyōgai kanji===
{{Main|Hyōgai kanji}}
{{Nihongo||表外漢字|Hyōgai kanji|"unlisted characters"}} are any kanji not contained in the ''jōyō kanji'' and ''jinmeiyō kanji'' lists. These are generally written using traditional characters, but [[extended shinjitai]] forms exist.

===Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji===
The [[Japanese Industrial Standards]] for kanji and kana define character code-points for each kanji and kana, as well as other forms of writing such as the [[Latin alphabet]], [[Cyrillic script]], [[Greek alphabet]], [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]], etc. for use in information processing. They have had numerous revisions. The current standards are:
*[[JIS X 0208]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanji90#kanji90 JIS X 0208:1997].&lt;/ref&gt; the most recent version of the main standard. It has 6,355 kanji.
*[[JIS X 0212]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanjisup#kanjisup JIS X 0212:1990].&lt;/ref&gt; a supplementary standard containing a further 5,801 kanji. This standard is rarely used, mainly because the common [[Shift JIS]] encoding system could not use it. This standard is effectively obsolete;
*[[JIS X 0213]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanji00#kanji00 JIS X 0213:2000].&lt;/ref&gt; a further revision which extended the JIS X 0208 set with 3,695 additional kanji, of which 2,743 (all but 952) were in JIS X 0212. The standard is in part designed to be compatible with Shift JIS encoding;
*JIS X 0221:1995, the Japanese version of the ISO 10646/[[Unicode]] standard.

====Gaiji====
{{Nihongo||外字|Gaiji|literally "external characters"}} are kanji that are not represented in existing Japanese [[Character encoding|encoding systems]]. These include variant forms of common kanji that need to be represented alongside the more conventional [[glyph]] in reference works, and can include non-kanji symbols as well.

''Gaiji'' can be either user-defined characters or system-specific characters. Both are a problem for information interchange, as the [[code point]] used to represent an external character will not be consistent from one computer or operating system to another.

''Gaiji'' were nominally prohibited in JIS X 0208-1997, and JIS X 0213-2000 used the range of code-points previously allocated to ''gaiji'', making them completely unusable. Nevertheless, they persist today with [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s "[[i-mode]]" service, where they are used for [[emoji]] (pictorial characters).

[[Unicode]] allows for optional encoding of ''gaiji'' in [[Private Use (Unicode)|private use areas]], while [[OpenType#SING gaiji solution|Adobe's SING]] (Smart INdependent Glyphlets)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Adobe | url = https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=2437 | title = Introducing the SING Gaiji architecture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Adobe | url = https://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/ | title = OpenType Technology Center}}.&lt;/ref&gt; technology allows the creation of customized gaiji.

The [[Text Encoding Initiative]] uses a '''&lt;g&gt;''' element to encode any non-standard character or glyph, including gaiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = TEI-C | url = http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/WD.html | chapter = Representation of Non-standard Characters and Glyphs | title = P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (The '''g''' stands for "gaiji")&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = TEI-C | url = http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html | chapter = TEI element g (character or glyph) | title = P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Total number of kanji==
There is no definitive count of kanji characters, just as there is none of Chinese characters generally. The ''[[Dai Kan-Wa Jiten]]'', which is considered to be comprehensive in Japan,  contains about 50,000 characters. The ''[[Zhonghua Zihai]]'', published in 1994 in China contains about 85,000 characters;&lt;ref name=taipei&gt;Kuang-Hui Chiu, Chi-Ching Hsu (2006). [http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/ads/doc/95/paper%20hsu95.doc Chinese Dilemmas : How Many Ideographs are Needed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717015011/http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/ads/doc/95/paper%20hsu95.doc |date=July 17, 2011 }}, National Taipei University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shouhui Zhao, Dongbo Zhang, [http://www.colips.org/journals/volume17/JCLC_2007_V17_N2_04.pdf The Totality of Chinese Characters—A Digital Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel G. Peebles, [http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/TR2007-592.pdf SCML: A Structural Representation for Chinese Characters], May 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; however, the majority of these are not in common use in any country, and many are obscure variants or archaic forms.

Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 characters are commonly used in Japan, a few thousand more find occasional use, and a total of 13,108 characters can be encoded in various [[#Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji|Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji]].

Because of the way they have been adopted into Japanese, a single kanji may be used to write one or more different words—or, in some cases, [[morphemes]]—and thus the same character may be pronounced in different ways. From the point of view of the reader, kanji are said to have one or more different "readings". Although more than one reading may become activated in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2013.773050|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236062398_The_multiple_pronunciations_of_Japanese_kanji_A_masked_priming_investigation| pmid = 23510000| title = The multiple pronunciations of Japanese kanji: A masked priming investigation| journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology| volume = 66| issue = 10| pages = 2023| year = 2013| last1 = Verdonschot | first1 = R.

O. }}&lt;/ref&gt; deciding which reading is appropriate depends on recognizing which word it represents, which can usually be determined from context, intended meaning, whether the character occurs as part of a compound word or an independent word, and sometimes location within the sentence. For example, {{lang|ja|今日}} is usually read ''kyō'', meaning "today", but in formal writing is instead read ''konnichi'', meaning "nowadays"; this is understood from context. Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous and require a ''[[furigana]]'' gloss, which are also used simply for difficult readings or to specify a non-standard reading.

Kanji readings are categorized as either ''on'yomi'' (literally "sound reading", from Chinese) or ''kun'yomi'' (literally "meaning reading", native Japanese), and most characters have at least two readings, at least one of each. However, some characters have only a single reading, such as {{Nihongo||菊|kiku|"chrysanthemum", an ''on''-reading}} or {{Nihongo||鰯|iwashi|"sardine", a ''kun''-reading}}; ''kun''-only are common for Japanese-coined kanji (''kokuji''). Some common kanji have ten or more possible readings; the most complex common example is {{Nihongo2|生}}, which is read as ''sei, shō, nama, ki, o-u, i-kiru, i-kasu, i-keru, u-mu, u-mareru, ha-eru'', and ''ha-yasu'', totaling 8 basic readings (first 2 are ''on'', rest are ''kun''), or 12 if related verbs are counted as distinct; see [[Okurigana#生|okurigana: 生]] for details.

Most often, a character will be used for both sound and meaning, and it is simply a matter of choosing the correct reading based on which word it represents. In other cases, a character is used only for sound (''[[ateji]]''). In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of ''ateji'', narrowly ''jukujikun''). Therefore, only the full compound—not the individual character—has a reading. There are also [[#Special readings|special cases]] where the reading is completely different, often based on an historical or traditional reading.

The analogous phenomenon occurs to a much lesser degree in [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], where there are [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]]—borrowed readings and native readings. In Chinese these borrowed readings and native readings are etymologically related, since they are between Chinese varieties (which are related), not from Chinese to Japanese (which are not related). They thus form [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] and are generally similar, analogous to different on'yomi, reflecting different stages of Chinese borrowings into Japanese.

===''On'yomi'' (Sino-Japanese reading) {{anchor|on'yomi|on-yomi|onyomi|on'yomi (Chinese reading)}} &lt;!-- for redirects and direct links to older section names --&gt; ===
The {{Nihongo||音読み|'''on'yomi'''|literally "sound(-based) reading"}}, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] reading, is the modern descendant of the Japanese approximation of the base Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was introduced. It was often previously referred to as '''translation reading''', as it was recreated readings of the Chinese pronunciation but was not the Chinese pronunciation or reading itself, similar to the English pronunciation of Latin loanwords. Old Japanese scripts often stated that ''on'yomi'' readings were also created by the Japanese during their arrival and re-borrowed by the Chinese as their own. There also exist kanji created by the Japanese and given an ''on'yomi'' reading despite not being a Chinese-derived or a Chinese-originating character. Some kanji were introduced from different parts of China at different times, and so have multiple ''on'yomi'', and often multiple meanings. ''Kanji'' invented in Japan would not normally be expected to have ''on'yomi'', but there are exceptions, such as the character {{Nihongo2|働}} "to work", which has the ''kun'yomi'' "''hataraku''" and the ''on'yomi'' "''dō''", and {{Nihongo2|腺}} "gland", which has only the ''on'yomi'' "''sen''"—in both cases these come from the ''on'yomi'' of the phonetic component, respectively {{Nihongo2|動}} "''dō''" and {{Nihongo2|泉}} "''sen''".

Generally, ''on'yomi'' are classified into four types according to their region and time of origin:
*{{Nihongo||呉音|'''[[Go-on]]'''|"Wu sound"}} readings are from the pronunciation during the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] of China during the 5th and 6th centuries. ''Go'' refers to the [[Wu (region)|Wu]] region (in the vicinity of modern [[Shanghai]]), which still maintains linguistic similarities with modern Sino-Japanese vocabulary.
*{{Nihongo||漢音|'''[[Kan-on]]'''|"Han sound"}} readings are from the pronunciation during the [[Tang dynasty]] of China in the 7th to 9th centuries, primarily from the standard speech of the capital, [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]). Here, ''Kan'' refers to [[Han Chinese]] or [[China proper]].
*{{Nihongo||唐音|'''[[Tō-on]]'''|"Tang sound"}} readings are from the pronunciations of later dynasties of China, such as the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]. They cover all readings adopted from the [[Heian era]] to the [[Edo period]]. This is also known as {{Nihongo||唐宋音|Tōsō-on|Tang and Song sound}}.
*{{anchor|kan'yō-on|kan'yōon|kan'you-on}} {{Nihongo||慣用音|'''Kan'yō-on'''|"customary sound"}} readings, which are mistaken or changed readings of the kanji that have become accepted into Japanese language. In some cases, they are the actual readings that accompanied the character's introduction to Japan, but do not match how the character [[linguistic prescription|"should"]] be read according to the rules of character construction and pronunciation.

The most common form of readings is the ''kan-on'' one, and use of a non-''kan-on'' reading in a word where the ''kan-on'' reading is well-known is a common cause of reading mistakes or difficulty, such as in {{Nihongo||解毒|ge-doku|detoxification, anti-poison}} (''go-on''), where {{Nihongo2|解}} is usually instead read as ''kai''. The ''go-on'' readings are especially common in [[Buddhist]] terminology such as {{Nihongo||極楽|gokuraku|paradise}}, as well as in some of the earliest loans, such as the Sino-Japanese numbers. The ''tō-on'' readings occur in some later words, such as {{Nihongo||椅子|isu|chair}}, {{Nihongo||布団|[[futon]]|mattress}}, and {{Nihongo||行灯|andon|a kind of paper lantern}}. The go-on, kan-on, and tō-on readings are generally [[cognate]] (with rare exceptions of homographs; see below), having a common origin in [[Old Chinese]], and hence form [[doublet (linguistics)|linguistic doublets]] or triplets, but they can differ significantly from each other and from modern Chinese pronunciation.

In Chinese, most characters are associated with a single Chinese sound, though there are distinct [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary and colloquial readings]]. However, some homographs ({{lang|zh|多音字}} {{zh|p=duōyīnzì}}) such as {{lang|zh|行}} (''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|háng}}'' or ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|xíng}}'') (Japanese: ''an, gō, gyō'')&lt;!--in go'on. in kan'on, both are ''kō''--&gt; have more than one reading in Chinese representing different meanings, which is reflected in the carryover to Japanese as well. Additionally, many Chinese syllables, especially those with an [[entering tone]], did not fit the largely consonant-vowel (CV) [[phonotactics]] of classical Japanese. Thus most ''on'yomi'' are composed of two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] (beats), the second of which is either a lengthening of the vowel in the first mora (to ''ei'', ''ō'', or ''ū''), the vowel ''i''&lt;!--eg. ''ai'', ''sui''--&gt;, or one of the syllables ''ku'', ''ki'', ''tsu'', ''chi'', ''fu'' (historically, later merged into ''ō''), or moraic ''n'', chosen for their approximation to the final consonants of Middle Chinese. It may be that [[Yōon|palatalized consonants before vowels other than ''i'']] developed in Japanese as a result of Chinese borrowings, as they are virtually unknown in words of native Japanese origin, but are common in Chinese.

''On'yomi'' primarily occur in {{nihongo|multi-kanji compound words|熟語|jukugo}} words, many of which are the result of the adoption, along with the kanji themselves, of Chinese words for concepts that either did not exist in Japanese or could not be articulated as elegantly using native words. This borrowing process is often compared to the [[List of English words with dual French and Anglo-Saxon variations|English borrowings from Latin, Greek, and Norman French]], since Chinese-borrowed terms are often more specialized, or considered to sound more erudite or formal, than their native counterparts (occupying a higher [[linguistic register]]).  The major exception to this rule is [[Japanese family name|family name]]s, in which the native ''kun'yomi'' are usually used (though ''on'yomi'' are found in many personal names, especially men's names).

=== ''Kun'yomi'' (native reading)  {{anchor|kun'yomi|kun-yomi|kunyomi|Japanese reading|native reading}} ===
The {{Nihongo||訓読み|'''kun'yomi'''|{{abbr|lit.|literally}} "meaning reading"}}, the native reading, is a reading based on the pronunciation of a native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word, or ''[[yamato kotoba]]'', that closely approximated the meaning of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] character when it was introduced. As with ''on'yomi'', there can be multiple ''kun'yomi'' for the same kanji, and some kanji have no ''kun'yomi'' at all.

For instance, the character for [[east]], {{Nihongo2|[[wikt:東|東]]}}, has the ''on'yomi'' ''tō'', from [[Middle Chinese]] ''{{IPA|tung}}''. However, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] already had two words for "east": ''higashi'' and ''azuma''. Thus the kanji {{lang|ja|東}} had the latter readings added as ''kun'yomi''. In contrast, the kanji {{lang|ja|[[Cun (length)|寸]]}}, denoting a Chinese unit of measurement (about 30&amp;nbsp;mm or 1.2&amp;nbsp;inch), has no native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] equivalent; it only has an ''on'yomi'', ''[[Cun (length)|sun]]'', with no native ''kun'yomi''. Most ''[[kokuji]]'', Japanese-created Chinese characters, only have ''kun'yomi'', although some have back-formed a pseudo-''on'yomi'' by analogy with similar characters, such as {{Nihongo2|働}} ''dō'', from {{Nihongo2|動}} ''dō'', and there are even some, such as {{Nihongo2|腺}} ''sen'' "gland", that have only an ''on'yomi''.

''Kun'yomi'' are characterized by the strict (C)V syllable structure of ''yamato kotoba''. Most noun or adjective ''kun'yomi'' are two to three syllables long, while verb ''kun'yomi'' are usually between one and three syllables in length, not counting trailing [[hiragana]] called ''[[okurigana]]''. ''Okurigana'' are not considered to be part of the internal reading of the character, although they are part of the reading of the word. A beginner in the language will rarely come across characters with long readings, but readings of three or even four syllables are not uncommon. This contrasts with ''on'yomi'', which are monosyllabic, and is unusual in the [[Chinese family of scripts]], which generally use one character per syllable—not only in Chinese, but also in Korean, Vietnamese, and Zhuang; [[polysyllabic Chinese character]]s are rare and considered non-standard.

{{Nihongo2|承る}} ''uketamawaru'',  {{Nihongo2|志}} ''kokorozashi'', and {{Nihongo2|詔}} ''mikotonori'' have five syllables represented by a single kanji, the longest readings in the [[Jōyō kanji|''jōyō'' character set]]. These unusually long readings are due to a single character representing a compound word:

* {{lang|ja|承る}} is a single character for a compound verb, one component of which has a long reading.
** It has an alternative spelling as {{lang|ja|受け賜る}} ''u(ke)-tamawa(ru)'', hence (1+1)+3=5.
** Compare common {{lang|ja|受け付ける}} ''u(ke)-tsu(keru)''.
* {{lang|ja|志}} is a nominalization of the verb {{lang|ja|志す}} which has a long reading ''kokoroza(su)''.
** This is due to its being derived from a noun-verb compound, {{lang|ja|心指す}} ''kokoro-za(su)''.
** The nominalization removes the okurigana, hence increasing the reading by one mora, yielding 4+1=5.
** Compare common {{lang|ja|話}} ''hanashi'' 2+1=3, from {{lang|ja|話す}} ''hana(su)''.
* {{lang|ja|詔}} is a triple compound.
** It has an alternative spelling {{lang|ja|御言宣}} ''mi-koto-nori'', hence 1+2+2=5.

Longer readings exist for non-Jōyō characters and non-kanji symbols, where a long [[gairaigo]] word may be the reading (this is classed as ''kun'yomi''—see [[#Single character gairaigo|single character gairaigo]], below)—the character {{Nihongo2|糎}} has the seven kana reading {{lang|ja-Kana|センチメートル}} ''senchimētoru'' "centimeter", though it is generally written as "cm" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space); another common example is '%' (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading {{lang|ja-Kana|パーセント}} ''pāsento''. Further, some Jōyō characters have long non-Jōyō readings (students learn the character, but not the reading), such as ''omonpakaru'' for {{lang|ja|慮る}}.

In a number of cases, multiple kanji were assigned to cover a single [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word. Typically when this occurs, the different kanji refer to specific shades of meaning. For instance, the word {{lang|ja-Kana|なおす}}, ''naosu'', when written {{lang|ja|治す}}, means "to heal an illness or sickness". When written {{lang|ja|直す}} it means "to fix or correct something". Sometimes the distinction is very clear, although not always. Differences of opinion among reference works is not uncommon; one dictionary may say the kanji are equivalent, while another dictionary may draw distinctions of use. As a result, native speakers of the language may have trouble knowing which kanji to use and resort to personal preference or by writing the word in [[hiragana]]. This latter strategy is frequently employed with more complex cases such as もと ''moto'', which has at least five different kanji: {{lang|ja|元, 基, 本, 下}}, and {{lang|ja|素}}, the first three of which have only very subtle differences. Another notable example is ''sakazuki'' "sake cup", which may be spelt as at least five different kanji: {{lang|ja|杯, 盃, 巵/卮}}, and {{lang|ja|坏}}; of these, the first two are common—formally {{lang|ja|杯}} is a small cup and {{lang|ja|盃}} a large cup.

Local dialectical readings of kanji are also classified under ''kun'yomi'', most notably readings for words in [[Ryukyuan languages]]. Further, in rare cases gairaigo (borrowed words) have a single character associated with them, in which case this reading is formally classified as a ''kun'yomi'', because the character is being used for meaning, not sound. This is discussed under [[#Single character gairaigo|single character gairaigo]], below.

===Mixed readings {{anchor|jūbako|juubako|jubako|yutō|yutou|yuto}} ===
[[File:Jūbako.jpg|thumb|A {{Nihongo||重箱|jūbako}}, which has a mixed on-kun reading]]
[[File:Pail,yutou,soba-yu,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|A {{Nihongo||湯桶|yutō}}, which has a mixed kun-on reading]]
There are many kanji compounds that use a mixture of ''on'yomi'' and ''kun'yomi'', known as {{Nihongo||重箱読み|jūbako yomi|multi-layered food box}} or {{Nihongo||湯桶|yutō|hot liquid pail}} words (depending on the order), which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are [[autological word]]s): the first character of ''jūbako'' is read using ''on'yomi'', the second ''kun'yomi'' (''on-kun''). 
It is the other way around with ''yutō'' (''kun-on'').

Formally, these are referred to as {{Nihongo||重箱読み|jūbako-yomi|''jūbako'' reading}} and {{Nihongo||湯桶読み|yutō-yomi|''yutō'' reading}}. Note that in both these words, the ''on'yomi'' has a long vowel; long vowels in Japanese generally come from Chinese, hence distinctive of ''on'yomi''. These are the Japanese form of [[hybrid word]]s. Other examples include {{nihongo||場所|basho|"place", ''kun-on''}}, {{nihongo||金色|kin'iro|"golden", ''on-kun''}} and {{nihongo||合気道|aikidō|the martial art [[Aikido]]", ''kun-on-on''}}.

''Ateji'' often use mixed readings. For instance the city of [[Sapporo]], whose name derives from the [[Ainu language]] and has no meaning in Japanese, is written with the ''on-kun'' compound {{lang|ja|札幌}} (which includes ''[[sokuon]]'' as if it were a purely ''on'' compound).

===Special readings===
{{nihongo||{{linktext|義訓}}|{{visible anchor|Gikun}}}} and {{nihongo||{{linktext|熟字訓}}|{{visible anchor|jukujikun}}}} are readings of kanji combinations that have no direct correspondence to the characters' individual ''on'yomi'' or ''kun'yomi''. From the point of view of the character, rather than the word, this is known as a {{Nihongo||{{linktext|難訓}}|nankun|difficult reading}}, and these are listed in kanji dictionaries under the entry for the character.

''Gikun'' are when non-standard kanji are used, generally for effect, such as using {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|寒}}}} with reading ''fuyu'' ("winter"), rather than the standard character {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|冬}}}}.

''Jukujikun'' are when the standard kanji for a word are related to the meaning, but not the sound. The word is pronounced as a whole, not corresponding to sounds of individual kanji. For example, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|今朝}}}} ("this morning") is jukujikun, and read neither as *''ima'asa'', the ''kun'yomi'' of the characters, nor ''konchō'', the ''on'yomi'' of the characters, nor any combination thereof. Instead it is read as ''kesa'', a native bisyllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single [[morpheme]], or as a fusion of ''kyō'' (previously ''kefu''), "today", and ''asa'', "morning". Likewise, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|明日}}}} ("tomorrow") is jukujikun, and read neither as ''akari(no)hi'', the ''kun'yomi'' of the characters, nor ''meinichi'', the ''on'yomi'' of the characters, nor any combination thereof. Instead it is read as ''ashita'', a native multisyllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single [[morpheme]].

Jukujikun are primarily used for some native Japanese words, such as [[Yamato (disambiguation)|Yamato]]&lt;!-- intentional link to DAB page--&gt; ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|大和}}}} or {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|倭}}}}, the name of a Japanese province as well as ancient name for Japan), and for some old borrowings, such as {{Nihongo||{{linktext|柳葉魚}}|[[shishamo]]|willow leaf fish}} from Ainu, {{Nihongo||{{linktext|煙草}}|tabako|smoke grass}} from Portuguese, or ''bīru'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|麦酒}}}}, wheat alcohol) from Dutch, especially if the word was borrowed before the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]]. Words whose kanji are jukujikun are often usually written as hiragana (if native), or katakana (if borrowed); some old borrowed words are also written as hiragana, especially Portuguese loanwords such as ''karuta'' ({{linktext|かるた}}) from Portuguese "carta" (Eng: card), ''tempura'' ({{linktext|てんぷら}}) from Portuguese "tempora" (Eng: time), and ''pan'' ({{linktext|ぱん}}) from Spanish "pan" (Eng: bread), as well as ''tabako'' ({{linktext|たばこ}}).

Sometimes, jukujikun can even have more kanji than there are syllables, examples being ''kera'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|啄木鳥}}}}, woodpecker), ''gumi'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|胡頽子}}}}, silver berry/oleaster),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/29056/how-many-possible-phonological-forms-could-be-represented-by-a-randomly-chosen-s|title=How many possible phonological forms could be represented by a randomly chosen single character?|website=japanese.stackexchange.com|access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hozumi'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|八月朔日}}}}, a surname).&lt;ref name="How do Japanese names work"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/names-for-people.html|title=How do Japanese names work?|website=www.sljfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jukujikun are quite varied. Often the kanji compound for jukujikun is idiosyncratic and created for the word, and where the corresponding Chinese word does not exist; in other cases a kanji compound for an existing Chinese word is reused, where the Chinese word and ''on'yomi'' may or may not be used in Japanese; for example, {{Nihongo||{{linktext|馴鹿}}||reindeer}} is jukujikun for ''tonakai'', from Ainu, but the ''on'yomi'' reading of ''junroku'' is also used. In some cases Japanese coinages have subsequently been borrowed back into  Chinese, such as {{Nihongo||{{linktext|鮟鱇}}|ankō|monkfish}}.

The underlying word for jukujikun is a native Japanese word or foreign borrowing, which either does not have an existing kanji spelling (either ''kun'yomi'' or ''ateji'') or for which a new kanji spelling is produced. Most often the word is a noun, which may be a simple noun (not a compound or derived from a verb), or may be a verb form or a fusional pronunciation; for example {{Nihongo||{{linktext|相撲}}|sumō|[[sumo]]}} is originally from the verb {{Nihongo||{{linktext|争う}}|suma-u|to vie}}, while {{Nihongo||{{linktext|今日}}|kyō|today}} is fusional. In rare cases jukujikun is also applied to inflectional words (verbs and adjectives), in which case there is frequently a corresponding Chinese word.

Examples of jukujikun for inflectional words follow. The most common example of a jukujikun adjective is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|可愛い}}|kawai-i|cute}}, originally ''kawayu-i;'' the word {{Nihongo||{{linktext|可愛}}}} is used in Chinese, but the corresponding ''on'yomi'' is not used in Japanese. By contrast, "appropriate" can be either {{Nihongo||{{linktext|相応しい}}|fusawa-shii|in jukujikun}} or {{Nihongo||{{linktext|相応}}|sōō|in ''on'yomi''}} are both used; the ''-shii'' ending is because these were formerly a different class of adjectives. A common example of a verb with jukujikun is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|流行る}}|haya-ru|to spread, to be in vogue}}, corresponding to ''on'yomi'' {{Nihongo||{{linktext|流行}}|ryūkō}}. A sample jukujikun deverbal (noun derived from a verb form) is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|強請}}|yusuri|extortion}}, from {{Nihongo||{{linktext|強請る}}|yusu-ru|to extort}}, spelling from {{Nihongo||{{linktext|強請}}|kyōsei|extortion}}. See [[:ja:義訓#義訓|義訓]] and [[:ja:熟字訓|熟字訓]] for many more examples. Note that there are also compound verbs and, less commonly, compound adjectives, and while these may have multiple kanji without intervening characters, they are read using usual ''kun'yomi;'' examples include {{Nihongo||{{linktext|面白い}}|omo-shiro-i|interesting|face-whitening}} and {{Nihongo||{{linktext|狡賢い}}|zuru-gashiko-i|sly}}.

Typographically, the [[furigana]] for jukujikun are often written so they are centered across the entire word, or for inflectional words over the entire root—corresponding to the reading being related to the entire word—rather than each part of the word being centered over its corresponding character, as is often done for the usual phono-semantic readings.

Broadly speaking, jukujikun can be considered a form of ''[[ateji]]'', though in narrow usage "ateji" refers specifically to using characters for sound and not meaning (sound-spelling), rather than meaning and not sound (meaning-spelling), as in jukujikun.

Many jukujikun (established meaning-spellings) began life as gikun (improvised meaning-spellings). Occasionally a single word will have many such kanji spellings; an extreme example is {{nihongo|||hototogisu|[[Lesser Cuckoo|lesser cuckoo]]}}, which may be spelt in a great many ways, including {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|杜鵑}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|時鳥}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|子規}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|不如帰}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|霍公鳥}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|蜀魂}}}},  {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|沓手鳥}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|杜宇}}}},{{Nihongo2|{{linktext|田鵑}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|沓直鳥}}}}, and {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|郭公}}}}—many of these variant spellings are particular to [[haiku]] poems.

===Single character gairaigo===
In some rare cases, an individual kanji has a reading that is borrowed from a modern foreign language ([[gairaigo]]), though most often these words are written in katakana. Notable examples include {{nihongo||頁、ページ|pēji|page}}, {{nihongo||釦／鈕、ボタン|botan|button}}, {{nihongo||零、ゼロ|zero|zero}}, and {{nihongo||米、メートル|mētoru|meter}}. See [[wikt:Appendix:Single character gairaigo|list of single character gairaigo]] for more. These are classed as ''kun'yomi'' of a single character, because the character is being used for meaning only (without the Chinese pronunciation), rather than as [[ateji]], which is the classification used when a gairaigo term is written as a compound (2 or more characters). However, unlike the vast majority of other ''kun'yomi'', these readings are not native Japanese, but rather borrowed, so the "kun'yomi" label can be misleading. The readings are also written in katakana, unlike the usual hiragana for native ''kun'yomi''. Note that most of these characters are for units, particularly [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|SI units]], in many cases using new characters ([[kokuji]]) coined during the [[Meiji period]], such as {{nihongo||粁、キロメートル|kiromētoru|kilometer, {{Nihongo2|米}} "meter" + {{Nihongo2|千}} "thousand"}}.

===Other readings===
Some kanji also have lesser-known readings called ''[[nanori]]'' ({{Nihongo2|名乗り}}), which are mostly used for names (often [[given name]]s) and in general, are closely related to the ''kun'yomi''. Place names sometimes also use ''nanori'' or, occasionally, unique readings not found elsewhere.

For example, there is the surname {{lang|ja|小鳥遊}} (literally, "little birds at play") that implies there are no predators, such as hawks, present. Pronounced, "''kotori asobu''". The name then can also mean {{lang|ja|鷹がいない}} (''taka ga inai'', literally, "no hawks around") and it can be shortened to be pronounced as ''Takanashi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myoji-yurai.net/searchResult.htm?myojiKanji=小鳥遊 {{Nihongo2|【名字】小鳥遊}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===When to use which reading===
Although there are general rules for when to use ''on'yomi'' and when to use ''kun'yomi'', the language is littered with exceptions, and it is not always possible for even a native speaker to know how to read a character without prior knowledge (this is especially true for names, both of people and places); further, a given character may have multiple ''kun'yomi'' or ''on'yomi''. When reading Japanese, one primarily recognizes ''words'' (multiple characters and okurigana) and their readings, rather than individual characters, and only guess readings of characters when trying to "sound out" an unrecognized word.

Homographs exist, however, which can sometimes be deduced from context, and sometimes cannot, requiring a glossary.  For example, {{Nihongo2|今日}} may be read either as ''kyō'' "today (informal)" (special fused reading for native word) or as ''konnichi'' "these days (formal)" (''on'yomi''); in formal writing this will generally be read as ''konnichi''. In some cases multiple readings are common, as in {{Nihongo2|豚汁}} "pork soup", which is commonly pronounced both as ''ton-jiru'' (mixed ''on-kun'') and ''buta-jiru'' (''kun-kun''), with ''ton'' somewhat more common nationally. Inconsistencies abound—for example {{Nihongo2|牛肉}} ''gyū-niku'' "beef" and {{Nihongo2|羊肉}} ''yō-niku'' "mutton" have ''on-on'' readings, but {{Nihongo2|豚肉}} ''buta-niku'' "pork" and {{Nihongo2|鶏肉}} ''tori-niku'' "poultry" have ''kun-on'' readings.

The main guideline is that a single kanji followed by ''okurigana'' (hiragana characters that are part of the word)—as used in native verbs and adjectives—''always'' indicates ''kun'yomi'', while kanji compounds (kango) usually use ''on'yomi'', which is usually ''kan-on;'' however, other ''on'yomi'' are also common, and ''kun'yomi'' are also commonly used in kango. For a kanji in isolation without okurigana, it is typically read using their ''kun'yomi'', though there are numerous exceptions. For example, {{Nihongo2|鉄}} "iron" is usually read with the ''on'yomi'' ''tetsu'' rather than the ''kun'yomi'' ''kurogane''. Chinese ''on'yomi'' which are not the common ''kan-on'' reading are a frequent cause of difficulty or mistakes when encountering unfamiliar words or for inexperienced readers, though skilled natives will recognize the word; a good example is {{Nihongo||解毒|ge-doku|detoxification, anti-poison}} (''go-on''), where {{Nihongo||解}} is usually instead read as ''kai''.

[[Okurigana]] are used with ''kun'yomi'' to mark the inflected ending of a native verb or adjective, or by convention. Note that Japanese verbs and adjectives are [[closed class]], and do not generally admit new words (borrowed Chinese vocabulary, which are nouns, can form verbs by adding {{Nihongo||〜する|-suru|to do}} at the end, and adjectives via {{Nihongo2|〜の}} ''-no'' or {{Nihongo2|〜な}} ''-na'', but cannot become native Japanese vocabulary, which inflect). For example: {{Nihongo2|赤い}} ''aka-i'' "red", {{Nihongo2|新しい}} ''atara-shii'' "new", {{Nihongo2|見る}} ''mi-ru'' "(to) see". Okurigana can be used to indicate which ''kun'yomi'' to use, as in {{Nihongo2|食べる}} ''ta-beru'' versus {{Nihongo2|食う}} ''ku-u'' (casual), both meaning "(to) eat", but this is not always sufficient, as in {{Nihongo2|開く}}, which may be read as ''a-ku'' or ''hira-ku'', both meaning "(to) open". {{Nihongo2|生}} is a particularly complicated example, with multiple ''kun'' and ''on'yomi''—see [[Okurigana#生|okurigana: 生]] for details. Okurigana is also used for some nouns and adverbs, as in {{Nihongo2|情け}} ''nasake'' "sympathy",  {{Nihongo2|必ず}} ''kanarazu'' "invariably", but not for {{Nihongo2|金}} ''kane'' "money", for instance. [[Okurigana]] is an important aspect of kanji usage in Japanese; see that article for more information on ''kun'yomi'' orthography

{{anchor|jukugo|multi-kanji compound words}}
Kanji occurring in {{nihongo|compounds (multi-kanji words)|熟語|jukugo}} are generally read using ''on'yomi'', especially for four-character compounds (''[[yojijukugo]]''). Though again, exceptions abound, for example, {{Nihongo2|情報}} ''jōhō'' "information", {{Nihongo2|学校}} ''gakkō'' "school", and   {{Nihongo2|新幹線}} ''shinkansen'' "bullet train" all follow this pattern. This isolated kanji versus compound distinction gives words for similar concepts completely different pronunciations. {{Nihongo2|北}} "north" and {{Nihongo2|東}} "east" use the ''kun'yomi'' ''kita'' and ''higashi'', being stand-alone characters, but {{Nihongo2|北東}} "northeast", as a compound, uses the ''on'yomi'' ''hokutō''. This is further complicated by the fact that many kanji have more than one ''on'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|生}} is read as ''sei'' in {{Nihongo2|先生}} ''sensei'' "teacher" but as ''shō'' in {{Nihongo2|一生}} ''isshō'' "one's whole life". Meaning can also be an important indicator of reading; {{Nihongo2|易}} is read ''i'' when it means "simple", but as ''eki'' when it means "divination", both being ''on'yomi'' for this character.

These rules of thumb have many exceptions. ''Kun'yomi'' compound words are not as numerous as those with ''on'yomi'', but neither are they rare. Examples include {{Nihongo2|手紙}} ''tegami'' "letter", {{Nihongo2|日傘}} ''higasa'' "parasol", and the famous {{Nihongo2|神風}} ''[[kamikaze]]'' "divine wind". Such compounds may also have okurigana, such as {{Nihongo2|空揚げ}} (also written {{Nihongo2|唐揚げ}}) ''karaage'' "Chinese-style fried chicken" and {{Nihongo2|折り紙}} ''[[origami]]'', although many of these can also be written with the okurigana omitted (for example, {{Nihongo2|空揚}} or {{Nihongo2|折紙}}).

Similarly, some ''on'yomi'' characters can also be used as words in isolation: {{Nihongo2|愛}} ''ai'' "love", {{Nihongo2|禅}} ''[[Zen]]'', {{Nihongo2|点}} ''ten'' "mark, dot". Most of these cases involve kanji that have no ''kun'yomi'', so there can be no confusion, although exceptions do occur. Alone {{Nihongo2|金}} may be read as ''kin'' "gold" or as ''kane'' "money, metal"; only context can determine the writer's intended reading and meaning.

Multiple readings have given rise to a number of [[homograph]]s, in some cases having different meanings depending on how they are read. One example is {{Nihongo2|上手}}, which can be read in three different ways: ''jōzu'' (skilled), ''uwate'' (upper part), or ''kamite'' ([[Blocking (stage)#Stage directions|stage left/house right]]). In addition, {{Nihongo2|上手い}} has the reading ''umai'' (skilled). More subtly, {{Nihongo2|明日}} has three different readings, all meaning "tomorrow": ''ashita'' (casual), ''asu'' (polite), and ''myōnichi'' (formal). [[Furigana]] (reading glosses) is often used to clarify any potential ambiguities.

Conversely, in some cases homophonous terms may be distinguished in writing by different characters, but not so distinguished in speech, and hence potentially confusing. In some cases when it is important to distinguish these in speech, the reading of a relevant character may be changed. For example, {{Nihongo2|私立}} (privately established, esp. school) and {{Nihongo2|市立}} (city established) are both normally pronounced ''shi-ritsu;'' in speech these may be distinguished by the alternative pronunciations ''watakushi-ritsu'' and ''ichi-ritsu''. More informally, in legal jargon {{Nihongo2|前文}} "preamble" and {{Nihongo2|全文}} "full text" are both pronounced ''zen-bun'', so {{Nihongo2|前文}} may be pronounced ''mae-bun'' for clarity, as in "Have you memorized the preamble [not 'whole text'] of the constitution?". As in these examples, this is primarily using a ''kun'yomi'' for one character in a normally ''on'yomi'' term.

As stated above, [[#Mixed readings|''jūbako'' and ''yutō'' readings]] are also not uncommon. Indeed, all four combinations of reading are possible: ''on-on'', ''kun-kun'', ''kun-on'' and ''on-kun''.

Several famous place names, including [[names of Japan|those of Japan]] itself ({{Nihongo2|日本}} ''Nihon'' or sometimes ''Nippon''), those of some cities such as [[Tokyo]] ({{Nihongo2|東京}} ''Tōkyō'') and [[Kyoto]] ({{Nihongo2|京都}} ''Kyōto''), and those of the main islands [[Honshu]] ({{Nihongo2|本州}} ''Honshū''), [[Kyushu]] ({{Nihongo2|九州}} ''Kyūshū''), [[Shikoku]] ({{Nihongo2|四国}} ''Shikoku''), and [[Hokkaido]] ({{Nihongo2|北海道}} ''Hokkaidō'') are read with ''on'yomi''; however, the majority of Japanese place names are read with ''kun'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|大阪}} ''Ōsaka'', {{Nihongo2|青森}} ''[[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]]'', {{Nihongo2|箱根}} ''[[Hakone]]''. Names often use characters and readings that are not in common use outside of names. When characters are used as abbreviations of place names, their reading may not match that in the original. The [[Osaka]] ({{Nihongo2|大阪}}) and [[Kobe]] ({{Nihongo2|神戸}}) baseball team, the [[Hanshin Tigers|Hanshin]] ({{Nihongo2|阪神}}) Tigers, take their name from the ''on'yomi'' of the second kanji of ''Ōsaka'' and the first of ''Kōbe''. The name of the [[Keisei Narita Airport Line|Keisei]] ({{Nihongo2|京成}}) railway line—linking Tokyo ({{Nihongo2|東京}}) and [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]] ({{Nihongo2|成田}})—is formed similarly, although the reading of {{Nihongo2|京}} from {{Nihongo2|東京}} is ''kei'', despite ''kyō'' already being an ''on'yomi'' in the word ''Tōkyō''.

[[Japanese family name]]s are also usually read with ''kun'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|山田}} ''Yamada'', {{Nihongo2|田中}} ''Tanaka'', {{Nihongo2|鈴木}} ''Suzuki''. Japanese [[given name]]s often have very irregular readings. Although they are not typically considered ''jūbako'' or ''yutō'', they often contain mixtures of ''kun'yomi'', ''on'yomi'' and ''nanori'', such as {{Nihongo2|大助}} ''Daisuke'' [''on-kun''], {{Nihongo2|夏美}} ''Natsumi'' [''kun-on'']. Being chosen at the discretion of the parents, the readings of given names do not follow any set rules, and it is impossible to know with certainty how to read a person's name without independent verification. Parents can be quite creative, and rumours abound of children called {{Nihongo2|地球}} ''Āsu'' ("Earth") and {{Nihongo2|天使}} ''Enjeru'' ("Angel"); neither are common names, and have normal readings ''chikyū'' and ''tenshi'' respectively. Some common Japanese names can be written in multiple ways, e.g. Akira can be written as {{Nihongo2|亮}}, {{Nihongo2|彰}}, {{Nihongo2|明}}, {{Nihongo2|顕}}, {{Nihongo2|章}}, {{Nihongo2|聴}}, {{Nihongo2|光}}, {{Nihongo2|晶}}, {{Nihongo2|晄}}, {{Nihongo2|彬}}, {{Nihongo2|昶}}, {{Nihongo2|了}}, {{Nihongo2|秋良}}, {{Nihongo2|明楽}}, {{Nihongo2|日日日}}, {{Nihongo2|亜紀良}}, {{Nihongo2|安喜良}} and many other characters and kanji combinations not listed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ateji Archives |url = http://www.tofugu.com/tag/ateji/|website = Tofugu|access-date = 2016-02-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satoshi can be written as {{Nihongo2|聡}}, {{Nihongo2|哲}}, {{Nihongo2|哲史}}, {{Nihongo2|悟}}, {{Nihongo2|佐登史}}, {{Nihongo2|暁}}, {{Nihongo2|訓}}, {{Nihongo2|哲士}}, {{Nihongo2|哲司}}, {{Nihongo2|敏}}, {{Nihongo2|諭}}, {{Nihongo2|智}}, {{Nihongo2|佐登司}}, {{Nihongo2|總}}, {{Nihongo2|里史}}, {{Nihongo2|三十四}}, {{Nihongo2|了}}, {{Nihongo2|智詞}}, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jisho.org/search/Satoshi|title=Satoshi |website=jisho.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Haruka can be written as {{Nihongo2|遥}}, {{Nihongo2|春香}}, {{Nihongo2|晴香}}, {{Nihongo2|遥香}}, {{Nihongo2|春果}}, {{Nihongo2|晴夏}}, {{Nihongo2|春賀}}, {{Nihongo2|春佳}}, and several other possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jisho.org/search/Haruka|title=Haruka |website=jisho.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common patterns do exist, however, allowing experienced readers to make a good guess for most names. To alleviate any confusion on how to pronounce the names of other Japanese people, most official Japanese documents require Japanese to write their names in both kana and kanji.&lt;ref name="How do Japanese names work"/&gt;

Chinese place names and [[Chinese personal name]]s appearing in Japanese texts, if spelled in kanji, are almost invariably read with ''on'yomi''. Especially for older and well-known names, the resulting Japanese pronunciation may differ widely from that used by modern Chinese speakers. For example, [[Mao Zedong]]'s name is pronounced as {{nihongo||毛沢東|Mō Takutō}} in Japanese, and the name of the legendary Monkey King, [[Sun Wukong]], is pronounced ''[[Son Goku (Journey to the West)|Son Gokū]]'' ({{Nihongo2|孫悟空}}) in Japanese.

Today, Chinese names that are not well known in Japan are often spelled in [[katakana]] instead, in a form much more closely approximating the native Chinese pronunciation. Alternatively, they may be written in kanji with katakana furigana. Many such cities have names that come from non-[[Chinese languages]] like [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] or [[Manchu language|Manchu]]. Examples of such not-well-known Chinese names include:

Internationally renowned Chinese-named cities tend to imitate the older English pronunciations of their names, regardless of the kanji's ''on'yomi'' or the Mandarin or Cantonese pronunciation, and can be written in either katakana or kanji. Examples include:

Notes: 
*Guangzhou, the city, is pronounced ''Kōshū'', while Guangdong, its province, is pronounced ''Kanton'', not ''Kōtō'' (in this case, opting for a Tō-on reading rather than the usual Kan-on reading).
*Kaohsiung was originally pronounced ''Takao'' (or similar) in [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] and Japanese. It received this written [[Kaohsiung#Etymology and names|name]] (kanji/Chinese) from Japanese, and later its spoken Mandarin name from the corresponding characters. The English name "Kaohsiung" derived from its Mandarin pronunciation. Today it is pronounced either カオシュン or タカオ in Japanese.
*Taipei is generally pronounced たいほく in Japanese.

In some cases the same kanji can appear in a given word with different readings. Normally this occurs when a character is duplicated and the reading of the second character has voicing (''[[rendaku]]''), as in {{lang|ja|人人}} ''hito-bito'' "people" (more often written with the [[iteration mark]] as {{Nihongo2|人々}}), but in rare cases the readings can be unrelated, as in {{nihongo||跳び跳ねる|tobi-haneru|"hop around", more often written {{lang|ja|飛び跳ねる}}}}.

===Pronunciation assistance===
Because of the ambiguities involved, kanji sometimes have their pronunciation for the given context spelled out in [[ruby character]]s known as ''[[furigana]]'', (small ''[[kana]]'' written above or to the right of the character) or ''kumimoji'' (small ''kana'' written in-line after the character). This is especially true in texts for children or foreign learners. It is also used in [[newspaper]]s and ''[[manga]]'' (comics) for rare or unusual readings, or for situations like the first time a character's name is given, and for characters not included in the officially recognized set of [[jōyō kanji|essential kanji]]. Works of fiction sometimes use ''furigana'' to create new "words" by giving normal kanji non-standard readings, or to attach a foreign word rendered in katakana as the reading for a kanji or kanji compound of the same or similar meaning.

===Spelling words===
Conversely, specifying a given kanji, or spelling out a kanji word—whether the pronunciation is known or not—can be complicated, due to the fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to "kanji #237"), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji—indeed there are many homophonous ''words'', not simply individual characters, particularly for ''kango'' (with ''on'yomi''). Easiest is to write the word out—either on paper or tracing it in the air—or look it up (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving ''kun'yomi'' for characters—these are often unique—using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain how to spell the word {{Nihongo||香辛料|kōshinryō|spice}} via the words {{Nihongo||香り|kao-ri|fragrance}}, {{Nihongo||辛い|kara-i|spicy}}, and {{Nihongo||飲料|in-ryō|beverage}}—the first two use the ''kun'yomi'', the third is a well-known compound—saying "''kaori'', ''karai'', ''ryō'' as in ''inryō''."

===Dictionaries===
In dictionaries, both words and individual characters have readings glossed, via various conventions. Native words and Sino-Japanese vocabulary are glossed in hiragana (for both ''kun'' and ''on'' readings), while borrowings (''gairaigo'')—including modern borrowings from Chinese—are glossed in katakana; this is the standard writing convention also used in furigana. By contrast, readings for individual characters are conventionally written in katakana for ''on'' readings, and hiragana for ''kun'' readings. Kun readings may further have a separator to indicate which characters are okurigana, and which are considered readings of the character itself. For example, in the entry for {{Nihongo2|食}}, the reading corresponding to the basic verb {{Nihongo|''eat''|食べる|taberu}} may be written as {{lang|ja-Kana|た.べる}} (''ta.beru''), to indicate that ''ta'' is the reading of the character itself. Further, [[kanji dictionary|kanji dictionaries]] often list compounds including irregular readings of a kanji.

==Local developments and divergences from Chinese==
Since kanji are essentially Chinese ''[[Hanzi|hànzì]]'' used to write Japanese, the majority of characters used in modern Japanese still retain their Chinese meaning, physical resemblance with some of their modern [[traditional Chinese characters]] counterparts, and a degree of similarity with [[Classical Chinese]] pronunciation imported to Japan from 5th to 9th century. Nevertheless, after centuries of development, there is a notable number of kanji used in modern Japanese which have different meaning from ''hanzi'' used in modern Chinese. Such differences are the result of:
* the use of characters created in Japan,
* characters that have been given different meanings in Japanese, and 
* post-[[World War II]] simplifications (''[[shinjitai]]'') of the character.

Likewise, the process of [[simplified characters|character simplification]] in [[mainland China]] since the 1950s has resulted in the fact that Japanese speakers who have not studied Chinese may not recognize some simplified characters.

===Kokuji {{anchor|Wasei kanji}} ===
{{see also|Gukja|Chữ Nôm|Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages}}
In Japanese, {{nihongo||[[:ja:国字|国字]]|Kokuji|"national characters"}} refers to Chinese characters made outside of China. Specifically, kanji made in Japan are referred to as {{nihongo||和製漢字|Wasei kanji}}. They are primarily formed in the usual way of Chinese characters, namely by combining existing components, though using a combination that is not used in China. The corresponding phenomenon in Korea is called ''[[gukja]]'' ({{lang|ko|國字}}), a cognate name; there are however far fewer Korean-coined characters than Japanese-coined ones. [[Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages|Other languages]] using the [[Chinese family of scripts]] sometimes have far more extensive systems of native characters, most significantly Vietnamese [[chữ Nôm]], which comprises over 20,000 characters used throughout traditional Vietnamese writing, and [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] [[sawndip]], which comprises over 10,000 characters, which are still in use.

Since kokuji are generally devised for existing native words, these usually only have native [[Kun reading#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|''kun'' readings]]. However, they occasionally have a Chinese [[On reading#On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading)|''on'' reading]], derived from a phonetic, as in {{Nihongo2|働}}, ''dō'', and in rare cases only have an ''on'' reading, as in {{Nihongo2|腺}}, ''sen'', from {{lang|ja|泉}}, which was derived for use in technical compounds ({{lang|ja|腺}} means "gland", hence used in medical terminology).

The majority of kokuji are [[Chinese character classification#Ideogrammatic compounds|ideogrammatic compounds]] ({{lang|ja|会意字}}), meaning that they are composed of two (or more) characters, with the meaning associated with the combination. For example, {{Nihongo2|働}} is composed of {{Nihongo2|亻}} (person radical) plus {{Nihongo2|動}} (action), hence "action of a person, work". This is in contrast to kanji generally, which are overwhelmingly phono-semantic compounds. This difference is because kokuji were coined to express Japanese words, so borrowing existing (Chinese) readings could not express these—combining existing characters to logically express the meaning was the simplest way to achieve this. Other illustrative examples (below) include {{lang|ja|榊}} ''[[sakaki]]'' tree, formed as {{Nihongo2|木}} "tree" and {{lang|ja|神}} "god", literally "divine tree", and {{lang|ja|辻}} ''tsuji'' "crossroads, street" formed as {{lang|ja|辶}} ({{Nihongo2|⻌}}) "road" and {{lang|ja|十}} "cross", hence "cross-road".

In terms of meanings, these are especially for natural phenomena (esp. [[flora]] and [[fauna]] [[species]]) that were not present in ancient China, including a very large number of fish, such as {{Nihongo2|鰯}} ([[sardine]]), {{Nihongo2|鱈}} ([[codfish]]), {{Nihongo2|鮴}} ([[Perch (disambiguation)|seaperch]]), and {{Nihongo2|鱚}} ([[sillago]]), and trees, such as {{Nihongo2|樫}} ([[evergreen oak]]), {{Nihongo2|椙}} ([[Japanese cedar]]), {{Nihongo2|椛}} ([[birch]], [[maple]]) and {{Nihongo2|柾}} ([[spindle tree]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/kokuji/?series=kanji|title=Kokuji: "Made In Japan," Kanji Edition|last=Koichi|date=2012-08-21|work=Tofugu|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases they refer to specifically Japanese abstract concepts, everyday words (like {{Nihongo2|辻}}), or later technical coinages (such as {{Nihongo2|腺}}).

There are hundreds of ''kokuji'' in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = SLJ FAQ | url = http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kokuji-list.html | chapter = Kokuji list}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many are rarely used, but a number have become commonly used components of the written Japanese language. These include the following:

Jōyō kanji has about 9 kokuji; there is some dispute over classification, but generally includes these:
* {{Nihongo2|働}} {{lang|ja-Kana|どう}} ''dō'', {{lang|ja-Kana|はたら(く)}} ''hatara(ku)'' "work", the most commonly used kokuji, used in the fundamental verb {{nihongo||働く|hatara(ku)|"work"}}, included in elementary texts and on the [[Japanese Language Proficiency Test|Proficiency Test]] N5.
* {{Nihongo2|込}} {{lang|ja-Kana|こ(む)}} ''ko(mu)'', used in the fundamental verb {{nihongo||込む|komu|"to be crowded"}}
* {{Nihongo2|匂}} {{lang|ja-Kana|にお(う)}} ''nio(u)'', used in common verb {{nihongo||匂う|niou|"to smell, to be fragrant"}}
* {{Nihongo2|畑}} {{lang|ja-Kana|はたけ}} ''hatake'' "field of crops"
* {{Nihongo2|腺}} {{lang|ja-Kana|せん}} ''sen'', "gland"
* {{Nihongo2|峠}} {{lang|ja-Kana|とうげ}} ''tōge'' "mountain pass"
* {{Nihongo2|枠}} {{lang|ja-Kana|わく}} ''waku'', "frame"
* {{Nihongo2|塀}} {{lang|ja-Kana|へい}} ''hei'', "wall"
* {{Nihongo2|搾}} {{lang|ja-Kana|しぼ(る)}} ''shibo(ru)'', "to squeeze" (disputed; see below); a 
''jinmeiyō kanji''
* {{Nihongo2|榊}} {{lang|ja-Kana|さかき}} ''sakaki'' "tree, genus ''[[Sakaki|Cleyera]]''"
* {{Nihongo2|辻}} {{lang|ja-Kana|つじ}} ''tsuji'' "crossroads, street"
* {{Nihongo2|匁}} {{lang|ja-Kana|もんめ}} ''monme'' (unit of weight)
Hyōgaiji:
* {{Nihongo2|躾}} {{lang|ja-Kana|しつけ}} ''shitsuke'' "training, rearing (an animal, a child)"

Some of these characters (for example, {{Nihongo2|腺}}, "gland")&lt;ref&gt;Buck, James H. (October 15, 1969) "Some Observations on kokuji" in ''The Journal-Newsletter of the Association of Teachers of Japanese'', Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 45–9.&lt;/ref&gt; have been introduced to China. In some cases the Chinese reading is the inferred Chinese reading, interpreting the character as a phono-semantic compound (as in how ''on'' readings are sometimes assigned to these characters in Chinese), while in other cases (such as {{Nihongo2|働}}), the Japanese ''on'' reading is borrowed (in general this differs from the modern Chinese pronunciation of this phonetic). Similar coinages occurred to a more limited extent in Korea and Vietnam.

Historically, some kokuji date back to very early Japanese writing, being found in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'', for example—{{Nihongo2|鰯}} ''iwashi'' "sardine" dates to the [[Nara period]] (8th century)—while they have continued to be created as late as the late 19th century, when a number of characters were coined in the [[Meiji era]] for new scientific concepts. For example, some characters were produced as regular compounds for some (but not all) SI units, such as {{Nihongo2|粁}} ({{Nihongo2|米}} "meter" + {{Nihongo2|千}} "thousand, kilo-") for kilometer, {{Nihongo2|竏}} ({{Nihongo2|立}} "liter" + {{Nihongo2|千}} "thousand, kilo-") for kiloliter, and {{Nihongo2|瓩}} ({{Nihongo2|瓦}} "gram" + "thousand, kilo-") for kilogram—see [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters for SI units]] for details. However, SI units in Japanese today are almost exclusively written using rōmaji or katakana such as {{Nihongo2|キロメートル}} or {{Nihongo2|㌖}} for km, {{Nihongo2|キロリットル}} for kl, and {{Nihongo2|キログラム}} or {{Nihongo2|㌕}} for kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kokuji-list.html|title=A list of kokuji (国字)|website=www.sljfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan the kokuji category is strictly defined as characters whose ''earliest'' appearance is in Japan. If a character appears earlier in the Chinese literature, it is not considered a kokuji even if the character was independently coined in Japan and unrelated to the Chinese character (meaning "not borrowed from Chinese"). In other words, kokuji are not simply characters that were made in Japan, but characters that were ''first'' made in Japan. An illustrative example is {{Nihongo||鮟鱇|ankō|[[monkfish]]}}. This spelling was created in Edo period Japan from the [[ateji]] (phonetic kanji spelling) {{Nihongo2|安康}} for the existing word ''ankō'' by adding the {{Nihongo2|魚}} radical to each character—the characters were "made in Japan". However, {{Nihongo2|鮟}} is not considered kokuji, as it is found in ancient Chinese texts as a corruption of {{lang|zh-hant|鰋}} (魚匽). {{Nihongo2|鱇}} is considered kokuji, as it has not been found in any earlier Chinese text. Casual listings may be more inclusive, including characters such as {{Nihongo2|鮟}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanjijiten.net/japanese.html {{Nihongo2|国字}}] at [http://www.kanjijiten.net/ {{Nihongo2|漢字辞典ネット}}] demonstrates this, listing both {{Nihongo2|鮟}} and {{Nihongo2|鱇}} as kokuji, but starring {{Nihongo2|鮟}} and stating that dictionaries do not consider it to be a kokuji.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is {{Nihongo2|搾}}, which is sometimes not considered kokuji due to its earlier presence as a corruption of Chinese {{lang|zh-hant|榨}}.

===Kokkun===
In addition to ''kokuji'', there are kanji that have been given meanings in Japanese different from their original Chinese meanings. These are not considered ''kokuji'' but are instead called ''kok{{zwnj}}[[#kunyomi|kun]]'' ({{Nihongo2|国訓}}) and include characters such as the following:

==Types of kanji by category==
{{Main|Chinese character classification}}
[[Han-dynasty]] scholar [[Xu Shen]] in his 2nd-century dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' classified Chinese characters into six categories ({{zh|c=六書}} ''liùshū'', Japanese: {{Nihongo2|六書}} ''rikusho''). The traditional classification is still taught but is problematic and no longer the focus of modern lexicographic practice, as some categories are not clearly defined, nor are they mutually exclusive: the first four refer to structural composition, while the last two refer to usage.

===''Shōkei moji'' ({{Nihongo2|象形文字}})===
''Shōkei'' (Mandarin: ''xiàngxíng'') characters are [[pictograph]]ic sketches of the object they represent. For example, {{Nihongo2|目}} is an eye, while {{Nihongo2|木}} is a tree. The current forms of the characters are very different from the originals, though their representations are more clear in [[oracle bone script]] and [[seal script]]. These pictographic characters make up only a small fraction of modern characters.

===''Shiji moji'' ({{Nihongo2|指事文字}})===
''Shiji'' (Mandarin: ''zhǐshì'') characters are [[ideograph]]s, often called "simple ideographs" or "simple indicatives" to distinguish them and tell the difference from compound ideographs (below). They are usually simple graphically and represent an abstract concept such as {{Nihongo2|上}} "up" or "above" and {{Nihongo2|下}} "down" or "below". These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.

===''Kaii moji'' ({{Nihongo2|会意文字}})===
''Kaii'' (Mandarin: ''huìyì'') characters are compound ideographs, often called "compound indicatives", "associative compounds", or just "ideographs". These are usually a combination of pictographs that combine semantically to present an overall meaning. An example of this type is {{Nihongo2|休}} (rest) from {{Nihongo2|亻}} (person radical) and {{Nihongo2|木}} (tree).  Another is the ''kokuji'' {{Nihongo2|峠}} (mountain pass) made from {{Nihongo2|山}} (mountain), {{Nihongo2|上}} (up) and {{Nihongo2|下}} (down). These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.

===''Keisei moji'' ({{Nihongo2|形声文字}})===
''Keisei'' (Mandarin: ''xíngshēng'') characters are phono-semantic or [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]-phonetic compounds, sometimes called "semantic-phonetic", "semasio-phonetic", or "phonetic-ideographic" characters, are by far the largest category, making up about 90% of the characters in the standard lists; however, some of the most frequently used kanji belong to one of the three groups mentioned above, so ''keisei moji'' will usually make up less than 90% of the characters in a text. Typically they are made up of two components, one of which (most commonly, but by no means always, the left or top element) suggests the general category of the meaning or semantic context, and the other (most commonly the right or bottom element) approximates the pronunciation. The pronunciation relates to the original Chinese, and may now only be distantly detectable in the modern Japanese ''on'yomi'' of the kanji; it generally has no relation at all to ''kun'yomi''. The same is true of the semantic context, which may have changed over the centuries or in the transition from Chinese to Japanese. As a result, it is a common error in folk etymology to fail to recognize a phono-semantic compound, typically instead inventing a compound-indicative explanation.

===''Tenchū moji'' ({{Nihongo2|転注文字}})===
''Tenchū'' (Mandarin: ''zhuǎnzhù'') characters have variously been called "derivative characters", "derivative [[cognate]]s", or translated as "mutually explanatory" or "mutually synonymous" characters; this is the most problematic of the six categories, as it is vaguely defined. It may refer to kanji where the meaning or application has become extended. For example, {{Nihongo2|楽}} is used for 'music' and 'comfort, ease', with different pronunciations in Chinese reflected in the two different ''on'yomi'', ''gaku'' 'music' and ''raku'' 'pleasure'.

===''Kasha moji'' ({{Nihongo2|仮借文字}})===
''Kasha'' (Mandarin: ''jiǎjiè'') are [[rebus]]es, sometimes called "phonetic loans". The etymology of the characters follows one of the patterns above, but the present-day meaning is completely unrelated to this. A character was appropriated to represent a similar-sounding word. For example, {{Nihongo2|来}} in ancient Chinese was originally a pictograph for "wheat". Its syllable was homophonous with the verb meaning "to come", and the character is used for that verb as a result, without any embellishing "meaning" element attached. The character for wheat {{Nihongo2|麦}}, originally meant "to come", being a ''keisei moji'' having 'foot' at the bottom for its meaning part and "wheat" at the top for sound. The two characters swapped meaning, so today the more common word has the simpler character. This borrowing of sounds has a very long history.

==Related symbols==
{{see also | Japanese typographic symbols}}

The [[iteration mark]] ({{Nihongo2|々}}) is used to indicate that the preceding kanji is to be repeated, functioning similarly to a [[ditto mark]] in English. It is pronounced as though the kanji were written twice in a row, for example {{Nihongo||{{linktext|色々}}|iroiro|"various"}} and {{Nihongo||時々|tokidoki|"sometimes"}}. This mark also appears in personal and place names, as in the [[Japanese name|surname]] Sasaki ({{lang|ja|佐々木}}). This symbol is a simplified version of the kanji {{Nihongo2|仝}}, a variant of {{Nihongo||同|dō|"same"}}.

Another abbreviated symbol is {{Nihongo2|[[ヶ]]}}, in appearance a small [[katakana]] "ke", but actually a simplified version of the kanji {{Nihongo2|箇}}, a general counter. It is pronounced "ka" when used to indicate quantity (such as {{lang|ja|六ヶ月}}, ''rok'''ka'''getsu'' "six months") or "ga" in place names like {{Nihongo|[[Kasumigaseki]]|霞ヶ関}}.

The way how these symbols may be produced on a computer depends on the operating system. In OS X, typing{{Nihongo2|「じおくり」}}will reveal the symbol {{Nihongo2|々}} as well as {{Nihongo2|ヽ}}, {{Nihongo2|ゝ}} and {{Nihongo2|ゞ}}. To produce {{Nihongo2|〻}}, type {{Nihongo2|「おどりじ」}}. Under Windows, typing{{Nihongo2|「くりかえし」}}will reveal some of these symbols, while in Google IME,{{Nihongo2|「おどりじ」}}may be used.

==Collation==
Kanji, whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by conventions such as those used for the [[Latin script]], are often [[collation|collated]] using the traditional Chinese [[radical-and-stroke sorting]] method. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]]. Characters are grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. For example, the kanji character {{Nihongo2|桜}}, meaning "cherry", is sorted as a ten-stroke character under the four-stroke primary radical {{lang|ja|木}} meaning "tree". When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation.

Other kanji sorting methods, such as the [[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary#SKIP|SKIP]] system, have been devised by various authors.

Modern general-purpose [[Japanese dictionaries]] (as opposed to specifically character dictionaries) generally collate all entries, including words written using kanji, according to their [[kana]] representations (reflecting the way they are pronounced). The [[gojūon]] ordering of kana is normally used for this purpose.

==Kanji education==
[[File:3002_Kanji.svg|thumb|An image that lists most joyo-kanji, according to [[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary|Halpern's KKLD indexing system]], with kyo-iku kanji color-coded by grade level.]]

Japanese school children are expected to learn 1006 basic kanji characters, the ''[[kyōiku kanji]]'', before finishing the sixth grade. The order in which these characters are learned is fixed. The ''kyōiku kanji'' list is a subset of a larger list, originally of 1945 kanji characters, in 2010 extended to 2136, known as the ''[[jōyō kanji]]''—characters required for the level of fluency necessary to read newspapers and literature in Japanese. This larger list of characters is to be mastered by the end of the ninth grade.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J. (2006) ''The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary''. {{ISBN|1568364075}}. p. 38a.&lt;/ref&gt; Schoolchildren learn the characters by repetition and [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]].

Students studying Japanese as a foreign language are often required by a curriculum to acquire kanji without having first learned the vocabulary associated with them. Strategies for these learners vary from copying-based methods to [[mnemonic]]-based methods such as those used in [[James Heisig]]'s series ''[[Remembering the Kanji]]''. Other textbooks use methods based on the [[etymology]] of the characters, such as Mathias and Habein's ''The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji'' and Henshall's ''A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters''. Pictorial [[mnemonics]], as in the text ''Kanji Pict-o-graphix'', are also seen.

The [[Japanese government]] provides the ''[[Kanji kentei]]'' ({{Nihongo2|日本漢字能力検定試験}} ''Nihon kanji nōryoku kentei shiken''; "Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude"), which tests the ability to read and write kanji. The highest level of the ''Kanji kentei'' tests about six thousand kanji.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Kobayashi Maru''}}
{{in-universe|subject=''Star Trek''|category=Star Trek|date=April 2009}}
[[File:Captain kirk publicity photo.jpg|thumb|[[William Shatner]] portraying Captain [[James T. Kirk]], the first person able to defeat the ''Kobayashi Maru'' test]]
The '''''Kobayashi Maru''''' is a training exercise in the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe designed to test the character of [[Starfleet Academy]] cadets in a [[No-win situation|no-win scenario]]. The Kobayashi Maru test was first depicted in the opening scene of the film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' and also appears in the 2009 film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]''. Screenwriter [[Jack B. Sowards]] is credited with inventing the test. The test's name is occasionally used among ''Star Trek'' fans or those familiar with the series to describe a no-win scenario, a test of one's character or a solution that involves redefining the problem and managing an insurmountable scenario gracefully.

The notional primary goal of the exercise is to rescue the civilian vessel ''Kobayashi Maru'' in a simulated battle with the [[Klingons]]. The disabled ship is located in the Klingon [[Neutral zone (Star Trek)|Neutral Zone]], and any Starfleet ship entering the zone would cause an interstellar border incident. The approaching cadet crew must decide whether to attempt rescue of the ''Kobayashi Maru'' crew—endangering their own ship and lives—or leave the ''Kobayashi Maru'' to certain destruction. If the cadet chooses to attempt rescue, the simulation is designed to guarantee that the cadet's ship is destroyed with the loss of all crew members.

==Simulation==
In ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]],'' the simulation takes place on a replica of a [[Spacecraft in Star Trek|starship]] bridge, with the test-taker as captain and other Starfleet members, officers or other cadets, in other key positions. In the scenario of the 2280s, the cadet receives a [[distress signal]] stating that the civilian freighter ''Kobayashi Maru'' has struck a gravitic mine in the Klingon Neutral Zone and is rapidly losing power, hull integrity and life support. Sensor readings are indeterminate and there is no way to verify the distress signal.  There are no other vessels nearby. The cadet must quickly make a decision:

* Attempt to rescue the ''Kobayashi Maru''{{'}}s crew and passengers, which involves violating the Neutral Zone and thereby provoking the Klingons into hostile action or possibly an all-out war; or
* Abandon the ''Kobayashi Maru'', preventing war with the Klingons but leaving the crew and passengers of the freighter to probable death.

If the cadet chooses to rescue the ''Kobayashi Maru''{{'}}s crew and passengers, the scenario progresses quickly. The bridge officers notify the cadet that they are in violation of the treaty between the Federation and the Klingons, giving the cadet a chance to turn back before finally committing to this dangerous action.  As the starship enters the Neutral Zone, the communications officer loses contact with the crippled vessel. Klingon warships then quickly appear on an intercept course. Attempts to contact them are met with radio silence; indeed, their only response is to open fire with devastating results. No defense is sufficient against the Klingons and the cadet's ship is eventually defeated (and destroyed if the scenario plays out fully).

Not depicted on film are the possible consequences of rejecting the rescue appeal.  These are discussed at length in novels and video games and include mutiny of the crew over being asked to abandon civilians to die; violations of Starfleet policy regarding rendering of aid to distressed vessels; Klingon incursion into Federation territory responding to "provocation" by the ''Kobayashi Maru''; or the weight on the cadet's conscience caused by refusing to render aid.

The objective of the test is not for the cadet to outfight or outplan the opponent but rather to force the cadet into a no-win situation and simply observe how he or she reacts.

==Notable participants==

===Saavik===
The opening of ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' is itself a ''Kobayashi Maru'' test, but this is not revealed until after the end of the scene, leading the audience to believe that this is a genuine combat scenario involving the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']]. The test-taker, [[Saavik]] ([[Kirstie Alley]]), is in command of the simulated USS ''Enterprise''. During the test, [[Spock]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) serves as science officer and second-in-command, [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]] ([[DeForest Kelley]]) is standing by on the bridge, [[Uhura]] ([[Nichelle Nichols]]) as communications officer, and [[Hikaru Sulu]] ([[George Takei]]) as helm officer; cadets are at other positions.  After the distress call is received, Saavik orders Sulu to plot an intercept course with the imperiled ship. Sulu warns Saavik against violating the Neutral Zone but she overrules him.  Contact with the ''Kobayashi Maru'' is lost, and three Klingon battle cruisers appear on an intercept course. Outgunned and in violation of the Federation–Klingon treaty, Saavik orders a retreat, but the Klingon ships quickly overtake and cripple the ''Enterprise''. Further attacks kill Sulu, Uhura, McCoy, and Spock. [[Montgomery Scott|Mr. Scott]] reports that the ''Enterprise'' is dead in space. Saavik orders that a log buoy be launched, and that the crew abandon ship.

Admiral James Kirk, who had been monitoring the situation from a control room, halts the simulation. All the "deceased" officers rise, and Spock (now revealed as the cadets' instructor) orders the trainees to the briefing room. Saavik protests being subjected to a no-win scenario, opining that it does not properly reflect her command abilities. Kirk explains that the test is meant to reveal how the subject deals with a no-win scenario, and that how one deals with death is as important as how one deals with life. Later in the film, after repeated inquiries from Saavik, Kirk says that the exercise is a true no-win scenario because there is no correct resolution—it is a test of character.&lt;ref name="st:twok"&gt;{{cite video |date = 1982| title = Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan | medium = DVD | publisher = Paramount |people = Nicholas Meyer, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Kirstie Alley |accessdate = 2007-11-09 | url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene used the same set as the bridge of the ''Enterprise'' (shown later in the film). The test is a vehicle to introduce the concept of the no-win scenario as presented to cadets.  The main plot of the film deals with James Kirk's response when finally forced to face such a scenario in real life.

===James T. Kirk===
[[James T. Kirk]] took the test three times while at Starfleet Academy. Before his third attempt, Kirk surreptitiously reprogrammed the simulator so that it was possible to rescue the freighter. Despite having cheated, Kirk was awarded a commendation for "original thinking". This fact is revealed in ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'', as Kirk, Saavik and others are marooned. Saavik accuses Kirk of never having faced the no-win scenario. Kirk replies that he does not believe in it.

====''Star Trek'' (2009)====
The 2009 [[J. J. Abrams]] film depicts cadet James T. Kirk ([[Chris Pine]]) reprogramming the test so the Klingon ships' shields suddenly drop, allowing all five to be destroyed with ease so the safe rescue of the ''Kobayashi Maru'' can commence. This incident earns him the ire of Spock, who is an Academy instructor maintaining the simulation and creator of the test.

During a disciplinary hearing, Spock and Kirk meet for the first time and say many of the same lines that their characters originally used in ''The Wrath of Khan''. Kirk argues that the test itself is a cheat, since the program is unwinnable, and thus cheating is the only solution. Spock counters that the point of the test is not to win, but to face fear and accept the possibility of death, like Kirk's father did. Due to an attack on [[Vulcan (Star Trek planet)|Vulcan]] by the film's villain [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]], the hearing is put on hold and left unresolved.

In the [[Star Trek (novel)|novelization]] of the film, the last chapter reveals that the information Kirk used to defeat the test was obtained during his trysts with an [[Orion (Star Trek)|Orion]] female fellow cadet, who talked in her sleep.

===Spock===
As [[Spock]] had not entered Starfleet Academy as a command-track cadet, he did not take the ''Kobayashi Maru'' test while there. In his death scene at the conclusion of ''The Wrath of Khan'', he describes his sacrifice as his solution to the no-win scenario.&lt;ref name="st:twok"/&gt;

==''Star Trek'' novels==
Depictions of the ''Kobayashi Maru'' test are a fairly popular subject in ''Star Trek'' literature. Non-canonical examples of ''Kobayashi Maru'' tests have been described in many ''Star Trek'' novels. Much like Kirk, characters are frequently depicted as coming up with innovative or surprising ways of handling the situation.

===''The Kobayashi Maru'' (Original Series novel)===
''[[The Kobayashi Maru (novel)|The Kobayashi Maru]]'' (1989) by [[Julia Ecklar]] tells how each of these officers faced the problem:
* [[Pavel Chekov|Chekov]] evacuates his ship and then crashes it into the three Klingon cruisers, destroying all four ships in the process and (inadvertently) all of the evacuees as well.
* [[Hikaru Sulu|Sulu]] realizes it is probably a trap and refuses to cross the Neutral Zone.  His senior crew threaten mutiny but are faced down by a fellow cadet who warns of making a bad situation worse.
* [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]] tricks the simulation into overestimating the effectiveness of a theoretical attack against the Klingon ships' overlapping shielding. Faced with proof that such attacks, although quite valid in theory, would not work in reality and that Scotty knows this, Academy staff reassign Scotty from command school to Engineering (his true love - he used this "solution" precisely because of these consequences).
* Kirk reprograms the simulated Klingons to be afraid of and apologetic toward "''The'' Captain Kirk", arguing that he expected to build a comparable reputation.

===''Dreadnought'' (1986)===
In the novel ''[[Dreadnought!|Dreadnought]]'' by [[Diane Carey]], the protagonist, Piper, a recent academy graduate, manages to [[crash (computing)|crash]] the entire simulator by attempting to improvise an engineering solution to the problem through an unorthodox series of computer commands and [[jury-rig]]ging, essentially tricking the computer into fighting itself. Her instructors admit that her solution might theoretically have been successful.

===''Sarek'' (1994)===
In [[Ann C. Crispin|A.C. Crispin]]'s novel ''[[Sarek (Star Trek novel)|Sarek]]'', [[Peter Kirk (Star Trek)|Peter Kirk]], James T. Kirk's nephew, uses his experiences throughout the novel to come up with another way to defeat the unwinnable scenario, this time against [[Romulan]] opponents. Upon entering the Romulan Neutral Zone, he provokes the Romulans, who are expected to destroy the ''Enterprise''. Before the Romulans open fire, Peter challenges the Romulan commander to a ritual fight to the death (using an obscure but still valid Romulan law predating their schism with the Vulcans), in which actual battle is prohibited until the contest is resolved. As Peter leaves the bridge to go to the simulation [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter room]], he instructs the crew to beam aboard the "survivors" and escape, leaving him to certain death.

The simulation ends with the supervising instructor ending the test in confusion. Upon learning of Peter's trick, he promises to change the scenario to prevent it from being re-used. Peter is credited, however, with coming up with an actual "winning" solution: saving the ''Kobayashi Maru'' and his own ship by sacrificing himself.  This echoes Spock's description of his own sacrifice depicted in ''The Wrath of Khan'' as his resolution of the ''Kobayashi Maru'' test.

===''Avenger'' (1998)===
In [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''[[Avenger (Star Trek)|Avenger]]'', Captain Christine McDonald of the USS ''Tobias'' tells Captain Kirk that in her time, the ''Kobayashi Maru'' scenario is no longer used to test character, but rather to evaluate the "original thinking" for which Kirk had received a commendation. In the new version of the scenario, cadets are charged with coming up with ways to outsmart the simulation by reprogramming it to counter various moves made by the more advanced [[artificial Intelligence|AI]] of the computer.

===''Stone and Anvil'' (2003)===
In his ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier]]'' novels, [[Peter David]] suggests that future versions of the scenario would involve the Romulans.

In ''Stone and Anvil'', [[Mackenzie Calhoun]] realizes that it is impossible to rescue the ''Kobayashi Maru''. He uses the unorthodox solution of destroying the ''Kobayashi Maru'' itself. He determines that a rescue attempt will be unsuccessful, would likely end in failure and would probably also result in his own ship being destroyed or captured. His reasoning is that it is more merciful to kill the civilians outright rather than let them be captured (and likely tortured) by the Romulans. Alternatively, he proposes the possibility that the entire scenario is a Romulan trap and the ''Kobayashi Maru'' is in league with the Romulans, so destruction of the ''Kobayashi Maru'' is a valid attack on an enemy.

===''Star Trek: Strange New Worlds''===
Three short stories in the ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds|Strange New Worlds]]'' anthologies series have also tackled the test. In "The Bottom Line" by Andrew Morby (''Strange New Worlds III'', 2000) and Shawn Michael Scott's "Best Tools Available" (''Strange New Worlds VI,'' 2003), cadet [[Nog (Star Trek)|Nog]] solves the scenario in two entirely different (and thoroughly [[Ferengi]]) manners.

[[Kevin Lauderdale]]'s "A Test of Character" (''Strange New Worlds VII'', 2004) depicts a different version of Kirk's solution from Ecklar's, in which Kirk's tampering is "cheating without cheating," since he merely creates a level playing field where success is not necessarily guaranteed.

===''Kobayashi Maru'' (''Enterprise'' novel)===
In this novel by [[Andy Mangels]] and [[Michael A. Martin]], the scenario occurs as an actual plot event instead of a training exercise. The ''Kobayashi Maru'' is a retrofitted Klingon cargo vessel under Earth control and with a human crew. When the ship is struck by a gravitic mine, Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] and the crew of the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' are sent to assist. Though forewarned that the ''Enterprise'' is entering a trap set by the Romulans, Archer attempts to rescue the crew and passengers of the ''Kobayashi Maru''. At this point three Klingon cruisers being controlled by remote Romulan [[telepresence]] systems drop out of warp and begin attacking the ''Enterprise''. As the ship's systems begin to fail from Romulan attempts to capture ''Enterprise'' via the same telepresence systems, Archer is forced to withdraw, preventing the capture of ''Enterprise'' but leaving the ''Kobayashi Maru'' to be destroyed.

==''Star Trek'' video games==
===''Star Trek: Starfleet Academy''===
In the video game ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (video game)|Star Trek: Starfleet Academy]]'', one of the missions assigned to the player is the ''Kobayashi Maru'' scenario.  The player&amp;nbsp;– who controls the character of Cadet David Forrester&amp;nbsp;– has a choice to make before the test. The player can have Forrester face the unaltered version of the test, or have Forrester reprogram the computer as Captain Kirk did, altering the scenario in one of three ways. He can reprogram the Klingon AI, making them fight poorly (they do not fire at all), reprogram the strength of the Klingon ships by making them easier to beat (in addition, their weapons cause no damage), or make the Klingon captains fear and respect him personally (Kirk's solution from the novel).

If the player cheats by altering the battle itself, he is treated to two larger waves of [[Klingon starships#D7-class|Klingon D7]] cruisers after destroying the initial wave of three. After destroying those waves, the simulator computer crashes with a [[Guru Meditation]] error, and in debriefing the commandant remarks that he would be impressed were it not for the impossibility of such a feat.

If the player cheats by instilling fear and respect into the Klingon captains, he is able to hail the Klingons during the scenario. The Klingon captain extols Forrester's prowess, and agrees to help him rescue the freighter instead. This allows the scenario to complete successfully, and the commandant seems truly impressed in debriefing. No matter how the player cheats, if he chooses this option the cheating is detected by Academy staff, and Forrester is offered a chance to avoid punishment by helping the authorities with an ongoing criminal investigation.

If the player decides to face the unaltered version, the ship is swiftly destroyed by the first wave of D7 cruisers, or if they opt to not rescue the ship, they are forced to listen to the crew of the ''Kobayashi Maru'' die. It is possible to defeat the Klingons in the unaltered version; however, before the player can rescue the crew of the ''Kobayashi Maru'', the game bugs out and the player's ship blows up anyway even though there are no Klingons left.

===''Star Trek: Klingon Academy''===
The video game ''[[Star Trek: Klingon Academy]]'' offers an alternate version of the ''Kobayashi Maru'' test, though conditions are entirely different - The player, who controls the character of Cadet Torlek, is assigned to prevent an incident between the Klingon Empire and the Tholian forces on approach, in the midst of a simulated Klingon-Federation war.  Unlike the choice of saving lives or not, the player has the choice of either attempting to perform his duty but failing, in which the Klingons are forced to compromise their campaign to hold back the Tholians, or to sully his honor by collaborating with the Tholians and surrendering Colonel Poktarhl (Torlek's commanding officer), but ultimately ending the incident.

Regardless of the result, the player is berated by General Chang for his deeds, and Chang's response can depend on Torlek's attitudes - If the player accepts the punishment, Chang will be severe but ultimately retain the player, given only his success record, so far.  If, otherwise, Torlek berates Chang back, on the conditions of this test, Chang will calm Torlek down and expose this was intentional, meaning to have Torlek question the 'injustice' of the test, reassuring him no one is dismissed from the Klingon Academy for failing this one particular simulation, though all others are punished with summary discharge.

===''Star Trek: Starfleet Command III''===
In the video game ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command III]]'', one of the campaign missions is titled "Klingon Maru". However, the player can rescue the ship and not fight a battle.

===''Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative''===
There was also a ''[[Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative|Kobayashi Alternative]]'' [[video game]] published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1985. The game was a [[text adventure]] written by [[Diane Duane]] depicting the "Kobayashi Alternative Command Performance Evaluation", a test being proposed to replace the ''Kobayashi Maru'' scenario, and was available for the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[MS-DOS]] [[PC compatible|PC-compatible]], and [[Macintosh]] platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaming.trekcore.com/kobayashialternative/manualimages.html |title=GAMING :: TrekCore |publisher=Gaming.trekcore.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===''Star Trek: Voyager: Elite Force''===
The first mission of the [[first-person shooter]], ''[[Star Trek: Voyager: Elite Force]]'', developed by [[Raven Software]] and published by [[Activision]] in 2000, is considered Ensign Munro's (the player character's) ''Kobayashi Maru'' by Commander [[Tuvok]].

===''Star Trek DAC''===
In ''[[Star Trek DAC]]'' for [[XBLA]] and [[PlayStation Network]], there is a trophy called Kobayashi Maru that is only achievable by entering a cheat code. Paramount, the publisher of the game, leaked the cheat code in a press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/984/984570p1.html |title=Star Trek's Secret Achievement Revealed |publisher=xboxlive.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523213834/http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/984/984570p1.html |archivedate=2009-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Star Trek Online''===
In ''[[Star Trek Online]]'', the Fleet Action mission released on July 12, 2012, titled "No Win Scenario" pits a 5-player team against progressively harder waves of computer-controlled enemy ships who attempt to destroy the stationary freighter. The mission ends when the freighter is destroyed or the team defeats all 10 waves. Defeating higher waves rewards players with increased numbers of Fleet Marks and unlocks several Accolades and Captain Titles. Defeating the ninth wave yields the "Original Thinking" accolade and grants the "Original Thinker" title, and defeating the final wave rewards the "I don't believe in the No-Win Scenario" accolade which grants the title "Kirk's Protégé".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=609221|title=Release Notes: July 12, 2012 (Season 6: Under Siege)|date=2012-07-12|accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Star Trek: Bridge Crew''===
In ''[[Star Trek: Bridge Crew]]'', which was developed to be played in [[virtual reality]] in 2017, the first level ends with the same Kobayashi Maru test as part of the mission to be solved. No moral choice of lateral thinking is involved here. In practice the mission serves to train the players how to coordinate their actions and alternate between beaming survivors aboard and combat.

''Entertainment Weekly'' called the ''Kobayashi Maru'' test one of the top ten elements of ''Star Trek'' with which non-fans are likely to be familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/06/star-trek-ii-wrath-khan-geekly|title='Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' is a movie about acting|last=Franich|first=Darren|date=May 6, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|access-date=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21929">'''Length measurement''' is implemented in practice in many ways. The most commonly used approaches are the transit-time methods and the interferometer methods based upon the [[speed of light]]. For objects such as crystals and [[diffraction grating]]s, [[diffraction]] is used with [[X-ray]]s and [[electron beam]]s. Measurement techniques for three-dimensional structures very small in every dimension use specialized instruments such as [[Focused ion beam#FIB imaging|ion microscopy]] coupled with intensive computer modeling.

For a discussion of astronomical methods for determining cosmological distances, see the article [[Cosmic distance ladder]].

== Standard rulers ==
The [[ruler]] the simplest kind of length measurement tool: lengths are defined by printed marks or engravings on a stick. The [[meter]] was initially defined using a ruler before more accurate methods became available.

[[Gauge block]]s are a common method for precise measurement or calibration of measurement tools.

For small or microscopic objects, microphotography where the length is calibrated using a graticule can be used. A graticule is a piece that has lines for precise lengths etched into it. Graticules may be fitted into the eyepiece or they may be used on the measurement plane.

==Transit-time measurement==
The basic idea behind a transit-time measurement of length is to send a signal from one end of the length to be measured to the other, and back again. The time for the round trip is the transit time Δt, and the length ℓ is then 2ℓ = Δt*"v",with ''v'' the speed of propagation of the signal, assuming that is the same in both directions. If light is used for the signal, its [[speed of light|speed]] depends upon the medium in which it propagates; in [[SI units]] the speed is a defined value ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the reference medium of [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. Thus, when light is used in a transit-time approach,  length measurements are not subject to knowledge of the source frequency (apart from possible frequency dependence of the correction to relate the medium to classical vacuum), but are subject to the error in measuring transit times, in particular, errors introduced by the response times of the pulse emission and detection instrumentation. An additional uncertainty is the ''refractive index correction'' relating the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. A [[refractive index]] of the medium larger than one slows the light.

Transit-time measurement underlies most radio navigation systems for boats and aircraft, for example, [[radar]] and the nearly obsolete Long Range Aid to Navigation [[LORAN|LORAN-C]]. For example, in one radar system, pulses of electromagnetic radiation are sent out by the vehicle (interrogating pulses) and trigger a response from a ''responder beacon''. The time interval between the sending and the receiving of a pulse is monitored and used to determine a distance. In the [[Global Positioning System|global positioning system]] a code of ones and zeros is emitted at a known time from multiple satellites, and their times of arrival are noted at a receiver along with the time they were sent (encoded in the messages). Assuming the receiver clock can be related to the synchronized clocks on the satellites, the ''transit time'' can be found and used to provide the distance to each satellite. Receiver clock error is corrected by combining the data from four satellites.&lt;ref name= GPS/&gt;

Such techniques vary in accuracy according to the distances over which they are intended for use. For example, LORAN-C is accurate to about {{nowrap|6 km,}} GPS about {{nowrap|10 m,}} enhanced GPS, in which a correction signal is transmitted from terrestrial stations (that is, [[differential GPS]] (DGPS)) or via satellites (that is, [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS)) can bring accuracy to a few meters or {{nowrap|&lt; 1 meter,}} or, in specific applications, tens of centimeters. Time-of-flight systems for robotics (for example, Laser Detection and Ranging [[Laser rangefinder|LADAR]] and Light Detection and Ranging [[LIDAR]]) aim at lengths of {{nowrap|10 - 100 m}} and have an accuracy of about {{nowrap|5 – 10 mm}}&lt;ref name=Siciliano/&gt;

==Interferometer measurements==
[[File:Michelson interferometer with corner cubes.png|thumb|Measuring a length in wavelengths of light using an [[interferometer]].]]
In many practical circumstances, and for precision work, measurement of dimension using transit-time measurements is used only as an initial indicator of length and is refined using an interferometer.&lt;ref name=Boyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ye/&gt; Generally, transit time measurements are preferred for longer lengths, and interferometers for shorter lengths.&lt;ref name=Yoshizawa/&gt;

The figure shows schematically how length is determined using a [[Michelson interferometer]]: the two panels show a laser source emitting a light beam split by a ''[[beam splitter]]'' (BS) to travel two paths. The light is recombined by bouncing the two components off a pair of ''[[corner cubes]]'' (CC) that return the two components to the beam splitter again to be reassembled. The corner cube serves to displace the incident from the reflected beam, which avoids some complications caused by superposing the two beams.&lt;ref name=CC/&gt; The distance between the left-hand corner cube and the beam splitter is compared to that separation on the fixed leg as the left-hand spacing is adjusted to compare the length of the object to be measured.

In the top panel the path is such that the two beams reinforce each other after reassembly, leading to a strong light pattern (sun). The bottom panel shows a path that is made a half wavelength longer by moving the left-hand mirror a quarter wavelength further away, increasing the path difference by a half wavelength. The result is the two beams are in opposition to each other at reassembly, and the recombined light intensity drops to zero (clouds). Thus, as the spacing between the mirrors is adjusted, the observed light intensity cycles between reinforcement and cancellation as the number of wavelengths of path difference changes, and the observed intensity alternately peaks (bright sun) and dims (dark clouds). This behavior is called [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and the machine is called an [[interferometer]]. By ''counting fringes'' it is found how many wavelengths long the measured path is compared to the fixed leg. In this way, measurements are made in units of wavelengths ''&amp;lambda;'' corresponding to a particular [[Atomic spectral line|atomic transition]]. The length in wavelengths can be converted to a length in units of metres if the selected transition has a known frequency ''f''. The length as a certain number of wavelengths ''&amp;lambda;'' is related to the metre using ''&amp;lambda;'' = {{nowrap|''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; / f''}}. With ''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' a defined value of 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s, the error in a measured length in wavelengths is increased by this conversion to metres by the error in measuring the frequency of the light source.

By using sources of several wavelengths to generate sum and difference [[Envelope (waves)#Example: Beating waves|beat frequencies]], absolute distance measurements become possible.&lt;ref name=Zheng/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt;

This methodology for length determination requires a careful specification of the wavelength of the light used, and is one reason for employing a [[laser]] source where the wavelength can be held stable.  Regardless of stability, however, the precise frequency of any source has linewidth limitations.&lt;ref name= frequency/&gt; Other significant errors are introduced by the interferometer itself; in particular: errors in light beam alignment, collimation and fractional fringe determination.&lt;ref name=Yoshizawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=errors/&gt; Corrections also are made to account for departures of the medium (for example, air&lt;ref name=air/&gt;) from the reference medium of [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. Resolution using wavelengths is in the range of ΔL/L ≈ {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;}} depending upon the length measured, the wavelength and the type of interferometer used.&lt;ref name=errors/&gt;

The measurement also requires careful specification of the medium in which the light propagates. A ''refractive index correction'' is made to relate the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. These refractive index corrections can be found more accurately by adding frequencies, for example, frequencies at which propagation is sensitive to the presence of water vapor. This way non-ideal contributions to the refractive index can be measured and corrected for at another frequency using established theoretical models.

It may be noted again, by way of contrast, that the transit-time measurement of length is independent of any knowledge of the source frequency, except for a possible dependence of the correction relating the measurement medium to the reference medium of classical vacuum, which may indeed depend on the frequency of the source. Where a pulse train or some other wave-shaping is used, a range of frequencies may be involved.

==Diffraction measurements==
For small objects, different methods are used that also depend upon determining size in units of wavelengths. For instance, in the case of a crystal, atomic spacings can be determined using [[X-ray diffraction]].&lt;ref name=Mohr/&gt;  The present best value for the lattice parameter of silicon, denoted ''a'', is:&lt;ref name=silicon/&gt;

::a = 543.102 0504(89) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; m,

corresponding to a resolution of ΔL/L ≈ {{nowrap|3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;.}} Similar techniques can provide the dimensions of small structures repeated in large periodic arrays like a [[diffraction grating]].&lt;ref name=grating/&gt;

Such measurements allow the calibration of [[electron microscope]]s, extending measurement capabilities. For non-relativistic electrons in an electron microscope, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] is:&lt;ref name=Spence/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_e = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2m_e e V}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''V'' the electrical voltage drop traversed by the electron, ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' the electron mass, ''e'' the [[elementary charge]], and ''h'' the [[Planck constant]]. This wavelength can be measured in terms of inter-atomic spacing using a crystal diffraction pattern, and related to the metre through an optical measurement of the lattice spacing on the same crystal. This process of extending calibration is called ''[[metrological traceability]]''.&lt;ref name=traceability&gt;

See {{cite web |title=Metrological traceability |publisher=BIPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/calibrations/traceability.html |accessdate=2011-04-10}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The use of metrological traceability to connect different regimes of measurement is similar to the idea behind the [[cosmic distance ladder]] for different ranges of astronomical length. Both calibrate different methods for length measurement using overlapping ranges of applicability.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

==Other techniques==
Measuring dimensions of localized structures (as opposed to large arrays of atoms like a crystal), as in modern [[integrated circuit]]s, is done using the [[scanning electron microscope]]. This instrument bounces electrons off the object to be measured in a high vacuum enclosure, and the reflected electrons are collected as a photodetector image that is interpreted by a computer. These are not transit-time measurements, but are based upon comparison of [[Fourier transform]]s of images with theoretical results from computer modeling. Such elaborate methods are required because the image depends on the three-dimensional geometry of the measured feature, for example, the contour of an edge, and not just upon one- or two-dimensional properties. The underlying limitations are the beam width and the wavelength of the electron beam (determining [[diffraction]]), determined, as already discussed, by the electron beam energy.&lt;ref name=IC_linewidth&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
The calibration of these scanning electron microscope measurements is tricky, as results depend upon the material measured and its geometry. A typical wavelength is {{nowrap|0.5 Å,}} and a typical resolution is about {{nowrap|4 nm.}}

Other small dimension techniques are the [[atomic force microscope]], the [[focused ion beam]] and the [[helium ion microscope]]. Calibration is attempted using standard samples measured by [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM).&lt;ref name=Orji&gt;

[[Nuclear Overhauser effect]] spectroscopy (NOESY) is a specialized type of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] where distances between atoms can be measured. It is based on the effect where nuclear spin cross-relaxation after excitation by a radio pulse depends on the distance between the nuclei. Unlike spin-spin coupling, NOE propagates through space and does not require that the atoms are connected by bonds, so it is a true distance measurement instead of a chemical measurement. Unlike diffraction measurements, NOESY does not require a crystalline sample, but is done in solution state and can be applied to substances that are difficult to crystallize.

==Other systems of units==

In some systems of units, unlike the current SI system, lengths are fundamental units (for example, ''wavelengths'' in the older SI units and ''bohrs'' in [[atomic units]]) and are not defined by times of transit. Even in such units, however, the ''comparison'' of two lengths can be made by comparing the two transit times of light along the lengths. Such time-of-flight methodology may or may not be more accurate than the determination of a length as a multiple of the fundamental length unit.

The [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) is the thermal radiation assumed to be left over from the "[[Big Bang]]" of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]].  The CMB is a snapshot of the oldest light in our universe, imprinted on the sky when the universe was just 380,000 years old. It shows tiny temperature fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities, representing the seeds of all future structure: the stars and galaxies of today. Therefore, analysis of the small anisotropies in the CMB helps us to understand the origin and the fate of our universe. In past few decades, there has been a lot of improvement in the observations and several experiments, performed to understand the basic structure of the universe. For analyzing data of different cosmological experiments and for understanding the theoretical nature of the universe many advanced methods and computing software are developed in and used by Cosmologists for years. These software are widely used by the cosmologists across the globe.

The computational software, used in cosmology can be classified into the following major classes.

* '''Map generation and processing software:''' These software are used for preparing the CMB sky maps from the crude observational data. The software HEALPIX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Gorski|first=Krzysztof M.|author2=Benjamin D. Wandelt |author3=Frode K. Hansen |author4=Eric Hivon |author5=Anthony J.

== Map generation and processing software ==

=== HEALPix ===

[[HEALPix]] (sometimes written as Healpix), an acronym for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelisation of a 2-sphere, can refer to either an algorithm for pixelization of the 2-sphere, an associated software package, or an associated class of map projections.  Healpix is widely used for cosmological random map generation. The original motivation for devising HEALPix was one of necessity. [[NASA]]'s [[WMAP]] and the [[European Space Agency]]’s mission [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] - produce multi-frequency data sets sufficient for the construction of full-sky maps of the microwave sky at an angular resolution of a few arc minutes. The principal requirements in the development of HEALPix were to create a mathematical structure that supports a suitable discretization of functions on a sphere at sufficiently high resolution, and to facilitate fast and accurate statistical and astrophysical analysis of massive full-sky data sets.  The HEALPix maps are used in almost all the data processing research in cosmology.

== Cosmological Boltzmann codes ==

=== CMBFAST ===

[[CMBFAST]] is a computer code, developed by [[Uroš Seljak]] and [[Matias Zaldarriaga]] (based on a Boltzmann code written by Edmund Bertschinger, [[Chung-Pei Ma]] and Paul Bode) for computing the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy. It is the first efficient program to do so, reducing the time taken to compute the anisotropy from several days to a few minutes by using a novel semi-analytic line-of-sight approach.

=== CAMB ===

Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background by Antony Lewis and Anthony Challinor. The code was originally based on CMBFAST. Later several developments are made to make it a faster and more accurate and compatible with the present research. The code is written in an object oriented manner to make it more user friendly.

=== CMBEASY ===

CMBEASY is a software package written by Michael Doran, Georg Robbers and Christian M. Müller. The code is based on the CMBFAST package. CMBEASY is fully object oriented C++. This considerably simplifies manipulations and extensions of the CMBFAST code. In addition, a powerful Spline class can be used to easily store and visualize data. Many features of the CMBEASY package are also accessible via a graphical user interface. This may be helpful for gaining intuition, as well as for instruction purposes.

=== CLASS ===

CLASS is a new Boltzmann code developed in this line. The purpose of CLASS is to simulate the evolution of linear perturbations in the universe and to compute CMB and large scale structure observables. Its name also comes from the fact that it is written in object-oriented style mimicking the notion of class. Classes are a programming feature available, e.g., in C++ and python, but these languages are known to be less vectorizable/parallelizable than plain C (or Fortran), and hence potentially slower. CLASS is written in plain C for high performances, while organizing the code in a few modules that reproduce the architecture and philosophy of C++ classes, for optimal readability and modularity.

== Parameter estimation packages ==

[[File:Snapshot3-2-.png|thumbnail|right|A snapshot of AnalyzeThis (CMBEASY) GUI package. The plot shows the marginalize probability distribution from a MCMC chain.]]

=== AnalizeThis ===

AnalizeThis is a parameter estimation package used by cosmologists. It comes with the CMBEASY package. The code is written in C++ and uses the global metropolis Algorithm for estimation of cosmological parameters. The code was developed by Michael Doran, for parameter estimation using WMAP-5 likelihood. However, the code was not updated after 2008 for the new CMB experiments. Hence this package is currently not in use by the CMB research community. The package comes up with a nice GUI.

=== CosmoMC ===

CosmoMC is a Fortran 2003 [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) engine for exploring cosmological parameter space. The code does brute force (but accurate) theoretical [[matter power spectrum]] and [[Cosmic microwave background|Cl]] calculations using CAMB. CosmoMC uses a simple local Metropolis algorithm along with an optimized fast-slow sampling method. This fast-slow sampling method provides faster convergence for the cases with many nuisance parameters like Planck. CosmoMC package also provides subroutines for post processing and plotting of the data.

CosmoMC was written by Antony Lewis in 2002 and later several versions are developed to keep the code up-to date with different cosmological experiments. It is presently the most used cosmological parameter estimation code.

=== SCoPE ===

SCoPE/Slick Cosmological Parameter Estimator is a newly developed cosmological MCMC package written by Santanu Das in C language. Apart of standard global metropolis algorithm the code uses three unique technique named as 'delayed rejection' that increases the acceptance rate of a chain, 'pre-fetching' that helps an individual chain to run on parallel CPUs and 'inter-chain covariance update' that prevents clustering of the chains allowing faster and better mixing of the chains. The code is capable of faster computation of cosmological parameters from WMAP and Planck data.

== Other packages ==
* [http://cds.cern.ch/record/408710/files/9911389.pdf MADCAP] - Microwave Anisotropy Data Computational Analysis Package developed by Borrill et al.
* [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~sasselov/rec/ RECFAST] - Software was developed by Seager, Sasselov, and Scott and used to calculate the recombination history of the universe. The package is used by cosmological boltzmann codes (CMBFast, CAMB etc.)

=== Likelihood software packages ===

Different cosmology experiments, in particular the CMB experiments like [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] measures the temperature fluctuations in the CMB sky and then measure the CMB power spectrum from the observed skymap. But for parameter estimation the χ² is required. Therefore, all these CMB experiments comes up with its own likelihood software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8969">A '''magnetorquer''' or '''magnetic torquer''' (also known as '''torque rod''') is a [[satellite]] system for [[attitude control]], detumbling, and stabilization built from [[electromagnetic coil]]s. The magnetorquer creates a magnetic dipole that interfaces with an ambient magnetic field, usually [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's]], so that the counter-forces produced provide useful [[torque]].

== Functional principle ==

Magnetorquers are essentially sets of electromagnets which are laid out to yield a rotationally asymmetric ([[anisotropic]]) magnetic field over an extended area. That field is controlled by switching [[Electric current|current]] flow through the coils on or off, usually under computerized [[feedback]] [[control theory|control]]. The magnets themselves are mechanically anchored to the craft, so that any magnetic force they exert on the surrounding magnetic field will lead to a magnetic reverse force and result in mechanical torque about the vessel's [[center of gravity]]. This makes it possible to freely pivot the craft around in a known local [[gradient]] of the magnetic field by only using electrical energy.
The magnetic dipole generated by the ''magnetorquer'' is expressed by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}=  n I \mathbf{A} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of turns of the wire, ''I'' is the current provided, and '''A''' is the [[vector area]] of the coil. 
The dipole interacts with the magnetic field generating a torque whose expression is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}= \mathbf{m}\times \mathbf{B}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where '''m''' is the magnetic dipole vector, '''B''' the magnetic field vector (for a spacecraft it is the Earth magnetic field vector) and '''τ''' is the generated torque vector.

== Construction ==

The construction of a ''magnetorquer'' is based on the realization of a coil with a defined area and number of turns according to the required performances. However, there are different ways to obtain the coil, thus according to the construction strategy it is possible to find three type of magnetorquer, apparently very different from each other but based on the same concept &lt;ref&gt;{{cite document

}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
*'''Air-core magnetorquer''': this comprises the basic concept of ''magnetorquer'', a conductive wire wrapped around a non-conductive support anchored to the satellite. This kind of ''magnetorquer'' can provide a consistent magnetic dipole with an acceptable mass and encumbrance. 
*'''Embedded coil''': this kind of ''magnetorquer'' is constructed creating a spiral trace inside the [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]] of solar panels which generates the effect of the coil. This solution is the one with the least impact on the satellite as it is entirely contained within the solar panels. However, due to the physical limit in the board thickness and the presence of other circuits and electronic components, it is not possible to reach a high value of the magnetic dipole.  
*'''Torquerod''': this kind of ''magnetorquer'' is the most efficient solution. A conductive wire is wrapped around a ferromagnetic core which is magnetized when excited by the coil, thus generating a dipole considerably higher than the other solutions. However, the disadvantage is the presence of a residual magnetic dipole that remains even when the coil is turned off because of the [[Magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]] in the magnetization curve of the core. It is therefore necessary to demagnetize the core with a proper demagnetizing procedure. Normally, the presence of the core (generally consisting of heavy metal) increases the mass of the system.

Typically three coils are used, although reduced configurations of two or even one magnet can suffice where full attitude control is not needed or external forces like asymmetric [[Drag (physics)|drag]] allow [[Underactuation|underactuated control]]. The three coil assembly usually takes the form of three perpendicular coils, because this setup equalizes the rotational symmetry of the fields which can be generated; no matter how the external field and the craft are placed with respect to each other, approximately the same torque can always be generated simply by using different amounts of current on the three different coils.

As long as [[Electric current|current]] is passing through the coils and the spacecraft has not yet been stabilized in a fixed orientation with respect to the external field, the craft's spinning will continue.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Very small satellites may use [[permanent magnet]]s instead of coils.

== Advantages ==

Magnetorquers are lightweight, reliable, and energy-efficient. Unlike [[Rocket engine|thrusters]], they do not require expendable [[propellant]] either, so they could in theory work indefinitely as long as sufficient [[Electric power|power]] is available to match the [[resistive]] load of the coils. In Earth orbit, sunlight is one such practically inexhaustible energy source, using [[solar panels]].

A further advantage over [[momentum wheel]]s and [[control moment gyroscope]]s is the absence of [[moving parts]] and therefore significantly higher reliability.

== Disadvantages ==

The main disadvantage of magnetorquers is that very high [[magnetic flux density|magnetic flux densities]] are needed if large craft have to be turned very fast. This either necessitates a very high [[amperage|current]] in the coils, or much higher ambient flux densities than are available in [[Earth orbit]]. Subsequently, the torques provided are very limited and only serve to accelerate or decelerate the change in a spacecraft's attitude by minute amounts. Over time active control can produce very fast spinning even here, but for accurate attitude control and stabilization the torques provided often aren't enough.

A broader disadvantage is the dependence on Earth's magnetic field strength, making this approach unsuitable for deep space missions, and also more suitable for [[low Earth orbit]]s as opposed to higher ones like the [[geosynchronous]]. The dependence on the highly variable intensity of Earth's magnetic field is also problematic because then the attitude control problem becomes highly [[nonlinear]]. It is also impossible to control attitude in all three axes even if the full three coils are used, because the torque can be generated only perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field vector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Any spinning satellite made of a conductive material will lose rotational momentum in Earth's magnetic field due to generation of [[eddy current]]s in its body and the corresponding braking force proportional to its spin rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aerodynamics|Aerodynamic]] [[friction]] losses can also play a part. This means that the magnetorquer will have to be continuously operated, and at a power level which is enough to counter the resistive forces present. This is not always possible within the energy constraints of the vessel.

The Michigan Exploration Laboratory (MXL) suspects that the [[M-Cubed]] [[CubeSat]], a joint project run by MXL and [[JPL]], became magnetically conjoined to [[Explorer-1 Prime]], a second CubeSat released at the same time, via strong onboard magnets used for passive attitude control, after deploying on October 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Global Country headquarters.JPG|thumb|A commercial building constructed using the principles and features of MVA]]

'''Maharishi Vastu Architecture''' (MVA) is a set of architectural and planning principles assembled by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] based on "ancient Sanskrit texts".&lt;ref name=Argus&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_08_05_RockIsArgus_ltr.pdf Welvaert, Brandy, Vedic homes seek better living through architecture", ''Rock Island Argus'', (August 5, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spivack/&gt; Maharishi Vastu Architecture is also called "Maharishi [[Sthapatya Veda]]", "Fortune-Creating" buildings and homes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharishivastu.org/ Official Web site, Maharishi Vastu Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Maharishi Vedic architecture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedicarchitecture.org/ Maharishi Vedic Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

MVA has strict rules governing the orientation and proportions of a building.&lt;ref name=Toner&gt;{{cite news|title=Houses that boost health and wealth|first=Niall |last=Toner|work=Sunday Times|location=London (UK)|date=July 22, 2007|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important factor is the entrance, which must be either due east or due north.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; The MVA architect also considers the slope and shape of the lot, exposure to the rising sun, location of nearby bodies of water and the other buildings or activities in the nearby environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_07_AAAMag_ltr.pdf Egenes, Linda "Spotlight: Maharishi Vedic City", ''AAA Magazine'' (July 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; MVA emphasizes the use of natural or "green" building materials.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

MVA homes are marketed in the US by Maharishi Global Construction, LLC,&lt;ref name=Hutchinson/&gt; and by MVA Homes in the UK, both arms of the [[Transcendental Meditation movement]].&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; Several communities around the world have been developed using MVA principles. The plans for [[#Peace Tower project|Peace Tower]], which would have been the world's tallest building, followed MVA specifications.

==Principles and effects==
According to [[#Maharishi Global Construction|Maharishi Global Construction]] (MGC) in [[Fairfield, Iowa]], building a home according to the principles of MVA "connects the individual intelligence of the occupant of the house to the cosmic intelligence of the universe".&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_09_TimesJourCont.pdf Times Journal of Construction and Design, In Accord With Nature, Niranjan Mudholkar, September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of MVA say its basis is in the [[Vedas]], 5,000-year-old Sanskrit texts that assert a connection between human health and building materials, orientation to the movements of the sun and spatial relationships.&lt;ref name=Spivack/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt; According to Lipman, Vedic architecture and [[feng shui]] have a common root, but MVA is more scientific, while feng shui has superstitious elements.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt; Lipman says that MVA is derived from "lost and misunderstood" principles, natural law, "whereby the entire universe is created: galaxies, planets, human beings" along with buildings and cities.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

Craig Pearson, Executive Vice President of [[Maharishi University of Management]] (MUM), claims that spending time in buildings that follow these principles makes one smarter.&lt;ref name=Willdorf&gt;{{cite journal|title=Karma and wrecking balls|first=Nina|last=Willdorf|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|location=Washington|date=June 2, 2000|volume=46|issue=39|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that MVA homes have escaped wildfires that burned neighboring homes, and that businesses located in MVA office buildings have greater profit and lower absenteeism.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Residents of MVA homes in [[Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa]] claim they felt vitality, calm and happiness when they moved into their Vedic houses. A mother claims that her boys are more orderly.&lt;ref name=Balachandran/&gt; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has said, "Living in a proper vastu can eliminate 60 to 80 percent of the problems we encounter in life."&lt;ref name=Balachandran&gt;{{cite news|title=Vedic city: A city in the US follows building principles set in the Vedas|first=R. |last=Balachandran|date=September 9, 2001|work=The Week (Indian magazine)|location=Kerala, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Warburton, Raja of England, says that the practice of Maharishi’s Vedic peace technologies is more powerful with Vastu buildings.&lt;ref name=Warburton/&gt; Yale University architecture professor [[Keller Easterling]] says that MVA is fueled by a desire to create outposts for broadcasting the [[Maharishi Effect]].&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt;

Maharishi Sthapatya Veda is considered to be an element of the [[Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health]], and the main modality of MVAH for improving the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Schneider| first1 = Robert H. | last2 = Fields| first2 = Jeremy Z. | title = Total heart health : how to prevent and reverse heart disease with the maharishi vedic approach to health | year = 2006 | publisher = Basic Health Publications | location = Laguna Beach, CA | isbn = 978-1-59120-087-1 | pages=64, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siting===
Auspicious locations have water to the east or north.&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt; If water is in an inauspicious location then it can be balanced with fountains on the north side.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt; Items in the nearby environment that generate electro-magnetic fields, such as high tension wires and microwave towers, are avoided.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The slope, if any, should be towards the east, and there should be no obstructions that block the sun's first rays.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt;

===Orientation===
[[File:Maharishi Centre for Educational Excellence, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India..jpg|thumb|left|350px|MCEE School Campus at Bhopal, India, '''facing due east''']]
The principles of orientation in Maharishi Sthapatya Veda are based on the position of the sun, considered by MVA to be the most powerful natural influence on Earth.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt; Aligning a structure with the rising sun (facing east) is considered by MVA adherents to be auspicious for the building's inhabitants and to be "spiritually healthy."&lt;ref name=Aspan&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Aspan| first = Maria| title = Maharishi’s Minions Come to Wall Street| work = The New York Times| accessdate=December 17, 2009 |date = 2007-07-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/business/worldbusiness/02maharishi.html?_r=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the principles of MVA, the other three cardinal directions also have their corresponding influences. For example, homes with entrances facing west invite "poverty, lack of creativity and vitality,"&lt;ref name="Kansas City Star"&gt;Canon, Scott, "Maharishi's followers have integrated into small Iowa town" ''Kansas City Star'', (September 28, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and "anxiety, depression, bad luck and even criminal tendencies."&lt;ref name="rickross.com"&gt;"Reclusive Guru's in Battle to Demolish Historic Dutch Monastery" ''Associated Press'', January 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; According to the MVA official website, the north direction has the influence of prosperity and happiness and the south direction has the influence of negativity, problems and suffering.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Proper orientation is also said to increase business productivity.

===Placement===
When a house for a particular individual is being designed using MVA principles, the placement of the building and its rooms are carefully planned according to their intended usage and the influence of the sun as it moves throughout the day.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_07_22_AmericanWay_ltr.pdf Kissel, William "Home and Peace", ''American Way'' (July 15 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rooms are placed to "take in the sun's light as it passes overhead." Windows and skylights are also used to allow as much natural sunlight as possible to enter the building.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt; An aspect of MVA called "Vastu Vidya" determines the places in the building that are used for generating and storing natural elements like fire and water, heating and plumbing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Bathroom fixtures such as sinks and mirrors also have a particular placement according to MVA rules;&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions/&gt; Toilets have a particular direction depending on the Vastu design&lt;ref name=Hutchinson&gt;{{cite news|title=Wasting away in Maharishi-ville|first=Brian |last=Hutchinson|work=National Post|location=Don Mills, Ont.|date= February 22, 2003|page=B.1.Fro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchens and dining rooms should be on the east side, and offices on the west.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt;  commercial buildings are often designed as linear "bar buildings" to offer the most east-facing exposure.&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt;

===Proportion===
MVA says that symmetry is orderly and helps to coordinate the various aspects of a structure, and that there is an ideal proportion for every room in a home or office. Also, the length, width and elevation of the building are calculated using the ancient Vedic mathematical formulas and requires a level of construction precision to one-eighth of an inch.&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions/&gt;

MVA planning and building takes into account the effects of the sun, moon, planets and stars, and also using the poles and the equator as reference points.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Its measurements and proportions are said to be calculated in reference to proportions of the human physiology and the cosmos, and in harmony with nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Features===
[[File:Maharishi Headquarters in Holland- cropped.jpg|thumb|A ''kalash'' atop a ''Brahmasthan'', with the flag of the [[Global Country of World Peace]], on the Maharishi's HQ in Vlodrop.]]
One of the features of MVA design is the ''[[Brahmasthan]]'', whose literal translation is "establish wholeness". The ''Brahmasthan'' is a central space "lit by a skylight" that serves as a "silent core" and is "never walked on".&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/transcendental-meditation-vedic-city-iowa/story?id=9218475 Berman, John and Burbank, Maggie, "Transcendental Meditation thrives in Iowa", ''ABC News'' (January 8 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmastan'' is said to act as the "nucleus" or axis point for the structure like the nucleus of a cell or an atom.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt;

Other features include a perimeter designation called a ''vastu'' fence. This boundary line may consist of shrubs or a metal, stone or wood fence. It is ideally about {{convert|30|ft|m}} away from the front and back of the building and eight feet away from the sides.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Another feature is a "small, golden, roof ornament" or [[cupola]], called a ''[[Kalasha|kalash]]'', which one MVA architect says improves the connection between the residents and heaven.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutchinson/&gt; A defined plinth is another standard element.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Color is also covered by MVA.&lt;ref name=Paradkar&gt;{{cite news|title=Before feng shui, there was vastu shastra; Indian science has formulas to align a home with nature Interiors, decor can be modified to best advantage|first=Bageshree |last=Paradkar|work=Toronto Star|date=March 10, 2005|page=J.06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ceremonies====
Three "special ceremonies" performed on "auspicious dates" are recommended by MVA. These include a ground breaking, which is described as digging a precise square hole while facing east, adding organic fertilizer and "sacred water" from India, and making statements of goodwill and success for the new construction. The second ceremony is the laying of the cornerstone and the third is moving-in.&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions&gt;Architectural Impressions, 2005 Edition, the Maharishi Vedic Center, Alan Sullivan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
MVA buildings should not contain any iron or steel.&lt;ref name=TMB91&gt;{{cite news|title=Details of World's Most Advanced 'Sustainable' and 'Fortune-Creating' Building |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=September 2008 |url=http://www.tmbulletin.com/Volume9/TMBulletinV9I01.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717063738/http://www.tmbulletin.com/Volume9/TMBulletinV9I01.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MVA emphasizes the use of natural or "green" building materials such as wood, bricks, adobe, rammed earth, clay, stucco and marble. Other natural fibers such as wood, paper, cotton and wool are used in the interior.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The use of natural materials, along with spacious plots and layouts, mean that MVA homes can be expensive, according to the MGC sales director, Eloise Raymond.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt;

==Global Reconstruction==
The Maharishi's Global Reconstruction Program for Permanent World Peace entails replacing the existing cities and buildings of the world with plans and structures that follow MVA principles. The project is estimated by the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) Finance Minister to cost $300 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press-conference.globalgoodnews.com/archive/january/06-01-18.html |title=Maharishi Press Conference Highlights |publisher=globalgoodnews.com |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A goal of the MGDF is to achieve "heaven on earth".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; The Director of the Global Country of World Peace's [[Global Country of World Peace#Financial Capital|Financial Capital]], Paul Potter, said "we hope to be able to rebuild the whole world to be fortune-oriented buildings, to be heaven on earth".&lt;ref name=Aspan/&gt;

A 2000 document from the Maharishi Global Development Fund outlines a proposed method for cities to transition to Vastu buildings. The first phase is "controlling the expansion of the city by establishing a masterplan with parallel roads in east/west, north/south directions". The second phase is "construction of ideal villages and satellite towns around the city, free from pollution". The third is "starting to demolish congested areas in the city center, replacing them with beautiful gardens, parks and fountains". The fourth is "final stage of the expanded garden city, providing ideal living conditions, including a modern communication and transportation system".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite news|work=Dallas Business Journal|date=May 5, 2000|volume=23|issue=37|page=1|title=Maharishi eyes Colony project|first1=LISA Y.|last1=TAYLOR|first2=CHRISTINE |last2=PEREZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maharishi said that "improperly oriented" building should be demolished, including the [[White House]] and the [[United Nations Headquarters|U.N.

He designated 2006 as the "Year of Reconstruction for the Whole World to be Heaven on Earth".

==Reception==
After hearing a presentation on MVA at the [[National Building Museum]] in 2005, a ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter said that "non-adherents" may find the principles "eccentric, to say the least," as houses not facing east or north are said by MVA adherents to be "practically begging inauspicious forces to sweep in and wreak havoc." The reporter goes on to say that many architects would not "quibble" with other components of MVA such as "balance and symmetry", a vastu fence or wall and "solar influenced" placement of rooms in the home.&lt;ref name=Turrentine&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/06/AR2005070600611.html Turrentine, Jeff , "Mind over mortar", ''Washington Post'' (July 7 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' travel writer Carina Chocano writes that Maharishi Vedic City "displays all the architectural characteristics of a new exurban development: gaudy, oversize construction that has no stylistic relation to its environment but instead vaguely alludes to a theme-park version, someplace sort of magical and far away."&lt;ref name=Chocano&gt;[http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-tr-vedic10sep10?page=1 Chocano, Carina, "Meditation comes with creature comforts at Iowa's Maharishi University", ''Los Angeles Times'' (September 10, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24397">'''Mental toughness''' is a measure of individual resilience and confidence that may predict success in sport, education and the workplace. As a broad concept, it emerged in the context of sports training, in the context of a set of attributes that allow a person to become a better athlete and able to cope difficult training and  difficult competitive situations and emerge without losing [[confidence]]. In recent decades, the term has been commonly used by coaches, [[Sport psychology|sport psychologists]], [[sports commentator]]s, and business leaders.

There are several factors as to why a positive mentality or mental toughness is a huge benefactor to success. An elite athlete must be able to handle pressure, have self-belief and avoid any lifestyle distractions. They must have that urge to win and know that they have all the capabilities to do anything they desire. This separate's the good athletes from the elite athletes (Jones et al.,2002). &lt;ref&gt;Declan Connaughton,2008. The development and maintenance of mental toughness: Perceptions of elite performers. Journal of Sports Sciences, Issue 1, Volume 26, Pages 83-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

 Samples of attributes were taken by Graham Jones to examine differences of success between athletes and which ones possess a strong mentality. It was proven that there were 30 attributes suggesting mental toughness in super elite athlete but only an average of 12 in elite athletes indicating the mental difference to become a super elite performer (Jones et al.,2007). This illustrates how important a positive mentality is for athletes to be successful. &lt;ref&gt;Declan Connaughton,2008. The development and maintenance of mental toughness: Perceptions of elite performers. Journal of Sports Sciences, Issue 1, Volume 26, Pages 83-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mental toughness" is frequently used colloquially to refer to any set of positive attributes that helps a person to cope with difficult situations. Coaches and sport commentators freely use the term mental toughness to describe the mental state of athletes who persevere through difficult sport circumstances to succeed. In support of this, a number of studies have linked mental toughness to sporting success or achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Cowden, R. (2017). Mental toughness and success in sport: A review and prospect. The Open Sports Science Journal, 10, 1-14. doi:10.2174/1875399X01710010001 &lt;/ref&gt; However, it is often simply applied as a default explanation for any victory, which is highly problematic as an attribution. Criticisms about the use of this imprecise approach abound (for example, Moran (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Moran, A. P. (2012). Sport and Exercise Psychology: A Critical Introduction (2nd ed.). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;).

However, within the past fifteen years, scientific research has attempted a formal definition of mental toughness as a [[Construct validity|psychological construct]] with clear measurement criteria, allowing robust analyses and comparisons to be made.

In particular, three research teams have produced both a definition and a construct definition for mental toughness:

== Jones, Hanton, and Connaughton ==

Graham Jones, Sheldon Hanton, and Declan Connaughton of the United States used [[Personal construct theory|personal construct psychology]] in interviews with elite athletes, as well as elite-level coaches and sport psychologists, to arrive at the following definition of mental toughness:

* Mental toughness is "Having the natural or developed psychological edge that enables you to: generally, cope better than your opponents with the many demands (competition, training, lifestyle) that sport places on a performer; specifically, be more consistent and better than your opponents in remaining determined, focused, confident, and in control under pressure." (Jones, Hanton, &amp; Connaughton, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;209).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = G. | last2 = Hanton | first2 = S. | last3 = Connaughton | first3 = D. | year = 2002 | title = What Is This Thing Called Mental Toughness? An Investigation of Elite Sport Performers | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Sport Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 205–218 | doi = 10.1080/10413200290103509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These same researchers published a second paper in 2007, which provided four dimensions (categories) for mental toughness attributes. One general dimension was outlined: a performer's attitude or mindset (specifically, the performer's focus and self-belief). Three time-specific dimensions were outlined: training, competition, and post-competition. These time-specific dimensions contain attributes of mental toughness  (such as handling pressure, handling failure and pushing yourself to your physical limit in training) that pertain to their use at these times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = G. | last2 = Hanton | first2 = S. | last3 = Connaughton | first3 = D. | year = 2007 | title = A framework of mental toughness in the world's best performers | url = http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20073152280.html | journal = Sport Psychologist | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 243–264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clough and Earle ==

Peter Clough et al. (2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mental Toughness. The Concept and its Management. In: Cockerill, I. (Ed.), Solutions in Sport Psychology.|last=Clough, P. J., K. Earle, and D. Sewell.|first=|publisher=Thomson|year=2002|isbn=|location=London|pages=32-45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model of mental toughness, conceptualising it more like a personality trait. Their model has four components: confidence; challenge; control and commitment. In initially conceptualising mental toughness and developing the MTQ48&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mental toughness Questionnaire 48: Technical manual.|last=Clough, P. J., Marchant, D. C., &amp; Earle, K.|first=|publisher=AQR|year=2007|isbn=|location=Wrexham|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; questionnaire measurement tool, the approach taken by Clough et al. (2002) was to combine existing psychological theory and applied sport psychology in an attempt to bridge the gap between research and practice. Clough et al. saw clear comparisons between their emerging mental toughness data and the concept of hardiness, a key individual difference and resistance resource that helps buffer stress and has become an accepted concept in health psychology within the study of the stress-illness relationship. Clough et al. are clear that mental toughness is concept with broad application and should not be limited to the sports domain. They feel that sports specific measures are unlikely to move the field forward in any meaningful ways.  The development work relating to their model is fully described and discussed in their book on mental toughness.&lt;ref&gt;Clough, P.J. &amp; Strycharczyk, D (2012)  Applied mental toughness: A tool kit for the 21st Century. Kogan Page {{ISBN|978-0-7494-6377-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gucciardi, Gordon, and Dimmock ==

Daniel Gucciardi, Sandy Gordon, and James Dimmock of Australia have proposed a different definition and framework of mental toughness, based primarily on their work with Australian footballers. Using [[Personal construct theory|personal construct psychology]], these authors proposed the following definition of mental toughness:

{{quote|Mental toughness in Australian Football is a collection of values, attitudes, behaviors, and emotions that enable you to persevere and overcome any obstacle, adversity, or pressure experienced, but also to maintain concentration and motivation when things are going well to consistently achieve your goals.|Gucciardi, Gordon, &amp; Dimmock, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;278|&lt;ref name="AF1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gucciardi | first1 = D. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = S. | last3 = Dimmock | first3 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Towards an Understanding of Mental Toughness in American Football | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Sport Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 261–281 | doi = 10.1080/10413200801998556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although this definition was produced through work with Australian footballers, it has been generalized to other sports, including cricket&lt;ref name="CMTI"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gordon|first2=S.|year=2009|title=Development and preliminary validation of the Cricket Mental Toughness Inventory (CMTI)|url=|journal=Journal of sports sciences|volume=27|issue=12|pages=1293–310|doi=10.1080/02640410903242306|last1=Gucciardi|first1=D. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cricketers"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=The relationship between developmental experiences and mental toughness in adolescent cricketers|url=|journal=Journal of sport &amp; exercise psychology|volume=33|issue=3|pages=370–93|pmid=21659669|last1=Gucciardi|first1=D. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soccer.&lt;ref name="AUSOC" /&gt; This definition conceives of mental toughness as having both reactive ''and'' proactive qualities, meaning that mentally tough players can use mental toughness attributes to help endure and perform well during adverse situations, but can also employ other attributes of mental toughness when the game is going well, to keep them playing at their best.

== Studies ==

Some psychologists have argued that a separate, sport-specific definitions of mental toughness should be developed.&lt;ref&gt;Crust, L. (2007). Mental toughness in sport: A review. ''International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology'', 5(3), 270-290. Retrieved from http://www.informaworld.com/index/934187662.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L | year = 2008 | title = A review and conceptual re-examination of mental toughness: Implications for future researchers | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 45 | issue = 7| pages = 576–583 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2008.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have highlighted that the attributes of a mentally tough athlete in one sport may differ greatly from the attributes of a mentally tough athlete in a different sport. Differences have been hypothesized between male and female athletes, as well as between "team sport" and "individual sport" athletes, but to date, little empirical evidence has shown what these differences are.

These studies have not employed a common framework, although many have used the definition of mental toughness provided by either the Jones et al. study, or the Gucciardi ''et al.'' study.

Many sports focussed studies have employed the Clough model of mental toughness.  They have, using samples of athletes, shown a link between toughness, coping, emotional reactivity, psychological skills and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L | year = 2009 | title = The relationship between mental toughness and affect intensity | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 959–963 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L. | last2 = Azadi | first2 = K. | year = 2010 | title = Mental toughness and athletes' use of psychological strategies | url = | journal = European Journal of Sport Science | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 43–51 | doi=10.1080/17461390903049972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls | first1 = A. | last2 = Polman | first2 = R. | last3 = Levy | first3 = A. | last4 = Backhouse | first4 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Mental toughness, optimism, and coping among athletes | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1182–1192 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few published studies that takes mental toughness out of the sporting domain is based on the [[#Clough and Earle|4 'C's]] model. In this study it was shown that senior managers are tougher than their junior colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marchant | first1 = D. | last2 = Polman | first2 = R. | last3 = Clough | first3 = P.J. | last4 = Jackson | first4 = J.G. | last5 = Levy | first5 = A. | last6 = Nicholls | first6 = A.R. | year = 2009 | title = Mental toughness: Managerial and age differences | url = | journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 428–437 | doi=10.1108/02683940910959753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clough and his team are working in a number of areas outside of sport – education, health, social as well as occupational to explore the relevance of mental toughness in these areas.

=== Developmental studies ===
There is an active debate about whether mental toughness is primarily a developed characteristic, or has  a genetic basis. Two studies  suggest that foundational processes occur during development that allow a person to build mental toughness throughout life. For instance, a study of American soccer players, parents, and coaches found that parents provide a "generalized form" of mental toughness upon which coaches can build a sport-specific form of mental toughness.&lt;ref name="AUSOC"/&gt; A similar study suggested that mental toughness development proceeds first through the development of a tough attitude (strong focus and strong self-belief); upon a tough attitude, an athlete learns how to develop mental toughness attributes needed for training, then for competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connaughton | first1 = D. | last2 = Hanton | first2 = S. | last3 = Jones | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = The development and maintenance of mental toughness in the World's best performers | url = http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103259744.html | journal = The Sport Psychologist | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 168–193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examined the developmental experiences of ten super-elite athletes and found that coaches and significant adults played an important role in mental toughness development through all stages of talent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connaughton | first1 = D. | last2 = Wadey | first2 = R. | last3 = Hanton | first3 = S. | last4 = Jones | first4 = G. | year = 2008 | title = The development and maintenance of mental toughness: perceptions of elite performers | url = | journal = Journal of sports sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 83–95 | doi = 10.1080/02640410701310958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the work of Horsburgh et al. (2009) demonstrates that genetic and non-shared environmental factors contribute to the development of mental toughness (as measured by the MTQ48), and that mental toughness behaves "in the same manner as virtually every personality trait that has ever been investigated in behavioural genetic study".&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt; In establishing significant relationships with the big five personality factors of Costa and McCrae (1992), these researchers have also provided evidence to support Clough et al.’s conceptualisation of mental toughness.&lt;ref name="Horsburgh, V. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horsburgh | first1 = V. | last2 = Schermer | first2 = J. | last3 = Veselka | first3 = L. | last4 = Vernon | first4 = P. | year = 2009 | title = A behavioral genetic study of mental toughness and personality | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 100–105 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2008.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst clearly embracing the importance of genetics, Clough clearly acknowledges that mental toughness can be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L | last2 = Clough | first2 = P.J. | year = 2011 | title = Developing Mental Toughness: From Research to Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Sport Psychology in Action | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 21–32 | doi=10.1080/21520704.2011.563436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar constructs ==
Mental toughness has been equated with better understood constructs from psychology such as [[Resilience (psychology)|resilience]] and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]]. The term resilience is often incorrectly used interchangeably with mental toughness, and researchers have found the two constructs are positively associated with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Cowden, R.G., Meyer-Weitz, A., &amp; Oppong Asante, K. (2013). Mental toughness in competitive tennis: Relationships with resilience and stress. Frontiers in Psychology, 7(320). doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00320.&lt;/ref&gt; However, psychologists define resilience as a positive adaptive ''process'' of coping with stress and adversity, as opposed to a collection of psychological attributes or personality traits. Hardiness has been suggested as a similar construct to mental toughness. Hardiness has typically been constructed as a [[Trait theory|personality trait]], which is generally seen as stable throughout the lifetime. This differs from the conceptions of mental toughness offered by both Jones et al. and Gucciardi et al. These authors both conceive of mental toughness as unstable, arising in development, fluctuating over time, and varying for an individual performer between different sport and life scenarios. This definitional dilemma plagues the use of the term mental toughness and if mental toughness exists as a valid construct it may on occasion be maladaptive. Evidence to support this contention is derived from a study of overtraining behaviors and mental toughness by Tibbert (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Tibbert, S. J. (2013). MENTAL TOUGHNESS AND OVERTRAINING BEHAVIOURS Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Victoria University.&lt;/ref&gt; She reported that "the MT attributes of mental self-concept and task familiarity displayed moderate curvilinear correlations with sport-specific recovery scales of the RESTQ-Sport. The curvilinear correlations reflect decreasing recovery at the highest levels of MT. The results suggest that some attributes of MT may relate to increased ability to recover whereas other attributes are associated with lower recovery (p.2-3). Arguably mental toughness is more closely linked with goal fixedness rather than adaptability and a flexible mindset, attributes which are central to resilience.

== Measurement ==
Two instruments have been developed and validated since 2009. Gucciardi and colleagues validated the American Football Mental Toughness Inventory (AFMTI),&lt;ref name="AFMTI"/&gt; while Sheard and Golby validated the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ).&lt;ref name="SMTQ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheard | first1 = M. | last2 = Golby | first2 = J. | last3 = van Wersch | first3 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Progress Toward Construct Validation of the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ) | url = | journal = European Journal of Psychological Assessment | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 186–193 | doi = 10.1027/1015-5759.25.3.186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MTQ48 pre dates these by some seven years. The factor structure of the MTQ48 has been supported by an independent research grouping led by Horsburgh (2009).&lt;ref name="Horsburgh, V. 2009"/&gt; Dr Lee Crust, University of Lincoln, compared the SMTQ with the MTQ 48 and concluded "Both instruments appear to tap the core components of MT but the MTQ48 seemingly provides a more comprehensive measure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L. | last2 = Swann | first2 = C. | year = 2011 | title = Comparing two measures of mental toughness | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 217–221 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.09.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTQ48 questionnaire has demonstrable criterion related, construct and content validity. Reliability has been assessed by numerous independent researchers and it has clearly demonstrable internal consistency and test-retest reliability.{{fact|date=April 2018}} All component scales exceed 0.70 and the overall measure has a reliability in excess of 0.90.{{fact|date=April 2018}} &lt;!-- Independent research CFA paper published in December (2012) can be accessed through AQR; MD Doug Strycharczyk was involved in the development of the MTQ48. www.aqr.co.uk--&gt; Nevertheless both the construct validity and the psychometric properties of this test have been questioned by  Andersen (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, M. B. (2011). Who's mental? Who's tough and who's both? Mutton constructs dressed up as lamb. In: Mental toughness in sport : developments in research and theory. Gucciardi, Daniel F and Gordan, Sandy, eds. Routledge Research in Sport and Exercise Science . Routledge, Abington, Oxon, U.K. ; New York, pp. 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other instruments have purported to measure mental toughness, but research has called their validity into question. For example, the Performance Profile Inventory (PPI) developed by Jim Loehr used seven subscales to compute a mental toughness score.  The Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI) developed by Middleton and colleagues measures mental toughness using twelve subscales and appears to show strong theoretical evidence for its formation. However, construct validation has only been performed with a narrow sample of athletes, leaving its psychometric properties up for debate.&lt;ref name="SMTQ"/&gt;

'''Metafiction''' is a form of literature that emphasizes its own constructedness in a way that continually reminds the reader to be aware that they are reading or viewing a fictional work. Metafiction is self-conscious about language, literary form, storytelling, and directly or indirectly draw attention to their status as artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metafiction is frequently used as a form of parody or a tool to undermine literary conventions and explore the relationship between literature and reality, life, and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Metafiction – A Poetological Study of Metafiction in English since 1939|last=Imhof|first=Rüdiger|publisher=Carl Winter Universitätsverlag|year=1986|isbn=|location=Heidelberg|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although metafiction is most commonly associated with [[postmodern literature]], its use can be traced back to much earlier works of fiction, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Canterbury Tales|''Canterbury Tales'']] (1387), [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605), [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' (c.1608), [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759), [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s [[Vanity Fair (novel)|''Vanity Fair'']] (1847), as well as more recent works such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954–1955), or [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (1979). Metafiction, however, became particularly prominent in the 1960s, with authors and works such as [[John Barth]]'s ''[[Lost in the Funhouse]]'', [[Robert Coover]]'s "The Babysitter" and "The Magic Poker", [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'',&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;Jensen, Mikkel (2016) "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00144940.2015.1133546 Janus-Headed Postmodernism: The Opening Lines of ''Slaughterhouse-Five'']" in ''[[The Explicator]]'', 74:1, 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Fowles]]' ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'',  [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' and [[William H. Gass]]'s ''Willie Master's Lonesome Wife''.

== History of the term ==
The term 'metafiction' was coined in 1970 by [[William H. Gass]] in his book ''Fiction and the Figures of Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William H.|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gass describes the increasing use of metafiction at the time as a result of authors developing a better understanding of the medium. This new understanding of the medium led to a major change in the approach toward fiction. Theoretical issues became more prominent aspects, resulting in an increased self-reflexivity and formal uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William H.|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Scholes]] expands upon Gass' theory and identifies four forms of criticism on fiction, which he refers to as formal, behavioural, structural, and philosophical criticism. Metafiction assimilates these perspectives into the fictional process, putting emphasis on one or more of these aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fabulation and Metafiction|last=Scholes|first=Robert|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=111-115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments were part of a larger movement (arguably a 'metareferential turn'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Metareferential Turn in Contemporary Arts and Media: Forms, Functions, Attempts at Explanation|last=|first=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|series=Studies in Intermediality 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which, approximately from the 1960s onwards, was the consequence of an increasing social and cultural self-consciousness, stemming from, as [[Patricia Waugh]] puts it, "a more general cultural interest in the problem of how human beings reflect, construct and mediate their experience in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this development, an increasing number of novelists rejected the notion of rendering the world through fiction. The new principle became to create through the medium of language a world that does not reflect the real world. Language was considered an "independent, self-contained system which generates its own 'meanings.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a means of mediating knowledge of the world. Thus, literary fiction, which constructs worlds through language, became a model for the construction of 'reality' rather than a reflection of it. Reality itself became regarded as a construct instead of an objective truth. Through its formal self-exploration, metafiction thus became the device that explores the question of how human beings construct their experience of the world.

Robert Scholes identifies the time around 1970 as the peak of experimental fiction (which metafiction is an instrumental part of) and names a lack of commercial and critical success as reasons for its subsequent decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fabulation and Metafiction|last=Scholes|first=Robert|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development toward metafictional writing in postmodernism generated mixed responses. Some critics argued that it signified the decadence of the novel and an exhaustion of the artistic capabilities of the medium, with some going as far as to call it the '[[death of the novel]]'. Others see the self-consciousness of fictional writing as a way to gain deeper understanding of the medium and a path that leads to innovation that resulted in the emergence of new forms of literature, such as the [[Historiographic metafiction|historiographic novel]] by [[Linda Hutcheon]].

== Forms ==
According to Werner Wolf, metafiction can be differentiated into four pairs of forms that can be combined with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Werner (2009). "Metareference across Media: The Concept, its Transmedial Potentials and Problems, Main Forms and Functions". ''Metareference across Media: Theory and Case Studies''. Studies in Intermediality 4, eds. Werner Wolf, Katharina Bantleon, and Jeff Thoss. Amsterdam: Rodopi. pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explicit/implicit metafiction ===
Explicit metafiction is identifiable through its use of clear metafictional elements on the surface of a text. It comments on its own artificiality and is quotable. Explicit metafiction is described as a mode of telling. An example would be a narrator explaining the process of creating the story they are telling. 

Rather than commenting on the text, implicit metafiction foregrounds the medium or its status as an artefact through various, for example disruptive, techniques such as [[metalepsis]]. It relies more than other forms of metafiction on the reader's ability to recognize these devices in order to evoke a metafictional reading. Implicit metafiction is described as a mode of showing.

=== Direct/indirect metafiction ===
Direct metafiction establishes a reference within the text one is just reading. In contrast to this, indirect metafiction consists in metareferences external to this text, such as reflections on specific other literary works or genres (as in parodies) and general discussions of aesthetic issues; since there is always a relationship between the text in which indirect metafiction occurs and the referenced external texts or issues, indirect metafiction always also impacts the text one is reading, albeit in an indirect way. 

=== Critical/non-critical metafiction ===
Critical metafiction aims to find the artificiality or fictionality of a text in some critical way, which is frequently done in [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] fiction. Non-critical metafiction does not criticize or undermine the artificiality or fictionality of a text and can, for example, be used to "suggest that the story one is reading is authentic".&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Werner (2009). "Metareference across Media: The Concept, its Transmedial Potentials and Problems, Main Forms and Functions". ''Metareference across Media: Theory and Case Studies''. Studies in Intermediality 4, eds. Werner Wolf, Katharina Bantleon, and Jeff Thoss. Amsterdam: Rodopi. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generally media-centred/truth- or fiction-centred metafiction ===
While all metafiction somehow deals with the medial quality of fiction or narrative and is thus generally media-centred, in some cases there is an additional focus on the truthfulness or inventedness (fictionality) of a text, which merits mention as a specific form. The suggestion of a story being authentic (a device frequently used in [[Literary realism|realistic]] fiction) would be an example of (non-critical) truth-centred metafiction.

== Examples ==

=== Laurence Sterne, ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'' ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is with LOVE as with CUCKOLDOM—&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;—But now I am talking of beginning a book, and have long had a thing upon my mind to be imparted to the reader, which if not imparted now, can never be imparted to him as long as I live (whereas the COMPARISON may be imparted to him any hour of the day)—I'll just mention it, and begin in good earnest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The thing is this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now in practice throughout the known world, I am confident my own way of doing it is the best—I'm sure it is the most religious—for I begin with writing the first sentence—and trusting to Almighty God for the second.&lt;ref&gt;Sterne, Laurence (1759-1767/2003). ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman''. London:&amp;nbsp;Penguin. p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this scene [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]], the eponymous character and narrator of the novel, foregrounds the process of creating literature as he interrupts his previous thought and begins to talk about the beginnings of books. The scene evokes an explicitly metafictional response to the problem (and by addressing a problem of the novel one is just reading but also a general problem the excerpt is thus an example of both direct and indirect metafiction, which may additionally be classified as generally media-centred, non-critical metafiction). Through the lack of context to this sudden change of topic (writing a book is not a plot point, nor does this scene take place at the beginning of the novel, where such a scene might be more willingly accepted by the reader) the metafictional reflection is foregrounded. Additionally, the narrator addresses the reader directly, thereby confronting the reader with the fact that they are reading a constructed text.

=== David Lodge, ''The British Museum is Falling Down'' ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Has it ever occurred to you that novelists are using up experience at a dangerous rate? No, I see it hasn't. Well, then, consider that before the novel emerged as the dominant literary form, narrative literature dealt only with the extraordinary or the allegorical – with kings and queens, giants and dragons, sublime virtue and diabolic evil. There was no risk of confusing that sort of thing with life, of course. But as soon as the novel got going, you might pick up a book at any time and read about an ordinary chap called Joe Smith doing just the sort of things you did yourself. Now, I know what you're going to say – you're going to say that the novelist still has to invent a lot. But that's just the point: there've been such a fantastic number of novels written in the past couple of centuries that they've just about exhausted the possibilities of life. So all of us, you see, are really enacting events that have already been written about in some novel or other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The British Museum Is Falling Down|last=Lodge|first=David|publisher=McGibbon &amp; Kee|year=1965|isbn=|location=London|pages=129-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This scene from ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down|The British Museum is Falling Down]]'' (1965) features several instances of metafiction. First, the speaker, Adam Appleby (the protagonist of the novel) discusses the change the rise of the novel brought upon the literary landscape, specifically with regards to thematic changes that occurred. Second, he talks about the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] aspect of [[Literary realism|realist]] novels. Third, he alludes to the notion that the capabilities of literature have been exhausted, and thus to the idea of the [[death of the novel]] (all of this is explicit, critical indirect metafiction). Fourth, he covertly foregrounds that fact that the characters in the novel are fictional characters, rather than masking this aspect, as would be the case in non-metafictional writing. Therefore, this scene features metafictional elements with reference to the medium (the novel), the form of art (literature), a genre (realism), and arguably also lays bare the fictionality of the characters and thus of the novel itself (which could be classified as critical, direct, fiction-centred metafiction).

=== Jasper Fforde, ''The Eyre Affair'' ===
''[[The Eyre Affair]]'' (2001) is set in an alternate history in which it is possible to enter the world of a work of literature through the use of a machine. In the novel, literary detective [[Thursday Next]] chases a criminal through the world of [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. This paradoxical transgression of narrative boundaries is called [[metalepsis]], an implicitly metafictional device when used in literature. Metalepsis has a high inherent potential to disrupt [[aesthetic illusion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Breaking the Frame: Metalepsis and the Construction of the Subject|last=Malina|first=Debra|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Columbus|pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confronts the reader with the fictionality of the text. However, as metalepsis is used as a plot device that has been introduced as part of the world of ''The Eyre Affair'' it can, in this instance, have the opposite effect and is compatible with immersion. It can thus be seen as an example of metafiction that does not (necessarily) break aesthetic illusion.

'''''Mind and Cosmos: Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature is Almost Certainly False''''' is a 2012 book by the philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]].

==Summary==
Nagel argues that the [[Materialism|materialist]] version of [[evolutionary biology]] is unable to account for the existence of [[mind]] and [[consciousness]], and is therefore at best incomplete. He writes that mind is a basic aspect of nature, and that any philosophy of nature that cannot account for it is fundamentally misguided.&lt;ref&gt;For the argument that mind is a basic aspect of nature, see {{harvnb|Nagel|2012|p=16ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the standard physico-chemical [[reductionist]] account of [[Abiogenesis|the emergence of life]] – that it emerged from a series of accidents, acted upon by the mechanism of [[natural selection]] – flies in the face of common sense.{{sfn|Nagel|2012|pp=5–6}}

Nagel's position is that principles of an entirely different kind may account for the emergence of life, and in particular conscious life, and that those principles may be [[Teleology|teleological]], rather than materialist or mechanistic. He stresses that his argument is not a religious one (he is an atheist), and that it is not based on the theory of [[intelligent design]] (ID), though he also writes that ID proponents such as [[Michael Behe]], [[Stephen C. Meyer]], and [[David Berlinski]] do not deserve the scorn with which their ideas have been met by the overwhelming majority of the scientific establishment.{{sfn|Nagel|2012|p=10}}

==Reception==

The book generated significant criticism, including from [[Steven Pinker]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Elliott Sober]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael|title=Where Thomas Nagel Went Wrong|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Where-Thomas-Nagel-Went-Wrong/139129/|website=The Chronicle Review|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliot. (2012). [http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/remarkable-facts "Remarkable Facts: Ending Science as We Know It"]. ''[[Boston Review]]''. Retrieved July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Chorost]] wrote that Nagel raised valid criticisms but did not sufficiently engage with the large – though not dominant – body of scientific literature related to natural teleology. Chorost also suggests the book would have received less criticism had Nagel not endorsed criticisms raised by proponents of intelligent design, despite Nagel's not having endorsed intelligent design as a solution.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] negatively reviewed the book concluding "he advocates overthrowing things that are precisely defined, extremely robust, and impressively well-tested (the known laws of physics, natural selection) on the basis of ideas that are rather vague and much less well-supported (a conviction that consciousness can’t be explained physically, a demand for intelligibility, moral realism)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/08/22/mind-and-cosmos/ "Mind and Cosmos"].

'''Motivational salience''' is a [[cognitive process]] and a form of [[attention]] that ''motivates'', or propels, an individual's behavior towards or away from a particular [[stimulus (psychology)|object, perceived event, or outcome]].&lt;ref name="Motivational salience"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puglisi-Allegra S, Ventura R | title = Prefrontal/accumbal catecholamine system processes high motivational salience | journal = Front. Behav. Neurosci. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 31 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22754514 | pmc = 3384081 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00031 | quote = Motivational salience regulates the strength of goal seeking, the amount of risk taken, and the energy invested from mild to extreme.&amp;nbsp;... Motivation can be conceptually described as a continuum along which stimuli can either reinforce or punish responses to other stimuli. Behaviorally, stimuli that reinforce are called rewarding and those that punish aversive (Skinner, 1953). Reward and aversion describe the impact a stimulus has on behavior, and provided of motivational properties, thus able to induce attribution of motivational salience.&amp;nbsp;... Attribution of motivational salience is related to the salience of an UCS (Dallman et al., 2003; Pecina et al., 2006). Thus, the more salient an UCS the more likely a neutral (to-be-conditioned) stimulus will be associated with it through motivational salience attribution. Prior experience is a major determinant of the motivational impact of any given stimulus (Borsook et al., 2007) and emotional arousal induced by motivational stimuli increases the attention given to stimuli influencing both the initial perceptual encoding and the consolidation process (Anderson et al., 2006; McGaugh, 2006).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motivational salience regulates the intensity of behaviors that facilitate the attainment of a particular [[goal]], the amount of time and energy that an individual is willing to expend to attain a particular goal, and the [[Risk aversion (psychology)|amount of risk that an individual is willing to accept]] while working to attain a particular goal.&lt;ref name="Motivational salience" /&gt;

Motivational salience is composed of two component processes that are defined by their attractive or aversive effects on an individual's behavior relative to a particular stimulus: ''incentive salience'' and ''aversive salience''.&lt;ref name="Motivational salience" /&gt; '''Incentive salience''' is the attractive form of motivational salience that causes [[approach behavior]], and is associated with [[operant reinforcement]], [[reward system|desirable outcomes, and pleasurable stimuli]].&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultz/&gt; '''Aversive salience''' is the aversive form of motivational salience that causes avoidance behavior, and is associated with [[Punishment (psychology)|operant punishment]], [[aversives|undesirable outcomes, and unpleasant stimuli]].&lt;ref name="Aversive salience"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Koob GF, Moal ML|title=Neurobiology of Addiction|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080497372|page=415|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sjn6I6QMxdwC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;dq=aversive+salience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incentive salience==
{{addiction glossary}}
'''Incentive salience''' is a [[cognitive process]] that confers a "desire" or "want" attribute, which includes a motivational component, to a [[rewarding stimulus]].&lt;ref name="Motivational salience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt; ''Reward'' is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior – also known as approach behavior – and consummatory behavior.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schultz W | year = 2015 | title = Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 853–951 | pmid = 26109341 | pmc = 4491543 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014 | quote = Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.&amp;nbsp;... Rewarding stimuli, objects, events, situations, and activities consist of several major components. First, rewards have basic sensory components (visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, and olfactory)&amp;nbsp;... Second, rewards are salient and thus elicit attention, which are manifested as orienting responses (FIGURE 1, middle). The salience of rewards derives from three principal factors, namely, their physical intensity and impact (physical salience), their novelty and surprise (novelty/surprise salience), and their general motivational impact shared with punishers (motivational salience). A separate form not included in this scheme, incentive salience, primarily addresses dopamine function in addiction and refers only to approach behavior (as opposed to learning)&amp;nbsp;... Third, rewards have a value component that determines the positively motivating effects of rewards and is not contained in, nor explained by, the sensory and attentional components (FIGURE 1, right). This component reflects behavioral preferences and thus is subjective and only partially determined by physical parameters. Only this component constitutes what we understand as a reward. It mediates the specific behavioral reinforcing, approach generating, and emotional effects of rewards that are crucial for the organism's survival and reproduction, whereas all other components are only supportive of these functions.&amp;nbsp;... These emotions are also called liking (for pleasure) and wanting (for desire) in addiction research (471) and strongly support the learning and approach generating functions of reward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "wanting" of incentive salience differs from "liking" in the sense that liking is the [[pleasure]] that is immediately gained from the acquisition or consumption of a rewarding stimulus;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt; the "wanting" of incentive salience serves a "motivational magnet" quality of a rewarding stimulus that makes it a desirable and attractive goal, transforming it from a mere sensory experience into something that commands attention, induces approach, and causes it to be sought out.&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur. J. Neurosci. | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 1124–1143 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22487042 | pmc = 3325516 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.07990.x | quote = Here I discuss how mesocorticolimbic mechanisms generate the motivation component of incentive salience. Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&amp;nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.&amp;nbsp;...  A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS. This is a signature feature of incentive salience.&amp;nbsp;... When a Pavlovian CS+ is attributed with incentive salience it not only triggers ‘wanting’ for its UCS, but often the cue itself becomes highly attractive – even to an irrational degree. This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience.&amp;nbsp;... An attractive CS often elicits behavioral motivated approach, and sometimes an individual may even attempt to ‘consume’ the CS somewhat as its UCS (e.g., eat, drink, smoke, have sex with, take as drug). ‘Wanting’ of a CS can turn also turn the formerly neutral stimulus into an instrumental conditioned reinforcer, so that an individual will work to obtain the cue (however, there exist alternative psychological mechanisms for conditioned reinforcement too).&amp;nbsp;... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed 'wanting' – CS-triggered pulses of intensified 'wanting' for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed 'wanting' – motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt;

Incentive salience is regulated by a number of brain structures, but it is assigned to stimuli by a region of the [[ventral striatum]] known as the [[nucleus accumbens shell]].&lt;ref name="Motivational salience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–148, 367, 376 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory. This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (“wanting”) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt; Incentive salience is primarily regulated by [[dopamine]] neurotransmission in the [[mesocorticolimbic projection]],{{#tag:ref|The mesocorticolimbic projection is a group of [[dopamine pathway]]s that connects the [[ventral tegmental area]] to the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[prefrontal cortex]].|group="note"}}, but activity in other [[dopaminergic pathway]]s and [[hedonic hotspot]]s (e.g., the [[ventral pallidum]]) also modulate incentive salience.&lt;ref name="NAcc function" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–664 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = An important goal in future for addiction neuroscience is to understand how intense motivation becomes narrowly focused on a particular target. Addiction has been suggested to be partly due to excessive incentive salience produced by sensitized or hyper-reactive dopamine systems that produce intense ‘wanting’ (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). But why one target becomes more ‘wanted’ than all others has not been fully explained. In addicts or agonist-stimulated patients, the repetition of dopamine-stimulation of incentive salience becomes attributed to particular individualized pursuits, such as taking the addictive drug or the particular compulsions. In Pavlovian reward situations, some cues for reward become more ‘wanted’ more than others as powerful motivational magnets, in ways that differ across individuals (Robinson et al., 2014b; Saunders and Robinson, 2013).&amp;nbsp;... However, hedonic effects might well change over time. As a drug was taken repeatedly, mesolimbic dopaminergic sensitization could consequently occur in susceptible individuals to amplify ‘wanting’ (Leyton and Vezina, 2013; Lodge and Grace, 2011; Wolf and Ferrario, 2010), even if opioid hedonic mechanisms underwent down-regulation due to continual drug stimulation, producing ‘liking’ tolerance. Incentive-sensitization would produce addiction, by selectively magnifying cue-triggered ‘wanting’ to take the drug again, and so powerfully cause motivation even if the drug became less pleasant (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).| pmc=4425246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chapter 18 – From Experienced Utility to Decision Utility|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124160088000188|publisher = Academic Press|date = 1 January 2014|location = San Diego|isbn = 978-0-12-416008-8|pages = 335–351|first = Kent C.|last = Berridge|first2 = John P.|last2 = O’Doherty|editor-first = Paul W.

Importantly, repeated exposure to rewarding substances sets off a chain of secondary reinforcing events, whereby cues and contexts associated with drug use may themselves become reinforcing and thereby contribute to the continued use and possible abuse of the substance(s) of choice.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug [addiction], cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing&amp;nbsp;... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an “escape” response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of an addiction, the repeated association of otherwise neutral and even non-rewarding [[stimulation|stimuli]] with drug consumption triggers an [[associative learning]] process that causes these previously neutral stimuli to act as [[Reinforcement#Secondary reinforcers|conditioned positive reinforcers]] of addictive drug use (i.e., these stimuli start to function as [[drug cues]]).&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt; As conditioned positive reinforcers of drug use, these previously neutral stimuli are assigned incentive salience (which manifests as a craving)&amp;nbsp;– sometimes at pathologically high levels due to [[reward sensitization]]&amp;nbsp;– which can [[Pavlovian-instrumental transfer|transfer to the primary reinforcer]] (e.g., the use of an addictive drug) with which it was originally paired.&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinforcement in addiction" /&gt; Thus, if an individual remains abstinent from drug use for some time and encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of [[drug paraphernalia]] as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In [[addiction]], the "liking" (pleasure or [[hedonic]] value) of a drug or other stimulus becomes dissociated from "wanting" (i.e., desire or craving) due to the [[Addiction#Reward sensitization|sensitization of incentive salience]].&lt;ref&gt;Berridge, K.C., Robinson, T.E. What is the role of dopamine in reward: hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience? Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 1998 Dec; 28(3):309–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, if the incentive salience associated with drug-taking becomes [[pathological]]ly amplified, the user may want the drug more and more while liking it less and less as [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] develops to the drug's pleasurable effects.&lt;ref name="Pleasure system - incentive sensitization" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4770">In [[Buddhism]], especially the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] ([[Zen]]) traditions, '''non-abidance''' (in [[Sanskrit]]: ''apratiṣṭhita'', with the ''[[privative a|a-]]'' prefix, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} ‘unlimited’, ‘unlocalized’&lt;ref&gt;''Sanskrit-English Dictionary'', by [[M. Monier William]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice of avoiding mental constructs during daily life. That is, other than while engaged in [[meditation]] (''[[Zazen]]'').

Some [[schools of Buddhism]], especially the [[Mahāyāna]], consider ''apratisthita-[[nirvana]]'' ("non-abiding cessation") to be the highest form of [[Bodhi|Buddhahood]], more profound than ''pratiṣṭhita-nirvāṇa'', the ‘localized’, lesser form.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Buswell and Donald Lopez, ''apratisthita-nirvana'' is the standard mahayana view of [[buddhahood]], which enables them to freely return to [[samsara]] in order to help sentient beings, while still remaining in nirvana and being a buddha&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert E; Lopez, Donald S. ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' Princeton University press. Entry: apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa.&lt;/ref&gt; via the usage of [[nirmanakaya]] and [[sambhogakaya]].

== Term ==
Here, ''[[wikt:abide|abide]]''&lt;ref&gt;From [[wikt:abide]]: "To stay; to continue in a place; to remain stable or fixed in some state or condition; to be left."&lt;br&gt;From [[wikt:abidance]]: The sense of 'continuance; dwelling' is older than 'compliance' (19th century).&lt;/ref&gt; is used to translate ''pratiṣṭhita'', meaning "to be contained in [a locale]" or "situated", from the prefix ''prati-'' ('towards', 'in the direction of') and ''ṣṭhita'' ('established', 'set up').&lt;ref&gt;The [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=pratisthita+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU ''Spoken Sanskrit Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

To translate ''pratiṣṭhita'', Chinese Buddhists used ''zhù'' (住), literally "to reside, lodge, remain". Both ''wúsuǒzhù'' (無所住 'no means of staying') and ''wúzhù'' (無住 'not staying')&lt;ref name=Soothill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soothill|first1=W.E.|authorlink1=William Edward Soothill|last2=Hodous|first2=Lewis|authorlink2=Lewis Hodous|title=A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used for ''apratiṣṭhita''.

== Sutras ==

The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', a [[classic book|classic]] Buddhist text, is primarily concerned with the idea of non-abidance. The concept seems to have originated with the 1st-century [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosopher]] [[Nagarjuna]], whose version of ''[[shunyata|śūnyatā]]'', or [[emptiness]], entails that [[entity|entities]] neither exist, nor do they not exist.

Realizing the depth of this concept was also responsible of a Chan master's [[subitism|sudden enlightenment]]. The ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' relates how the spiritual patriarch [[Huineng]] was enlightened after hearing his master [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] reciting from the ''Diamond Sutra'':
{{quote|Responding to ''the non-abiding'', yet generating the mind.&lt;br&gt; (應'''無所住'''，而生其心。 ''Yìng '''wúsuǒzhù''', er sheng qi xin''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =McRae | first =John | year =2000 | title =The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch. Translated from the Chinese of Zongbao |publisher=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research|location=Berkeley| url =http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Translations/PlatformSutra_McRaeTranslation.pdf |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Huineng then responded that [[self-nature]]s are intrinsically pure, cannot be generated or extinguished, are self-sufficient and capable of generating ''[[dharma]]''.
However, this key incident, though found in the majority of texts, is absent in the older [[Dunhuang]] version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=Transmission and Enlightenment in Chan Buddhism Seen Through the ''Platform Sūtra''|journal=Chung-hwa Buddhist Journal|year=2007|issue=20|page=396|location=Taipei|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Transmission_and_Enlightenment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar-monk Qisong (契嵩) also noted in his foreword of the ''Platform Sutra'':
{{quote|
: The formless is the essence. (無相為體 wúxiang wei ti) 
: Non-thought is the tenet. (無念為宗 wúnian wei zong)
: ''Non-abiding'' is the fundamental. ('''無住'''為本 '''wúzhù''' wei ben)}}

Non-abiding leads to ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]'' (wisdom), as it enables one to consider that worldly issues are [[śūnyatā|empty]], so there is no point in retaliation or disputes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Platform Sutra'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10677">The '''Out of Asia theory''' was a [[scientific theory]] which contended that [[modern humans]] first arose in [[Asia]]. Most [[anthropologists]] until the mid 20th century preferred Asia, over Africa, as the continent where the first [[hominids]] evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Sommer ''Bones and ochre: the afterlife of the red lady of Paviland'' Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 283 {{ISBN|978-0674024991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[recent African origin of modern humans]] ("Out of Africa") theory is currently supported by more data.

== History ==

Because of the rise of evolutionary thought in the late 19th century the out of Asia theory gained many new proponents, many of whom believed that the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] would be found in Asia. Scientists such as [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[Eugene Dubois]], [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] and [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] all thought Asia was where the major events of [[evolution]] had occurred.

Ernst Haeckel, the German [[evolutionary biologist]], believed that [[Hindustan]] (South Asia) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved.  Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin's hypothesis of [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Palmer, ''Prehistoric past: The four billion year history of life on earth'', University of California Press; 1 edition, 2006, p. 43 {{ISBN|978-0520248274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Regal ''Human evolution, a guide to the debates'', [[ABC-CLIO]], 2004, p. 73-75 {{ISBN|978-1851094189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haeckel later claimed that the missing link was to be found on the [[lost continent of Lemuria]] located in the [[Indian Ocean]].  He believed that Lemuria was the home of the first humans, that Asia was the home of many of the earliest [[primates]], and thus Asia was the cradle of hominin evolution.  Haeckel also claimed that Lemuria connected Asia and Africa which allowed the migration of humans to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J Norton, David R Braun. ''Asian Paleoanthropology: From Africa to China and beyond'', Springer; 1st Edition, 2010, p. 4 {{ISBN|978-9048190935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario A. Di Gregorio, ''From here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and the scientific faith'', [[Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht]], 2005  p. 480 {{ISBN|978-3525569726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Dubois]], a Dutch [[paleoanthropologist]] and proponent of the out of Asia theory, discovered the skeletal remains of the first representative ''[[Homo erectus]]'' found in Java in 1891 on the banks of [[Solo River]], [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The find later became known as [[Java man]].&lt;ref&gt;Bert Theunissen, ''Eugène Dubois and the ape-men from Java: The history of the first missing link and its discoverer'', Springer; 1 edition, 1988, {{ISBN|978-1556080814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peking Man Skull (replica) presented at Paleozoological Museum of China.jpg|thumb|Replica of ''Homo erectus'' ("Peking man") skull from China.]]

Later, the discovery of [[Peking man]] persuaded anthropologists up until the 1930s that Asia was most likely the cradle of the human species.&lt;ref&gt;Aedeen Cremin, ''The World Encyclopedia of Archaeology: The World's Most Significant Sites and Cultural Treasures'', Firefly Books, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1554073115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Boyd Dawkins]] wrote that the tropical region of Asia was "the probable birthplace of the human race". The British anthropologist [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] wrote "There is reason to believe that mankind did not originate in Africa; but that all the main races in that continent reached it from Southern Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Corbey, [[Wil Roebroeks]]. ''Studying Human Origins: disciplinary history and epistemology'', Amsterdam University Press; 1 edition, 2001, p. 48 {{ISBN|978-9053564646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Eugene Dubois, very few of the early human origin theorists actually visited Asia to see if their ideas were valid or not. This changed in the 1920s as a well-funded expedition was carried out in Asia called '''The Central Asiatic Expeditions'''.  The expedition, led by Roy Chapman Andrews, visited parts of Central Asia including [[China]] and [[Mongolia]] to search for the origins of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Expeditions|first=Central Asiatic|last2=Chapman,|first2=Andrews, Roy|last3=Diller,|first3=Matthew, William|date=2000-01-01|title=Central Asiatic Expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History, under the leadership of Roy Chapman Andrews :|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44810#page/8/mode/1up|volume=1918-1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleontologists who believed humans originated in Asia also include [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]], [[Otto Zdansky]] and [[Walter W. Granger]]. All three of these scientists were known for visiting China and for their work and discoveries by excavating the sites at [[Zhoukoudian]] that yielded remains of so-called [[Peking man]] (''Homo erectus pekinensis''). Further funding for the excavations was carried out by [[Davidson Black]] a key proponent of the out of Asia theory. Because of the finds in Zhoukoudian, such as Peking Man, the focus of paleoanthropological research moved entirely to Asia, up until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Corbey, Wil Roebroeks. ''Studying Human Origins: disciplinary history and epistemology'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The explorer [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] along with [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] led several expeditions to North China and Mongolia from 1922 to 1928 known as the "Central Asiatic Expeditions" setting out to try to find the earliest human remains in Asia, however Andrews and his team found many other finds, such as [[dinosaur]] bones and fossil mammals and most notably the first known dinosaur nests full of eggs. Andrews' main account of these expeditions can be found in his book ''The New Conquest of Central Asia''.&lt;ref&gt;''Horns, tusks, and flippers: the evolution of hoofed mammals'', [[Donald R. Prothero]], [[Robert M. Schoch]] p. 119, also see ''Men and dinosaurs: the search in field and laboratory'', [[Edwin Harris Colbert]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Andrews' 1926 book ''On the Trail of the Ancient Man'', Henry Fairfield Osborn noted in the preface that the birthplace of modern humans would be found in Asia and that he had predicted it decades earlier even before the Asiatic expeditions were carried out. Another key proponent of the out of Asia theory of this era was [[William Diller Matthew]] who also took part in the Central Asiatic expeditions; Matthew was well known for his deeply influential 1915 article "Climate and evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1914.tb55346.x |last=Matthew |first=W. D. |year=1915 |title=Climate and Evolution |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=171–318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew's theory was that climate change was how organisms came to live where we find them today in opposition to the theory of [[continental drift]]. His basic premise was that cyclical changes in global climate along with the prevailing tendency for mammals to disperse from north to south account for the odd geographic patterns of living mammals, he believed that humans and many other groups of modern mammals first evolved in the northern areas of the globe, especially central Asia because of the shifting climatic circumstances, Matthew firmly placed hominid origins in central Asia as he claimed that the high plateaux of [[Tibet]] was the forcing ground of mammalian evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Corbey, Wil Roebroeks. ''Studying human origins, disciplinary history and epistemology'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Later defenders of the out of Asia theory included Henry Fairfield Osborn, [[Davidson Black]], and William King Gregory. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] was best known for his [[Dawn Man theory]] of human origins which he wrote would be found in Tibet and Mongolia. Osborn firmly believed that Asia had been the cradle of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[K. Christopher Beard]], ''The Hunt for the Dawn Monkey: Unearthing the Origins of Monkeys, Apes, and Humans'', University of California Press; 1 edition, 2004 {{ISBN|0520233697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson Black writing a paper in 1925 titled ''Asia and the dispersal of primates'' wrote that the origins of man were to be found in Tibet, British India, the [[Yung-Ling]], and the [[Tarim Basin of China]]. His last paper published in 1934 before his death argued for human origins in an Eastern Asian context. [[William King Gregory]] also wrote that the [[Tarim Desert]] is the most likely place for human origins.&lt;ref&gt;''Studying human origins, disciplinary history and epistemology'', Raymond Corbey, Wil Roebroeks, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald|Von Koenigswald]] who found the first ''[[Gigantopithecus]]'' tooth in [[Hong Kong]] in 1935, continued to support the out of Asia theory.&lt;ref&gt;Schmalzer, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

The out of Asia theory later fell into decline, one of the reasons was because [[Franz Weidenreich]] merged the Asia hypothesis into the [[multiregional origin of modern humans]], extending many other regions into his theory from the Old World with [[gene flow]] between various populations which influenced many anthropologists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Sigrid Schmalzer ''The people's Peking man, popular science and human identity in twentieth-century China'' University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 252 {{ISBN|978-0226738604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franz Weidenreich ''Apes, Giants, and Man'' Univ of Chicago Pr, 1946 {{ISBN|978-0226881478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last support for the out of Asia theory was due to the finds of fossils such as the ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' and ''[[Ramapithecus]]'' in Eurasia up until the early 1980s. One of the last advocates of the out of Asia theory was [[Jia Lanpo]] who argued that the cradle of humanity had been in Southwest China, up until his death in 2001. Scholar Sigrid Schmalzer in her book ''The People's Peking man'' claims the only modern advocates of the out of Asia theory have their beliefs firmly rooted in [[Chinese Nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmalzer pp. 246-286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent revival==
There are still claims in favor of Out of Asia from modern [[molecular genetics]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuan|first=Dejian|last2=Lei|first2=Xiaoyun|last3=Gui|first3=Yuanyuan|last4=Zhu|first4=Zuobin|last5=Wang|first5=Dapeng|last6=Yu|first6=Jun|last7=Huang|first7=Shi|date=2018-05-01|title=Modern human origins: multiregional evolution of autosomes and East Asia origin of Y and mtDNA|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/01/101410|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=101410|doi=10.1101/101410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12482">Neglect is defined as giving little attention to or to leave undone or unattended to, especially through carelessness. Mortuary neglect can comprise many things, such as bodies being stolen from the morgue, or bodies being mixed up and the wrong one was buried. When a mortuary fails to preserve a body correctly, it could also be considered neglect because of the consequences.

[[Insect indicators of abuse or neglect|Patient neglect]] is similar to mortuary neglect with one major difference: that patient neglect has to do with people who are still living and that neglect could ultimately lead to their death. Patient neglect concerns people in hospitals, in nursing homes, or being cared for in home. Usually in nursing homes or home-assisted living, neglect would consist of patients being left lying in their own urine and/or feces, which could, in turn, possibly attract flesh flies and lead to maggot infestation. It also encompasses patients getting rashes, [[lice]], and other sores from being improperly cared for.&lt;ref&gt;Arnoldi, Kyle. "Noncompliance vs. Medical Neglect." ''American Orthopedic Journal'' 2007: 137-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of mortuary neglect and the law ==
The general sign of mortuary neglect (in terms of forensic entomology) is an infestation of maggots or some other insect (such as cockroaches) of a corpse. This should not be confused with insects found on a body before they are transferred to the morgue.  The following examples are forms of mortuary neglect that pertain to the ethical treatment of a corpse.

=== Improper embalming === 
Improper embalming is the utilization of embalming techniques that cause premature decomposition of the body especially in cases where the body in question is to be presented in an open-casket funeral. In addition, not refrigerating the body immediately following death, but before the embalming process could lead to rapid deterioration of the human remains as well.

==== Washington v. John T. Rhines Co. ====
On August 29, 1994, widow Marian Washington filed suit against funeral home, John T. Rhines Co., for improperly embalming her late husband Vernon W. Washington. She claimed that the embalming fluid was leaking and that her husband’s skin was decomposing at an alarming rate. John T. Rhines Co. re-embalmed Mr. Washington in efforts to make his body presentable. However, they failed to restore Mr. Washington’s body completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail37860/Page1.htm "Washington V. John T. Rhines Co."] National Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. 2005. 10 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cooley v. State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers ====
On May 3, 1956, Cooley, a petitioner of a particular funeral home tried to appeal the revoke of his license by the California state board of funeral directors and embalmers. The case reveals the reasons as to why the license was revoked. Cooley’s practices were described as unsanitary for the following reasons: an infant was discovered improperly embalmed after maggots were seeping out of its orifices, commingling of bodies, blood stains were found on the walls, and tools used were not cleaned from one autopsy to the next. Needless to say, the appeal was not granted.&lt;ref&gt;"Cooley V. State Bd. of Funeral Directors and Embalmers." Texas A&amp;M Database Search (1987): 293-296. Westlaw. Texas A&amp;M. 13 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fencing stolen organs  ===
This form of abuse consists of selling body parts stolen from carcasses that are sent to the morgue for embalming.

=== Commingling of ashes ===
Commingling of ashes is putting several carcasses in the same crematorium during the same burn cycle. This act undermines the respect due a passed loved one.

=== Unauthorized disposal ===
In this form of abuse, funeral home operators dispose of the body in a manner not authorized by the deceased’s loved ones.

==== Christensen v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County ====
On June 28, 1990, a court heard a case on a class action suit against multiple funeral service operators. These acts included all of the types of mortuary neglect mentioned above in this section. The case contended that the defendants violated conscionable standards regarding the treatment of the deceased.  This practice occurred for nearly a decade and victimized approximately 17,000 decedents and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napil.com/PersonalInjuryCaseLawDetail38312/Page20.htm "Christensen V. Superior Court of Los Angeles County."] National Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. 2005. 10 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical treatment of the deceased ===
Any violation of the standards that any reasonable person would expect of a Mortuary operator could be considered in this category.

====Dennis v. Robbins Funeral Home====
James Dennis, widower of Molly Dennis, sued Robbins Funeral Home on August 24, 1987. Before Mrs. Dennis was to be cremated, Lee Miller, the funeral director of Robbins Funeral Home called the family to see the body. When the family arrived, to their dismay, they found Molly Dennis’s body unprofessionally presented in an unhygienic environment as unspecified limbs were hanging off the dissection table and into a dirty sink. Mr. Dennis was not, however, able to successfully sue the funeral home because the judicial history in the area did not include a precedent for funeral home malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;"Dennis v. Robbins Funeral Home." Texas A&amp;M Database Search (1987): 698-701. Westlaw. Texas A&amp;M. 13 Apr. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Funeral Directors Association==
The National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) is an organization in the United States that regulates mortuaries and morgues and their activities regarding the [[embalming]] and interring of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfda.org/missionhistorystructure.php National Funeral Directors Association Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152454/http://nfda.org/missionhistorystructure.php |date=2008-05-10 }} National Funeral Directors Association. 13 Mar. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  With any complaint including mortuary neglect, the NFDA has a fifteen step disciplinary process it goes through to determine the severity of the situation. After receiving a complaint, a committee reviews the situation even to the extent of an investigation and then they determine the consequences of the violation. Those considered in violation of the NFDA’s policies could face punitive action ranging from a warning to suspension from the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfda.org/files/2003FaxBackPDFs/Membership/9506_CodeofProfessionalConductEnforcement.pdf NFDA Code of Professional Conduct.]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} National Funeral Directors Association.

== Trends ==
There are certain segments of the health care industry that are seeing downward moves in neglect, while other sections are experiencing unfortunate growth.  In modern hospitals the most prevalent form of neglect deals with the patients themselves neglecting their own care.  However, in other segments such as assisted living for mentally deficient patients the rates of abuse and neglect are still relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Graham. "Patients at Risk of Neglect in Mental Health Trusts" ''Nursing Standard'' 7 Jan. 2004: 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortuary neglect is another segment that has peculiar trends. There are relatively few morticians that just refuse to perform their duties. However, cases of ethically questionable practices can be easily found. Morticians only preserving visible body parts, incomplete embalming and defrauding families are just a few examples of reported cases of neglect.

Increasingly medical journals are recommending that doctors become more active in attempting to persuade parents and guardians of children to either accept or continue treatment for diseases or injuries in order to avoid a neglect case.  In the American Orthopedic Journal a case study was presented where a doctor suggested that an effort to convince a girl's mother to adequately treat a case of [[ambylopia]] to avoid potential neglect.  While a viewpoint arguing this was unnecessary, it shows a growing trend to go beyond traditional measures to avoid neglect charges.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, Jane N. "Avoiding Charges of Fraud and Abuse: Developing and Implementing an Effective Compliance Program." ''Journal of Nursing Administration'' Dec. 2004: 546.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From the times of the ancient [[Egyptians]], cases of mortuary neglect have been recorded. The process of [[embalming]] is to preserve the dead for burial, as the Egyptians believed the afterlife was just as important as life itself. However, if a woman was married to an embalmer, he would likely keep her preserved for his own benefit until obvious [[decomposition]] took place.

Dignity for the dead is now a [[legal]] matter, as patient neglect has always been. Abuse in the healthcare system is another huge problem in today’s society. Nursing homes and hospitals are preying grounds for predators of the weak and disabled. In 2001 a nursing home in Ossining, New York was closed because of neglect and unsafe conditions that existed for the patients.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Katherine. "Nursing Home Shuts Down After U.S. Finding of Danger." ''New York Times'' [New York City] 23 August 2001: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==US state laws==
For the most part, mortuary standards are created by the states, not by the federal government. The following are links to state policies (where available) on mortuary practices:

&lt;!--Although it has features of a disambiguation page, this page currently serves also as an introduction to the general concept of "Pneuma" in a way not covered by any of the individual articles. It should be considered as under development --&gt;

'''Pneuma''' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:πνεῦμα|πνεῦμα]]}}) is an [[ancient Greek]] word for "[[breathing|breath]]", and in a religious context for "[[spirit]]" or "[[soul]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpneu%3Dma Entry πνεῦμα], in Liddell-Scott-Jones, [[A Greek–English Lexicon]], online version.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See pp.190, 195, 205 of {{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has various technical meanings for medical writers and philosophers of [[classical antiquity]], particularly in regard to physiology, and is also used in Greek translations of  ''ruach'' [[:wikt:רוח|רוח]]  in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]]. 
In classical philosophy, it is distinguishable from ''[[Psyche (psychology)#Etymology|psyche]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ψυχή|ψυχή]]}}), which originally meant "breath of life", but is regularly translated as "[[spirit]]" or most often "[[soul#Philosophical views|soul]]".&lt;ref name="Furley1999"/&gt;

==Classical antiquity==

===Presocratics===
''Pneuma'', "air in motion, breath, wind," is equivalent in the [[material monism]] of [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] to ''aer'' (ἀήρ, "air") as the element from which all else originated. This usage is the earliest extant occurrence of the term in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Benso, "The Breathing of the Air: Presocratic Echoes in Levinas," in ''Levinas and the Ancients'' (Indiana University Press, 2008), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; A quotation from Anaximenes observes that "just as our soul ''(psyche)'', being air ''(aer)'', holds us together, so do breath ''(pneuma)'' and air ''(aer)'' encompass the whole world." In this early usage, ''aer'' and ''pneuma'' are synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Benso, "The Breathing of the Air," p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek medical theory===
{{See also|Pneumatic school}}
In [[ancient Greek medicine]], ''pneuma'' is the form of circulating [[Air (classical element)|air]] necessary for the systemic functioning of vital organs. It is the material that sustains [[consciousness]] in a body. According to [[Diocles of Carystus|Diocles]] and [[Praxagoras]], the psychic pneuma mediates between the [[heart]], regarded as the seat of [[Mind]] in some [[physiology|physiological]] theories of ancient medicine, and the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. van der Eijk, "The Heart, the Brain, the Blood and the ''pneuma'': [[Hippocrates]], Diocles and [[Aristotle]] on the Location of Cognitive Processes," in ''Medicine and Philosophy in [[Classical Antiquity]]: Doctors and Philosophers on Nature, Soul, Health and Disease'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 131–132 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Aesg-6eBWCYC&amp;dq=pneuma+intitle%3AMedicine+intitle%3Aand+intitle%3Aphilosophy+intitle%3Ain+intitle%3Aclassical+intitle%3Aantiquity&amp;q=pneuma#v=snippet&amp;q=pneuma&amp;f=false et passim.]'' {{ISBN|0-521-81800-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disciples of [[Hippocrates]] explained the maintenance of [[vital heat]] to be the function of the breath within the organism. Around 300 BC, [[Praxagoras]] discovered the distinction between the [[arteries]] and the [[veins]]. In the corpse arteries are empty; hence, in the light of these preconceptions they were declared to be vessels for conveying ''pneuma'' to the different parts of the body. A generation afterwards, [[Erasistratus]] made this the basis of a new theory of [[disease]]s and their treatment. The ''pneuma'', inhaled from the outside air, rushes through the arteries till it reaches the various centres, especially the [[brain]] and the [[heart]], and there causes thought and organic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |last=Hicks |first=Robert Drew |wstitle=Stoics |volume=25 |pages=942–951 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{See also|Spontaneous generation#Aristotle|On Breath}}
The "connate pneuma" of [[Aristotle]] is the warm mobile "air" that in the sperm transmits the capacity for locomotion and certain sensations to the offspring. These movements derive from the soul of the parent and are embodied by the ''pneuma'' as a material substance in semen. ''Pneuma'' is necessary for life, and as in medical theory is involved with the "vital heat," but the Aristotelian ''pneuma'' is less precisely and thoroughly defined than that of the Stoics.&lt;ref name="Furley1999"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.J. |last=Furley |year=1999 |title=From Aristotle to Augustine |series=History of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-06002-8 |lccn=98008543 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZnizDaJz5EC&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;pg=PA29 |page=29 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoic ''pneuma''===
{{Main|Pneuma (Stoic)}}
In [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]], ''pneuma'' is the concept of the "breath of life," a mixture of the [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|elements]] air (in motion) and fire (as warmth).&lt;ref&gt;"Stoicism," ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Stoics, ''pneuma'' is the active, generative principle that organizes both the individual and the [[cosmos]].&lt;ref&gt;David Sedley, "[[Stoicism#Stoic physics and cosmology|Stoic Physics]] and [[Metaphysics]]," ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; In its highest form, ''pneuma'' constitutes the human soul (''psychê''), which is a fragment of the ''pneuma'' that is the soul of God ([[Zeus]]). As a force that structures [[matter]], it exists even in inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'' (University of California Press, 2006), pp. 98-104.&lt;/ref&gt; In his Introduction to the 1964 book ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Cleanthes]], wishing to give more explicit meaning to [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno's]] 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 &lt;!--|ISBN=978-0-140-44140-6 --&gt; |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Judaism and Christianity==
{{See also|Soul in the Bible}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
In [[Judaism|Judaic]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] usage, ''pneuma'' is a common word for "spirit" in the [[Septuagint]] and the Greek New Testament. At John 3:5, for example, ''pneuma'' is the Greek word translated into English as "spirit": "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit (pneuma), he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." In some translations such as the King James version, however, ''pneuma'' is then translated as "wind" in verse eight, followed by the rendering "Spirit": "The wind (pneuma) bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit (pneuma)."

[[Philo]], a 1st-century [[Hellenistic Jewish]] philosopher commented on the use of {{lang|grc|Πνοή}}, rather then {{lang|grc|πνευμα}}, in the [[Septuagint]] translation of {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Genesis|chapter=2|verse=7}}. Philo explains that, in his view, ''pneuma'' is for the light breathing of human men while the stronger ''pnoē''  was used for the divine Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wm. B.

'''Pratyaksha''' is one of the three principal means of knowledge, it means that which is present before the eyes clear, distinct and evident.
   '''PRATYKSHA'
'''प्रत्यक्षा माँ दुर्गा का १०८ वा नाम है''' - जिसका मतलब आप जिसके बारे में सोचती है वो आप के समुख हो. और प्रत्यक्षा का मतलब ज्ञान से भी लियागया है


==Meaning==
'''PRATYKSHA &amp; Pratyaksha Both are different Meaning (प्रत्यक्षा &amp;  प्रत्यक्ष)'''

'''Pratyaksha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रत्यक्ष [[IAST]]: pratyakṣa) literally means that which is perceptible to the eye or visible, in general usage it refers to being present, present before the eye i.e. within the range of sight, cognizable by any sense organ, distinct, evident, clear, direct, immediate, explicit, express, corporeal; it is a Pramana, mode of proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=185|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.apte.238764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyaya]] School recognizes ''Pratyaksha'' (perception) as a kind of ''[[pramana]]'' along with ''[[Anumana]]'' (inference), ''Upamana'' (comparison) and [[Shabda]] (verbal testimony); this school recognizes these four kinds only. The [[Sankhya]] School does not recognize ''Upamana'' as a ''pramana''.  To these four auxiliaries which help illuminate things the [[Vedantins]] and the Mimamsakas also add ''[[Anupalabdhi]]'' (non-apprehension) and ''Arthapatti'' (presumption)as valid ''pramanas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of knowledge==

''Pratyaksha'' is one of the three principal means of knowledge. The three principal means of knowledge are – 1) ''Anumana'', inference from data, which depends for its value on the possession of the right data, on the right observation of the data including the drawing of the right analogies, the unerring perception of true identity and rejection of false identity, the just estimate of difference and contrast, and on the power of right reasoning from the right data; 2) ''Pratyaksha'' which is the process of collecting and knowing the data, and 3) ''Aptavakya'' which is evidence, the testimony of men in possession of the sought after knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publications|page=337|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f4XsuPPjQlIC&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VhfGU_CONZK2uASs-YEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

''Pratyaksha'' refers to the faculties of perception with which are connected thoughts (''[[Chinta (mentation)|Chinta]]''), imagination (''Kalpana'') and volition (''Praytna''), which four together as ''Chetas'' illuminate the ''[[Mind|Manas]]'', the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, and give awareness or consciousness (''Chetna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Encyclopaedia|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publications|page=5839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDh2WjvLo7gC&amp;pg=PA5839&amp;dq=chinta+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wtRHU6LbFMaxrgfM94HAAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are four types of valid perceptions – a) ''Indriya pratyaksha'' or sense perception, b) ''Manas pratyaksha'' or mental perception, c) ''Svavedana pratyaksha'' or self-consciousness, and d) ''Yoga pratyaksha'' or super normal intuition. In sense perception, which is an indeterminate perception the ''chittashakti'' (intelligence-energy) acts as the substratum of the senses. Mental perception arises when ''chittashakti'', with the aid of ''[[Buddhi]]'', reflects upon objects of senses, and is a determinate perception. Self-consciousness arises when, directed by the ''[[tattvas]]'' or ''panchakoshas'', ''raga'' (attachment), ''vidya'' (knowledge), ''niyati'' (order of things), ''kala'' (time) and ''kalpa'' (the elements) along with pleasure and pain become objects of knowledge to chit, the intelligence of the self.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22395">The '''Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model''', or '''Ramsey growth model''', is a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] model of [[economic growth]] based primarily on the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frank P. |last=Ramsey |title=A Mathematical Theory of Saving |journal=[[Economic Journal]] |volume=38 |issue=152 |year=1928 |pages=543–559 |doi= |jstor=2224098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with significant extensions by [[David Cass]] and [[Tjalling Koopmans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Cass |title=Optimum Growth in an Aggregative Model of Capital Accumulation |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=1965 |pages=233–240 |jstor=2295827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koopmans |first=T. C. |year=1965 |chapter=On the Concept of Optimal Economic Growth |title=The Economic Approach to Development Planning |location=Chicago |publisher=Rand McNally |pages=225–287 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model differs from the [[Solow–Swan model]] in that the choice of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] is explicitly [[Microfoundations|microfounded]] at a point in time and so endogenizes the [[saving|savings rate]]. As a result, unlike in the Solow–Swan model, the saving rate may not be constant along the transition to the long run [[steady state]]. Another implication of the model is that the outcome is [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto optimal]] or [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This result is due not just to the endogeneity of the saving rate but also because of the infinite nature of the planning horizon of the agents in the model; it does not hold in other models with endogenous saving rates but more complex intergenerational dynamics, for example, in [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] or [[Peter Diamond|Diamond's]] [[overlapping generations model]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Ramsey set out the model as a central planner's problem of maximizing levels of consumption over successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David A. |last=Collard |chapter=Ramsey, saving and the generations |title=Generations of Economists |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |chapterurl={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B4MG8XzM3qYC |page=256 }} |isbn=978-0-415-56541-7 |pages=256–273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only later was a model adopted by Cass and Koopmans as a description of a decentralized dynamic economy. The Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model aims only at explaining long-run economic growth rather than business cycle fluctuations, and does not include any sources of disturbances like market imperfections, heterogeneity among households, or exogenous [[Shock (economics)|shocks]]. Subsequent researchers therefore extended the model, allowing for government-purchases shocks, variations in employment, and other sources of disturbances, which is known as [[real business cycle theory]].

The blue line represents the dynamic adjustment (or saddle) path of the economy in which all the constraints present in the model are satisfied. It is a stable path of the dynamic system. The red lines represent dynamic paths which are ruled out by the transversality condition.]]
The Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model starts with an [[aggregate production function]] that satisfies the [[Inada conditions]], often specified to be of [[Cobb–Douglas]] type, &lt;math&gt;F(K, L)&lt;/math&gt;, with factors capital &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and labour &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Since this production function is assumed to be [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree 1]], one can express it in ''[[per capita]]'' terms, &lt;math&gt;F(K, L) = L\cdot F(\frac{K}{L}, 1) = L\cdot f(k)&lt;/math&gt;. The amount of labour is equal to the population in the economy, and grows at a constant rate &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;L = L_{0} e^{nt}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L_{0} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; was the population in the initial period. 

The first key equation of the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model is the state equation for capital accumulation:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{k} =f(k) - (n + \delta)k - c&lt;/math&gt;

a non-linear differential equation akin to the [[Solow–Swan model]], where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[capital intensity]] (i.e., [[capital (economics)|capital]] per worker), &lt;math&gt;\dot{k}&lt;/math&gt; is change in capital intensity over time &lt;math&gt;\left( \tfrac{dk}{dt} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is consumption per worker, &lt;math&gt;f(k)&lt;/math&gt; is output per worker for a given &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\delta\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Depreciation (economics)|depreciation]] rate of capital. Under the simplifying assumption that there is no population growth, this equation states that [[investment]], or increase in [[capital (economics)|capital]] per worker is that part of output which is not consumed, minus the rate of depreciation of capital. Investment is, therefore, the same as [[saving]]s.

The second equation of the model is the solution to the [[social planner]]'s problem of maximizing a [[social welfare function]], &lt;math&gt;U_{0} = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} U(C) \, \mathrm{d} t&lt;/math&gt;, that consists of the stream of [[Exponential discounting|exponentially discounted]] instantaneous [[utility]] from consumption, where &lt;math&gt;\rho \in (0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Intertemporal choice|discount rate]] reflecting [[time preference]]. It is assumed that the economy is populated by identical individuals, such that the [[optimal control]] problem can be stated in terms of an infinitely-lived [[Agent (economics)|representative agent]] with time-invariant utility: &lt;math&gt;U(C) = L u(c) = L_{0} e^{nt} u(c)&lt;/math&gt;. The utility function is assumed to be strictly increasing (i.e., there is no [[Bliss point (economics)|bliss point]]) and concave in &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\lim_{c \to 0} u_{c} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is short-hand notation for the [[marginal utility]] of consumption &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial u}{\partial c}&lt;/math&gt;. Normalizing the initial population &lt;math&gt;L_{0}&lt;/math&gt; to one, the problem can be stated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\max_{c} U_{0} = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-(\rho - n) t} u(c) \, \mathrm{d} t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{subject to} \quad c = f(k) - (n + \delta)k - \dot{k}&lt;/math&gt;
where an initial non-zero capital stock &lt;math&gt;k(0) = k_{0} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is given. Solving this problem, for instance by converting it into a [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian function]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Hamiltonian for the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans problem is
:&lt;math&gt;H = e^{-\rho t} u(c) + \mu \left[ f(k) - (n + \delta) k - c \right]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Costate equation|costate variable]] usually economically interpreted as the [[shadow price]]. Because the terminal value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is free but may not be negative, a [[Transversality (mathematics)|transversality condition]] &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \to \infty} \mu \cdot k = 0&lt;/math&gt; similar to the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Karush–Kuhn–Tucker “complementary slackness” condition]] is required. From the first-order conditions for maximization of the Hamiltonian one can derive the equation of motion for consumption, see {{cite book |first=Brian S. |last=Ferguson |first2=G. C. |last2=Lim |title=Introduction to Dynamic Economic Models |location= |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-7190-4997-0 |pages=174–175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmCAmgEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA174 |postscript=none }}, or {{cite book |first=Giancarlo |last=Gandolfo |authorlink=Giancarlo Gandolfo |title=Economic Dynamics |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |edition=3rd |year=1996 |isbn=3-540-60988-1 |pages=381–384 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMwXi67nhHQC&amp;pg=PA381 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The problem can also be solved with classical [[calculus of variations]] methods, see {{cite book |first=G. |last=Hadley |first2=M. C. |last2=Kemp |title=Variational Methods in Economics |location=New York |publisher=Elsevier |year=1971 |isbn=0-444-10097-0 |pages=50–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqujBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; yields a non-linear differential equation that describes the optimal evolution of consumption,
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{c} = - \frac{u_{c}(c)}{c \cdot u_{cc}(c)} \left[ f_{k}(k) - \delta - \rho \right] \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;
which is known as the [[Keynes–Ramsey rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Olivier Jean |last=Blanchard |first2=Stanley |last2=Fischer |title=Lectures on Macroeconomics |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-262-02283-4 |pages=41–43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_zs7htz9moC&amp;pg=PA41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &lt;math&gt;f_{k}(k) - \delta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is short-hand notation for the [[marginal product of capital]] &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial k}&lt;/math&gt;, reflects the marginal return on [[net investment]]. The expression &lt;math&gt;- \left. u_{c}(c) \right/ c \cdot u_{cc}(c)&lt;/math&gt; reflects the [[curvature]] of the utility function; its [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] is known as the (intertemporal) [[elasticity of substitution]] and indicates how much the representative agent wishes to [[Consumption smoothing|smooth consumption]] over time. It is assumed that this elasticity is a positive constant, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\sigma = - \left. c \cdot u_{cc}(c) \right/ u_{c}(c) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Together both differential equations describe the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans [[dynamical system]]. The [[steady state]], which is found by setting &lt;math&gt;\dot k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot c&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero, is given by the pair &lt;math&gt;(k^{\ast}, c^{\ast})&lt;/math&gt; implicitly defined by
:&lt;math&gt; f_{k} \left( k^{\ast} \right) = \delta + \rho \quad \text{and} \quad c^{\ast} = f \left( k^{\ast} \right) - (n + \delta) k^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt;
The equilibrium has [[saddle point]] property as can be seen from the phase diagram. By the [[Hartman–Grobman theorem]] the non-linear system is [[Topological conjugacy|topologically equivalent]] to a linearization of the system about &lt;math&gt;(k^{\ast}, c^{\ast})&lt;/math&gt; by a first-order [[Taylor polynomial]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \dot{(k - k^{\ast})} \\ \dot{(c - c^{\ast})} \end{bmatrix} \approx \mathbf{J}(k^{\ast}, c^{\ast}) \begin{bmatrix} (k - k^{\ast}) \\ (c - c^{\ast}) \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}(k^{\ast}, c^{\ast})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] evaluated at steady state,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Jacobian matrix of the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans system is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} \left( k, c \right) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial \dot{k}}{\partial k} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{k}}{\partial c} \\ \frac{\partial \dot{c}}{\partial k} &amp; \frac{\partial \dot{c}}{\partial c} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} f_{k}(k) - (n + \delta) &amp; -1 \\ \frac{1}{\sigma} f_{kk}(k) \cdot c &amp; \frac{1}{\sigma} \left[ f_{k}(k) - \delta - \rho \right] \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} \left( k^{\ast}, c^{\ast} \right) = \begin{bmatrix} \rho - n &amp; -1 \\ \frac{1}{\sigma} f_{kk}(k) \cdot c^{\ast} &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
which has [[determinant]] &lt;math&gt;\left| \mathbf{J} \left( k^{\ast}, c^{\ast} \right) \right| = \frac{1}{\sigma} f_{kk}(k) \cdot c^{\ast} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is always positive, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is positive by assumption, and only &lt;math&gt;f_{kk}&lt;/math&gt; is negative since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Concave function|concave]]. Since the determinant equals the product of the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]], the eigenvalues must be real and opposite in sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Beavis |first2=Ian |last2=Dobbs |title=Optimization and Stability Theory for Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-33605-8 |page=157 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7HMACFgnXMC&amp;pg=PA157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hence by the [[stable manifold theorem]], the equilibrium is a [[saddle point]] and there exists a unique stable arm, or “saddle path”, that converges on the equilibrium, indicated by the blue curve in the phase diagram. The system is called “saddle path stable” since all unstable trajectories are ruled out by the “no [[Ponzi scheme]]” condition:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Terry L. |last=Roe |first2=Rodney B. W. |last2=Smith |first3=D. Sirin |last3=Saracoglu |title=Multisector Growth Models: Theory and Application |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-387-77358-2 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NzlllN-OAIC&amp;pg=PA48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \to \infty} k \cdot e^{- \int_{0}^{t} \left( f_{k} - n - \delta \right) \mathrm{d} s } \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;
implying that the [[present value]] of the capital stock cannot be negative.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It can be shown that the “no Ponzi scheme” condition follows from the transversality condition on the Hamiltonian, see {{cite book |first1= Robert J. |last1= Barro |authorlink1=Robert J.

Spear and Young re-examine the history of optimal growth during the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S1365100513000291| title = Optimum Savings and Optimal Growth: The Cass–Malinvaud–Koopmans Nexus| journal = Macroeconomic Dynamics| volume = 18| issue = 1| pages = 215–243| year = 2014| last1 = Spear | first1 = S. E.| last2 = Young | first2 = W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing in part on the veracity of the claimed simultaneous and independent development of Cass' "Optimum growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation" (published in 1965 in the ''[[Review of Economic Studies]]''), and Tjalling Koopman's "On the concept of optimal economic growth" (published in Study Week on the Econometric Approach to Development Planning, 1965, Rome: Pontifical Academy of Science).

Over their lifetimes, neither Cass nor Koopmans ever suggested that their results characterizing optimal growth in the one-sector, continuous-time growth model were anything other than "simultaneous and independent".  That the issue of priority ever became a discussion point was due only to the fact that in the published version of Koopmans' work, he cited the chapter from Cass' thesis that later became the ''RES'' paper.  In his paper, Koopmans states in a footnote that Cass independently obtained conditions similar to what Koopmans finds, and that Cass also considers the limiting case where the discount rate goes to zero in his paper.  For his part, Cass notes that "after the original version of this paper was completed, a very similar analysis by Koopmans came to our attention. We draw on his results in discussing the limiting case, where the effective social discount rate goes to zero".  In the interview that Cass gave to ''Macroeconomic Dynamics'', he credits Koopmans with pointing him to Frank Ramsey's previous work, claiming to have been embarrassed not to have known of it, but says nothing to dispel the basic claim that his work and Koopmans' were in fact independent.

Spear and Young dispute this history, based upon a previously overlooked working paper version of Koopmans' paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Koopmans |first=Tjalling |title=On the Concept of Optimal Economic Growth |work=Cowles Foundation Discussion paper 163 |date=December 1963 |url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d01b/d0163.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the basis for Koopmans' oft-cited presentation at a conference held by the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] in October 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKenzie |first=Lionel |authorlink=Lionel McKenzie |chapter=Some Early Conferences on Growth Theory |pages=3–18 |title=Essays in Economic Theory, Growth and Labor Markets |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Bitros |editor2-first=Yannis |editor2-last=Katsoulacos |location=Cheltenham |publisher=Edward Elgar |year=2002 |isbn=1-84064-739-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this Cowles Discussion paper, there is an error.  Koopmans claims in his main result that the Euler equations are both necessary and sufficient to characterize optimal trajectories in the model because any solutions to the Euler equations which do not converge to the optimal steady-state would hit either a zero consumption or zero capital boundary in finite time.  This error was apparently presented at the Vatican conference, although at the time of Koopmans' presenting it, no participant commented on the problem.  This can be inferred because the discussion after each paper presentation at the Vatican conference is preserved verbatim in the conference volume.

In the Vatican volume discussion following the presentation of a paper by [[Edmond Malinvaud]], the issue does arise because of Malinvaud's explicit inclusion of a so-called "transversality condition" (which Malinvaud calls Condition I) in his paper.  At the end of the presentation, Koopmans asks Malinvaud whether it is not the case that Condition I simply guarantees that solutions to the Euler equations that do not converge to the optimal steady-state hit a boundary in finite time.  Malinvaud replies that this is not the case, and suggests that Koopmans look at the example with log utility functions and Cobb-Douglas production functions.

At this point, Koopmans obviously recognizes he has a problem, but, based on a confusing appendix to a later version of the paper produced after the Vatican conference, he seems unable to decide how to deal with the issue raised by Malinvaud's Condition I.

From the ''Macroeconomic Dynamics'' interview with Cass, it is clear that Koopmans met with Cass' thesis advisor, [[Hirofumi Uzawa]], at the winter meetings of the [[Econometric Society]] in January 1964, where Uzawa advised him that his student [Cass] had solved this problem already.  Uzawa must have then provided Koopmans with the copy of Cass' thesis chapter, which he apparently sent along in the guise of the IMSSS Technical Report that Koopmans cited in the published version of his paper.  The word "guise" is appropriate here, because the TR number listed in Koopmans' citation would have put the issue date of the report in the early 1950s, which it clearly was not.

In the published version of Koopmans' paper, he imposes a new Condition Alpha in addition to the Euler equations, stating that the only admissible trajectories among those satisfying the Euler equations is the one that converges to the optimal steady-state equilibrium of the model.  This result is derived in Cass' paper via the imposition of a transversality condition that Cass deduced from relevant sections of a book by [[Lev Pontryagin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pontryagin |first=Lev |last2=Boltyansky |first2=Vladimir |last3=Gamkrelidze |first3=Revaz |last4=Mishchenko |first4=Evgenii |title=The Mathematical Theory of Optimal Processes |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley |edition= |year=1962 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spear and Young conjecture that Koopmans took this route because he did not want to appear to be "borrowing" either Malinvaud's or Cass' transversality technology.

Based on this and other examination of Malinvaud's contributions in 1950s—specifically his intuition of the importance of the transversality condition—Spear and Young suggest that the neo-classical growth model might better be called the Ramsey–Malinvaud–Cass model than the established Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans honorific.

[[Gary Becker]]'s '''rotten kid theorem''' is a [[thought experiment]] in [[economics]]. It posits that family members, even if they are selfish, will act to help one another if their personal incentives are properly aligned. The theorem is one of the most famous theorems within [[family economics]],{{cn|date=May 2017}} and applied [[mechanism design]].

In his original work, Becker paints a hypothetical situation in which children will receive gifts of money income from a wealthy, [[altruism|altruistic]] parent to make them [[utilitarianism|happy]]. One of the children is a selfish, "rotten", child who would take pleasure in harming his sibling. However, if he chose to actually hurt his sibling, the altruistic parent would help the victim, and curtail help to the wrongdoer. That way, the altruist would function as a means of transferring utility between the rotten kid and his sibling. In the process the parent would also bring about an incentive not to wrong the sibling in the first place, because any [[utility]] robbed of the sibling would be automatically taken away from the rotten kid.

The theorem relies on multiple assumptions. First, the altruistic parent has to be wealthy enough to compensate for any wrongdoing by the rotten kid. Secondly, he has to be a pure, rational altruist, with full knowledge of the personal utility of both the rotten kid and his sibling. Thirdly, the altruist would have to be fixed in his own income. And so on.

The theorem has proven widely influential in the economic analysis of family life,{{cn|date=May 2017}} and beyond that, other regarding economic institutions in general. It has done so especially in the economical analysis of unconventional and nonmonetary economic institutions, traditionally and especially in the popular sphere regarded as being outside the ambit of the economic science. Thus today it is a standard example of the novel contribution to economic literature that the so-called [[nonstandard economics]] has brought about.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Further applications ==

The theorem can be applied to inheritance as well, in expectation. There it suggests that a parent who plans to bequeath his estate in accordance to his children's needs and equity, might want to delay until the children are older, or possibly until after his demise. This is because if parents plan to will their children money in accordance with their needs, the real outcome of their behavior over their lifetime cannot be measured beforehand. Thus, the perfect incentive for the child to behave well towards his siblings can only be realized at the very end of the altruistic parent's life. In this application, the independent earnings of the various siblings can also be taken into account, without breaking the grounding logic of the theorem.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Society for the Promotion of Life-Cycle Analysis''' (SPOLD) was the association of multiple companies that wanted to create an file format that would help mold Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) software into a better management tool.

The '''Scheveningen system''' is a method of organizing a [[chess]] match between two teams.  Each player on one team plays each player on the other team {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|p=308}}.  The team with the highest number of games won is the winner.  This system is a popular way to create [[Grandmaster norm|title norm]] opportunities {{harvcol|Karpov|Roshal|1980|p=22}}.

The system was first used in a tournament in [[Scheveningen]] in 1923.  The idea behind it was that a team of ten Dutch players could face ten foreign [[chess master|masters]].  This has the intention of giving the players on the team experience against strong competition {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.

The '''social influence bias''' is an asymmetric [[Herd behavior|herding effect]] on online social media platforms which makes users overcompensate for negative ratings but amplify positive ones. Positive social influence can accumulate and result in a rating bubble, while negative social influence is neutralized by crowd correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Centola|first=Damon|last2=Willer|first2=Robb|last3=Macy|first3=Michael|date=2005-01-01|title=The Emperor’s Dilemma: A Computational Model of Self‐Enforcing Norms|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/427321|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=110|issue=4|pages=1009–1040|doi=10.1086/427321|issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was first described in a paper written by Lev Muchnik,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.levmuchnik.net/|title=Lev Muchnik's Home Page|last=Muchnik|first=Lev|website=www.levmuchnik.net|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinan Aral&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/sinana/www/|title=SINAN@MIT ~ Networks, Information, Productivity, Viral Marketing &amp; Social Commerce|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sean J.

Taylor|website=seanjtaylor.com|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014,&lt;ref name = aral2013 /&gt; then the question was revisited by Cicognani et al., who's experiment reinforced Munchnik's and his co-authors' results.&lt;ref name = cicognani2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simona|first=Cicognani,|last2=Paolo|first2=Figini,|last3=Marco|first3=Magnani,|date=2016|title=Social Influence Bias in Online Ratings: A Field Experiment|url=http://amsacta.unibo.it/4669|doi=10.6092/unibo/amsacta/4669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance ==

Online customer reviews are trusted sources of information in various contexts such as [[Online marketplace|online marketplaces,]] dining, accommodation, movies or digital products. However, these online ratings are not immune to [[Herd behavior|herd behaviour]], which means that subsequent reviews are not independent from each other. As on many such sites, preceding opinions are visible to a new reviewer, he or she can be heavily influenced by the antecedent evaluations in his or her decision about the certain product, service or online content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-problem-with-online-ratings-2/|title=The Problem With Online Ratings|last=Aral|first=Sinan|date=December 19, 2013|website=MIT Sloan Management Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of herding behaviour inspired Muchnik, Aral and Taylor to conduct their experiment on influence in social contexts.

== Experimental Design ==

Muchnik, Aral and Taylor designed a large-scale randomized experiment to measure social influence on user reviews. The experiment was conducted on the social news aggregation website like [[Reddit]]. The study lasted for 5 months, the authors randomly assigned 101 281 comments to one of the following treatment groups: up-treated (4049), down-treated (1942) or control (the proportions reflect the observed ratio of up- and down-votes. Comments which fell to the first group were given an up-vote upon the creation of the comment, the second group got a down-vote upon creation, the comments in the control group remained untouched. A vote is equivalent of a single rating (+1 or -1). As other users are unable to trace a user’s votes, they were unaware of the experiment. Due to randomization, comments in the control and the treatment group was not different in terms of expected rating. The treated comments were viewed more than 10 million times and rated 308 515 times by successive users.&lt;ref name = aral2013 /&gt;

== Results ==

The up-vote treatment increased the probability of up-voting by the first viewer by 32% over the control group (Figure 1A), while the probability of down-voting did not change compared to the control group, which means that users did not correct the random positive rating. The upward bias remained inplace for the observed 5-month period. The accumulating herding effect increased the comment’s mean rating by 25% compared to the control group comments (Figure 1C). Positively manipulated comments did receive higher ratings at all parts of the distribution, which means that they were also more likely to collect extremely high scores.[http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-problem-with-online-ratings-2/] The negative manipulation created an asymmetric herd effect: although the probability of subsequent down-votes was increased by the negative treatment, the probability of up-voting also grew for these comments. The community performed a correction which neutralized the negative treatment and resulted non-different final mean ratings from the control group. The authors also compared the final mean scores of comments across the most active topic categories on the website. The observed positive herding effect was present in the “politics,” “culture and society,” and “business” subreddits, but was not applicable for “economics,” “IT,” “fun,” and “general news”.&lt;ref name = aral2013 /&gt;

== Implications ==

The skewed nature of online ratings makes review outcomes different to what it would be without the social influence bias. In a 2009 experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Nan|last2=Zhang|first2=Jie|last3=Pavlou|first3=Paul A.|date=2009-10-01|title=Overcoming the J-shaped Distribution of Product Reviews|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1562764.1562800|journal=Commun. ACM|volume=52|issue=10|pages=144–147|doi=10.1145/1562764.1562800|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Hu, Zhang and Pavlou showed that the distribution of reviews of a certain product made by unconnected individuals is approximately [[Normal distribution|normal]], however, the rating of the same product on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] followed a J-Shaped distribution with twice as much five-star ratings than others. Cicognani, Figini and Magnani came to similar conclusions after their experiment conducted on a tourism services website: positive preceding ratings influenced raters' behavior more than mediocre ones.&lt;ref name = cicognani2016 /&gt; Positive crowd correction makes community-based opinions upward-biased.

'''''The Holy State and the Profane State''''' ('''''Prophane''''' in the original, sometimes shortened to '''''The Holy State''''') is a 1642 book by English churchman and historian [[Thomas Fuller]]. It describes the holy state as existing in the family and in public life, gives rules of conduct, model "characters" for the various professions and profane biographies. It was perhaps the most popular of Fuller's writings, having been reprinted four times after the first run sold out.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Curwen (journalist)|Henry Curwen]], ''A History of Booksellers: The Old and the New'' (2010), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains four volumes, three of which outline the characteristics of [[archetype]]s such as "the good husband", "the good servant", and "the good widow", and the fourth containing biographies intended to illustrate profane people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">A '''top-lit updraft gasifier''' (also known as a '''TLUD''') is a [[micro-kiln]] used to produce charcoal, especially [[biochar]], and heat for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biochar-Producing Stoves to Benefit Climate, Health, and Soil|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves|publisher=International Biochar Initiative|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TLUD [[pyrolysis|pyrolyzes]] organic material, including wood or manure, and uses a reburner to eliminate volatile byproducts of pyrolization. The process leaves mostly [[carbon]] as a residue, which can be incorporated into soil to create [[terra preta]].

Dr Thomas B Reed and the Norwegian architect Paal Wendelbo independently developed the working idea of a TLUD gasifier in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of TLUD|url=http://www.drtlud.com/tlud-technology/history/|publisher=Dr TLUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TLUD gasifier takes it further from a [[rocket stove]] in more efficient way of smoke-free, highly efficient combustion of the fuel.

== The Technology ==

A TLUD gasifier stove &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioChar Foundation|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly constructed with two concentric cylindrical containers.

The inner cylinder is the fuel pot. The fuel pot has holes in the base. These holes are the primary air inlet. The fuel pot also has holes on the neck, like the skirt, serving as a secondary air inlet.

The outer cylinder has holes near the bottom on the sides. During combustion, air enters these holes, either by natural air draft or forced with a DC fan depending on requirement and construction model.

Any biomass with less than 20% water content can be used as fuel. The user fills the fuel pot up to the neck, just below the secondary air inlet holes. The user ignites the top layer of fuel for the pyrolysis to start. Air then flows in through the primary and secondary air inlets. The primary inlet helps the draft of pyrolysed wood gas flow up.

The secondary air inlet blows hot air by the time it travels around the fuel pot. The secondary inlet above the fuel layer helps burn the wood gas. 

YouTube has many instructional videos, with further explanation on other websites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7123">'''Truth-seeking''' processes allow societies to examine and come to grips with past crimes and atrocities and prevent their future repetition. Truth-seeking often occurs in societies emerging from a period of prolonged conflict or authoritarian rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory|title=Truth-seeking, Memory, and Memorials - ICTJ|date=25 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example to date is the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], although many other examples also exist. Most commonly these are carried out by official [[truth and reconciliation commission]]s as a form of [[restorative justice]], but there are other mechanisms as well.

Through a truth-seeking process, actors in a country are able to investigate past abuses  and seek redress for victims and their families. Such investigations go beyond simply identifying guilty parties or individuals, but may investigate root causes, patterns of suffering, and social impact as well as events in individual cases, such as disappearances.

By seeking to investigate such questions with a high degree of professionalism and commitment, truth-seeking processes seek to create long-lasting public impact, often through the publication of a public report. Such reporting helps expose the facts of violations and suffering, which are often otherwise denied, and minimize possibilities of revisionism in the future.

Given that truth-seeking requires both considerable time and resources to properly tackle investigations and victims’ needs, local community and regional representatives, [[civil society]] organizations, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and aid agencies, and governmental and judicial entities play different roles in this process.

==The Right to Truth==
Many steps taken in a truth-seeking process are based on the premise of a right to truth. The right to truth entails that victims and communities affected by past crimes have the right to know the identity of suspected perpetrators consistent with the rights of the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/publication/ex-combatants-and-truth-commissions|title=Ex-Combatants and Truth Commissions|date=20 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]]: "Any person who has suffered atrocities has the unalienable right to know who is responsible; any family whose members have disappeared has the basic right discover their fate and whereabouts; every society where these crimes have taken place have the right to learn their history without lies or denial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ictj.org/gallery-items/right-truth|title = Right to the Truth|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher = International Center for Transitional Justice|access-date = 9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to truth is an emerging principle in customary international law. It has been recognized in the United Nations Principles on Impunity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derechos.org/nizkor/impu/principles.html|title=Equipo Nizkor - Updated Set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity.|website=derechos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent [[UN]] materials, and the UN has declared March 24 to be the "International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims" in memory of Archbishop [[Óscar Romero|Oscar Romero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/en/events/righttotruthday/documents.shtml|title = International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher = United Nations|access-date = 9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to truth has also been proclaimedby regional  bodies such as the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], and in some national courts.

==Truth-seeking Mechanisms==
Frequently used tactics during truth-seeking include the protection of evidence, collection of extensive victim data and testimony, the opening and maintenance of state information and public archives, and the publication of comprehensive reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory|title=Truth-seeking, Memory, and Memorials - ICTJ|date=25 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To implement such practices, [[truth commissions]] are often established to represent voices of victims. Such commissions are typically independent in nature and focus on accountability for past crimes, the root causes for the conflict and constructing historical narratives countering revisionism of the past. Policy recommendations issued by commissions often lead to a call for national reforms and further [[transitional justice]] initiatives, such as reparations, vetting and prosecutions.

Official truth commissions (often called truth and reconciliation commissions) have taken place in many countries, including [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South Africa]], [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Peru]], [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor|Timor-Leste]], [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Liberia)|Liberia]], the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Solomon Islands)|Solomon Islands]], and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Korea)|South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usip.org/resources-tools/latest?filter1=**ALL**&amp;filter0=**ALL**&amp;filter2=2222&amp;filter3=**ALL**&amp;filter4=&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently truth commissions have begun to be implemented in developed countries such as [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Canada]] and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Germany)|Germany]].

==Unofficial or Local Truth-seeking==
Unofficial or local truth-seeking projects became popular in the 1980s and 1990s in Latin America, when community organizations such as churches and academic institutions documented human rights violations and issued reports following the end to military rule. Though unofficial, such efforts from civil society often serve to pave the way for or complement state- led transitional justice initiatives, and sometimes produce superior results, as in [[Historical Clarification Commission|Guatemala]]. Unofficial truth-seeking initiatives have also taken place more recently at the local level in Northern Ireland, the [[Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission|United States]], [[The Jeju 4.3 Committee|South Korea]], and elsewhere. Calls for truth-seeking processes continue to be debated in other countries, such as [[Truth and Reconciliation in Cambodia|Cambodia]] and [[Truth and Reconciliation in Colombia|Colombia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">In [[philosophy]], '''truth by consensus''' is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them.  [[Imre Lakatos]] characterizes it as a "watered down" form of provable [[truth]] propounded by some [[sociology of knowledge|sociologists of knowledge]], particularly [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michael Polanyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Papers|author=[[Imre Lakatos]]|chapter=Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|pages=8|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter-url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcsoc00i/classes/s680f11/Lakatos.pdf|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Nigel Warburton]] argues that the truth by consensus process is not a reliable way of discovering truth.  That there is general agreement upon something does not make it actually true.&lt;br&gt;
There are two main reasons for this:&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking from A to Z|author=Nigel Warburton|chapter=truth by consensus|pages=134&amp;ndash;135|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-22281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# One reason Warburton discusses is that people are prone to wishful thinking.  People can believe an assertion and espouse it as truth in the face of overwhelming evidence and facts to the contrary, simply because they wish that things were so.  
# The other one is that people are gullible, and easily misled.

Another unreliable method of determining truth is by determining the majority opinion of a popular vote.  This is unreliable because on many questions the majority of people are ill-informed.  Warburton gives [[astrology]] as an example of this.  He states that while it may be the case that the majority of the people of the world believe that people's destinies are wholly determined by astrological mechanisms, given that most of that majority have only sketchy and superficial knowledge of the stars in the first place, their views cannot be held to be a significant factor in determining the truth of astrology.  The fact that something "is generally agreed" or that "most people believe" something should be viewed critically, asking the question why that factor is considered to matter at all in an argument over truth.  He states that the simple fact that a majority believes something to be true is unsatisfactory justification for believing it to be true.&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Warburton makes a distinction between the fallacy of truth by consensus and the process of [[democracy]] in decision-making.  Democracy is preferable to other processes not because it results in truth, but because it provides for equal participation by multiple special-interest groups, and the avoidance of [[tyranny]].&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Weinberger characterizes [[Jürgen Habermas]] as a proponent of a [[consensus theory of truth]], and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds:  First, even if everyone's opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous.  Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, it has not been proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards ''one single'' limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alternative Action Theory: Simultaneously a Critique of Georg Henrik Von Wright's Practical Philosophy|author=Ota Weinberger|pages=63|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-5184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9272">The '''unity of opposites''' is the central category of [[dialectic]]s, said to be related to the notion of [[non-duality]] in a deep sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thetempleofnature.org/_dox/unity-of-opposites-dialectic.pdf "The Unity of Opposites: A Dialectical Principle (PDF)"], V.T.JMcGill and W.T. Parry, ''Science &amp; Society'', vol. 12 no. 4 (Fall 1948), pp.418-444]&lt;/ref&gt; It defines a situation in which the existence or identity of a thing (or situation) depends on the co-existence of at least two conditions which are opposite to each other, yet dependent on each other and presupposing each other, within a field of tension. 

==Ancient philosophy==
First suggested by [[Heraclitus]] (c. 535 – c. 475 BC), a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]], philosophers had for some time been contemplating the notion of opposites. [[Anaximander]] posited that every element was an opposite, or connected to an opposite (water is cold, fire is hot). Thus,  the material world was composed by some indefinite, boundless [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]] from which arose the [[classical element|elements]] (earth, air, fire, water) and pairs of opposites (hot/cold, wet/dry). There was, according to Anaximander, a continual war of opposites.

[[Anaximenes of Miletus]], a student and successor of Anaximander, replaced this indefinite, boundless [[arche]] with air, a known element with neutral properties. According to Anaximenes, there was not so much a war of opposites, as a continuum of change.

Heraclitus, however, did not accept the [[Milesians (Greek)|milesian]] [[monism]] and replaced their underlying material arche with a single, divine law of the universe, which he called [[Logos]]. The universe of Heraclitus is in constant change, but also remaining the same. That is to say, an object moves from point A to point B, thus creating a change, but the underlying law remains the same. Thus, a unity of opposites is present in the universe as difference and sameness. This is a rather broad example though. For a more detailed example we may turn to an [[aphorism]] of [[Heraclitus]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The road up and the road down are the same thing. ([[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], ''Refutations'' 9.10.3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is an example of a [[wikt:compresence|compresent]] unity of opposites. For, at the same time, this slanted road has the opposite qualities of ascent and descent.  According to Heraclitus, everything is in constant flux, and every changing object co-instantiates at least one pair of opposites (though not necessarily simultaneously) and every pair of opposites is co-instantiated in at least one object. 

Heraclitus also uses the succession of opposites as a base for change:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cold things grow hot, a hot thing cold, a moist thing withers, a parched thing is wetted. ([[Diels–Kranz|DK]] B126)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a single object persists through opposite properties, this object undergoes change.

==Modern philosophy==
Dialecticians claim that unity or identity of opposites can exist in reality or in thought. If the opposites were completely balanced, the result would be [[Stability theory|stasis]], but often it is implied that one of the pairs of opposites is larger, stronger or more powerful than the other, such that over time, one of the opposed conditions prevails over the other. Yet rather than 'stasis' the identity of opposites, there being unity within their duality, is taken to be the instance of their very manifestation, the unity between them being the essential principle of making any particular opposite in question extant as either opposing force. For example 'upward' cannot exist unless there is a 'downward', they are opposites but they co-substantiate one another, their unity is that either one exists because the opposite is necessary for the existence of the other, one manifests immediately with the other. Hot would not be hot without cold, due to there being no contrast by which to define it as 'hot' relative to any other condition, it would not and could not have identity whatsoever if not for its very opposite that makes the necessary prerequisite existence for the opposing condition to be. This is the oneness, unity, principle to the very existence of any opposite. Either one's identity is the contra-posing principle itself, necessitating the other. The criteria for what is opposite is therefore something ''a priori''. 

In his criticism of [[Immanuel Kant]], the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] who tried to systematise dialectical understandings thus wrote: 

{{Quotation|The principles of the metaphysical philosophy gave rise to the belief that, when cognition lapsed into contradictions, it was a mere accidental aberration, due to some subjective mistake in argument and inference. According to Kant, however, thought has a natural tendency to issue in [[contradiction]]s or [[antinomy|antinomies]], whenever it seeks to apprehend the infinite. We have in the latter part of the above paragraph referred to the philosophical importance of the antinomies of [[reason]], and shown how the recognition of their existence helped largely to get rid of the rigid dogmatism of the metaphysic of understanding, and to direct attention to the Dialectical movement of thought. But here too Kant, as we must add, never got beyond the negative result that the thing-in-itself is unknowable, and never penetrated to the discovery of what the antinomies really and positively mean. That true and positive meaning of the antinomies is this: that every actual thing involves a coexistence of opposed elements. Consequently to know, or, in other words, to comprehend an object is equivalent to being conscious of it as a concrete unity of opposed determinations. The old metaphysic, as we have already seen, when it studied the objects of which it sought a metaphysical knowledge, went to work by applying categories abstractly and to the exclusion of their opposites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL48n Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1830) Part One IV. Second Attitude of Thought to Objectivity ''TWO. THE CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY'' §48]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his philosophy, Hegel ventured to describe quite a few cases of "unity of opposites", including the concepts of [[Infinity|Finite and Infinite]], [[Force]] and [[Matter]], [[Identity (social science)|Identity]] and [[Difference (philosophy)|Difference]], Positive and Negative, [[Substantial form|Form]] and [[wikt:content|Content]], [[Chance (philosophy)|Chance]] and [[Metaphysical necessity|Necessity]], [[Causality|Cause and effect]], [[Freedom of will|Freedom]] and [[Metaphysical necessity|Necessity]], [[Subjectivity]] and [[objectivity (science)|Objectivity]], [[Means (ethics)|Means]] and [[End (philosophy)|Ends]], [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|Object]], and [[Abstract object|Abstract]] and [[Concrete]]. It is also considered to be integral to [[Marxist_philosophy_of_nature#Law_of_opposites|Marxist philosophy of nature]] and is discussed in [[Friedrich Engels]]' ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]''.

==''Coincidentia oppositorum''==
''Coincidentia oppositorum'' is a Latin phrase meaning coincidence of opposites.  It is a [[neoplatonic]] term attributed to 15th century German polymath [[Nicholas of Kues|Nicholas of Cusa]] in his essay, ''[[De Docta Ignorantia]]'' (1440).  [[Mircea Eliade]], a 20th-century historian of religion, used the term extensively in his [[Mircea_Eliade#Coincidentia_oppositorum|essays about myth and ritual]], describing the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' as "the mythical pattern".  Psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], the philosopher and Islamic Studies professor [[Henry Corbin]] as well as Jewish philosophers [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] also used the term.  
In [[alchemy]], ''coincidentia oppositorum'' is a synonym for ''coniunctio''. For example, [[Michael Maier]] stresses that the union of opposites is the aim of the alchemical work. Or, according to [[Paracelsus]]' pupil, [[Gerhard Dorn]], the highest grade of the alchemical ''coniunctio'' consisted in the union of the total man with the ''[[unus mundus]]'' ("one world"). 

The term is also used in describing a revelation of the oneness of things previously believed to be different. Such insight into the unity of things is a kind of [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], and is found in various mystical traditions. The idea occurs in the traditions of [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], in [[German mysticism]], [[Taoism]], [[Zen]] and [[Sufism]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
