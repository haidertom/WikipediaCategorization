[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==
In 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash,&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies.&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the {{ill|Einwohnermeldeamt|de}} or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/1500-werke-von-picasso-bis-chagall-zollfahnder-entdecken-sensationellen-kunstschatz-in-muenchen_aid_1147066.html|title=Fahnder entdecken 1500 Werke von Picasso, Chagall und weiteren Künstlern|work=Focus|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24794970|title=Nazi looted art 'found in Munich'|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ_Nov22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-ein-dementi-weitere-meldungen-nuechterne-schaetzungen-12674903.html|title=Schwabinger Kunstfund: Ein Dementi, weitere Meldungen, nüchterne Schätzungen|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;
The paintings recovered included works by &lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Canaletto]], Marc Chagall, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Christoph|de}}, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], Otto Dix, [[Albrecht Dürer]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Fraaß|de}}, [[Conrad Felixmüller]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Ludwig Godenschweg]], [[Otto Griebel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paul Klee]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Kretzschmar|de}}, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wilhelm Lachnit]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Maskos|de}}, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Christoph Voll]].

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A. Böhmer und sein Nachlass.'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-05-004498-9}}. (''Schriften der Forschungsstelle "Entartete Kunst"''),  p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; She stated to ''Focus'' that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970/&gt; At the time of the interview with ''Focus'', she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name=Telg10424957&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10424957/Art-experts-demand-Germany-releases-list-of-1-billion-Nazi-art-trove.html | title=Art experts demand Germany releases list of €1-billion Nazi art trove | work=The Telegraph | date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Alexander, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners.&lt;ref name=BBCSpiegel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24977814|title=Nazi-looted art: German collector says he owns pictures |date=17 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-interview-with-cornelius-gurlitt-about-munich-art-find-a-933953.htm | title=Interview with a Phantom: Cornelius Gurlitt Shares the Secrets of His Pictures | work=Der Spiegel | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Gezer, Õzlem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10439168/Art-dealer-paid-Nazis-just-4000-Swiss-Francs-for-masterpieces.html|title=Art dealer paid Nazis just 4,000 Swiss Francs for masterpieces|last=Barnett |first=Louise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCStuttgart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24910093|title=German police check new art haul near Stuttgart |date=12 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated). "Die eigentumsrechtliche Problematik der ''entarteten'' Kunst" – "The problems surrounding ownership rights to ''degenerate'' art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235653/http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 |date=2 December 2013 }} (bilingual), on the website of the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.  Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gurlitt-collection-arrives-kunstmuseum-bern-1018277| title = The Notorious Gurlitt Trove of Nazi-Tainted Art Makes Its First Appearance at Kunstmuseum Bern| author = Neuendorf, Henri| date = July 10, 2017| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = artmet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme Assise'' to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Max Liebermann's ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector [[David Friedmann]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s ''Playing the Piano'' to the heirs of music publisher [[Henri Hinrichsen]], who was murdered at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30176190 |title=Swiss museum to accept Gurlitt 'Nazi art' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public display of the Gurlitt art trove took place at an exhibition curated by the Bern Fine Art Museum, running from November 2017 to March 2018, which featured 160 works from the controversial Gurlitt art collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/bern-fine-arts-museum_gurlitt-exhibition-attracts-droves-of-visitors/43793524| title = Gurlitt exhibition attracts droves of visitors| date = January 2, 2018| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AZUPANE-Lagunillas''' was the first school for children with learning disabilities in the western region of [[Zulia]], Venezuela. The school was inaugurated in [[Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia]] by its founder, [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]], on May 4, 1974. It was later integrated into the government educational program, becoming a public school and renamed as "Institute of Special Education" Jesús Enrique Losada".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"Inicó actividedes AZUPANE" (AZUPANE started activities), article reviewing the inaugural event of AZUPANE-Lagunillas, published by Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", May 5, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noticiaalminuto.com/efemerides-20abr-nacio-betty-cecilia-lugo-filantropa-dedicada-al-zulia-y-confundadora-de-la-casa-de-la-misericordia/|title=¡EFEMÉRIDES! #20Abr Nació Betty Cecilia Lugo, filántropa dedicada al Zulia y confundadora de La Casa de la Misericordia - Noticia al Minuto|website=noticiaalminuto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The project==
In the early 1970s the western region of Zulia state included four municipalities and it was the main center of Venezuela's oil industry. Many international corporations, connected to oil and gas, had long time and successful business in the district.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, June 1975 edition&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite being one of the richest regions in the country, Special Education was not included in the programs followed by local schools. There was not even awareness about the importance of integrating disabled children into the educational system.&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"/&gt;
[[File:Betty Cecilia Lugo.png|thumb|left|Venezuela philanthropist [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]], founder of AZUPANE-Lagunillas]]
This situation was perceived by philanthropist Betty Cecilia Lugo when she arrived in Lagunillas. Educated in Medicine and Special Education, she started a crusade in order to include special education into the local educational system. That is how the idea of starting a school for children with disabilities was born. The school was created primarily as a place where disabled children could be educated, have special activities outdoors and start to play sports. &lt;ref&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, June 1974 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages===
Betty Lugo started the project by creating awareness within the local community. She discussed the importance of Special Education with private companies and government institutions and built a fundraising committee. The most important achievement at this stage was to make possible that oil international companies included the project in their donation programs.&lt;ref&gt;“Mayoritario respaldo merece AZUPANE" (Azupane deserves strong support), Betty Lugo interview in the Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", November 21, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"/&gt;

The second stage focused on the search and selection of teachers, to be chosen into a community where Special Education was an unknown field. Given her academic training on the subject, Betty Lugo took care of the education and guidance of selected teachers, training them as special educators.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The third stage aimed to find an appropriate building to start activities, which took one year of meetings with different public and private companies. The school was inaugurated on May 4, 1974, in a large building donated by Shell Company of Venezuela, located in Ciudad Ojeda, [[Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The building had enough space for classrooms and offices. It also had a large garden, where children could develop psychomotor skills. Furniture and other equipment was purchased with money collected by the fundraising committee. &lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Inicó actividedes AZUPANE" (AZUPANE started activities), article reviewing the inaugural event of AZUPANE-Lagunillas, published by Maracaibo newspaper "Crítica", May 5, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school==
[[File:Betty Cecilia Lugo. Charla.png|thumb|right|Betty Cecilia Lugo speaks to representatives of the local community, in order to create awareness about the need for Special Education]]
The name of the school was AZUPANE- Lagunillas ("{{lang|es|Asociación Zuliana de Padres y Amigos de Niños Excepcionales - Lagunillas}}", English: "Zulian Association of Parents and Friends of Exceptional Children" - Lagunillas district). It started with seven pupils while Betty Lugo, together with benefactors and local authorities, continued searching for disabled children within the region. Other cases in need for special education started to show up and the school soon began to increase the number of students. &lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The school program was planned for children aged six to twelve years, suffering from neurological disorders, motor disabilities and communication and language problems. The main purpose was to create the appropriate atmosphere to grant academic learning, as well as the acquirement of social skills and the improvement of students quality of life.&lt;ref&gt; “Mayoritario respaldo merece AZUPANE" (Azupane deserves strong support), Betty Lugo interview in the Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", November 21, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents took care of the student’s daily transportation to the school, till Shell Oil Company of Venezuela, one of the greatest benefactors of the project, donated a school bus and provided the gasoline. Betty Lugo donated to the school all her special educational material, acquired during her training years in the United States. This kind of special educational resource was not produced or imported in Venezuela, by the time AZUPANE - Lagunillas started.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Legacy==
While AZUPANE- Lagunillas was raising awareness for the need of special education, Betty Lugo continued her crusade by encouraging private and official organizations to create special schools throughout the region. When she left Lagunillas, at the end of the 1970s, the school had increased the number of students, the local society was attentive to children with special needs and the Ministry of Education was planning to develop similar projects in the area. AZUPANE-Lagunillas was lately absorbed by the government as part of its educational programs, and the school was renamed as Institute of Special Education “Jesús Enrique Lossada”.&lt;ref&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, March 1979 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agricultural microbiology''' is a branch of [[microbiology]] dealing with plant-associated microbes and plant and animal diseases. It also deals with the microbiology of soil fertility, such as microbial degradation of organic matter and soil nutrient transformations.
Done by Alpha B S Conteh of Njala University.

== Soil microorganisms  ==
'''Bacteria''':- more dominant group of microorganisms in the soil and equal to one half of the microbial biomass in soil. Population 100,000 to several hundred millions for gram of  soil - Autochthnous - Zymogenous groups. Majority are Heterotrophs.  
(Common soil bacteria - Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Clostridium, Micrococcus).

'''Actinomycetes''' - intermediate group between bacteria and fungi. Numerous and widely distributed in soil. Abundance is next to bacteria. 104 - 108/g soil. 70% of soil actinomycetes are Streptomyces. Many of them are known to produce antibiotics. Population increases with depth of soil.

'''Fungi''': More numerous in surface layers of well-aerated and cultivated soils-dominant in acid soils. Common genera in soil are Aspergillus, Mucor, Penicillium Trichoderma, Alternaria, Rhizopus.
Algae – found in most of the soils in number ranges from 100 to 10,000 per g.

'''Protozoa''': Unicellular – population ranges from 10,000 to 100,000 per g of soil. Most of the soil forms are flagellates, amoebae or ciliates. Derive their nutrition by devouring soil bacteria. Abundant in upper larger of the soil. They are regulating the biological equilibrium in soil.

===Importance of soil microorganisms===
* Involved in nutrient transformation process
* Decomposition of resistant components of plant and animal tissue
* Role in microbial antagonism

===Example===

'''Ainola''', meaning "Aino's place", was the home of the composer [[Jean Sibelius]], his wife [[Aino Sibelius|Aino]] and their family from the autumn of 1904 until 1972. It stands on the scenic shores of [[Lake Tuusulanjärvi]] in [[Järvenpää]], 38 kilometers north of [[Helsinki]], the [[Finland|Finnish]] capital. It was designed by the famous  architect [[Lars Sonck]]. The only requests Sibelius had for Sonck were to include both a lakefront view and a green fireplace in the dining room. Water pipes were never installed until after Sibelius died because he did not want the distraction while he was there composing. 

Its distance from the hustle and bustle of the nation's capital gave the composer the peace that he needed for his creative endeavours. [[Erik W. Tawaststjerna]] writes that "when Sibelius first left Helsinki, Järvenpää was to a large extent untouched countryside. Foals and sheep almost nosed their way into the house, and from time to time an elk majestically bestrode the grounds." There were also other artistic families living in the neighborhood who provided a lively social circle for the Sibelius family.

Daily life in Ainola was documented by Sibelius’ private secretary [[Santeri Levas]] in the 1945 photographic book ''Jean Sibelius and His Home''.

[[Image:Ainola sauna.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Ainola’s sauna was designed by Aino Sibelius.]]
Buildings around Ainola include the [[sauna]] and the family's personal workshop. Sibelius died at Ainola on September 20, 1957; he is buried in a garden there. His wife Aino lived in Ainola for the next twelve years until she died on June 8, 1969. She is buried there with her husband.

In 1972 Jean Sibelius' daughters, Eva, Ruth, Katarina, Margareta, and Heidi, sold Ainola to the State of Finland. The [[Government of Finland#Ministry of Education|Ministry of Education]] and the [[Sibelius Society of Finland]] opened it as a museum in 1974. It is currently open from May to September. Among the personal effects remaining there are a grand piano, which was a gift to Sibelius on his fiftieth birthday, and paintings by Aino's brother [[Eero Järnefelt]].

'''Alternatives to evolution by natural selection''', also described as '''non-Darwinian mechanisms of evolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Darwinian mechanisms of evolution and their authors|url=http://darwiniana.com/2012/02/24/non-darwinian-mechanisms-of-evolution-and-their-authors/|publisher=Darwiniana|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been proposed by scholars investigating biology since classical times to explain signs of [[evolution]] and the [[Homology (biology)|relatedness]] of different groups of living things. The alternatives in question do not encompass religious points of view such as young or old earth [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]], but are limited to explanations proposed by biologists, though one was confusingly named 'theistic evolution' by [[Asa Gray]].

Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted but the mechanism proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], [[natural selection]], was denied, explanations of evolution such as [[Lamarckism]], [[catastrophism]], [[orthogenesis]], [[vitalism]], [[structuralism (biology)|structuralism]] and [[mutationism]] (called saltationism before 1900) were entertained. Different factors motivated people to propose non-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] mechanisms of evolution. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life. Some who came to accept evolution, but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections. Others felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.

By the start of the 20th century, evolution was generally accepted by biologists but [[eclipse of Darwinism|natural selection was in eclipse]].{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=246–281}} Many alternative theories were proposed, but biologists were quick to discount theories such as orthogenesis, vitalism and Lamarckism which offered no mechanism for evolution. Mutationism did propose a mechanism, but it was not generally accepted. The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] a generation later claimed to sweep away all the alternatives to Darwinian evolution, though some have been revived as molecular mechanisms for them have been discovered.

==Unchanging forms==
{{main|Hylomorphism|Great chain of being}}

[[Aristotle]] did not embrace either divine creation or evolution, instead arguing [[Aristotle's biology|in his biology]] that each species (''eidos'') was immutable, breeding true to its [[Hylomorphism|ideal eternal form]] (not the same as Plato's [[theory of Forms]]).{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Leroi|2015|p=89}} Aristotle's suggestion in ''[[De Generatione Animalium]]'' of a fixed hierarchy in nature - a ''scala naturae'' ("ladder of nature") provided an early explanation of the continuity of living things.{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pp=166–169}}{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pp=276–278}}{{sfn|Mayr|1985|pp=201–202}} Aristotle saw that animals were [[teleology|teleological]] (functionally end-directed), and had parts that were [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with those of other animals, but he did not connect these ideas into a concept of evolutionary progress.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=43}}

In the Middle Ages, [[Scholasticism]] developed Aristotle's view into the idea of a [[great chain of being]].{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} The image of a ladder inherently suggests the possibility of climbing, but both the ancient Greeks and mediaeval scholastics such as [[Ramon Lull]]{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} maintained that each species remained fixed from the moment of its creation.{{sfn|Lovejoy|2011|p=228 and passim}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=43}}

By 1818, however, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued in his ''Philosophie anatomique'' that the chain was "a progressive series", where animals like molluscs low on the chain could "rise, by addition of parts, from the simplicity of the first formations to the complication of the creatures at the head of the scale", given sufficient time. Accordingly, Geoffroy and later biologists looked for explanations of such evolutionary change.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=95}}

[[Georges Cuvier]]'s 1812 ''Recherches sur les Ossements Fossiles'' set out his doctrine of the correlation of parts, namely that since an organism was a whole system, all its parts mutually corresponded, contributing to the function of the whole. So, from a single bone the zoologist could often tell what class or even genus the animal belonged to. And if an animal had teeth adapted for cutting meat, the zoologist could be sure without even looking that its sense organs would be those of a predator and its intestines those of a carnivore. A species had an irreducible functional complexity, and "none of its parts can change without the others changing too".{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=18–21}} Evolutionists expected one part to change at a time, one change to follow another. In Cuvier's view, evolution was impossible, as any one change would unbalance the whole delicate system.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=18–21}}

[[Louis Agassiz]]'s 1856 "Essay on Classification" exemplified German philosophical idealism. This held that each species was complex within itself, had complex relationships to other organisms, and fitted precisely into its environment, as a pine tree in a forest, and could not survive outside those circles. The argument from such ideal forms opposed evolution without offering an actual alternative mechanism. [[Richard Owen]] held a similar view in Britain.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=42–43, 111}}

The Lamarckian social philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], ironically the author of the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" adopted by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]],{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=239, 342}} used an argument like Cuvier's to oppose natural selection. In 1893, he stated that a change in any one structure of the body would require all the other parts to adapt to fit in with the new arrangement. From this, he argued that it was unlikely that all the changes could appear at the right moment if each one depended on random variation; whereas in a Lamarckian world, all the parts would naturally adapt at once, through a changed pattern of use and disuse.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=149, 253, 259}}

==Alternative explanations of change==
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism}}

Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted by biologists but [[natural selection]] was denied, including but not limited to the late 19th century [[eclipse of Darwinism]], alternative scientific explanations such as [[Lamarckism]], [[orthogenesis]], [[structuralism]], [[catastrophism]], [[vitalism]] and theistic evolution&lt;!--don't link, that's a different topic--&gt;{{efn|Not to be confused with the more recent use of the term [[theistic evolution]], which refers to a theological belief in the compatibility of science and religion.}} were entertained, not necessarily separately. (Purely religious points of view such as young or old earth [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] are not considered here.) Different factors motivated people to propose non-Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=197}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=119–120}} Some of these scientists and philosophers, like [[St. George Jackson Mivart]] and [[Charles Lyell]], who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections.{{sfn|Quammen|2006|pp=209–210}} Others, such as the biologist and philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], the botanist [[George Henslow]] (son of Darwin's mentor [[John Stevens Henslow]], also a botanist), and the author [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}

Some felt that natural selection would be too slow, given the estimates of the [[age of the earth]] and sun (10–100 million years) being made at the time by physicists such as [[Lord Kelvin]], and some felt that natural selection could not work because at the time the models for inheritance involved blending of inherited characteristics, an objection raised by the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in a review of ''Origin'' written shortly after its publication.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}} Another factor at the end of the 19th century was the rise of a new faction of biologists, typified by geneticists like [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], who wanted to recast biology as an experimental laboratory science. They distrusted the work of naturalists like Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], dependent on field observations of variation, adaptation, and [[biogeography]], as being overly anecdotal. Instead they focused on topics like [[physiology]] and [[genetics]] that could be investigated with controlled experiments in the laboratory, and discounted less accessible phenomena like natural selection and [[adaptation]] to the environment.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=143–147,182}}

===Vitalism===

{{main|Vitalism}}

Vitalism holds that living organisms differ from other things in containing something non-physical, such as a fluid or vital spirit, that makes them live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Robert C.

Since [[Early Modern]] times, vitalism stood in contrast to the mechanistic explanation of biological systems started by [[Descartes]]. Nineteenth century chemists  set out to disprove the claim that forming organic compounds required vitalist influence.&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; In 1828, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] showed that [[urea]] could be made entirely from inorganic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kinne-Saffran |first1=E. |last2=Kinne |first2=R.

===Theistic evolution===

The American botanist [[Asa Gray]] used the name "theistic evolution"{{efn|Gray, and later historians of science, did not refer to a 20th century usage of [[theistic evolution]] (described in that article), that one can accept Darwinian evolution without being an atheist.}} for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book ''Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gray, Asa |authorlink=Asa Gray |year=1876 |title=Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism |publisher=Appleton |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.19483|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.19483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the deity supplies beneficial mutations to guide evolution. [[St George Jackson Mivart]] argued instead in his 1871 ''On the Genesis of Species'' that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution by specifying the (orthogenetic) laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|The Duke of Argyll]] set out similar views in his 1867 book ''The Reign of Law''.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=George|title=The Reign of Law|date=1867|publisher=Strahan|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/argyll/5rl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Edward Larson, the theory failed as an explanation in the minds of late 19th century biologists as it broke the rules of [[methodological naturalism]] which they had grown to expect.{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=126}} Accordingly, by around 1900, biologists no longer saw theistic evolution as a valid theory. In Larson's view, by then it "did not even merit a nod among scientists." Biologists might argue about mechanisms, but they were in no doubt that a mechanistic explanation was needed.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–128}} In the 20th century, theistic evolution could take other forms, such as the orthogenesis of Teilhard de Chardin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Morris, John D.; Morris, Henry M. |title=The Modern Creation Trilogy |year=1998 |publisher=New Leaf |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthogenesis===
[[File:Titanothere Osborn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] claimed in 1918 that [[Titanothere]] horns showed a non-[[adaptation|adaptive]] [[Orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] trend.]]
{{main|Orthogenesis}}

Orthogenesis is the hypothesis that life has an innate tendency to change, developing in a unilinear fashion in a particular direction, or simply making some kind of definite progress. Many different versions have been proposed, some such as that of [[Teilhard de Chardin]] openly spiritual, others such as [[Theodor Eimer]]'s apparently simply biological. These theories often combined orthogenesis with other supposed mechanisms. For example, Eimer believed in Lamarckian evolution, but felt that internal laws of growth determined which characteristics would be acquired and would guide the long-term direction of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=249}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=221}}

Orthogenesis was popular among paleontologists such as [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. They believed that the fossil record showed unidirectional change, but did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed). Osborn argued in his 1918 book ''Origin and Evolution of Life'' that trends in [[Titanothere]] horns were both orthogenetic and non-[[adaptation|adaptive]], and could be detrimental to the organism. For instance, they supposed that the large antlers of the [[Irish elk]] had caused its extinction.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=249}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=221}}

Support for orthogenesis fell during the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1940s when it became apparent that it could not explain the complex branching patterns of evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the [[fossil record]].{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}} Work in the 21st century has supported the mechanism and existence of mutation-biased adaptation (a form of mutationism), meaning that constrained orthogenesis is now seen as possible.&lt;ref name=Yampolsky&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yampolsky, L.

===Lamarckism===
{{main|Lamarckism}}
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], drawn by [[Jules Pizzetta]], 1893]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s 1809 evolutionary theory, [[transmutation of species]], was based on a progressive (orthogenetic) drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also shared the belief, common at the time, that [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|characteristics acquired during an organism's life could be inherited]] by the next generation, producing adaptation to the environment. Such characteristics were caused by the use or disuse of the affected part of the body. This minor component of Lamarck's theory became known, much later, as [[Lamarckism]].{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=86–95}} Darwin included ''Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection'' in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.{{sfn|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108]}} In the late 19th century, [[neo-Lamarckism]] was supported by the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], the American [[paleontologist]]s [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], and the American [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Packard]]. Butler and Cope believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=236}} Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=236}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=217}} Meanwhile, the English botanist [[George Henslow]] studied how environmental stress affected the development of plants, and he wrote that the variations induced by such environmental factors could largely explain evolution; he did not see the need to demonstrate that such variations could actually be inherited.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=239–240}} Critics pointed out that there was no solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Instead, the experimental work of the German biologist [[August Weismann]] resulted in the germ plasm theory of inheritance, which Weismann said made the inheritance of acquired characteristics impossible, since the [[Weismann barrier]] would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=253–255}}

In modern [[epigenetics]], biologists observe that [[phenotype]]s depend on heritable changes to [[gene expression]] that do not involve changes to the [[DNA sequence]]. [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|These changes can cross generations]] in plants, animals, and [[prokaryote]]s. This is not identical to traditional Lamarckism, as the changes do not last indefinitely and do not affect the germ line and hence the evolution of genes.&lt;ref name=Heard&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heard, E.; Martienssen, R. A. | title=Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: myths and mechanisms | journal=Cell | volume=157 | issue=1 | pages=95–109 | year=2014 | pmid=24679529 | pmc=4020004 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Baron Georges Cuvier Wellcome L0016365 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georges Cuvier]], shown here with a fossil fish, proposed [[catastrophism]] to explain the [[fossil record]].]]

===Catastrophism===
{{main|Catastrophism}}

Catastrophism is the [[hypothesis]], argued by the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]] in his 1812 ''Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes'', that the various [[extinction]]s and the patterns of [[faunal succession]] seen in the [[fossil]] record were caused by large-scale natural catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and, for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia, the inundation of low-lying areas by the [[sea]]. This was explained purely by natural events: he did not mention [[Noah's flood]],{{sfn|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}} nor did he ever refer to divine creation as the mechanism for repopulation after an extinction event, though he did not support evolutionary theories such as those of his contemporaries Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire either.{{sfn|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |year=1996 |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |title=Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several such catastrophes, recurring natural events, separated by long periods of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.{{sfn|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}

Catastrophism has found a place in modern biology with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, as proposed in a paper by 
[[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. It argued that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Alvarez hypothesis|struck Earth 66 million years ago]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The event, whatever it was, made about 70% of all species extinct, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving behind the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]].&lt;ref name=Alvarez&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alvarez |first1=L.W. |last2=Alvarez |first2=W. |last3=Asaro |first3=F. |last4=Michel |first4=H.

[[File:Darcythompson.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|In his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]'', [[D'Arcy Thompson]] illustrated the [[Transformation (geometry)|geometric transformation]] of [[Argyropelecus|one fish's]] body form into [[Sternoptyx|another]] with a 20° [[shear mapping]]. He did not discuss the [[evolution]]ary causes of such a change, raising suspicions of [[vitalism]].{{sfn|Ruse|2013|pp=419}}]]

Biological structuralism objects to an exclusively Darwinian explanation of natural selection, arguing that other mechanisms also guide evolution, and sometimes implying that these supersede selection altogether.{{sfn|Ruse|2013|pp=419}} Structuralists have proposed different mechanisms that might have guided the formation of [[body plan]]s.

[[Saltationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoltzfus, A.; Cable, K. | year=2014 | title=Mendelian-Mutationism: The Forgotten Evolutionary Synthesis | journal=J Hist Biol | volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=501–546 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9383-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=211–212, 276–277}} held that new species arise as a result of large [[mutation]]s. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]], a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. These ideas developed into [[mutationism]], the mutation theory of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}} This held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation, based on de Vries's experiments with the evening primrose, ''[[Oenothera]]'', from 1886. The primroses seemed to be constantly producing new varieties with striking variations in form and color, some of which appeared to be new species because plants of the new generation could only be crossed with one another, not with their parents.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=148–162}} However, [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] showed in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed were the result of [[polyploid]] hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=202–205}}

Initially, de Vries and Morgan believed that mutations were so large as to create new forms such as subspecies or even species instantly. Morgan's 1910 fruit fly experiments, in which he isolated mutations for characteristics such as white eyes, changed his mind. He saw that mutations represented small [[Mendelian]] characteristics that would only spread through a population when they were beneficial, helped by natural selection. This represented the germ of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], and the beginning of the end for mutationism as an evolutionary force.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=310–311}}

===Genetic drift===
[[File:Different Types of Mutations.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Many [[mutation]]s are [[neutral mutation|neutral]] or silent, having no effect on the [[amino acid]] sequence that is produced when the [[gene]] involved is [[translation (biology)|translated]] to [[protein]], and accumulate over time, forming a [[molecular clock]]. However this does not cause [[phenotype|phenotypic]] evolution.]]
{{main|Neutral theory of molecular evolution}}

The [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], proposed by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1968, holds that at the [[DNA sequence|molecular level]] most [[evolution]]ary changes and most of the variation within and between species is not caused by [[natural selection]] but by [[genetic drift]] of [[mutation|mutant]] [[allele]]s that are neutral. A [[neutral mutation]] is one that does not affect an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. The neutral theory allows for the possibility that most mutations are deleterious, but holds that because these are rapidly purged by natural selection, they do not make significant contributions to variation within and between species at the molecular level. Mutations that are not deleterious are assumed to be mostly neutral rather than beneficial.&lt;ref name=Kimura83/&gt;

The theory was controversial as it sounded like a challenge to Darwinian evolution; controversy was intensified by a 1969 paper by [[Jack Lester King]] and [[Thomas H. Jukes]], provocatively but misleadingly titled "[[Non-Darwinian Evolution (paper)|Non-Darwinian Evolution]]". It provided a wide variety of evidence including [[protein sequence]] comparisons, studies of the Treffers mutator gene in ''[[E. coli]]'',  analysis of the genetic code, and comparative [[immunology]], to argue that most protein evolution is due to neutral mutations and genetic drift.&lt;ref name=KingJukes1969&gt;{{cite journal |volume=164 |issue=3881 |pages=788–798 |last=King |first=Jack Lester |author2=Thomas H. Jukes  |title=Non-Darwinian Evolution |journal=Science |date=1969 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/164/3881/788 |doi=10.1126/science.164.3881.788 |pmid=5767777 |bibcode=1969Sci...164..788L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01058626 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=21–59 |last=Dietrich |first=Michael R. |title=The origins of the neutral theory of molecular evolution |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |year=1994 |pmid=11639258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kimura, the theory applies only for evolution at the molecular level, while [[phenotype|phenotypic]] evolution is controlled by natural selection, so the neutral theory does not constitute a true alternative.&lt;ref name=Kimura83&gt;{{cite book |author=Kimura, Motoo |authorlink=Motoo Kimura |year=1983 |title=The neutral theory of molecular evolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31793-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Austin L. |last=Hughes |title=Looking for Darwin in all the wrong places: the misguided quest for positive selection at the nucleotide sequence level |journal=Heredity |volume=99 |year=2007 |pages=364–373 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6801031 |pmid=17622265 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined theories==
[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Multiple explanations have been offered since the 19th century for how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection (dashed orange arrows). Many of these theories led (blue arrows) to some form of directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows) directly or indirectly. For example, evolutionists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] believed in a combination of theistic evolution, Lamarckism, vitalism, and orthogenesis,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261–262}} represented by the sequence of arrows on the extreme left of the diagram.]]

The various alternatives to Darwinian evolution by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]] is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that [[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]], which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in [[embryology]] and [[palaeontology]]. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261–262}} Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=264}}

==Rebirth of natural selection, with continuing alternatives==
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

By the start of the 20th century, during the [[eclipse of Darwinism]], biologists were doubtful of natural selection, but equally were quick to discount theories such as orthogenesis, vitalism and Lamarckism which offered no mechanism for evolution. Mutationism did propose a mechanism, but it was not generally accepted.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=128–129}} The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] a generation later, roughly between 1918 and 1932, broadly swept away all the alternatives to Darwinism, though some including forms of orthogenesis,&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus/&gt;  [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|epigenetic mechanisms]] that resemble Lamarckian [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]],&lt;ref name=Heard/&gt; catastrophism,&lt;ref name=Alvarez/&gt; structuralism,&lt;ref name=Goodwin/&gt; and mutationism&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus_on_Nei2014/&gt; have been revived, such as through the discovery of molecular mechanisms.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=222–243, 284–286}}

Biology has become Darwinian, but belief in some form of progress (orthogenesis) remains both in the public mind and among biologists. Ruse argues that evolutionary biologists will probably continue to believe in progress for three reasons. Firstly, the [[anthropic principle]] demands people able to ask about the process that led to their own existence, as if they were the pinnacle of such progress. Secondly, scientists in general and evolutionists in particular believe that their work is leading them progressively closer to [[philosophical realism|a true grasp of reality]], as knowledge increases, and hence (runs the argument) there is progress in nature also. Ruse notes in this regard that [[Richard Dawkins]] explicitly compares cultural progress with [[meme]]s to biological progress with genes. Thirdly, evolutionists are self-selected; they are people, such as the entomologist and sociobiologist [[E. O. Wilson]], who are interested in progress to supply a meaning for life.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=536–539}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3876">In [[psychoanalytic theory]], '''aphanisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|f|æ|n|ɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀφάνισις ''aphanisis'', "disappearance") is the disappearance of [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | title = Oxford Dictionary of Psychology | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-19-860761-X | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was later applied to the disappearance of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].

==Jones==
According to the theories of [[Ernest Jones]], who coined the term in 1927,&lt;ref name="ODP" /&gt; aphanisis is the foundation of all [[neurosis|neuroses]]. Jones suggested that fear of aphanisis was in both sexes more fundamental than [[castration anxiety]], an argument he used against [[Sigmund Freud]] in their debate over [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J. B. Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (2012) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Jones considered that the [[Oedipus complex]] confronted each sex with the threat of aphanisis, and the choice of giving up "either their sex or their incest".&lt;ref&gt;E. Schuker/N. A. Levinson, ''Female Psychology'' (1991) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones subsequently linked aphanisis to Freud's concept of the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] of separation, a point taken up by [[John Bowlby]] in the context of his own theory of [[Anxiety|separation anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''Separation'' (2010) pp. 431–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan==
[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] adapted Jones's term to a new meaning: "''aphanisis'' is to be situated in a more radical way at the level at which the subject manifests himself in this movement of disappearance...the ''fading'' of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) pp. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lacanian theory, aphanisis describes the process through which a subject is partially eclipsed behind any signifier used to conceive of him/her: "when the subject appears somewhere as meaning, he is manifested elsewhere as 'fading', as disappearance...''aphanisis''".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The subject as such is, accordingly, barred and riven by the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] (of language), a subject has no choice but to conceive of themself ''vis-a-vis'' something other than their self, something 'outside' or radically separated from them. 

Because the Other is the sole means through which a 'subject' can be rendered thinkable, aphanisis, the disappearance or the fading of the subject behind any signifier used to conceive of it, is an essential concept for understanding subjectivity and the peril of the subject's fundamental emptiness.

[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] developed the concept of aphanisis in terms of the dialectic of presence and absence—the gap between the core of the personality and the symbolic narrative in which the individual lives.&lt;ref&gt;R/ Maule/J. Beaulieu, ''In the Dark Room'' (2009), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
[[Montaigne]] has been seen as a classic example of the exploration of the aphanisis of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan, ''Les quatre concepts fondamnetaux de la psychanalyse'' (Le Séminaire, Livre XI, 1964), Texte établi par J.-A. Miller, Paris, Seuil, coll. Points, 1990, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Apollon/R. Feldstein, ''Lacan, Politics, Aestetics'' (1996) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|right|thumb|An archivist surveying an unprocessed collection of materials. Surveying is commonly done to determine priorities for preservation and/or conservation of materials before an archivist begins arrangement and description.]]
An '''archivist''' (''AR-kiv-ist'') is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to [[Document|record]]s and [[archive]]s determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by an archivist can consist of a variety of forms, including letters, diaries, logs, other personal documents, government documents, sound and/or picture recordings, digital files, or other physical objects.

==Description==
As [[Richard Pearce-Moses]] wrote:

:"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce-Moses, Richard. "Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist?" ''Archival Outlook'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining what records have enduring value can be challenging. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives: A How-to-do-it Manual|last=Hunter|first=Gregory|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.|others=|year=2003|isbn=|editor=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory and scholarly work underpinning [[archive]]s practices is called [[archival science]].

The most common related occupations are [[librarian]]s, [[Curator|museum curators]], and [[records manager]]s. The archivist occupation is distinct from that of librarian. The two occupations have separate courses of training, adhere to separate and distinct principles, and are represented by separate [[Professional association|professional organization]]s. In general, the librarian tends to deal with published media (where the [[metadata]], such as author, title, and date of publication, may be readily apparent and can be presented in standardized form), whereas the archivist deals with unpublished media (which has different challenges such as the metadata not always being immediately apparent, containing complications and variety, and more likely to depend on [[provenance]]).

In addition, because archival records are frequently unique, some archivists may be as much concerned with the preservation and custody of the information carrier (i.e. the physical document) as with its informational content. In this regard, some would argue the archivist may have more in common with the [[Curator|museum curator]] than with the librarian.

The occupation of archivist is also frequently distinguished from that of [[records manager]], although in this case the distinction is less absolute: the archivist is predominantly concerned with records deemed worthy of permanent preservation, whereas the records manager is more concerned with records of current administrative importance.

==Duties and work environment==
Archivists' duties include acquiring and [[archival appraisal|appraising]] new collections, [[manuscript processing|arranging and describing records]], providing reference service, and preserving materials.  In arranging records, archivists apply two important principles: [[provenance]] and [[original order]].  Provenance refers to the creation of records and keeping different records separate in order to maintain context. Many entities create records, including governments, businesses, universities, and individuals. Original order is applied by keeping records in their order as established and maintained by the creator(s). Both provenance and original order are closely related to the concept of ''[[respect des fonds]]'', which states that records from one corporate body should not be mixed with records from another.

There are two aspects to arrangement: intellectual and physical. Both aspects follow the principle of original order. Archivists process the records physically by placing them in acid-free folders and boxes to ensure their long-term survival. They also process the records intellectually, by determining what the records consist of, how they are organized, and what, if any, [[finding aid]]s need to be created. Finding aids can be box lists or descriptive inventories, or indexes. Even if the original arrangement is unclear or unhelpful in terms of accessing the collection, it is rarely rearranged to something that makes more sense. This is because preserving the original order shows how the creator of the records functioned, why the records were created, and how they went about arranging them. Moreover, the provenance and authenticity of the records may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roe|first=Kathleen D.|title=Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts|year=2005|publisher=Society of American Archivists|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, original order is not always the best way to maintain some collections and archivists must use their own experience and current best practices to determine the correct way to preserve collections of mixed media or those lacking a clear original arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://saa.archivists.org/store/understanding-archives-and-manuscripts-afs-ii/339/|title=Understanding Archives and Manuscripts|last=O'Toole|first=James M. and Richard J. Cox|publisher=Society of American Archivists|others=|year=2006|isbn=|editor=|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists' work encompasses a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] decisions that may be thought of as falling into three broad and intertwined areas: legal requirements; professional standards; and accountability to society in selecting and preserving documentary materials that serve as a [[Primary sources|primary source]] of knowledge, and influence [[collective memory]] and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, Elena S. (2010). ''The Ethical Archivist''. Chicago: The Society of American Archivists. p. 22-26, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In negotiating the ethical conflicts that arise in their work, archivists are guided by [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielson (2010), chapter 1, "Codes of Ethics," p. 21-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of American Archivists first adopted a [https://www2.archivists.org/groups/committee-on-ethics-and-professional-conduct/code-of-ethics-history code of ethics] in 1980;&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;Horn, David E (1989). "[http://americanarchivist.org/doi/abs/10.17723/aarc.52.1.nk661527341j0610 The Development of Ethics in Archival Practice]." ''The American Archivist'', 2(1), p. 64-71. It was based on an earlier statement produced in training programs at the National Archives, under Archivist of the United States [[Wayne C. Grover]], and published as "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015071393535;view=image;page=root;size=100;seq=713;num=307 The Archivist's Code]" (''American Archivist'', vol. 18, no. 4, p. 307-308).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Council on Archives]] adopted one in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 ICA Code of Ethics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929074919/http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 |date=29 September 2015 }}." International Council on Archives. Retrieved 2015-09-01. The ICA code is available in 23 languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside their work in arranging and caring for collections, archivists assist users in interpreting materials and answering inquiries. This reference work can be a small part of an archivist's job in a smaller organization, or consist of most of their occupation in a larger archive where specific roles (such as [[Manuscript processing|processing archivist]] and [[Reference interview|reference archivist]]) may be delineated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Frances|date=|year=2000|title=Reference Service in an Academic Archives|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/science/article/pii/S0099133399001470|journal=The [[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=110–118|doi=10.1016/S0099-1333(99)00147-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists work for a variety of organizations, including [[government agency|government agencies]], [[local authorities]], museums, hospitals, historical societies, businesses, charities, corporations, [[colleges]] and universities, and any institution whose records may potentially be valuable to researchers, exhibitors, [[genealogist]]s, or others. They can also work on the collections of a large family or even of an [[individual]].

Archivists are often educators as well; it is not unusual for an archivist employed at a university or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or [[outreach]] programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]], [[Advertising campaign|promotional]] events, or even media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/guidelines/cu_guidelines4.asp|title=Guidelines for College and University Archives, Section IV. Core Archival Functions, Subsection D. Service |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[Encoded Archival Description]], along with increasing demand for materials to be made available online, has required archivists to become more tech-savvy in the past decade.  Many archivists are now acquiring basic [[XML]] skills in order to make their finding aids available to researchers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml|title=Encoded Archival Description |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Archives Hub| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125702/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml| archivedate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Between_the_Forks_Exhibit.JPG|right|thumb|An Archivist and volunteer worker with an exhibit on local history.  Project management, preservation of historic materials, and research skills are just a few of the abilities required in an archivist's background to make such public education efforts effective and exciting. {{speedy-image-c|22 April 2007}}]] --&gt;

Because of the varied nature of the job within different organizations and work environments, archivists need to have a wide range of [[skills]]:
* Those who work in reference and access-oriented positions should have good customer services skills, to help patrons with their research.
* A basic knowledge of [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|conservation]] is needed to help extend the life of cultural artifacts. Many types of media (such as photographs, acidic papers, and unstable copy processes) can deteriorate if not stored and maintained properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Mary Lynn | last=Ritzenthaler | year=1993 | title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=Society of American Archivists | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although many archival collections consist solely of paper records, increasingly archivists must confront the new challenges posed by the [[digital preservation|preservation]] of electronic records, so they need to be forward-looking and technologically proficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|accessdate=3 April 2007 |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational preparation==
The educational preparation for archivists varies from country to country.

===Australia===
The [[Australian Society of Archivists]] is the professional body for archivists, and is responsible for the accreditation of the various University courses.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/accredited-courses|title=Accredited courses|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first University to offer archival training was the [[University of New South Wales]], starting in 1973. The course closed in 2000.

Courses are now offered at [[Curtin University]] in [[Western Australia]], [[Charles Sturt University]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Monash University]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[University of South Australia]] at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The course at [[Edith Cowan University]] is being phased out.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Courses are offered in a variety of modes, including online via [[Open University Australia]] and through a combination of online and internal units at the various universities.

===Brazil===
The profession has been regulated since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/1970-1979/L6546.htm|title=L6546|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities in Brazil, such as the University of Brasilian (UnB), the [[Federal University of Santa Catarina]] (UFSC), the [[Federal University of Santa Maria]] (UFSM) and the [[São Paulo State University]] (UNESP) offer the degree in [[archival science]].

===Colombia===
In [[Colombia]], the [[Universidad de La Salle]] offers the degree of Professional in Information Systems, Library and Archival Sciences. It is a vocational training program, within existing legal standards aimed at providing knowledge, skills and abilities required for the design and management of information systems and documentation of various sorts. Its projection for the future is based on the application of new information technologies and communications for the management of information services economically viable. The program was created in 1971.

Other institutions that offers a degree in Archival Science are:
* [[Universidad del Quindío]] – Professional degree: Professional in Information and Documentation, Library and Archival Sciences.
* [[Universidad de Antioquia, Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Archival Science.
* [[Universidad Católica de Manizales]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.
* [[Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje]] – SENA – in chain training with the [[Antioquia Institute of Technology|Tecnológico de Antioquia]] Tecnológico de Antioquia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042453/http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Technical degree: Professional Technical in Archives, Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.

===France===
In France, the oldest Archivist School is the ''[[École des chartes]]'', founded in 1821. This prestigious ''[[grande école]]'' (literally, "grand schools) offers a diploma in "Archivist-Paleography" after a three-year curriculum. A part of its alumni pursue a State archivist career after an 18-month formation at the ''[[Institut national du patrimoine]]''. Most positions are reserved for European citizens.

Some universities offer master's degree in Archival Science: [[University of Angers|Angers]], [[University of Caen|Caen]], [[University of Dijon|Dijon]], [[Charles de Gaulle University - Lille III|Lille III]], [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3|Lyon III]], [[Upper Alsace University|Mulhouse]], [[Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University|Versailles Saint-Quentin]],

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the [[University College Dublin School of History and Archives]] offers a Masters of Arts degree in Archives and Records Management, recognised by the Society of Archivists.

===New Zealand===
[[Victoria University of Wellington]] is the only tertiary institution in [[New Zealand]] provides postgraduate archival courses. Victoria Information Studies qualifications with ARCR endorsement have been recognized by [[Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia]]. Open Polytechnic of New Zealand provides undergraduate archival courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there are currently five full- or part-time postgraduate courses in archives administration or management which are recognised by the [[Archives and Records Association]] (United Kingdom and Ireland). Students are expected to have relevant paid or voluntary [[work experience]] before obtaining a place on the UK courses; many undertake a year's traineeship. Also, professional certification (after qualifying) can be pursued via the Registration Scheme offered by the Archives and Records Association.

===United States===
The most common types of advanced degrees held by archivists are in [[archival science]], [[public history]], history, [[library science]], or [[library and information science]]. It is also possible for archivists to earn a doctorate in library and information science. Archivists with a PhD often work as teaching faculty, deans, or directors of archival programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakel and Bastian |first=Elizabeth and Jeannette |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Archival Graduate Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=349–366 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/YakelBastian-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Society of American Archivists]] published Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp#_ftn1 |title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies |accessdate=30 March 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406075051/http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also promotes and disseminates a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SAA Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics |accessdate=2015-09-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|url=http://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has undergone several revisions since it was first adopted in 1980.&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

The [[Academy of Certified Archivists]] offers supplemental archival training by means of a certification program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Certified Archivists|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110317200502/http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/| archivedate= 17 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When first established in 1989, some critics of ACA certification objected to its annual membership fees, the theoretical versus practical nature of its tests, and the need for members to re-certify every five years. However, in the decades since, it has been agreed that such requirements are comparable with certification programs in other professions, and that certification strengthens professional standards and individual competencies. While some positions in archives require certification and many employers view certification as preferred, it is not required by all employers in the United States. Approximately 1,200+ archivists were certified by ACA, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/about-us/presidents-address-2/|title=2016 President’s Address {{!}} Welcome to the Academy of Certified Archivists|last=Jones|first=Louis|date=|website=www.certifiedarchivists.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations and continuing education==
Many archivists belong to a professional organization, such as the [[Society of American Archivists]], the [[Association of Canadian Archivists]], the [[Archives and Records Association]] (UK/Ireland), the [[Colombian College of Archivists - CCA]], and the [[Australian Society of Archivists]], as well as any number of local or regional associations.  These organizations often provide ongoing educational opportunities to their members and other interested practitioners.   In addition to formal degrees and or apprenticeships, many archivists take part in continuing education opportunities as available through professional associations and library school programs. New discoveries in the fields of [[media preservation]] and emerging technologies require continuing education as part of an archivist's job in order to stay current in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmelman |first=Nancy |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Continuing Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=367–395 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Zimmelman-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the profession==
The first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen's manuals of 1571.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest predecessors of archival science - Jacob von Rammingen's two manuals of registry and archival management, printed in 1571, translated by JBLD Strömberg. Lund: Wallin &amp; Dalholm, Lundaboken, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and Baldassare Bonifacio's ''De Archivis libris singularis'' of 1632.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sandri, 'Il "De Archivis" di Baldassare Bonifacio', ''Notizie delle Archive di Stato'', Roma, 1950, p. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled ''Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques'' (''Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives''), in which he systematized the archival theory of the ''[[respect des fonds]]'', first published by [[Natalis de Wailly]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;F. Hildesheimer, "Les Premières publications des Archives", ''Histoires de France, historiens de la France'', Paris, 1994, p. 280-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin, published the ''Handleiding voor het ordenen en beschrijven van archieven'' (''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives''). Produced for the Dutch Association of Archivists, it set out one hundred rules for archivists to base their work around. Notably, within these rules, the principle of preserving [[provenance]] and original order was first argued for as an essential trait of archival arrangement and description.&lt;ref name=Cook1997&gt;{{Citation

 | volume = 43
 | accessdate = 2013-07-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major text was the ''Manual of Archive Administration'' published in 1922 by [[Hilary Jenkinson]], then employed at the British [[Public Record Office]]: a revised edition appeared in 1937. In this work, Jenkinson states that archives are evidence and that the moral and physical defence of this evidential value is the central tenet of archival work. He further outlines his ideas of what an archive should be and how it should operate.

In 1956, [[T. R. Schellenberg]], who is known as the "Father of American Archival Appraisal",&lt;ref name=Cook1997/&gt; published ''Modern Archives''. Schellenberg's work was intended to be an academic textbook defining archival methodology and giving archivists specific technical instruction on workflow and arrangement. Moving away from Jenkinson's organic and passive approach to archival acquisition, where the administrator decided what was kept and what was destroyed, Schellenberg argued for a more active approach by archivists to appraisal. His primary (administrative) and secondary (research) value model for the management and appraisal of records and archives allowed government archivists greater control over the influx of material that they faced after the Second World War. As a result of the widespread adoption of Schellenberg's methods, especially in the United States of America, modern [[Records Management]] as a separate but related discipline was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Theodore R. | last=Schellenberg | year=1956 | title=Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Ernst Posner]] published ''Archives in the Ancient World''.  Posner's work emphasized that archives were not new inventions, but had existed in many different societies throughout recorded history.

In 1975, essays by [[Margaret C. Norton|Margaret Cross Norton]] were collected under the title of ''Norton on Archives: The Writings of Margaret Cross Norton on Archival and Records Management''. Norton was one of the founders of the [[Society of American Archivists]], and wrote essays based on her decades of experience working in the [[Illinois]] State Archives.

==Archives 2.0==

Archivists, like librarians, are taking advantage of [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as blogs, [[wiki]]s, as well as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open source]] philosophies. While Archives 2.0 may refer to implementing new technologies, it is also a way of engaging with archives in an effort to promote openness and flexibility of archival materials. This can be achieved through community participation in archives, archivists actively engaging with their collections, and promoting archival benefits in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theimer|first=Kate|date=2011|title=What is the Meaning of Archives 2.0?|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.74.1.h7tn4m4027407666|journal=The American Archivist|volume=74|pages=58–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Theimer writes that in order to understand Archives 2.0, it must be compared against Archives 1.0. She asserts that her representation of Archives 1.0 is by no means exhaustive or fully comprehensive of the breadth of archival experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following is a list of contrasts between 1.0 and 2.0.

* "Open, not closed;
* Transparent, not opaque;
* User centered, not record centered;
* Facilitator, not gatekeeper;
* Attracting new users, not relying on users to find them;
* Shared standards, not localized practice;
* Metrics and measurement, not 'unmeasurable' results;
* Iterative products, not 'perfect' products;
* Innovation and flexibility, not adhering to tradition;
* Technology savvy, not technology phobic;
* Value doing, not knowing;
* Confident about lobbying for resources, not hesitant beggars."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The technological tools of Archives 2.0 provide the foundational platforms to help the change from 1.0 to 2.0. When working in an archives that is dedicated to upholding 2.0 standards, the focus has shifted onto the user experience at an archives:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; community use, or research and reference help.

'''Bannai''' is a script form of the Islamic [[calligraphy]]. It was used primarily in [[Iran]] in the building [[inscription]]s. It is a kind of angular [[Kufic]] script, which has [[geometric]] forms like [[square]], [[rhombus]], [[rectangular]], [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] and [[cross]]ed [[Line (geometry)|line]]s. The foundation of Bannai script is the [[Horizontal and vertical|horizontal]] and [[Horizontal and vertical|vertical]] directions of the lines, which have always equal thickness and fill completely the geometrical form.&lt;ref&gt;

}}'''BonPatron''' is an online spelling and grammar checker for French. The site also includes guides for grammar, vocabulary, phonetics, and a verb conjugator.

== History ==

BonPatron was created as an academic project in 2001 by Terry Nadasdi ([[University of Alberta]]) and Stéfan Sinclair ([[McGill University]]). BonPatron initially targeted grammatical errors typically made by anglophone learners of French. Its purpose was to see how close a web-based grammar checker could replicate what teachers do when correcting student compositions (repeatedly indicating the same mistakes). BonPatron was initially called LePatron but changed its name in 2007 when it became a joint academic/commercial endeavour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonpatron.com/Resources/Docs/dublin.pdf|title=Anything I can do, CPU can do better: A comparison of human and computer grammar correction for L2 writing using BonPatron.com|last=Nadasdi|first=Terry|last2=Sinclair|first2=Stéfan|date=|year=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was initially designed for language learners in North America, but it is now used extensively by people whose first language is French, especially in France and Quebec.

In addition to the main grammar checker, other pedagogical resources have been added over the years (e.g.: a grammar guide, a vocabulary guide and a phonetics guide).

== Usage ==

BonPatron has two versions, one that is free and supported by ads (BonPatron.com) and the other that is subscription-based (Pro.BonPatron.com). Both draw on the same error database to identify and explain errors. The main difference is that the subscription-based version accepts longer texts. Native mobile apps are available for iOS and Android, developed in partnership with Alkeo.

In order to use BonPatron, the user supplies a text (typed or pasted from the clipboard) and hits the “Check” button. After doing so, the text is examined for typical errors. Errors will be flagged and relevant feedback will be displayed. BonPatron does not provide automatic correction. Rather, it supplies information to help the learner learn from the mistake. It is in this sense that BonPatron should be viewed as an interactive pedagogical tool rather than an editor or traditional grammar checker.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamel|first=Marie-Josée|date=|year=2008|title=Bon Patron – Parcours pédagogique critique du logiciel|url=|journal=Revue canadienne de linguistique appliquée|volume=11|issue=2|pages=123-131|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BonPatron website averages 4.5 million unique visitors annually and processes an average of 250,000 texts per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonpatron.com/faq/#Q_Who_Uses_BonPatron|title="BonPatron" Online Spelling and Grammar Checker for French as a Second Language|website=bonpatron.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and evaluation ==

BonPatron has been reviewed and evaluated by a number of scholars. The main findings from these evaluations are: a) BonPatron is able to identify approximately 90% of errors typical of learners writing in French&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burston|first=Jack|date=|year=2008|title=Bon Patron: An Online Spelling, Grammar, and Expression Checker|url=|journal=Calico Journal|volume=2|issue=25|pages=337-347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;; b) BonPatron stands apart from other grammar checkers because of its pedagogical design &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López Santiago|first=Mercedes|date=|year=2016|title=Review of BonPatron.com|url=https://polipapers.upv.es/index.php/eurocall/article/view/6515/7215|journal=The EUROCALL Review|volume=24|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; c) BonPatron promotes learning and its use leads to a reduced number of errors in learner texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bensalem|first=Samra|date=|year=2011|title=Le correcteur orthographique : quel apport pour l´amélioration de la compétence orthographique?|url=https://gerflint.fr/Base/Algerie12/samra_bensalem.pdf|journal=Synergies Algérie|volume=|issue=12|pages=233-240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Marie|date=|year=2013|title=Anglophone high school boys’ engagement and achievement in editing their French writing using the BonPatronPro|url=https://jcrl.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/jcrl/article/download/16093/pdf|journal=Journal of Classroom Research in Literacy|volume=|issue=6|pages=24-35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center''' (commonly known as the '''Carl Albert Center''') is a nonpartisan institution at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]] established for researching the [[United States Congress]] and, more generally, issues related to [[representative democracy]] and [[citizenship]].&lt;ref name="CAC home"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Carl Albert Center|url=http://www.ou.edu/carlalbertcenter/|website=The Carl Albert Congressional Research &amp; Studies Center|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma]]|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAC history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Mission |url=http://www.ou.edu/carlalbertcenter/history.html |website=The Carl Albert Congressional Research &amp; Studies Center |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma]] |accessdate=September 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124030100/http://www.ou.edu/carlalbertcenter/history.html |archivedate=November 24, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for [[Carl Albert]], a University of Oklahoma alumnus and the 46th [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="CAC home"/&gt; The current director is Cindy Rosenthal, who is also the Mayor of Norman.&lt;ref name="CAC staff"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayor|url=http://www.ci.norman.ok.us/content/mayor|website=City of Norman|publisher=[[Norman, Oklahoma]]|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Carl Albert Center was founded by the University of Oklahoma's Board of Regents and the [[Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education]] in 1979 with both state and private funds.&lt;ref name="CAC history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamino 15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamino|first1=Denise|title=Albert bill faces hurdle|url=http://newsok.com/albert-bill-faces-hurdle/article/2006545|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=[[NewsOK]]|date=December 15, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center's early federal funding proved to be controversial, as a "yearlong battle" occurred in Congress before it approved a $2-million appropriation in 1982.&lt;ref name="Gamino 21"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamino|first1=Denise|title=Lawmakers OK Research Center Funding for OU|url=http://newsok.com/lawmakers-ok-research-center-funding-for-ou/article/2007331|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=[[NewsOK]]|date=December 21, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight members in Oklahoma's congressional delegation that year, seven supported federal funding for the Carl Albert Center, with only [[Don Nickles]] opposing it.&lt;ref name="Gamino 21"/&gt; Nickles argued that the "Senate won't buy" the idea of federal funding for the Center, while [[Dave McCurdy]] (one of the seven in support) termed Nickles' opposition "unfortunate" and contended that the institution was "good for the University of Oklahoma" and "of national importance".&lt;ref name="Gamino 15"/&gt; In 1982, the Center contained 40 sets of congressional papers, 36 of which were from Oklahomans; however, a number of Oklahoma lawmakers wanted it to eventually become, in the words of journalist Denise Gamino, "the premier national repository for congressional papers".&lt;ref name="Gamino 15"/&gt; By 1989, the number of collections held at the Carl Albert Center had grown to 50, while the Center was selected as one of three host institutions for the [[National Historical Publications and Records Commission]]'s [[Andrew W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3064">'''Chloroplast capture''' is an evolutionary process through which inter-species [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and subsequent [[backcrossing|backcrosses]] yield a plant with new genetic combination of nuclear and chloroplast genomes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Loren H. Rieseberg|Rieseberg. L. H.]] and [[Soltis, D. E.]] (1991) [http://www3.botany.ubc.ca/rieseberglab/loren%20pubs/1991%20Evol%20Trends%20in%20Plants%20Rieseberg%20et%20al.pdf#search='Phylogenetic+consequences+of+cytoplasmic+gene+flow+in+plants' Phylogenetic consequences of cytoplasmic gene flow in plants]. Evolutionary Trends in Plants 5: 65-84&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 1) species A's (having chloroplast genome a and nuclear genome AA) [[pollen]]  hybridizes ([[backcrossing|backcross]]) to species B's (b and BB) [[ovule]], yielding the 1st hybrid (F1) with chloroplast genome b and nuclear genome A (50%) and B (50%); 2) species A's [[pollen]] again hybridizes ([[backcrossing|backcross]]) to F1's [[ovule]], yielding the 2nd hybrid (F2) with chloroplast genome b and nuclear genome A (75%) and B (25%); 3) species A's [[pollen]] again hybridizes ([[backcrossing|backcross]]) to F2's [[ovule]], yielding the 3rd hybrid (F3) with chloroplast genome b and nuclear genome A (87.5%) and B (12.5%); 4) after further backcross generations, a plant is obtained with the new genetic combination (chloroplast genome b and nuclear genome A).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4237">[[File:Chronospecies.svg|thumb|In [[palaeontology]], the evidence for [[species]] and [[evolution]] comes mainly from the [[comparative anatomy]] of [[fossil]]s. A chronospecies is defined in a single lineage (solid line) whose morphology changes with time. At some point, palaeontologists judge that enough change has occurred that two forms (A and B), separated in time and anatomy, once existed. If only sporadic examples of each survive in the fossil record, then the forms will appear sharply distinct.]]
A '''chronospecies''' is a [[species]] derived from a [[anagenesis|sequential development pattern]] which involves continual and uniform changes from an extinct ancestral form on an evolutionary scale. This sequence of alterations eventually produces a population which is physically, [[Comparative anatomy|morphologically]], and/or [[Genetics|genetically]] distinct from the original ancestors. Throughout this change, there is only one species in the lineage at any point in time, as opposed to cases where [[divergent evolution]] produces contemporary species with a common ancestor. The related term '''paleospecies''' (or '''palaeospecies''') indicates an extinct species only identified with [[fossil]] material. This identification relies on distinct similarities between the earlier fossil specimens and some proposed descendant, although the exact relationship to the later species is not always defined. In particular, the range of variation within all the early fossil specimens does not exceed the observed range which exists in the later species.

A '''paleosubspecies''' (or '''palaeosubspecies''') identifies an extinct [[subspecies]] which evolved into the currently existing form. This connection with relatively recent variations, usually from the [[Late Pleistocene]], often relies on the additional information available in [[subfossil]] material. Most of the current species have changed in size [[adaptation (biology)|adapting]] to the climatic changes during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] (''see'' [[Bergmann's Rule]]).

The further identification of fossil specimens as part of a "chronospecies" relies on additional similarities which more strongly indicate a specific relationship with a known species. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Howard | first = Hildegarde | authorlink= Hildegarde Howard | title = An ancestral Golden Eagle raises a question in taxonomy | journal = [[Auk (journal)|The Auk]] | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–291 | year = 1947 | url = http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v064n02/p0287-p0291.pdf | doi= 10.2307/4080550}}&lt;/ref&gt; relatively recent specimens – hundreds of thousands to a few million years old – with consistent variations (e.g. always smaller but with the same proportions) as a living species might represent the final step in a chronospecies. This possible identification of the immediate ancestor of the living [[taxon]] may also rely on [[stratigraphic]] information to establish the age of the specimens.

The concept of chronospecies is related to the [[phyletic gradualism]] model of evolution, and also relies on an extensive fossil record, since morphological changes accumulate over time and two very different organisms could be connected by a series of intermediaries.

Clinical or medical virology is a branch of [[medicine]] (more particularly of [[clinical pathology]]) which consists in isolating and/or in characterising one or several viruses responsible for some human pathologies by various direct or indirect techniques (cellular Cultures, serologies, biochemistry, molecular biology). It also consists in proving the absence of resistance of viruses in treatment antiviral by viral genome sequencing to adapt antiviral therapeutics at best.

The '''conservation and restoration of herbaria''' includes the preventative care, repair, and restoration of [[herbarium]] specimens. This is performed by [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[curator]]s, and [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] on herbarium collections in universities and museums. Herbarium specimens may be susceptible to [[water damage]], [[mold]], [[Pest (organism)|pests]], unattached specimens, [[dust]] and [[dirt]], and damage from improper storage conditions. [[Collections care|Preventative conservation]] can prevent much of the damage that could occur.

==Herbarium==
A herbarium is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens and associated data used for scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a herbarium|url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/herbarium/what-is-a-herbarium|website=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts. These will usually be dried and pressed and mounted on a sheet of paper but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Conserve O Gram - Preparing and Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=November 2009|website=National Park Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of specimens ===
* '''Pressed and dried:''' [[Vascular plant]] (flowering plants, [[conifer]]s, [[fern]]s) specimens are pressed and dried plants that are mounted on herbarium sheets. Various techniques are used to attach the plants with the most common method using archival adhesive and, if necessary, heavier portions of the plant are supported additionally by [[linen]] thread or narrow strips of gum-backed linen tape or polyester film (Mylar). If there are loose [[seed]]s or [[fruit]]s, these are placed in a small fragment packet, which also is glued to the sheet. A label with collection information is glued on the bottom right corner. 
* '''Dried:''' Small [[bryophyte]]s ([[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|hepatics]] or liverworts, and [[hornwort]]s) are dried and placed loose in folded packets. The label is glued on the front of the packet and the packets are filed loose in boxes, glued to sheets of mounting paper, or placed loose in folders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Causes of deterioration==

===Pests===
Common herbarium pests include:[[File:Silverfish 2007-2.jpg|thumb|Silverfish]]
*[[Silverfish]] 
* [[Psocoptera|book lice (psocids)]]
* [[Lasioderma|cigarette or tobacco beetles (Lasioderma]])
* [[Dermestidae|dermestids]]
* [[Drugstore beetle|drugstore beetles (Stegobium paniceum)]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
A reoccurring threat to the longevity of herbarium specimens is insects, a number of which find dried plants palatable. Historically, various methods have been used to kill insects, which either come in with the plants when they are collected or are in the building where the plants are stored.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bio.cgrer.uiowa.edu/herbarium/HerbariaAndSpecimens.htm#driedplants|title=Herbaria and Specimens: What Are They?|last=Horton|first=Diana|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pests are commonly treated with two different methods:
* '''Freezing:''' the specimen is placed inside a clear [[polyester]] bag with excess air pushed out and heat sealed, or place inside polythene bags and sealed with parcel tape. Then it is placed into a normal domestic freezer for at least 14 days at a temperature of −18&amp;nbsp;°C, or for 72 hours if freezing at -30&amp;nbsp;°C.
* '''Anoxia:''' this method starves the pests of oxygen. Small anoxic environments are created using sealed barrier films and placing [[oxygen scavenger]]s and [[RH buffer]]s inside before sealing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_botanical_specimens.pdf|title=Care and conservation of botanical specimens|last=|first=|date=2013|website=The Institute of Conservation (Icon) and Natural Sciences Collections Association (NatSCA)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Integrated Pest Management (for museums)|integrated pest management]] program is cost-effective over time and the best preventative measure against pests.

===Fungal attack===
The primary risk factor for [[Mold|fungal]] attack is incomplete drying of specimens, caused either during the specimen preparation process or afterwards, or in collections that become wet later through [[flood]], other water damage or improper storage conditions, especially in the [[tropics]]. Properly dried plant specimens will not suffer from fungal attack if stored in the correct conditions. During the drying process specimens are particularly at risk if they dry slowly. This happens through poor drying conditions or specimens being wet before being pressed or having water-retaining or [[Succulent plant|succulent]] parts. Specimens with sugary [[Exudate#Plant exudates|exudations]] or large quantities of nectar are also particularly attractive to fungi and need special care during drying to ensure that they dry fast enough to prevent mold growth. If fungal growth occurs on specimens, it can be brushed with 95% [[ethanol]] or [[Denatured alcohol|methylated spirits]] (denatured alcohol). However, this may alter the specimen for chemical and other investigative research and only kills the fungus present on the specimen, not preventing further problems of fungal growth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natsca.org/sites/default/files/publications/books/Vascular%20plants.pdf|title=Vascular plants|last=Bedford|first=David J.|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light ===
Herbarium specimens are sensitive to [[Light|visible light]] and [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], which can cause fading of biological [[pigment]]s (fading or shifts in color) and/or damage to chemical bonds (weakened or embrittled).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/AppendixT.pdf|title=Appendix T: Curatorial Care of Biological Collections|last=|first=|date=2005|website=National Park Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature and RH ===
High temperatures contribute to [[desiccation]]. The rate of any chemical reaction that damages specimens will double with each 10&amp;nbsp;°C rise in temperature. Excessive moisture in the air (above 65% relative humidity) encourages pest infestation and/or the softening of some adhesives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Preventative care==

===Environment===
Specimens are stored in environmentally controlled storage rooms away from direct sunlight with limited exposure to other light sources to minimize causes of deterioration. Storage rooms are kept at a [[relative humidity]] (RH) level of between 45% and 55%. [[Temperature]] levels are kept between 18&amp;nbsp;°C and 22&amp;nbsp;°C. Store rooms are never completely immune to pests. Pest infestations are reduced by the regular vacuuming of storage areas and not allowing any food or drink in the storage rooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Sarracenia purpurea herbarium specimens.jpg|thumb|Specimens in front of metal herbarium cabinets.]]

===Storage and handling ===
Specimens are stored in standard herbarium cabinets, as metal shelves can be easily cleaned and a well-sealed cabinet will provide a stable micro-climate for the specimens. Metal cabinets do not release [[volatile organic compound]]s, like wooden cabinets do.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plants are thoroughly dry and free of pests before placing in cabinets to prevent deterioration. Specimens mounted on sheets are kept flat and placed on stiff cardboard or in a box when moving them from cabinets to work spaces to minimize damage during examination. The weight from folders stacked too high can cause damage to lower specimens. Folders are kept specimen-side up and never turned over, so the specimens are never face down. During examinations, handlers review for potential maintenance (loose specimens, unattached specimens, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Leaning on herbarium sheets, writing notes on top of them, or placing heavy items or elbows on them can cause serious damage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Older herbaria specimens may have been treated with toxic chemicals including [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[arsenic]] to prevent pests. Handlers wear [[Medical glove|nitrile]] gloves and work in a well ventilated room when working with specimens prepared earlier than 1989. The card on which the specimen is mounted and the specimen itself may contain the chemicals. The dust on herbaria sheets may be contaminated, so conservators wear a [[dust mask]] and use a dust extractor or [[Fume hood|fume cupboard]] when cleaning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Repair and restoration==
===Cleaning=== 
Dust and dirt are removed from herbarium sheets by using a smoke sponge. Conservators gently rub the place where the dirt is and then softly remove any excess with a fine brush.

=== Broken specimens=== 
Broken specimens are reattached to the herbaria sheet using thinly cut strips of archival pre-gummed linen tape. Detached materials such as seeds, leaves, etc., are placed in an acid-free card fragment packet, which is secured onto the sheet with the original specimen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Neuchâtel Herbarium - Equisetum sylvaticum - NEU000001915.tif|thumb|Pressed and dried specimen with linen tape supports.]]

=== Removal from mounting sheet ===
Unattached specimens are removed from the herbaria sheet by humidifying it to make them pliable and removing the plant with a paper lifter (smooth wooden spatula). They are then placed to dry and flatten along with the original mounting sheet and written documentation (label and annotations). The specimen and original documents are then remounted to a new sheet using the original sheet as reference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Disaster recovery ===
Unforeseen disasters can occur at any time and [[Emergency response (museum)#Preparedness|disaster recovery]] planning and materials for herbaria are similar to [[museum]]s and [[Library|libraries]]. Little can be done with burnt specimens and fragmented specimens except to preserve and protect what is left intact. The damage most likely to occur is water damage through natural or man made flooding, such as roof leakage or [[Fire sprinkler system|fire sprinkler]] malfunction. Damaged of waterlogged specimens are frozen to delay deterioration and prevent fungal attack, which gives curators time to evaluate the situation and decide how best to approach the problem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Depiction''' is reference conveyed through pictures. Basically a picture refers to its object through a non-linguistic two-dimensional scheme. A picture is not writing or notation. A depictive two-dimensional scheme is called a [[picture plane]] and may be constructed according to [[descriptive geometry]] where they are usually divided between ''projections'' (orthogonal and various oblique angles) and ''perspectives'' (according to number of vanishing points). Pictures are made with various materials and techniques, such as painting, drawing, or prints (including photography and movies) mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, and collages of unusual and disparate elements. Occasionally, picture-like features may be recognised in simple inkblots, accidental stains, peculiar clouds or a glimpse of the moon, but these are special cases, and it is controversial whether they count as genuine instances of depiction.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Robert Hopkins (1998), "Picture, Image, Experience" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, sculpture and theatrical performances are sometimes said to depict, but this requires a broad understanding of 'depict', as simply designating a form of representation that is not linguistic or notational. The bulk of studies of depiction however deal only with pictures. While sculpture and performance clearly represent or refer, they do not strictly picture their objects. 
 
Objects pictured may be factual or fictional, literal or metaphorical, realistic or idealised and in various combination. Idealised depiction is also termed schematic or stylised and extends to icons, diagrams and maps. Classes or styles of picture may abstract their objects by degrees, conversely, establish degrees of the concrete (usually called, a little confusingly, figuration or figurative, since the 'figurative' is then often quite literal). Stylisation can lead to the fully abstract picture, where reference is only to conditions for a picture plane – a severe exercise in self-reference and ultimately a sub-set of pattern.

But just ''how'' pictures function remains controversial. Philosophers, art historians and critics, perceptual psychologists and other researchers in the arts and social sciences have contributed to the debate and many of the most influential contributions have been interdisciplinary. Some key positions are briefly surveyed below.

== Resemblance ==

Traditionally, depiction is distinguished from denotative meaning by the presence of a [[mimesis|mimetic]] element or resemblance. A picture resembles its object in a way a word or sound does not. Resemblance is no guarantee of depiction, obviously. Two pens may resemble one another but do not therefore depict each other. To say a picture resembles its object especially is only to say that its object is that which it especially resembles; which strictly begins with the picture itself. Indeed, since everything resembles something in some way, mere resemblance as a distinguishing trait is trivial. Moreover, depiction is no guarantee of resemblance to an object. A picture of a dragon does not resemble an actual dragon. So resemblance is not enough.

Theories have tried either to set further conditions to the kind of resemblance necessary, or sought ways in which a notational system might allow such resemblance. It is widely believed that the problem with a resemblance theory of depiction is that resemblance is a symmetrical relation between terms (necessarily, if x resembles y, then y resembles x) while in contrast depiction is at best a non-symmetrical relation (it is not necessary that, if x depicts y, y depicts x). If this is right, then depiction and resemblance cannot be identified, and a resemblance theory of depiction is forced to offer a more complicated explanation, for example by relying on experienced resemblance instead, which clearly is an asymmetrical notion (that you experience x as resembling y does not mean you also experience y as resembling x).&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Hopkins (1998), Christopher Peacocke (1987) 'Depiction', in Philosophical Review 96(3):383-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued, however, that the concept of resemblance is not exclusively a relational notion, and so that the initial problem is merely apparent.&lt;ref&gt;John Hyman (2012), 'Depiction', in Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 71:129-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In art history, the history of actual attempts to achieve resemblance in depictions is usually covered under the terms "[[realism (arts)|realism]]", [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]]", or "[[illusionism]]".

== Illusion ==

The most famous and elaborate case for resemblance modified by reference, is made by art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960) ''Art and Illusion'' (Oxford: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1963) Meditations on a Hobbyhorse (Oxford, Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. ''The Image and the Eye'' (Oxford and New York: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance in pictures is taken to involve illusion. Instincts in [[visual perception]] are said to be triggered or alerted by pictures, even when we are rarely deceived. The eye supposedly cannot resist finding resemblances that accord with illusion. Resemblance is thus narrowed to something like the seeds of illusion. Against the one-way relation of reference Gombrich argues for a weaker or labile relation, inherited from [[:wikt:substitution|substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960): pp 80-98, (1982): pp 278–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures are thus both more primitive and powerful than stricter reference.

But whether a picture can deceive a little while it represents as much seems gravely compromised. Claims for innate dispositions in sight are also contested. Gombrich appeals to an array of psychological research from [[James J. Gibson]], R. L. Gregory, John M. Kennedy, Konrad Lorenz, Ulric Neisser and others in arguing for an 'optical' basis to perspective, in particular (see also [[perspective (graphical)]]. Subsequent cross-cultural studies in depictive competence and related studies in child-development and vision impairment are inconclusive at best.

Gombrich's convictions have important implications for his popular history of art,&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1995), The Story Of Art 16th ed. (London: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment and priorities there. In a later study by John Willats (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Willats, John, (1997), ''Art and Representation: New Principles In The Analysis Of Pictures'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; on the variety and development of picture planes, Gombrich's views on the greater realism of perspective underpin many crucial findings.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (1995), pp. 133, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual invariants ==

A more frankly behaviouristic view is taken by the perceptual psychologist [[James J. Gibson]],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J., 'The Ecological approach to Visual Perception in Pictures' Leonardo, 1978, 11, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; partly in response to Gombrich. Gibson treats visual perception as the eye registering necessary information for behaviour in a given environment. The information is filtered from light rays that meet the retina. The light is called the stimulus energy or sensation. The information consists of underlying patterns or 'invariants' for vital features to the environment.

Gibson's view of depiction concerns the re-presentation of these invariants. In the case of illusions or trompe l'oeil, the picture also conveys the stimulus energy, but generally the experience is of perceiving two sets of invariants, one for the picture surface, another for the object pictured. He pointedly rejects any seeds of illusion or substitution and allows that a picture represents when two sets of invariants are displayed. But invariants tell us little more than that the resemblance is visible, dual invariants only that the terms of reference are the same as those for resemblance

== Seeing-in ==

A similar duality is proposed by the philosopher of art [[Richard Wollheim]]. He calls it 'twofoldness'.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard (1987), ''Painting as an Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson) pp 46-7, 72-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Our experience of the picture surface is called the 'configurational' aspect, and our experience of the object depicted the 'recognitional'. Wollheim's main claim is that we are simultaneously aware of both the surface and the depicted object. The concept of twofoldness has been very influential in contemporary analytic aesthetics, especially in the writings of [[Dominic Lopes]]&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, Dominic (2005), Sight and Sensibility: Evaluating Pictures (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Bence Nanay]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanay, Bence (2005), 'Is Twofoldness Necessary for Representational Seeing?', British Journal of Aesthetics 45(3): 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, illusion is forestalled by the prominence of the picture surface where an object is depicted. Yet the object depicted quite simply ''is'' the picture surface under one reading, the surface indifferent to picture, another. The two are hardly compatible or simultaneous. Nor do they ensure a reference relation.

Wollheim introduces the concept of 'seeing-in' to qualify depictive resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim (1987), pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing-in is a psychological disposition to detect a resemblance between certain surfaces, such as inkblots or accidental stains, etc. and three-dimensional objects. The eye is not deceived, but finds or projects some resemblance to the surface. This is not quite depiction, since the resemblance is only incidental to the surface. The surface does not strictly refer to such objects. Seeing-in is a necessary condition to depiction, and sufficient when in accordance with the maker's intentions, where these are clear from certain features to a picture. But seeing-in cannot really say in what way such surfaces resemble objects either, only specify where they perhaps first occur.

Wollheim's account of how a resemblance is agreed or modified, whereby maker and user anticipate each other's roles, does not really explain how a resemblance refers, but rather when an agreed resemblance obtains.

== Other psychological resources ==

The appeal to broader psychological factors in qualifying depictive resemblance is echoed in the theories of philosophers such as Robert Hopkins,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Robert (1998), Picture, Image, and Experience (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Schier&lt;ref&gt;Schier, Flint (1986), Deeper Into Pictures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall (1990), Mimesis as Make-believe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; They enlist 'experience', 'recognition' and 'imagination' respectively. Each provides additional factors to an understanding or interpretation of pictorial reference, although none can explain how a picture resembles an object (if indeed it does), nor how this resemblance is then also a reference.

For example, Schier returns to the contrast with language to try to identify a crucial difference in depictive competence. Understanding a pictorial style does not depend upon learning a vocabulary and syntax. Once grasped, a style allows the recognition of any object known to the user. Of course recognition allows a great deal more than that – books teaching children to read often introduce them to many exotic creatures such as a kangaroo or armadillo through illustrations. Many fictions and caricatures are promptly recognised without prior acquaintance of either a particular style or the object in question.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Stephanie (1971), 'Caricature', The Monist 58: pp 285-93.&lt;/ref&gt; So competence cannot rely on a simple index or synonymy for objects and styles.

Schier's conclusion that lack of syntax and semantics in reference then qualifies as depiction, leaves dance, architecture, animation, sculpture and music all sharing the same mode of reference. This perhaps points as much to limitations in a linguistic model.

== Notation ==
Reversing orthodoxy, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson (1968), Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis and New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt; starts from reference and attempts to assimilate resemblance. He denies resemblance as either necessary or sufficient condition for depiction but surprisingly, allows that it arises and fluctuates as a matter of usage or familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), pp. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Goodman, a picture denotes. Denotation is divided between description, covering writing and extending to more discursive notation including music and dance scores, to depiction at greatest remove. However, a word does not grow to resemble its object, no matter how familiar or preferred. To explain how a pictorial notation does, Goodman proposes an analogue system, consisting of undifferentiated characters, a density of syntax and semantics and relative repleteness of syntax. These requirements taken in combination mean that a one-way reference running from picture to object encounters a problem. If its semantics is undifferentiated, then the relation flows back from object to picture. Depiction can acquire resemblance but must surrender reference. This is a point tacitly acknowledged by Goodman, conceding firstly that density is the antithesis of notation&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that lack of differentiation may actually permit resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson and Elgin, Catherine Z, (1988) Reconceptions in Philosophy (London and New York: Routledge) p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation without notation lacks sense.

Nevertheless, Goodman's framework is revisited by philosopher John Kulvicki&lt;ref&gt;Kulvicki, John (2006), On Images: Their structure and content (Oxford: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by art historian James Elkins&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James (1999), The Domain of Images (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; to an array of hybrid artefacts, combining picture, pattern and notation.

== Pictorial semiotics ==

Pictorial [[semiotics]] aims for just the kind of integration of depiction with notation undertaken by Goodman, but fails to identify his requirements for syntax and semantics. It seeks to apply the model of structural linguistics, to reveal core meanings and permutations for pictures of all kinds, but stalls in identifying constituent elements of reference, or as semioticians prefer, 'signification'. Similarly, they accept resemblance although call it 'iconicity' (after [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles Sanders - (1931-58), Collected Papers I-VIII. Hartshorne, C, Weiss, P, &amp; Burks, A, (eds.) (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; 1931–58) and are uncomfortable in qualifying its role. Older practitioners, such as [[Roland Barthes]]&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland (1969), Elements of semiology (Paris, 1967) translated by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith, (London: Cape).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto (1980), A Theory of Semiotics (Milan 1976) (Bloomington: Indiana University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; variously shift analysis to underlying 'connotations' for an object depicted or concentrate on description of purported content at the expense of more medium-specific meaning. Essentially they establish a more general [[iconography]].

A later adherent, Göran Sonesson,&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (1989), Pictorial Concepts: Inquiries into the semiotic heritage and its relevance for the analysis of the visual world. (Lund: Aris/Lund University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (2001), 'Iconicity strikes back: the third generation – or why Eco is still wrong'. VISIO 9: 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; rejects Goodman's terms for syntax and semantics as alien to linguistics, no more than an ideal and turns instead to the findings of perceptual psychologists, such as J. M. Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John M. (1974) The Psychology of Picture Perception (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass).&lt;/ref&gt; N. H. Freeman&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H. and Cox, M. V. (eds.) (1985), Visual Order: The Nature and Development of Pictorial Representation (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H., Evans, D., and Willats, J. (1988) Symposium overview: the computational approach to projection drawing-systems. (Budapest, Paper given at Third European Conference on Developmental Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt; and David Marr&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1977), 'Analysis of occluding outline', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B 197 441-475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1978), 'Representing visual information: a computational approach.' in Computer Vision, A. R. Hanson and E. M. Riseman (eds.) Academic Press, New York and London, pp. 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to detect underlying structure. Sonesson accepts 'seeing-in',&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (Revised August 2006), 'Current issues in pictorial semiotics. Lecture three: From the Critique of the Iconicity Critique to Pictorality' . Third conference of a series published online at the Semiotics Institute Online. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although prefers Edmund Husserl's version.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1928), Zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins. Halle. (Republished in Husserliana X, The Hague: Nijhoff, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1980), Phantasie, Bildbewusstsein, Erinnerung, Husserliana XXIII. (The Hague: Nijhoff).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance is again grounded in optics or the visible, although this does not exclude writing nor reconcile resemblance with reference. Discussion tends to be restricted to the function of outlines in schemes for depth.

==Deixis==
The art historian [[Norman Bryson]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Norman (1983) Vision and Painting: The Logic of The Gaz, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; persists with a linguistic model and advances a detail of parsing and tense, '[[deixis]]'. He rejects resemblance and illusion as incompatible with the ambiguities and interpretation available to pictures and is also critical of the inflexible nature of structuralist analysis. Deixis is taken as the rhetoric of the narrator, indicating the presence of the speaker in a discourse, a bodily or physical aspect as well as an explicit temporal dimension. In depiction this translates as a difference between 'The [[Gaze]]' where deixis is absent and 'The Glance' where it is present. Where present, details to materials indicate how long and in what way the depiction was made, where absent, a telling suppression or prolonging of the act. The distinction attempts to account for the 'plastic' or medium-specific qualities absent from earlier semiotic analyses and somewhat approximates the 'indexic' aspect to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#Icon, index, symbol|signs introduced by Peirce]].

Deixis offers a more elaborate account of the picture surface and broad differences to expression and application but cannot qualify resemblance.

==Iconography==
Lastly, iconography is the study of pictorial content, mainly in art, and would seem to ignore the question of how to concentrate upon what. But iconography's findings take a rather recondite view of content, are often based on subtle literary, historical and cultural allusion and highlight a sharp difference in terms of resemblance, optical accuracy or intuitive illusion. Resemblance is hardly direct or spontaneous for the iconographer, reference rarely to the literal or singular. Visual perception here is subject to reflection and research, the object as much reference as referent.

The distinguished art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, Erwin (1955) Meaning in the Visual Arts (New York: Doubleday).&lt;/ref&gt; allowed three levels to iconography. The first is 'natural' content, the object recognised or resembling without context, on a second level, a modifying historical and cultural context and at a third, deeper level, a fundamental structure or ideology (called iconology). He even ascribed the use of perspective a deep social meaning (1927). However more recently, a natural or neutral level tends to be abandoned as mythical. The cultural scholar [[W. J. T. Mitchell]]&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1980), The Language of Images (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1986), Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology, (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1994), Picture Theory (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt; looks to ideology to determine resemblance and depiction as acknowledgement of shifts in relations there, albeit by an unspecified scheme or notation.

Iconography points to differences in scope for a theory of depiction. Where stylistics and a basic object is nominated, resemblance is prominent, but where more elaborate objects are encountered, or terms for nature denied, simple perception or notation flounder. The difference corresponds somewhat to the division in philosophy between the analytic and continental.

==Other issues==
Dozens of factors influence depictions and how they are represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T. J.|last2=Greenwood|first2=Keith|date=2016-03-08|title=Beyond Framing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the equipment used to create the depiction, the creator’s intent, vantage point, mobility, proximity, publication format, among others, and, when dealing with human subjects, their potential desire for impression management.

Other debates about the nature of depiction include the relationship between seeing something in a picture and seeing face to face, whether depictive representation is [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], how understanding novel depictions is possible, the [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] value of depiction and the nature of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in pictorial [[art]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9277">The '''ELIZA effect''', in [[computer science]], is the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors, that is [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]].

==Overview==
In its specific form, the ELIZA effect refers only to "the susceptibility of people to read far more understanding than is warranted into strings of symbols—especially words—strung together by computers".&lt;ref name="Hofstadter1996"&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trivial example of the specific form of the Eliza effect, given by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], involves an [[automated teller machine]] which displays the words "THANK YOU" at the end of a transaction. A (very) casual observer might think that the machine is actually expressing gratitude; however, the machine is only printing a preprogrammed string of symbols.&lt;ref name=Hofstadter1996/&gt;

More generally, the ELIZA effect describes any situation&lt;ref name="Fenton-Kerr1999"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=GAIA: An Experimental Pedagogical Agent for Exploring Multimodal Interaction|title=Computation for Metaphors, Analogy, and Agents|last=Fenton-Kerr|first=Tom|year=1999|publisher=Springer|page=156|doi=10.1007/3-540-48834-0_9|quote=''Although Hofstadter is emphasizing the text mode here, the "Eliza effect" can be seen in almost all modes of human/computer interaction.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ekbia2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Artificial Dreams: The Quest for Non-Biological Intelligence|last=Ekbia|first=Hamid R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-87867-8|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wEIlNjO0x0C&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, based solely on a system's output, users perceive computer systems as having "intrinsic qualities and abilities which the software controlling the (output) cannot possibly achieve"&lt;ref name="King1995"&gt;{{Cite techreport|title=Anthropomorphic Agents: Friend, Foe, or Folly|first=W.|last=King|id=M-95-1|publisher=University of Washington|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "assume that [outputs] reflect a greater causality than they actually do".&lt;ref name="Rouse2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Organizational Simulation|last=Rouse|first=William B.|last2=Boff|first2=Kenneth R.|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|year=2005|isbn=978-0-471-73943-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=371wV4dI7ckC&amp;pg=PA308|pages=308–309|quote=''This is a particular problem in digital environments where the "Eliza effect" as it is sometimes called causes interactors to assume that the system is more intelligent than it is, to assume that events reflect a greater causality than they actually do.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both its specific and general forms, the ELIZA effect is notable for occurring even when users of the system are aware of the [[determinate]] nature of output produced by the system. From a psychological standpoint, the ELIZA effect is the result of a subtle [[cognitive dissonance]] between the user's awareness of programming limitations and their behavior towards the output of the [[computer program|program]].&lt;ref name="Ekbia2008_quote"&gt;{{cite book|title=Artificial Dreams: The Quest for Non-Biological Intelligence|last=Ekbia|first=Hamid R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-87867-8|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wEIlNjO0x0C&amp;pg=PA156|quote=''But people '''want''' to believe that the program is "seeing" a football game at some plausible level of abstraction.

Collins of course knew that his program didn't deal with anything resembling a two-dimensional world of smoothly moving dots (let alone simplified human bodies), and presumably he thought that his readers, too, would realize this. He couldn't have suspected, however, how powerful the Eliza effect is.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the ELIZA effect was an important development in [[artificial intelligence]], demonstrating the principle of using [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] rather than explicit programming to pass a [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name="Trappl2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Emotions in Humans and Artifacts|last=Trappl|first=Robert|last2=Petta|first2=Paolo|last3=Payr|first3=Sabine|page=353|year=2002|isbn=978-0-262-20142-1|quote=''The "Eliza effect" — the tendency for people to treat programs that respond to them as if they had more intelligence than they really do (Weizenbaum 1966) is one of the most powerful tools available to the creators of virtual characters.''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jTgMIhy6YZMC&amp;pg=PA353|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The effect is named for the 1966 [[chatterbot]] [[ELIZA]], developed by MIT computer scientist [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]. When executing Weizenbaum's ''DOCTOR'' [[scripting language|script]], ELIZA parodied a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian]] [[psychotherapist]], largely by rephrasing the "patient{{"'}}s replies as questions:

:Human: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.
:ELIZA: Your boyfriend made you come here?
:Human: He says I'm depressed much of the time.
:ELIZA: I am sorry to hear you are depressed.
:Human: It's true. I'm unhappy.
:ELIZA: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?&lt;ref name="Güzeldere1"&gt;{{cite web |title=dialogues with colorful personalities of early ai |last=Güzeldere |first=Güven |author2=Franchi, Stefano |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/dialogues.html |accessdate=2007-07-30 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uQo99jVH?url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/dialogues.html |archivedate=2010-11-22 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6994">The '''electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide''' ('''ERC''') is the conversion of [[carbon dioxide]] to more [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced chemical species]] using electrical energy. The first examples of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide are from the 19th century, when carbon dioxide was reduced to [[carbon monoxide]] using a [[zinc]] [[cathode]]. Research in this field intensified in the 1980s following the [[oil embargo]]es of the 1970s.  Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide represents a possible means of producing chemicals or fuels, converting carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) to organic feedstocks such as [[Formic acid|formic acid (HCOOH)]], [[Methanol|methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)]], [[Ethylene|ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Methane|methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], and [[Carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide (CO)]].&lt;ref name=Centi&gt;Gabriele Centi, Siglinda Perathoner "Opportunities and prospects in the chemical recycling of carbon dioxide to fuels" Catalysis Today 148 (2009) 191–205.{{doi|10.1016/j.cattod.2009.07.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

== Chemicals from carbon dioxide ==
In [[carbon fixation]], plants convert carbon dioxide into sugars, from which many biosynthetic pathways originate.  The catalyst responsible for this conversion, [[RuBisCo]], is the most common protein on earth. Some anaerobic organisms employ enzymes to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to [[carbon monoxide]], from which fatty acids can be made.&lt;ref&gt;1. J. C. Fontecilla-Camps, P. Amara, C. Cavazza, Y. Nicolet and A. Volbeda, "Structure-function relationships of anaerobic gas-processing metalloenzymes", Nature 2009, volume 460, p. 814-822.{{doi|10.1038/nature08299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industry, a few products are made from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, including [[urea]], [[salicylic acid]], [[methanol]], and certain inorganic and organic carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Topham, "Carbon Dioxide" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the laboratory, carbon dioxide is sometimes used to prepare [[carboxylic acid]]s.  No electrochemical process involving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been commercialized.

==Electrocatalysis==
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to CO is usually described as:
: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   →   CO   + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The redox potential for this reaction is similar to that for hydrogen evolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus electrochemical reduction of CO2 is usually competitive with hydrogen evolution reaction.&lt;ref name= Jitaru/&gt;

Electrochemical methods have gained significant attention: 1) at ambient pressure and room temperature; 2) in connection with renewable energy sources (see also [[solar fuel]]) 3) competitive controllability, modularity and scale-up is relatively simple.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lee et al., ChemSusChem 9 (2016) 333-344, Electrode Build-Up of Reducible Metal Composites toward Achievable Electrochemical Conversion of Carbon Dioxide{{DOI|10.1002/cssc.201501112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrochemical reduction or electrocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can produce value-added chemicals such methane, ethylene, ethane, etc., and the products are mainly dependent on the selected catalysts and operating potentials (applying reduction voltage).&lt;ref&gt;S.

'''[[Eye movement]] in scene viewing''' refers to the [[visual processing]] of information presented in scenes. This phenomenon has been studied in a range of areas such as [[cognitive psychology]] and [[psychophysics]], where eye movement can be monitored under experimental conditions. A core aspect in these studies is the division of eye movements into [[saccades]], the rapid movement of the eyes, and fixations, the focus of the eyes on a point. There are several factors which influence eye movement in scene viewing, both the task and knowledge of the viewer (top-down factors), and the properties of the image being viewed (bottom-up factors). The study of eye movement in scene viewing helps to understand visual processing in more natural environments.

Typically, when presented with a scene, viewers demonstrate short fixation durations and long saccade amplitudes in the earlier phases of viewing an image, representing ambient processing. This is followed by longer fixations and shorter saccades in the latter phases of scene viewing, representing focal processing (Pannasch et al., 2008).

Eye movement behaviour in scene viewing differs between different levels of cognitive development. Fixation durations shorten and saccade amplitudes lengthen with the increase in age. In children, the development of saccades to the amplitude normally found in adults have occur earlier (4–6 years old) than the development of fixation durations (6–8 years old). Yet, the typical pattern of behaviour during scene viewing, when progressing from ambient processing to focal processing, has been observed to occur from the age of 2 years old (Helo, Pannasch, Sirri &amp; Rämä, 2014).

== Spatial variation ==

There are particular factors which affect where eye movements fixate upon, these include bottom-up factors inherent to the stimulus, and top-down factors inherent to the viewer. Even an initial glimpse of a scene has been found to generate an abstract representation of the image that can be stored in memory for use in subsequent eye movements (Castelhano &amp; Henderson, 2007).

In bottom-up factors, eye guidance can be affected by the local contrast or salience of features in an image (Itti &amp; Koch, 2000). An example of this would be an area with a large difference in luminance (Parkhurst et al., 2002), a greater density of edges (Mannan, Ruddock &amp; Wooding, 1996) or binocular disparity determining the distance of different objects on the scene (Jansen et al., 2009).

The top-down factors of scenes have more of an impact than bottom-up features in affecting fixation positions. Behaviourally relevant information that are more interesting in a scene is more salient than low-level features, drawing fixations more frequently and more quickly from scene onset (Onat, Açik, Schumann &amp; König, 2014). Local scene colour in a fixation position has an influence on where fixations occur. The presence of colour can increase the likelihood of the item being processed as a semantic object as it can aid the discrimination of the object, making it more interesting to view (Amano &amp; Foster, 2014). When viewers are semantically primed by being presented with consistently similar scenes, the density of fixations increase, and fixation durations decrease (Henderson, Weeks Jr., &amp; Hollingworth, 1999).

Information separate to what is presented in a scene also has an effect on the area being fixated upon. Eye movements can be guided anticipatorily by linguistic input, where if an item in the scene is presented verbally, the listener will be more likely to move their visual focus to that object (Staub, Abott &amp; Bogartz, 2012).
With regard to factors relating to viewers rather than the scene, differences have been found in cross-cultural research. Westerners have an inclination to concentrate on focal objects in a scene, where they look at focal objects more often and quicker in comparison to East Asians who attend more to contextual information, where they make more saccades to the background of the scene (Chua, Boland &amp; Nisbett, 2002).

== Temporal variation ==

Regarding the temporality of fixations,  average fixation durations last for 300ms on average, although there is a large variability around this approximation. Some of this variability can be explained through global properties of an image, impacting upon both bottom-up processing and top-down processing.

During natural scene viewing, the masking of an image by replacing it with a grey field during fixations has an increase in fixation durations (Henderson &amp; Pierce, 2008). More subtle degradations of an image on fixation durations, such as the decrease in luminance of an image during fixations, also increases the length of fixation durations (Henderson, Nuthmann &amp; Luke, 2013). An asymmetric effect is shown where the increase of luminance also increases fixation durations (Walshe &amp; Nuthmann, 2014). However, the change in factors affecting top-down processing, such as [[Gaussian blur|blur]]ring or [[phase noise]], increases fixation durations when used to degrade a scene and decreases fixation durations when used to enhance a scene (Henderson, Olejarczyk, Luke &amp; Schmidt, 2014; Einhäuser et al., 2006).

Furthermore, temporal and spatial aspects interact in a complex manner. When a picture is first presented on the screen, fixations made within the first second are more likely to be directed toward the left side of the scene, whereas the opposite holds true for the remaining part of the presentation (Ossandón et al., 2014).

'''Female sabotage''' is an [[evolutionary theory]] regarding the propensity of certain females to select "burdened" males of their species for mating.

==History==
Soon after [[Charles Darwin]] published his theory of [[Natural Selection]], he was faced with a puzzle.  If natural selection suggests "[[survival of the fittest]]," then why do some males have traits that detract from their survival?  For instance, the [[peacock]] grows a colorful, cumbersome tail that not only attracts [[predator]]s, but makes it difficult for him to escape those predators.  Similarly, the buck grows enormous [[antler]]s which are heavy to carry and can easily become tangled in branches, interfering with effective escape from pursuing [[hunter]]s.

Of course, Darwin knew that there was more to natural selection than simple [[Survival of the fittest|fitness]].  An equally important part of the struggle of life regards reproduction.  In this case, the question becomes, "Why would a female burden her offspring with dangerous traits by mating with a similarly burdened male?"

Noting that the males with burdensome traits are almost entirely those in [[polygamous]] species, where a minority of males generally mate with many females, Darwin had an insight.  He realized that if females found these male burdens more "attractive," and if that attractiveness resulted in more matings by burdened males, then the increase in matings of a few sons might offset the death of many other sons as a result of the burden.  In effect, if the success of the surviving males produced enough offspring to cover more than the loss of potential offspring from their lost brothers, then the female who mated with a burdened male had chosen correctly.

==The female sabotage theory==
In 1996, however, Joe Abraham presented a re-interpretation of the problem.  In polygamous species, males generally contribute nothing to the nurturing of offspring, but nevertheless continue to consume finite resources.  In such situations, males effectively become competitors with females and young once they are finished mating.  This gives females a reason to sabotage males, and mating gives them an opportunity to do so.  By choosing to mate exclusively with males who are unlikely to survive because of their burdens, the females ensure that as the males die, more food and other resources will remain for females and their young.  Because females are the limiting resource in most species, as their numbers increase, population fitness will also increase.

Just as a given amount of land can only produce a finite amount of grazing, and a limited amount of grazing can only support a limited number of grazing animals, so a given number of grazing animals can only sustain a limited number of predators.  Similar limitations apply to all living things, and are known as the [[carrying capacity]] of a physical area.  If males' burdens are more likely to draw the interest of local predators, then such males effectively shift predation away from females and their young.  In this case, the females and young will gain an added benefit from decreased predation, and enjoy even higher rates of survivability.

Abraham's explanation reunites the major split in [[sexual selection]]—intrasexual selection (male combat) and intersexual selection (female choice)--together under one rubric.  Under female sabotage, the increase in resources becomes the critical factor, and the cause of increased male mortality is secondary.  The theory also offers new, [[feminist]] approaches to [[Lek (biology)|leks]], [[harem]]s, resource guarding and mate location.

Perhaps the most attractive aspect of Abraham's explanation, however, is that it can easily work with any of the many current theories of sexual selection, and must play some role in them.  An increase in resources and a decrease in predation for females and their young is an inevitable result of increased male mortality, regardless of what mechanism drives females to mate with males carrying burdensome traits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4627">'''Flight operational quality assurance''' ('''FOQA''', pronounced PHO-QU-A), also known as '''flight data monitoring''' ('''FDM''') or '''flight data analysis''', is a method of capturing, analyzing and/or visualizing the data generated by an [[aircraft]] moving through the air from one point to another.  Applying the information learned from this analysis helps to find new ways to improve [[flight safety]] and increase overall operational efficiency. Several [[airline]]s and [[air force]]s have initiated FOQA programs to collect, store and analyze recorded flight data. The goal is to improve the organization or unit's overall safety, increase maintenance effectiveness and reduce operational costs.

==Acronyms==
*FOQA = flight operational quality assurance,
*FDM = flight data monitoring,
*FDA = flight data analysis,
*MOQA = maintenance operational quality assurance,
*MFOQA = military flight operational quality assurance,
*SOQA = simulator operational quality assurance,
*CFOQA = corporate flight operational quality assurance,
*HFDM = helicopter flight data monitoring,
*HOMP = helicopter operational monitoring program.

==Applications==
As a result of an ICAO Annex 6 mandate, all airlines are required under regional legislation to implement Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programs. However, in the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) does not yet require FOQA programs for commercial operators. The data recorded can be either pilot generated (as he or she moves the controls) or mechanically induced by related systems in the aircraft itself. "A significant barrier to wider adoption in the United States is pilot's universal lack of trust in who will see and act on the flight data once it is recorded and studied." &lt;ref&gt;Recorded as a direct quotation made by Mr. Douglas Carr in response to a question from the general audience at the annual conference of the Aviation Insurance Association held in Nashville, Tennessee on April 28, 2008. At the time, Mr. Carr was the vice president for Safety and Regulation of the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) which has its headquarters in Washington, DC, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) requirement is defined in EU-OPS section 1.037.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Flight_Data_Monitoring |title=FAA Advisory Circular 120-82 |publisher=Federal Aviation Authority |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAA defined FOQA in its Advisory Circular #120-82, dated April 12, 2004. The agency's ''Air Transportation Operations Inspector's Handbook'' (FAA Order 8400.10, August 9, 2006) details what a valid FOQA system contains.  An excerpt from Volume 1, Chapter 5, Section 2, page 1-221 of this FAA document states: "Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) is a voluntary safety program designed to improve aviation safety through the proactive use of flight-recorded data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/40C02FC39C1577B686256E8A005AFB0A?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=ac120-82 |title=SKYbrary Flight Data Monitoring |publisher=Eurocontrol |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) has made it mandatory for all airline operators to carry out Flight Data Analysis for flight safety. Instruction clearly states the need for a flight safety department for all scheduled operators. Non-scheduled operators are required to present a safety report on a half-yearly basis to DGCA.

In [[astrobiology]] and [[astrophysics|planetary astrophysics]], the '''galactic habitable zone''' is the region of a [[galaxy]] in which [[life]] might most likely develop. More specifically, the concept of a galactic habitable zone incorporates various factors, such as [[metallicity]] and the rate of major catastrophes such as [[supernovae]], to calculate which regions of the galaxy are more likely to form [[terrestrial planet]]s, initially develop simple life, and provide a suitable environment for this life to evolve and advance.&lt;ref name=gowanlock-2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gowanlock | first1 = M.

==Background==
The idea of the [[circumstellar habitable zone]] was introduced in 1953 by [[Hubertus Strughold]] and [[Harlow Shapley]]&lt;ref name=strughold-1953&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_green_and_red_planet.html?id=zNbPAAAAMAAJ | title=The Green and Red Planet: A Physiological Study of the Possibility of Life on Mars | publisher=University of New Mexico Press | author=Strughold, Hubertus | date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kasting2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Kasting|title=How to Find a Habitable Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPqEeB-SRvUC|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13805-3|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1959 by [[Su-Shu Huang]]&lt;ref name=huang-1960&gt;{{cite journal | title=Life-Supporting Regions in the Vicinity of Binary Systems | author=Huang, Su-Shu | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |date=April 1960 | volume=72 | issue=425 | pages=106–114 | bibcode=1960PASP...72..106H | doi=10.1086/127489}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the region around a star in which an orbiting planet could retain water at its surface. From the 1970s, planetary scientists and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life, including the impact that a nearby [[supernova]] may have on life's development.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6617|arxiv=astro-ph/0103165|title=The Galactic Habitable Zone: Galactic Chemical Evolution|date=2001|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Guillermo|last2=Brownlee|first2=Donald|last3=Peter|first3=Ward|journal=Icarus|volume=152|pages=185|bibcode = 2001Icar..152..185G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, [[Jim Clarke (computer scientist)|Jim Clarke]] proposed that the apparent lack of [[extraterrestrial civilization]]s in the Milky Way could be explained by [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert]]-type outbursts from an [[active galactic nucleus]], with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy.&lt;ref name=clarke-1981&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = J.

Modern galactic habitable-zone theory was introduced in 1986 by L.S. Marochnik and L.M. Mukhin, who defined the zone as the region in which ''intelligent'' life could flourish.&lt;ref name=blair-2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blair | first1 = S.

Brownlee|Donald Brownlee]] and palaeontologist [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] expanded upon the concept of a galactic habitable zone, as well as the other factors required for the emergence of [[metazoan|complex life]], in their 2000 book ''[[Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe]]''.&lt;ref name=ward-2000&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780387952895|title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe|first1=Peter|last1=Ward|first2=Donald|last2=Brownlee|publisher=Springer|pages=191–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that book, the authors used the galactic habitable zone, among other factors, to argue that intelligent life is not a common occurrence in the Universe.

The idea of a galactic habitable zone was further developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] of the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6617|arxiv=astro-ph/0103165|title=The Galactic Habitable Zone: Galactic Chemical Evolution|date=2001|last1=Gonzalez|first1=G|journal=Icarus|volume=152|pages=185|bibcode = 2001Icar..152..185G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Charles H.

Gibson | title=The Galactic Habitable Zone and the Age Distribution of Complex Life in the Milky Way | journal=Science|date=January 2004| volume=303 |issue=5654 | pages=59–62 | doi=10.1126/science.1092322 | pmid=14704421|arxiv = astro-ph/0401024 |bibcode = 2004Sci...303...59L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near the [[galactic halo]] would lack the heavier elements required to produce [[planetary habitability|habitable]] [[terrestrial planet]]s, thus creating an outward limit to the size of the galactic habitable zone.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; Being too close to the galactic center, however, would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive [[comet]]ary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's [[Oort cloud]]. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic habitable zone, located just outside the [[galactic bulge]].&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt;

==Considerations==
In order to identify a location in the galaxy as being a part of the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, the presence or absence of an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby [[supernovae]] that can threaten the existence of life, the [[metallicity]] of that location, and other factors.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.

===Chemical evolution===
[[File:Starpop.svg|thumb|The metallicity of the thin galactic disk is far greater than that of the outlying galactic halo.|400px]]One of the most basic requirements for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a [[terrestrial planet]] of sufficient mass to sustain it. Various elements, such as [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], and others, are required to produce habitable planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt;

One important elemental ratio is that of [Fe/[[hydrogen|H]]], one of the factors determining the propensity of a region of the galaxy to produce terrestrial planets. The [[galactic bulge]], the region of the galaxy closest to the galactic center, has an [Fe/H] distribution peaking at −0.2 [[decimal exponent|decimal exponent unit]]s (dex) relative to the [[Sun]]'s ratio; the [[thin disk]], where the [[Sun]] is located, has an average metallicity of −0.02 dex at the orbital distance of the Sun around the galactic center, reducing by 0.07 dex for every additional [[kiloparsec]] of orbital distance. The extended [[thick disk]] has an average [Fe/H] of −0.6 dex, while the [[galactic halo|halo]], the region farthest from the galactic center, has the lowest [Fe/H] distribution peak, at around −1.5 dex.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; In addition, ratios such as [C/O], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [S/Fe] may be relevant to the ability of a region of a galaxy to form habitable terrestrial planets, and of these [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] are slowly reducing over time, meaning that future terrestrial planets are more likely to possess larger iron cores.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt;

In addition to specific amounts of the various stable elements that comprise a terrestrial planet's mass, an abundance of [[radionuclide]]s such as [[potassium-40|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;]][[potassium|K]], [[uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;]][[uranium|U]], [[uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;]]U, and [[thorium-232|&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;]][[thorium|Th]] is required in order to heat the planet's interior and power life-sustaining processes such as [[plate tectonic]]s, [[volcanism]], and a [[geomagnetic dynamo]].&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; The [U/H] and [Th/H] ratios are dependent on the [Fe/H] ratio; however, a general function for the abundance of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K cannot be created with existing data.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt;

Even on a habitable planet with enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required in order to produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone.&lt;ref name=blair-2008 /&gt; A 2008 study by [[Samantha Blair]] and colleagues attempted to determine the outer edge of the galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing [[formaldehyde]] and [[carbon monoxide]] emissions from various [[giant molecular cloud]]s scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.

While high metallicity is beneficial for the creation of terrestrial [[extrasolar planets]], an excess amount can be harmful for life. Excess metallicity may lead to the formation of a large number of [[gas giant]]s in a given system, which may subsequently migrate from beyond the system's [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]] and become [[hot Jupiter]]s, disturbing planets that would otherwise have been located in the system's circumstellar habitable zone.&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lineweaver | first1 = C. H. | last2 = Fenner | first2 = Y. | last3 = Gibson | first3 = B. K. | doi = 10.1126/science.1092322 | title = The Galactic Habitable Zone and the Age Distribution of Complex Life in the Milky Way | journal = Science | volume = 303 | issue = 5654 | pages = 59–62 | year = 2004 | pmid =  14704421| pmc = |arxiv = astro-ph/0401024 |bibcode = 2004Sci...303...59L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was found that the [[Goldilocks principle]] applies to metallicity as well; low-metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial-mass planets at all, while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop, disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability of terrestrial planets in the system.

===Catastrophic events===
[[File:Crab Nebula.jpg|thumb|250px|The impact of supernovae on the extent of the galactic habitable zone has been extensively studied.]]
As well as being located in a region of the galaxy that is chemically advantageous for the development of life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets.&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004 /&gt; Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation,&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.

In addition to supernovae, [[gamma-ray burst]]s,&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007 /&gt; excessive amounts of radiation, gravitational perturbations&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004 /&gt; and various other events have been proposed to affect the distribution of life within the galaxy. These include, controversially, such proposals as "galactic tides" with the potential to induce cometary impacts or even [[cold dark matter|cold]] bodies of [[dark matter]]&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vukotic | first1 = B. | last2 = Cirkovic | first2 = M. M. | doi = 10.2298/SAJ0775045V | title = On the timescale forcing in astrobiology | journal = Serbian Astronomical Journal | issue = 175 | pages = 45 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.1508 |bibcode = 2007SerAJ.175...45V }}&lt;/ref&gt; that pass through organisms and induce genetic mutations.&lt;ref name=collar-j&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Collar | first1 = J.

===Galactic morphology===
Various morphological features of galaxies can affect their potential for habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's [[Oort cloud]], sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in.&lt;ref name=mullen-2001&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/news_stories/news_detail.cfm?ID=157 |title=Galactic Habitable Zones |work=NAI Features Archive |date=May 18, 2001 |agency=Nasa Astrobiology Institute |accessdate=May 9, 2013 |author=Mullen, Leslie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409002532/http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/news_stories/news_detail.cfm?ID=157 |archivedate=April 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life.&lt;ref name=mullen-2001 /&gt; Considering these factors, the [[Sun]] is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, in addition to being outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the [[corotation radius]], maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.&lt;ref name=mullen-2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sundin-2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sundin | first1 = M. | title = The galactic habitable zone in barred galaxies | doi = 10.1017/S1473550406003065 | journal = International Journal of Astrobiology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 325 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2006IJAsB...5..325S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiral arms also have the ability to cause climatic changes on a planet. Passing through the dense molecular clouds of galactic spiral arms, [[stellar wind]]s may be pushed back to the point that a reflective hydrogen layer accumulates in an orbiting planet's atmosphere, perhaps leading to a [[snowball Earth]] scenario.&lt;ref name=newscientist /&gt;&lt;ref name=pavlov-2005&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004GL021890/abstract|doi=10.1029/2004GL021890|title=Passing through a giant molecular cloud: "Snowball" glaciations produced by interstellar dust|date=2005|last1=Pavlov|first1=Alexander A.|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=32|issue=3|bibcode = 2005GeoRL..32.3705P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[barred spiral galaxy|galactic bar]] also has the potential to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there.&lt;ref name=sundin-2006 /&gt; High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.&lt;ref name=sundin-2006 /&gt;

==Boundaries==
[[File:Milky Way galactic habitable zone.gif|thumb|left|The galactic habitable zone is often viewed as an annulus 4–10 kpc from the galactic center, shown in green here, though recent research has called this into question.]]
Early research on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely stating that the zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability would be more likely in the galaxy's thin disk.&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001 /&gt; However, later research conducted in 2004 by Lineweaver and colleagues did create boundaries for this annulus, in the case of the Milky Way ranging from 4 kpc to 10 kpc from the galactic center.

The Lineweaver team also analyzed the evolution of the galactic habitable zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a time window of about two billion years in order to have habitable planets.&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004 /&gt; Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets, with the potential to destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar habitable zone.&lt;ref name=lineweaver-2004 /&gt; Simulations conducted in 2005 at the [[University of Washington]], however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.&lt;ref name=raymond-2005&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103505000965|title=The formation and habitability of terrestrial planets in the presence of close-in giant planets|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.03.008|date=2005|last1=Raymond|first1=Sean N.|last2=Quinn|first2=Thomas|last3=Lunine|first3=Jonathan I.|journal=Icarus|volume=177|pages=256|arxiv = astro-ph/0407620 |bibcode = 2005Icar..177..256R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study by [[Milan Ćirković]] and colleagues extended the notion of a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying [[secular phenomena|secular evolution]] of galactic dynamics.&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007 /&gt; The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a [[punctuated equilibrium]] in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others.&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007 /&gt; Based on the results of [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s on a [[toy model]] of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.&lt;ref name=vukotic-2007 /&gt;

Subsequent studies saw more fundamental revision of the old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by [[Nikos Prantzos]] revealed that, while the probability of a planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there.&lt;ref name=prantzos-2008 /&gt; The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the [[galactic plane]], and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the [[tidal locking]] of [[red dwarf]] planets as precluding the development of complex life.&lt;ref name=gowanlock-2011 /&gt;

==Criticism==
The idea of the galactic habitable zone has been criticized by Nikos Prantzos, on the grounds that the parameters to create it are impossible to define even approximately, and that thus the galactic habitable zone may merely be a useful conceptual tool to enable a better understanding of the distribution of life, rather than an end to itself.&lt;ref name=prantzos-2008 /&gt; For these reasons, Prantzos has suggested that the entire galaxy may be habitable, rather than habitability being restricted to a specific region in space and time.&lt;ref name=prantzos-2008 /&gt; In addition, stars "riding" the galaxy's spiral arms may move tens of thousands of light years from their original orbits, thus supporting the notion that there may not be one specific galactic habitable zone.&lt;ref name=roskar /&gt;&lt;ref name=newswise /&gt;&lt;ref name=newscientist /&gt; A Monte Carlo simulation, improving on the mechanisms used by  Ćirković in 2006, was conducted in 2010 by [[Duncan Forgan]]  of [[Royal Observatory Edinburgh]]. The data collected from the experiments support Prantzos's notion that there is no solidly defined galactic habitable zone, indicating the possibility of hundreds of [[extraterrestrial civilization]]s in the Milky Way, though further data will be required in order for a definitive determination to be made.&lt;ref name=forgan-2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Forgan | first1 = D.

A '''homeobox''' is a [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]], around 180 [[base pair]]s long, found within [[gene]]s that are involved in the regulation of patterns of anatomical development ([[morphogenesis]]) in [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s. These genes encode '''homeodomain''' [[protein]] products that are [[transcription factor]]s sharing a characteristic [[protein fold]] structure that binds [[DNA]].&lt;ref name="PUB00005390"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gehring WJ | title = The homeobox in perspective | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 277–80 | date = Aug 1992 | pmid = 1357790 | doi = 10.1016/0968-0004(92)90434-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7903947"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gehring WJ | title = Exploring the homeobox | journal = Gene | volume = 135 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 215–21 | date = Dec 1993 | pmid = 7903947 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(93)90068-E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26464018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bürglin, TR, Affolter, M | title = Homeodomain proteins: an update | journal = Chromosoma | volume =  125| issue = 3 | pages = 1–25 | date = Oct 2015 | pmid = 26464018 | doi = 10.1007/s00412-015-0543-8 | pmc=4901127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "homeo-" prefix in the words "homeobox" and "homeodomain" stems from the [[mutation|mutational phenotype]] known as "[[homeosis]]", which is frequently observed when these genes are mutated in [[animals]]. [[Homeosis]] is a term coined by [[William Bateson]] to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part. Homeobox genes are not only found in animals, but have also been found in [[fungus|fungi]], for example the [[microorganism|unicellular]] [[yeast]]s, in plants, and numerous single cell eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid26464018"/&gt;

== Discovery ==
Homeoboxes were discovered independently in 1983 by [[:de:Ernst Hafen|Ernst Hafen]], [[Michael Levine (biologist)|Michael Levine]], and [[William McGinnis]] working in the lab of [[Walter Jakob Gehring]] at the [[University of Basel]], [[Switzerland]]; and by [[Matthew P. Scott]] and Amy Weiner, who were then working with [[Thomas Kaufman]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]].&lt;ref name="pmid6323992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGinnis W, Levine MS, Hafen E, Kuroiwa A, Gehring WJ | title = A conserved DNA sequence in homoeotic genes of the Drosophila Antennapedia and bithorax complexes | journal = Nature | volume = 308 | issue = 5958 | pages = 428–33 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6323992 | doi = 10.1038/308428a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6330741"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott MP, Weiner AJ | title = Structural relationships among genes that control development: sequence homology between the Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, and fushi tarazu loci of Drosophila | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 81 | issue = 13 | pages = 4115–9 | date = Jul 1984 | pmid = 6330741 | pmc = 345379 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.81.13.4115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of homeobox genes were first discovered in ''[[Drosophila]]'', where mutations in homeobox genes caused the radical alterations known as "[[homeosis|homeotic]] transformations". One of the most famous such mutation is ''[[antennapedia]]'', in which legs grow from the head of a fly instead of the expected antennae.

== Homeodomain proteins ==
A homeobox is about 180 DNA [[base pair]]s long and encodes a [[protein domain]] that binds [[DNA]]. The following shows the [[consensus sequence|consensus]] homeodomain (~60 amino acid residue chain):&lt;ref name="urlwww.csb.ki.se"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csb.ki.se/groups/tbu/homeo/consensus.gif | title = The homeobox page| format = gif | author = Bürglin  TR | publisher = Karolinksa Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===

The characteristic homeodomain [[protein fold]] consists of a 60-[[amino acid]] long domain composed of three alpha helixes. Helix 2 and helix 3 form a so-called [[helix-turn-helix]] (HTH) structure, where the two [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] are connected by a short loop region. The [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] two helices of the homeodomain are [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] and the longer [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] helix is roughly perpendicular to the axes established by the first two. It is this third helix that interacts directly with [[DNA]] via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as indirect interactions via water molecules, which occur between specific [[side chain]]s and the exposed [[nucleotide|base]]s within the [[major groove]] of the DNA.&lt;ref name="PUB00005540" /&gt;

Homeodomain proteins are found in [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid26464018"/&gt; Through the HTH motif, they share limited sequence similarity and structural similarity to  prokaryotic transcription factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info/version/v4_0_0/superfamily/1.10.10.60|title=CATH Superfamily 1.10.10.60|author=|date=|website=www.cathdb.info|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[lambda phage]] proteins that alter the expression of genes in [[prokaryote]]s. The HTH motif shows some sequence similarity but a similar structure in a wide range of DNA-binding proteins (e.g., [[Lambda phage#Protein function overview|cro]] and [[repressor protein]]s, homeodomain proteins, etc.). One of the principal differences between HTH motifs in these different proteins arises from the stereo-chemical requirement for [[glycine]] in the turn which is needed to avoid [[steric]] interference of the beta-carbon with the main chain: for cro and repressor proteins the glycine appears to be mandatory, whereas for many of the homeotic and other DNA-binding proteins the requirement is relaxed.

===Sequence specificity===

Homeodomains can bind both specifically and nonspecifically to [[B-DNA]] with the C-terminal recognition helix aligning in the DNA's major groove and the unstructured peptide "tail" at the N-terminus aligning in the minor groove. The recognition helix and the inter-helix loops are rich in [[arginine]] and [[lysine]] residues, which form [[hydrogen bond]]s to the DNA backbone; [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] [[hydrophobic]] residues in the center of the recognition helix aid in stabilizing the helix packing. Homeodomain proteins show a preference for the DNA sequence 5'-TAAT-3'; sequence-independent binding occurs with significantly lower affinity.

===Biological function===

Through the DNA-recognition properties of the homeodomain, homeoproteins are believed to regulate the expression of targeted genes and direct the formation of many body structures during early embryonic development.&lt;ref name="pmid1357628"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corsetti MT, Briata P, Sanseverino L, Daga A, Airoldi I, Simeone A, Palmisano G, Angelini C, Boncinelli E, Corte G | title = Differential DNA binding properties of three human homeodomain proteins | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 20 | issue = 17 | pages = 4465–72 | date = Sep 1992 | pmid = 1357628 | pmc = 334173 | doi = 10.1093/nar/20.17.4465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many homeodomain proteins induce [[cellular differentiation]] by initiating the cascades of coregulated genes required to produce individual [[biological tissue|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s. Other proteins in the family, such as [[Homeobox protein NANOG|NANOG]] are involved in maintaining [[pluripotency]]. Homeobox genes are critical in the establishment of body axes during [[embryogenesis]].

Homeoprotein transcription factors typically switch on cascades of other genes. The homeodomain binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner. However, the specificity of a single homeodomain protein is usually not enough to recognize only its desired target genes. Most of the time, homeodomain proteins act in the [[promoter (biology)|promoter region]] of their target genes as complexes with other transcription factors. Such complexes have a much higher target specificity than a single homeodomain protein. Homeodomains are encoded both by genes of the [[Hox gene|Hox gene clusters]] and by other genes throughout the genome.

The homeobox domain was first identified in a number of ''Drosophila'' [[Homeosis|homeotic]] and segmentation proteins, but is now known to be well-conserved in many other animals, including [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name="PUB00005390"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PUB00005540"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schofield PN |title=Patterns, puzzles and paradigms - The riddle of the homeobox |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=10 |issue= |pages=3–6 |year=1987 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(87)90113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PUB00000591"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott MP, Tamkun JW, Hartzell GW | title = The structure and function of the homeodomain | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 989 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–48 | date = Jul 1989 | pmid = 2568852 | doi = 10.1016/0304-419x(89)90033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant homeobox genes ==
As in animals, the plant homeobox genes code for the typical 60 amino acid long DNA-binding homeodomain or in case of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) homeobox genes for an "atypical" homeodomain consisting of 63 amino acids. According to their conserved intron–exon structure and to unique codomain architectures they have been grouped into 14 distinct classes: HD-ZIP I to IV, BEL, KNOX, PLINC, WOX, PHD, DDT, NDX, LD, SAWADEE and PINTOX.&lt;ref name="pmid19734295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mukherjee K, Brocchieri L, Bürglin TR | title = A comprehensive classification and evolutionary analysis of plant homeobox genes | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 26 | issue = 12 | pages = 2775–94 | date = Dec 2009 | pmid = 19734295 | pmc = 2775110 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msp201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation of codomains suggests a common eukaryotic ancestry for TALE&lt;ref name="pmid9336443"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bürglin TR | title = Analysis of TALE superclass homeobox genes (MEIS, PBC, KNOX, Iroquois, TGIF) reveals a novel domain conserved between plants and animals | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 25 | issue = 21 | pages = 4173–80 | date = Nov 1997 | pmid = 9336443 | pmc = 147054 | doi =  10.1093/nar/25.21.4173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-TALE homeodomain proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid17501745"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Derelle R, Lopez P, Le Guyader H, Manuel M | title = Homeodomain proteins belong to the ancestral molecular toolkit of eukaryotes | journal = Evolution &amp; Development | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17501745 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00153.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==POU genes==
{{further|POU family}}
Proteins containing a POU region consist of a homeodomain and a separate, [[structurally homologous]] POU domain that contains two [[helix-turn-helix]] motifs and also binds DNA. The two domains are linked by a flexible loop that is long enough to stretch around the DNA helix, allowing the two domains to bind on opposite sides of the target DNA, collectively covering an eight-base segment with [[consensus sequence]] 5'-ATGCAAAT-3'. The individual domains of POU proteins bind DNA only weakly, but have strong sequence-specific affinity when linked. The POU domain itself has significant structural similarity with repressors expressed in [[bacteriophage]]s, particularly [[lambda phage]].

In humans, the POU genes are [[HDX (gene)|HDX]]; [[POU1F1]]; [[POU2F1]]; [[POU2F2]]; [[POU2F3]]; [[POU3F1]]; [[POU3F2]]; [[POU3F3]]; [[POU3F4]]; [[POU4F1]]; [[POU4F2]]; [[POU4F3]]; [[POU5F1]]; [[POU5F1P1]]; [[POU5F1P4]]; [[POU5F2]]; [[POU6F1]]; and [[POU6F2]].

{{Main article|Hox gene}}

Hox genes are a subset of homeobox genes. They are essential [[metazoa]]n genes as they determine the identity of embryonic regions along the anterio-posterior axis.&lt;ref name="pmid12445403"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alonso CR | title = Hox proteins: sculpting body parts by activating localized cell death | journal = Current Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 22 | pages = R776-8 | date = Nov 2002 | pmid = 12445403 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01291-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first vertebrate Hox gene was isolated in ''[[Xenopus]]'' by Eddy De Robertis and colleagues in 1984, marking the beginning of the young science of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] ("evo-devo").&lt;ref name="pmid6327066"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrasco AE, McGinnis W, Gehring WJ, De Robertis EM | title = Cloning of an X. laevis gene expressed during early embryogenesis coding for a peptide region homologous to Drosophila homeotic genes | journal = Cell | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 409–14 | date = Jun 1984 | pmid = 6327066 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(84)90371-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations in these [[homeotic gene]]s cause displacement of organs.

In vertebrates, the four [[homology (biology)|paralog]] clusters are partially redundant in function, but have also acquired several derived functions. In particular, HoxA and HoxD specify segment identity along the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] axis.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The main interest in this set of genes stems from their unique behaviour. They are typically found in an organized cluster. The linear order of the genes within a cluster is directly correlated to the order of the regions they affect as well as the timing in which they are affected. This phenomenon is called colinearity. Due to this linear relationship, changes in the gene cluster due to mutations generally result in similar changes in the affected regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

For example, when one gene is lost the segment develops into a more anterior one, while a mutation that leads to a gain of function causes a segment to develop into a more posterior one. This is called [[Ectopic expression|ectopia]]. Famous examples are [[Antennapedia]] and [[Bithorax complex|bithorax]] in ''Drosophila'', which can cause the development of legs instead of antennae and the development of a duplicated thorax, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Molecular evidence shows that some limited number of Hox genes have existed in the [[Cnidaria]] since before the earliest true [[Bilateria|Bilatera]], making these genes pre-[[Paleozoic]].&lt;ref name="pmid17252055"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan JF, Mazza ME, Pang K, Matus DQ, Baxevanis AD, Martindale MQ, Finnerty JR | title = Pre-bilaterian origins of the Hox cluster and the Hox code: evidence from the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = e153 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17252055 | pmc = 1779807 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ParaHox]] genes are analogously found in four areas. They include [[CDX1]], [[CDX2]], [[Cdx protein family|CDX4]]; [[GSX1]], [[GSX2]]; and [[PDX1]]. Other genes considered Hox-like include [[Evx1|EVX1]], [[EVX2]]; [[GBX1]], [[GBX2]]; [[MEOX1]], [[MEOX2]]; and [[MNX1]].

== Mutations ==
Mutations to homeobox genes can produce easily visible [[phenotype|phenotypic]] changes.

Two examples of homeobox mutations in the above-mentioned fruit fly are legs where the antennae should be ([[antennapedia]]), and a second pair of wings.

Duplication of homeobox genes can produce new body segments, and such duplications are likely to have been important in the [[evolution]] of segmented animals. However, Hox genes typically determine the identity of body segments.

There is one [[insect]] family, the [[Xyelidae|xyelid sawflies]], in which both the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and mouthparts are remarkably leg-like in structure. This is not uncommon in arthropods as all arthropod appendages are homologous.

== Regulation ==
Hox genes and their associated microRNAs are highly conserved developmental master regulators with tight tissue-specific, spatiotemporal control. These genes are known to be dysregulated in several cancers and are often controlled by DNA methylation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24996520"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatlekar S, Fields JZ, Boman BM | title = HOX genes and their role in the development of human cancers | journal = Journal of Molecular Medicine | volume = 92 | issue = 8 | pages = 811–23 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 24996520 | doi = 10.1007/s00109-014-1181-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation of Hox genes is highly complex and involves reciprocal interactions, mostly inhibitory. [[Drosophila]] is known to use the [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb]] and [[Trithorax]] Complexes to maintain the expression of Hox genes after the down-regulation of the pair-rule and gap genes that occurs during larval development. [[Polycomb-group proteins]] can silence the HOX genes by modulation of [[chromatin]] structure.&lt;ref name="Portoso"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg | vauthors = Portoso M, Cavalli G | year = 2008 | chapter = The Role of RNAi and Noncoding RNAs in Polycomb Mediated Control of Gene Expression and Genomic Programming | title = RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity | publisher = Caister Academic Press | url = http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg | isbn = 978-1-904455-25-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary Origin ==
The homeobox itself may have evolved from a non-DNA-binding transmembrane domain at the C-terminus of the MraY enzyme. This is based on metagenomic data  acquired from the transitional archaeon, Lokiarchaeum, that is regarded as the prokaryote closest to the ancestor of all eukaryotes. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328511976_The_origin_of_the_Homeobox_at_the_C-terminus_of_MraY_in_Lokiarchaea&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hot container composting''' (also referred to as [[in-vessel composting]] for larger industrial batches) is different to cold [[composting]], in that [[compost]] is created without losing valuable heat. Heat loss is the reason why a compost pile takes so long to [[decompose]]. Observers have noted that the time taken to create compost can be dramatically reduced by retaining the heat in a suitably insulated container. Another observation noted is the way the compostable items are added and mixed which allows for aeration. This is an important step in the process. Compost becomes [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] due to the absence of air, and this can result in it becoming smelly. By adding large, medium and fine items to the top of the container, space is provided in between the items for the air to flow from bottom to top. This creates a trickle ventilation. Compost made with this method is called [[Aerobic digestion|aerobic]] composting (no smell).

== Requirements ==
* Insulated container
** Polystyrene with polypropylene thick walls or cavity/ceiling insulation vents on top and bottom
* A starter composting medium
* A handful of soil from garden that is a few months old containing natural microbes and bacteria
* Regular feeding of household and compostable waste
* Food scraps
* Fruit and vegetable peelings
* Egg shells
* Bones
* Grass cuttings,
* Carbon
** Shredded or torn paper
** Cardboard
*** Egg cartons
*** Cereal boxes
* Thermometer (optional)

== Method ==
Place the waste you want to compost in a bucket or bag, add large pieces (bones, large bark pieces or anything the size of large egg), medium pieces (carrot tops, potato skins, chopped up branches etc.) and fine pieces (grass cuttings, ground egg shells) and carbon (bag of shredded paper, cut up cardboard, torn up cereal boxes, egg cartons, old magazines, newspaper).

Mix well or shake the bag. Empty the bag into top of container and close the lid. It must be able to be sealed and not let air enter or escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compostinstructions.com/in-a-hurry-heres-the-ultimate-one-page-guide-to-composting/|title=In a hurry? Here's the ultimate one page guide to composting|date=2008-09-23|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the top vent should allow a controlled flow of steam to escape. Too much and most of the beneficial heat will escape and too little and the steam turns to streams of water in the inside and drops the internal temperature which in turn lowers the rate of decomposition.

== How it works ==
The hyperthermic bacteria present in the container, derived from the handful of garden soil you added, reproduces and multiplies very quickly, which gives off a lot of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/what-vessel-composting-0|title=What is in-vessel composting?|date=2015-08-10|newspaper=Zero Waste Scotland|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retaining this heat is the secret to hot container composting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fccenvironment.co.uk/ivc.html|title=In-Vessel Composting|website=www.fccenvironment.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By keeping the container sealed, insulated and controlling the escaping steam, the temperature can be kept with the range needed for hot container composting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/vessel-composting-ivc&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures higher than 70 degrees causes the important hyperthermic bacteria to die off and defeats the plan.

The smaller the pieces, the quicker the decomposition. Typing paper takes days to decompose, grass clippings take weeks, branches a couple of months,  and bark takes several months.

Hot container composters aim for a temperature range of between 100 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) to aid optimal bacterial decomposition. A suitable thermometer, analogue or digital, is needed for monitoring this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.almanac.com/content/how-compost-hot-and-cold-methods|title=How To Compost|last=|first=|access-date=2017-08-31|website=The Farmer's Almanac|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you don't have a thermometer, you have to wait for the final product to inspect if it is suitable.

The bottom door is only opened to extract the compost when the top is full. The first time you open the door, there will be partially decomposed material.

This is due to the most of the decomposition work taking place on the top of the pile (where the heat is concentrated) and this can simply be added to the top during your next top up. Your next collection will probably have been through the process and be ready for use.

Let the collected material stand for aeration for 30 minutes to let the bad odor dissipate. Either remove the larger and medium-sized particles by hand or use a sifter. The larger pieces can be used again.

== Cold composting versus hot composting ==
There are advantages and disadvantages of cold and hot composting.

=== Cold compost pile ===

* Attracts vermin e.g. mice and rats due to odour of decomposing materials and some warmth it can offer.
* Attracts flying insects, e.g. flies
* Attracts other wildlife otters, foxes, raccoons, hedgehogs, and birds, which they view as free food
* Foul odors from the anaerobic processes
* Little decomposition takes place in winter
* Requires space for the pile, as well as a space for the new pile while the old pile is turned

=== Hot container composting ===

* Requires an insulated container
* Retains the heat all winter, allowing the compost to decompose all winter
* Any odours can be eliminated by adding an odour trap to the escaping steam (optional)
* No place for rodents, birds, wildlife to enter the container
* Takes up less space
* Sterilises compost, the high heat in the container kills any seed, harmful bacteria or fungi
* Creates compost in 20% of the time (the higher the temperature inside the quicker the material decomposes)

Yellow cedar (''[[Cupressus nootkatensis]]'') is a culturally, economically and environmentally significant species to the Pacific Northwest and was used extensively by indigenous peoples throughout the region.

==History==
===Archaeological Evidence of Use===
At the [[Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site]] in Washington, cedar (either yellow or red) wood, bark, and roots, along with the remains of cedar houses were found all dating between 300 and 500 years ago. On the east coast of Vancouver island at the Little Qualicum River site cedar (either yellow or red) rope, matting, and a canoe bailer were found dating to approximately 1000 years ago. At the Lachane site in Prince Rupert harbor many cedar (either yellow or red) wooden items and bark baskets were found dating to approximately 2000 years ago. At the Pitt River site near Vancouver two carved cedar (either yellow or red) items and baskets were found, dating to approximately 2900 years ago. At the Musqueam site near Vancouver cedar (either yellow or red) basketry, matting, ropes were found dating to 3000 years ago. At various other sites around Vancouver wood working tools have been found that date from between 5000 and 8000 years ago that could possibly have been intended to be used for cedar (either yellow or red).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends===
====[[Tlingit]]====
Natsilane was a great hunter and carver. He also hunted with respect for the sea lions he killed. His older brothers-in-law were jealous of his talents. One day when they had paddled far out to a sea lion rock to hunt, Natsilane speared a sea lion but it dove into the water breaking off the spear tip. When he looked back to the canoe, his older brothers-in-law were paddling away, against the protests of his youngest brother-in-law. Natsilane in despair went to sleep on the rock, and was awaked by the chief of the sea lions. He was brought to live in their village beneath the sea. It turned out that he had speared the sea lion chief's son, so Natsilane saved the boy by removing the spearhead from his side. In thanks, the sea lions sent him home in an inflated sealskin bladder. Once home, he visited his wife in secret and had her bring him his carving tools. He set about carving a killer whale, an animal that had yet to exist. First he tried spruce, but that sank when he placed it in a tide pool. Next, he tried hemlock, which also sank. He then tried red cedar, which circled, but then also came to rest on the bottom of the pool. Finally, he tried yellow cedar, his best carving yet. This jumped from the tide pool out to sea. He called the first killer whale back to him and told it to kill his older brothers-in-law when they next went in their canoe to hunt, but to save the youngest brother-in-law. The killer whale capsized the canoe, drowning the older brothers-in-law but brought the youngest back to shore on its back. When the killer whale returned, Natsilane instructed the whale to never again harm humans.&lt;ref&gt;Giraudo Beck 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caduto 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hesquiat====
Raven the trickster came upon three young women drying salmon on the beach. Being hungry, and interested in stealing their salmon he asked them if they were afraid of being alone. They answered no, so he asked if they were afraid of bears, to which they also answered no. He went through a long list of animals, all of which the young women said they were not afraid of until he mentioned owls. The women confessed they were very afraid of owls. Raven walked away and hid himself in some bushes nearby, where he began to mimic owl calls. The women were terrified, and ran up the mountainside. When they were halfway up and could run no more, they turned into yellow cedar trees. This is said to be why cedars are beautiful, growing silky bark like a woman's hair, graceful limbs, and why their young trunks are smooth to touch. This is also why they grow high on the slopes of Vancouver Island.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood==
Yellow cedar's common name comes from the color of its wood, which is pale yellow. The wood is durable, fine grained, contains a natural preservative, and does not split as easily as red cedar, making it very suitable for carving.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; it is also lightweight, pliable, yet strong, and was used to make paddles, fishing floats, rattles, ceremonial masks, speaker's staffs which were used as a badge of office for an announcer at events, bentwood bowls, totem poles, and longhouses. [[Bentwood]] boxes were made by using steam to bend a single plank of red cedar into four sides of a box, and then using yellow cedar pegs to join the corner. These boxes were highly prized and thus were a valuable trade item. They could be used to hold and store goods, or as coffins for the deceased. [[Salish peoples|Salish]] Hunters used yellow cedar saplings to make bows which were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;Huang, "Cedar."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Bill Reid Raven (UBC-2010a).jpg|thumb|Bill Reid Raven (UBC-2010a)]] [[File:Richard Carpenter bent-wood chest detail 01.jpg|thumb|Richard Carpenter bent-wood chest detail 01]]

===Harvesting===
Harvesting of trees was typically done from late summer to early spring. This was to avoid the time when the sap was up as it sped the rotting of the tree.

====Felling a Tree By Burning and Adzing====

A cavity was chiseled into the tree with an adze, and then red hot rocks were applied for controlled burning, with wet hemlock branches placed around the cavity to control the spread of the burn. The tree feller would chop away the charcoal, renewing the treatment of hot rocks as needed.

====Felling a Tree By Burning====

Fire was applied to the base of the tree. A ring of wet clay circled the tree above the fire to control burning.

====Felling a Tree With Hammer, Wedge, and Maul====

A scaffold and platform was built around the tree above the flaring roots. Two chiseled grooves about one foot apart were made around the tree and then the wood between cut away with a hammer and maul. The process was repeated until the tree fell.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 37-40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

===Hammer===
The earliest form of the hammer used when carving yellow cedar was the hammer stone, a hard rock worn smooth by water that was resistant to cracking or flaking. Northern and Southern peoples later developed their own respective hammers. Southern peoples used the hand maul which was held directly in the hand, while northern nations ([[Tsimshian]], [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tlingit]]) used hafted mauls, which were heavy stone heads lashed onto a long haft, similar to a sledge hammer. Many of the stone mauls were sculpted as animal figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wedge===
Wedges when hammered were used to split cedar logs into planks. A variety of woods including yew, spruce, maple, and crabapple were used as wedges. The wood was beveled on one end to allow it to be driven into the cedar, and then scorched to improve its hardness. Animal fat was rubbed into the wood to prevent warping, and a cedar with was twisted around the top end to prevent splitting when struck with a hammer. Antler was also historically used as an alternative to wood wedges.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Adze]]===
The most universal adze was the elbow adze, named for its shape. Metal blades have been found on adzes for several hundred years, and currently very little evidence of stone blades usage exists. Elbow adzes were used for chopping and rough shaping, and were typically used on large works. D adzes were also used from Vancouver island southward. Their name comes from the shape of their haft, which were often carved to represent animals. The D adze was used for finer work and for finishing.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Tools===
Chisels, scrapers, knives, awls, and sandstones to keep the tools sharp were important additional components of a woodcarver's tool chest.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Hibulb Cultural Center - watertight cedar basket c. 1920 (20873657113).jpg|thumb|Hibulb Cultural Center - watertight cedar basket c. 1920 (20873657113)]]

==Bark==
The inner bark of yellow cedar was valued over the inner bark of red cedar because it is more durable.  The inner bark is very versatile and could be dyed and used as different types of thread to create mats, clothing, blankets, basketry, fishing nets, ropes, and hats, the bark is also soft and absorbent, and was used for diapers, sanitary napkins, and bedding as well.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt; Yellow cedar was the only bark used for the core of the warp for [[Chilkat weaving]], due to its strength.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvesting===
Bark was cut and pulled as soon as the sap began to run, which varied regionally from late May to July.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; While carving was typically done by men, the harvesting of bark was performed by women. Straight young trees were chosen, and only a portion was debarked to ensure the tree's survival. Thousands of culturally modified trees with scars from past bark harvesting can now be found along the Pacific Northwest coastline.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt; On the side with the fewest branches, above the flare of the tree's roots, a woman would make a horizontal cut the width of two fingers. She would make a small vertical cut then on either end of the horizontal cut. She would then use a small wedge to pry the bark away from the trunk enough for her to grip securely. Holding this end of the bark, she would then walk away from the tree slowly, drawing a ribbon of bark off the tree. For the bark quality to prove good for weaving, the strip should run at least twenty feet before narrowing to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1995, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
Roots could be dried and then braided to form cords for weaving hats or basketry. Using specific techniques, the baskets could be made water and heat proof, and could be used as cookware.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt;

==Withes==
Withes were used to create strong cords for lashing and ropes. They were a valuable construction tool, and were often used in place nails or bolts. Because of their strength, they were also used to create burden baskets for heavy loads.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">The '''javelin argument''', credited to [[Lucretius]], is an ancient [[logical argument]] that the [[universe]], or [[cosmology|cosmological]] [[space]], must be infinite: 

:As to space, I need but ask you, how can that be bounded? For whatever bounds, it that thing must itself be bounded likewise; and to this bounding thing there must be a bound again, and so on for ever and ever throughout all immensity. Suppose, however, for a moment, all existing space to be bounded, and that a man runs forward to the uttermost borders, and stands upon the last verge of things, and then hurls forward a winged javelin,&amp;mdash; suppose you that the dart, when hurled by the vivid force, shall take its way to the point the darter aimed at, or that something will take its stand in the path of its flight, and arrest it? For one or other of these things must happen. There is a dilemma here that you never can escape from.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GyQgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 Google Books result]: [[William Hurrell Mallock|W. H. Mallock]], ''[[Lucretius]]''. John B. Alden:New York, 1883. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument was used to support the [[Epicurean]] thesis about the universe.

However, the argument assumes incorrectly that a finite universe must necessarily have a "limit" or edge. The argument fails in the case that [[shape of the universe|the universe might be shaped]] like the surface of a [[hypersphere]] or [[torus]]. (Consider a similar fallacious argument that the Earth's surface must be infinite in area: because otherwise one could go to the Earth's edge and throw a javelin, proving that the Earth's surface continued wherever the javelin hit the ground.)

'''Language acquisition by deaf children''' parallels the development of any children acquiring spoken language as long as there is full access to language from birth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Despite limited access to spoken language, communication and language exposure are fundamental to deaf infants' general cognitive development and their engagement with their surroundings.

== Early stages (birth to 12 months) ==
The general stages of [[language acquisition]] are the same whether the language is spoken or signed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sign language : An international handbook|last=Pfau|first=Roland|last2=Steinbach|first2=Markus|last3=Woll|first3=Bencie|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|others=|year=2012|isbn=9783110204216|location=Berlin|pages=647|oclc=812574063}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are certain unique features of sign language acquisition due to the visual/manual [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]] and these differences can help to distinguish between universal aspects of language acquisition and aspects that may be affected by early experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The very earliest linguistic tasks facing newborns are perceptual.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Babies need to determine what basic linguistic elements are used in their native language to create words (their [[Phonetics|phonetic]] inventory). They also need to determine how to segment the continuous stream of language input into phrases and eventually words.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; From birth, they have an attraction to patterned linguistic input, which is evident whether the input is spoken or signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petitto|first=Laura Ann|last2=Marentette|first2=P|date=1991|title=Babbling in the manual mode: Evidence for the ontogeny of language|pmid=2006424|journal=Science|volume=251|issue=5000|pages=483–1496|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Adam|last2=Petitto|first2=Laura Ann|last3=Bosworth|first3=Rain|date=December 2017|title=Visual Sonority Modulates Infants' Attraction to Sign Language|url=http://petitto.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Visual-sonority-modulates-infants-attraction-to-sign-language.pdf|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=|pages=1–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petitto|first=Laura Ann|last2=Zatorre|first2=Robert J.|last3=Gauna|first3=Kristine|last4=Nikelski|first4=E.

Research shows that Deaf parents with deaf infants are more successful than hearing parents at capturing moments of [[joint attention]] when signing, which are privileged language learning moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Patricia|last2=Harris|first2=Margaret|date=2006|title=Patterns and effects of language input to deaf infants and toddlers from deaf and hearing mothers|url=|journal=Advances in the Sign Language Development of Deaf Children|volume=|pages=71–101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf mothers are more adept at ensuring that the infant is visually engaged prior to signing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=M.|date=2001-07-01|title=It's All a Matter of Timing: Sign Visibility and Sign Reference in Deaf and Hearing Mothers of 18-Month-Old Children|url=https://academic.oup.com/jdsde/article/6/3/177/454612|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=177–185|doi=10.1093/deafed/6.3.177|pmid=15451848|issn=1081-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use specific modifications to their signing, referred to as child-directed sign&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pizer, Meier|first=G, R|date=2008|title=Pizer, G., &amp; Meier, R.

== Methods ==
=== Pedagogy ===

Language acquisition strategies for signing deaf children are different than those appropriate for hearing children, or for deaf children who successfully use hearing aids and/or cochlear implants. For parents with deaf children who do not use amplification (hearing aids or cochlear implants), [[joint attention]] (an important component to language development) can be problematic. Hearing children can watch their environment and listen to an adult comment on it. However, children who do not hear have to switch their visual attention back and forth between stimuli. 

Strategies for nonverbal communication include using facial expressions and body language to show emotion and reinforce the child's attention to their caregiver. To attract and direct a deaf child's attention, caregivers can break his line of gaze using hand and body movements, touch, and pointing to allow language input. In order to make language salient,{{clarify|reason=salient language?|date=February 2018}} parents should use short, simple sentences so that the child's attention doesn’t have to be divided for too long. Finally, to reduce the need for divided attention, a caregiver can position themselves and objects within the child's visual field so that language and the object can be seen at the same time.

=== Speech and oral methods ===

For deaf children who use listening and spoken language as their primary mode of communication, their families will often participate in [[Auditory-verbal therapy]], a means of enhancing the innate language and listening skills of deaf children. Most children who receive appropriate amplification before the age of 18 months and receive appropriate auditory-verbal instruction will follow language-learning trajectories of their peers who have typical hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Niparko |first1=John |author1link=John Niparko |last2=Tobey |first2=Emily |last3=Thal |first3=Donna |title=Spoken Language Development in Children Following Cochlear Implantation |journal=JAMA |date=April 21, 2010 |volume=303 |issue=15 |pages=1498–1506 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.451|pmid=20407059 |pmc=3073449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signing and manual methods ===

==== ASL (American sign language) ====

[[ASL]] employs signs made by moving one's hands along with one's facial expressions and body language. Some studies indicate that if a deaf child learns sign language, he or she will be less likely to learn spoken languages because they will lose motivation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} However, Humphries insists that there is no evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Tom|last2=Kushalnagar|first2=Poorna|last3=Mathur|first3=Gaurav|last4=Napoli|first4=Donna Jo|last5=Padden|first5=Carol|last6=Rathmann|first6=Christian|last7=Smith|first7=Scott R.|date=2012-01-01|title=Language acquisition for deaf children: Reducing the harms of zero tolerance to the use of alternative approaches|journal=Harm Reduction Journal|volume=9|pages=16|doi=10.1186/1477-7517-9-16|issn=1477-7517|pmc=3384464|pmid=22472091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manually coded English ====

[[Manually coded English]] is any one of a number of different representations of the English language that uses manual signs to encode English words visually. Although MCE uses signs, it is not a language like ASL; it is an [[encoding]] of English that uses hand gestures to make English visible in a visual mode. Most types of MCE use signs borrowed or adapted from American Sign Language, but use English sentence order and grammatical construction.

Numerous systems of manually encoded English have been proposed and used with greater or lesser success. 
Methods such as [[Signed English]], [[Signing Exact English]],&lt;ref name="Kong-2008"&gt;Kong, W. W., &amp; Ranganath, S. (2008). Signing exact english (see): Modeling and recognition. Pattern Recognition, 41(5), 1638-1652.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistics of Visual English]], and others use signs borrowed from ASL along with various grammatical marker signs, to indicate whole words, or meaning-bearing [[morphemes]] like ''-ed'' or ''-ing''.

Because MCE systems are encodings of English which follow English word order and sentence structure, it's possible to sign MCE and speak English at the same time.  This is a technique that is used in order to teach deaf children the structure of the English language not only through the sound and lip-reading patterns of spoken English, but also through manual patterns of signed English. Because of the close connection between the two, it is easier for hearing people to learn MCE than ASL.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==== Cued speech ====

[[Cued Speech]] is a hybrid, oral/manual system of communication used by some deaf or hard-of-hearing people. It is a technique that uses handshapes near the mouth ("cues") to represent phonemes that can be challenging for some deaf or hard-of-hearing people to distinguish from one another through speechreading ("lipreading") alone. It is designed to help receptive communicators to observe and fully understand the speaker.

Cued speech is not a signed language, and it does not have any signs in common with ASL. It is a kind of augmented speechreading, making speechreading much more accurate and accessible to deaf people. The handshapes by themselves have no meaning; they only have meaning as a cue in combination with a mouth shape, so that the mouth shape 'two lips together' plus one handshape might mean an 'M' sound, the same shape with a different cue might represent a 'B' sound, and with a third cue might represent a 'P' sound.

Some research shows a link between lack of phonological awareness and reading disorders, and indicate that teaching cued speech may be an aid to phonological awareness and literacy.&lt;ref name=Ostrander-1998&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |dead-url=yes |title=The Relationship Between Phonological Coding And Reading Achievement In Deaf Children: Is Cued Speech A Special Case? |first1=Carolyn |last1=Ostrander |date=1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113162758/web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fingerspelling ====

Another manual encoding system used by the deaf and which has been around for more than two centuries is [[fingerspelling]]. Fingerspelling is a system that encodes letters and not words or morphemes, so is not a manual encoding of English, but rather an encoding of the alphabet. As such, it is a method of spelling out words one letter at a time using 26 different handshapes. In the United States and many other countries, the letters are indicated on one hand&lt;ref&gt;Carmel, Simon (1982). ''International hand alphabet charts.''

Since fingerspelling is connected to the alphabet and not to entire words, it can be used to spell out words in any language that uses the same alphabet; so it is not tied to any one language in particular, and to that extent, it is analogous to other letter-encodings, such as [[Morse code]], or [[Semaphore]].  The [[Rochester Method]] relies heavily on fingerspelling, but it is slow and has mostly fallen out of favor.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Hybrid methods ===

Hybrid methods use a mixture of aural/oral methods as well as some visible indicators such as hand shapes in order to communicate in the standard spoken language by making parts of it visible to those with hearing loss.{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

==== Reading ====

According to Goldin-Meadow, reading requires two essential abilities: familiarity with a language and understanding the mapping between that language and the written word. However, reading is possible if deaf children learn ASL. Once they have acquired ASL, deaf children learn how to map between sign language and print so that they can learn English. Several techniques are used to help bridge the gap between ASL and spoken language or the "translation process" such as sandwiching and chaining.

Sandwiching consists of alternating between saying the word and signing it. Chaining consists of finger spelling a word, pointing to the spoken language version of the word and using pictorial support. Although chaining is not widely used, it creates an understanding between the visual spelling of a word and the sign language spelling of the word. This helps the child become bilingual in both ASL and spoken language.

The deaf child's social context is crucial for nurturing his or her capacity to read. Research shows that deaf children born to deaf parents are usually better readers than deaf children born to hearing parents.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is because deaf parents provide a strong social and emotional network and may immediately have access to the necessary resources for their child. Deaf parents already anticipate the needs of their child, having been through the same experience, as opposed to a hearing parent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Cochlear implants==
A [[cochlear implant]] is placed surgically inside the cochlea, which is the part of the inner ear that converts sound to neural signals. There is much debate regarding the linguistic conditions under which deaf children acquire spoken language via cochlear implantation. Some studies have concluded that long-term use of sign language impedes the development of spoken language and reading ability in deaf and hard of hearing children, and that using sign language is not at all advantageous, and can be detrimental to language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geers|first=A.

===Ethics and language acquisition===

Cochlear implants have been the subject of a heated debate between those that believe deaf children should receive the implants and those that do not. Members of the Deaf Community believe this is an important ethical problem. They strongly advocate that sign language is their first or native language just as any other spoken language is for a hearing person. They do not see deafness as a deficiency in any way, but rather a normal human trait amongst a variety of different ones. One issue on the ethical perspective of implantation is the possible side effects that may present themselves after surgery (the body may physically reject the implant; for some reason, there may not be any benefit, or very little gained; the internal component may need to be replaced causing the need for another surgery), even in some cases lessening listening capabilities, losing residual hearing or hearing sounds differently. While the surgery presents one positive solution, these side effects are not often taken into account but are significant and need to be afforded more attention. However, complications from cochlear implant surgery is a rare event, with some centers showing less than a three percent failure rate.{{cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239926.php|title=Cochlear Implant Failure Rate Generally Low}}

== Relationship between language acquisition and other domains of development ==

=== Cognitive development ===
Early exposure to language facilitates language acquisition, regardless of whether or not that exposure is native or non-native, as well as many other domains of development, such as cognitive development, including executive functioning skills. Executive functioning skills are extremely important, as these are the skills that guide learning and behavior&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Matthew L.|last2=Eigsti|first2=Inge-Marie|last3=Bortfeld|first3=Heather|last4=Lillo-Martin|first4=Diane|date=2016-09-13|title=Auditory Deprivation Does Not Impair Executive Function, But Language Deprivation Might: Evidence From a Parent-Report Measure in Deaf Native Signing Children|url=https://academic.oup.com/jdsde/article/22/1/9/2744719|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=9–21|doi=10.1093/deafed/enw054|pmid=27624307|pmc=5189172|issn=1081-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These skills include self-regulation, inhibition, emotional control, working memory, and planning and organization, which contribute to overall social, emotional and academic development for children. Early access to a language, such as sign language, from birth supports the development of these cognitive skills and abilities in Deaf and hard of hearing children, and supports their development in this area&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-12-01|title=Age constraints on first versus second language acquisition: Evidence for linguistic plasticity and epigenesis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X03001378|journal=Brain and Language|language=en|volume=87|issue=3|pages=369–384|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(03)00137-8|issn=0093-934X|last1=Mayberry|first1=Rachel I.|last2=Lock|first2=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, late exposure to language and delayed language acquisition can inhibit or delay the cognitive development of deaf and hard of hearing children, and impact these skills. This late exposure to language, or lack thereof, can be defined as language deprivation (see [[Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children]]). This experience is the result of a lack of exposure to natural human language, whether that be spoken or signed language, during the critical language period&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. Approximately 90% of Deaf children are born to hearing parents, and 95% of those Deaf children experience language deprivation to some degree&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. Language Deprivation has been found to impair deaf children’s cognitive development, specifically their executive functioning skills, and working memory, causing deficits in critical executive functioning skills and overall cognitive development.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Chloë|last2=Jones|first2=Anna|last3=Denmark|first3=Tanya|last4=Mason|first4=Kathryn|last5=Atkinson|first5=Joanna|last6=Botting|first6=Nicola|last7=Morgan|first7=Gary|date=2015|title=Deaf children's non-verbal working memory is impacted by their language experience|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=6|pages=527|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00527|pmid=25999875|pmc=4419661|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is not deafness that causes these deficits, but late language acquisition that influences the cognitive development and abilities of deaf people.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Social-emotional development ===
&lt;p&gt;Having an acquired language means an individual has had full access to at least one spoken or signed language.Typically, if a person has had this full access to language and has been able to acquire it, then being able to enter into a realm of social and emotional becomes plausible. Being able to communicate using is critical for those still developing their social skills&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/140.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAZ4wggGaBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGLMIIBhwIBADCCAYAGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMFh5pQJvI5m7dR_GxAgEQgIIBUQWnPtWmmWaPBeEiz0cUJNT8WZgv874iQ6cl-7oN1u8Ktoi4ri0FwtVMhiNbIFiEu7aR1pI_jcWOV6ZYOY55gnxEP0sk3npoEW_faTEwZtE3Gjsc9rHx5OWwUf6rjKwY7eZ4CeyyfNus6W-WQm93NtINR4pEV8GRPV3A3h2yfj0x-ifP4_PSjXOJ6Z_f-YOgP2wGMSZMeC-DqQ8msacRllYRbbF0sVeDJjg-Owxo-r2DdGtEc3UTPRAEftiOi1Psp-bpIcF-tlfyUtXOnUkOKH6YiIh2ba9Sly2SSmfCYal2oUZsVCpZ-qE67_3uUN5CrPmso9eCCCDKJqol9LvkU_9P_Lqib3R8sAErjQoetJk70-HfjrgDKd4idBF3NvrgTI1y6udZw187mJin7tRM4OJSMmF85OqfvBACkU179KmsMSX48QVP51b5GszvMPSOUX8|title=Parental Involvement in Deaf Children's Education Programs as a Predictor of Child's Language, Early Reading, and Social- Emotional Development|last=Calderon|first=Rosemary|date=2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also evidence to suggest that language acquisition can play a critical role in developing [[Theory of mind|Theory of Mind]], or developing the understanding of false beliefs in language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schick|first=Brenda|last2=de Villiers|first2=Peter|last3=de Villiers|first3=Jill|last4=Hoffmeister|first4=Robert|date=2007-03|title=Language and Theory of Mind: A Study of Deaf Children|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|pages=376–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01004.x|pmid=17381779|issn=0009-3920|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.8685}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For children who have been deprived of this access or have not yet fully acquired a language, social development can be hindered, which in turn can affect one’s emotional development as well.&lt;/p&gt;The lack of socialization can significantly impact a child’s emotional well-being. A child’s first experience with social communication typically begins at home, but deaf and hard of hearing children in particular who are born to hearing parents tend to struggle with this interaction, due to the fact that they are a “minority in their own family"&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ME5q-42NojgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=social+emotional+development+%22deaf+children%22,+Moores,+2001#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20emotional%20development%20%22deaf%20children%22,%20Moores,%202001&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education|last=NEWSOM|first=CAROL|last2=Newsom|first2=Professor of Old Testament Carol A.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195149975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Parents who have a Deaf child typically do not know a signed language, the logistical problem can become how to give that child a full language. If deaf and hard of hearing children are not developing their social skills at home, by the time they enter school, they can be behind in this development. All of this can lead to struggles with proper emotional development. It can be hard on a child who was not given a language early to try and express their emotions appropriately. The problem is not with the deaf child, but instead, not giving a deaf or hard of hearing child the necessary language access from birth that other children receive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ME5q-42NojgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=emotional+deaf+children+#v=onepage&amp;q=emotional%20deaf%20children&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education|last=NEWSOM|first=CAROL|last2=Newsom|first2=Professor of Old Testament Carol A.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195149975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are theories to suggest that language acquisition is a predictor of how a child can develop Theory of Mind and without a full language, this skill becomes null. Theory of Mind can be an indicator of social and cognitive development. Without language acquisition, Deaf children can become behind in Theory of Mind and the skills that coincide, which can lead to further social and emotional delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schick|first=Brenda|last2=de Villiers|first2=Peter|last3=de Villiers|first3=Jill|last4=Hoffmeister|first4=Robert|date=2007-03|title=Language and Theory of Mind: A Study of Deaf Children|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|pages=376–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01004.x|pmid=17381779|issn=0009-3920|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.8685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic development ===
Second language acquisition is also highly affected by early language exposure&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kroll et al.|date=2015|title=Bilingualism, Mind, and Brain|url=|journal=Annual Review of Linguistics|volume=1|pages=377–394|via=Annual Reviews|pmid=28642932|pmc=5478196|doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-124937}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More exposure in an accessible language leads to better performance in the second language upon entering school&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Providing deaf and hard of hearing children with the most language exposure possible from birth promotes both first and second language acquisition. This means giving students the opportunity to develop language at home and in social environments early on supports the child's language acquisition in American Sign Language as well as printed English&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;. There is extensive research regarding the correlation between proficiency in ASL and proficiency in English literacy skills&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2006|title=The Relationship between American Sign Language Proficiency and English Academic Development: A Review of the Research|url=|journal=Research Gate|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Verify source|date=May 2018}}. Deaf students with higher ASL proficiency tend to have higher English reading and writing scores&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;. There is also research to support that the development of a second language also improves proficiency in the student's first language&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to Hrastinski &amp; [[Ronnie Wilbur|Wilbur]] (2016), American Sign Language proficiency is the single most contributing factor to Deaf student’s academic achievement, particularly in reading literacy and math.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/env072.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaMwggGfBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGQMIIBjAIBADCCAYUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMS3camrsCwizIKhRSAgEQgIIBVpFuCm23QV_wHVAF3qVgbdg62eoEq1JZsJzomxbO32RncjGo5NWdeLlsU9FuynA2gSKh0AmiGnxZbZZTlHY_7pXQ-hiftLjL9eDTOfd3ZjUbfJmfcS15UDVJ1MTCiBrZukQfXeLsILvWEB4vfub0AoAbauMv9_DJI_g_gwToj0mPihM_xeoxSZ8-ol7ZoHV8nHQ_2B88eVr-zbdCzQvcPSfuAFVi-6a1o_G0R1AFAXIdoCpkobHaTGZNZpWS2LYyjZu6ROohCwka4zTyQm3bZUH4cavd5Eex0uGq67odjR3Q3wWsUB2KnmIfYC0ZBBRhBZl0UDp7glaYAeXhKXQVAm4HsR5VdFOAVUCKF-c9zY_wLIX07ANiGjyQJRBbDYl8gs0Bau5w4oD77V_WYsbZZcbJedA2IjGAVtcZUmBJioWxxHKSeEbIZAdBpwfmLGUkgl-GTlbmUw|title=Academic Achievement of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Students in an ASL/English Bilingual Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Lawmaking''' is the process of crafting legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lawmaking|title=Lawmaking definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its purest sense, it is the basis of [[governance]].  
This form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.
Lawmaking in modern [[democracy|democracies]] is the work of [[legislature]]s, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions.  These bodies are influenced by [[lobbyist]]s, [[pressure group]]s, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended.  Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the [[budget]] is a matter of law.

In [[dictator|dictatorships]] and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement.  However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the [[executive (government)|executive]] can make [[executive order]]s which have the force of law.  In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law.  [[Libertarian]]s, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law.  That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented.  In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic [[sunset]] after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

An '''open-air museum''' (or '''open air museum''') is a [[museum]] that exhibits collections of buildings and artifacts out-of-doors. They are also frequently known as '''museums of buildings''' or [[folk museum]]s.

The concept of an open-air museum originated in [[Scandinavia]] in the late 19th century and spread widely. A comprehensive history of the open-air museum as an idea and institution can be found in Swedish museologist [[Sten Rentzhog]]'s 2007 book ''Open Air Museums: The History and Future of a Visionary Idea''.

Living history museums, including '''living farm museums''' and ''[[living museum]]s'', open-air museums where costumed interpreters portray period life in an earlier era. The interpreters act as if they are living in a different time and place and perform everyday household tasks, crafts, and occupations. The goal is to demonstrate older lifestyles and pursuits to modern audiences. Household tasks might include cooking on an open [[hearth]], [[Churning (butter)|churning butter]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning wool]] and [[weaving]], and farming without modern equipment. Many living museums feature traditional craftsmen at work, such as a [[blacksmith]], [[tinsmith|pewtersmith]], [[silversmith]], [[Weaving|weaver]], [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]], [[armorer]], [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]], [[Pottery|potter]], [[miller]], [[sawyer (occupation)|sawyer]], [[joiner|cabinet-maker]], [[woodcarver]], [[Printing press|printer]], doctor and [[general store|general store keeper]].

==Definition==
''Open air'' is “The unconfined atmosphere…outside buildings…”&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the loosest sense, an open-air museum is any institution that includes one or more buildings in its collections, including farm museums, [[historic house museum]]s, and [[archaeological open-air museum]]s. Mostly ''open-air museum'' is applied to museums that specialize in the collection and re-erection of multiple old buildings at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of re-created landscapes of the past and often include [[living history]]. They may therefore be described as building museums. European open-air museums tended to be originally in regions where wooden architecture prevailed, as wooden structures may be trans-located without substantial loss of authenticity.

Common to all open-air museums, including the earliest ones of the 19th century, is the teaching of the history of everyday living by people from all segments of society.

==Origins==
[[File:Skansen, Stockholm, Sweden WDL2622.png|thumb|A view of [[Skansen]], the first open-air museum, in {{circa}}1900]]
The idea of the open-air museum dates to the 1790s. The first proponent of the idea was the Swiss thinker [[Charles Victor de Bonstetten|Charles de Bonstetten]] and was based on a visit to an exhibit of peasant costumes in the [[park of Frederiksborg Castle]] in [[Denmark]].{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} He believed that traditional peasant houses should be preserved against modernity but failed to attract support for the idea.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}}

The first major steps towards the creation of open-air museums was taken in [[Norway]] in 1867 when a private citizen transferred some historic farm buildings to a site near [[Oslo]] (Christiania) for public viewing.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} This, in turn, inspired [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]] in 1881 to establish his own collection nearby, later inherited by the [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norwegian Folk Museum]].{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} The similar [[Nordic Museum]], was founded in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] soon afterwards.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} In 1891, the first major open-air museum was founded at [[Skansen]], in [[Stockholm]], as a part of the Nordic Museum.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} The Skansen museum included farm buildings from across [[Scandinavia]], folk costumes, live animals, folk music, and demonstrations of folk crafts.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|pp=368-9}} The success of Skansen ensured that the open-air museum idea spread to countries across the world.

Most open-air museums concentrate on rural culture. However, since the opening of the first town museum, [[The Old Town, Aarhus|The Old Town]] in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/int/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218122006/http://www.dengamleby.dk/int/english.htm |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; town culture has also become a scope of open-air museums. In many cases new town quarters are being constructed in existing rural culture museums.

==North American innovations==
[[File:Williamsburg Virginia11.jpg|thumb|Traditional buildings in [[Colonial Williamsburg]]]]
The North American open-air museum, more commonly called a living history museum, had a different, slightly later origin than the European, and the visitor experience is different. The first was [[Henry Ford]]'s [[Greenfield Village]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] (1928), where Ford intended his collection to be “a pocket edition of America”.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;Kenneth Hudson, ''Museums of Influence'', Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|153}} But it was [[Colonial Williamsburg]] (opened in 1934) which had a greater influence on museum development in North America. It influenced such projects through the continent as [[Mystic Seaport]], [[Plimoth Plantation]], and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. What tends to differentiate the North American from the European model is the approach to interpretation. In Europe, the tendency is to usually focus on the buildings.

In North America, many open-air museums include interpreters who dress in period costume and conduct period crafts and everyday work.&lt;ref name="Hudson"/&gt;{{rp|154}} The living museum is therefore viewed as an attempt to recreate to the fullest extent conditions of a [[culture]], [[natural environment]] or [[history|historical period]]. The objective is immersion, using exhibits so that visitors can experience the specific culture, environment or historical period using the physical senses.

Performance and historiographic practices at American living museums have been critiqued in the past several years by scholars in anthropology and theater for creating false senses of authenticity and accuracy, and for neglecting to bear witness to some of the darker aspects of the American past (e.g., slavery and other forms of injustice). Even before such critiques were published, sites such as Williamsburg and others had begun to add more interpretation of difficult history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Magelssen]], ''Living History Museums: Undoing History Through Performance'', Scarecrow Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Participatory planning''' is an [[urban planning]] [[paradigm]] that emphasizes involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban planning; or, community-level planning processes, urban or rural. It is often considered as part of [[community development]].&lt;ref name="REFALPHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/bsf/cppe/cppe.pdf|title= Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation|publisher=IFAD|accessdate=2008-10-21| format=PDF| date=December 2000| last=Lefevre | first=Pierre|last2=Kolsteren|first2=Patrick| last3=De Wael| first3=Marie-Paule | last4=Byekwaso| first4=Francis | last5= Beghin|first5=Ivan|location=Antwerp, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory planning aims to harmonize views among all of its participants as well as prevent conflict between opposing parties. In addition, [[marginalized]] groups have an opportunity to participate in the planning process.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"&gt;[McTague, C. &amp; Jakubowski, S. Marching to the beat of a silent drum: Wasted consensus-building and failed neighborhood participatory planning. Applied Geography 44, 182–191 (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

===Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation===
Responding to the gap between the desires of local communities, and government programs such as [[urban renewal]], Sherry Arnstein wrote ''A Ladder of Citizen Participation'' to "encourage a more enlightened dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnstein|first1=Sherry R.|title=A Ladder Of Citizen Participation|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Planners|date=July 1969|volume=35|issue=4|page=216|doi=10.1080/01944366908977225}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed the ladder as a typology, with eight rungs ranging from various degrees of nonparticipation, to degrees of tokenism, and ultimately, citizen power. Her critical assault on planning methods of the time has informed policies affecting the growth and change in participatory methods, broadening access to planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffin|first1=Greg P.|title=Geographic specificity and positionality of public input in transportation: a rural transportation planning case from Central Texas|journal=Urban, Planning and Transport Research|date=16 October 2014|volume=2|issue=1|pages=407–422|doi=10.1080/21650020.2014.969442|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21650020.2014.969442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971 U.S. Department of Transportation seminar===
A 1971 [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]] publication summarized seminars where professional planners, public administrators, and citizens debated the idea of participatory planning.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"&gt;[Metropolitan transportation planning seminars. (Washington :, 1971). at http://hdl.handle.net/2027/ien.35556021061726]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Transportation recognized that citizens felt excluded from the current planning processes.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; In the seminar the following questions were asked: "Why do you want citizens to participate? What kind of citizens should be included? When should citizen participation enter the planning process? How do you organize citizen participation? How much power should be invested in citizen participation groups? Where do local elected officials fit in the citizen participation element? What are the responsibilities of the planner regarding citizen participation?".&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; The consensus was that citizen participation is valuable for better planning as well as for minimizing confrontation; however, not everyone agreed on how to effectively involve citizens.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt;

===Structure===
Planning needed a structure to allow natural and meaningful input from citizens.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"&gt;[Smith, R. W. A theoretical basis for participatory planning. Policy Sci 4, 275–295 (1973)]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for this to happen, planning needed to move away from its [[Hierarchy#Methods using the hierarchical model|hierarchical model]] and move toward a reticular model.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"/&gt; The reticular model would allow for more citizen participation.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. W 1973"/&gt; While there is some demand for a [[wikt:top-down|top-down approach]] with [[centralized]] decision-making from experts, participatory planning uses a bottom-up approach. Participatory planning aims to add more participation in decision-making, increase the legitimacy of politicians and officials, and provide for more criticism of experts' plans.&lt;ref&gt;[Murray, M. Participatory Spatial Planning : Learning from Rural Ireland. (Ashgate Publishing Group, 2010). at &lt;http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10421617&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard approach to planning can be defined in the following quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Town and country planning might be described as the art and science of ordering the use of land and the character of siting of buildings and communication routes so as to secure the maximum practicable degree of economy, convenience and beauty (Keeble,1952)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This approach does not withstand the addition of complex regional and local [[socio-economic]] aspects. The top down model lacked a way to approach planning. Taylor proposes an entirely different approach to Keeble:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It suggested the need for a new kind of planner altogether, one who was trained in analyzing and understanding how cities and regions functioned spatially in economic and social terms – a planner, that is trained in [[economic geography]] or the [[social science]]s rather than [[architecture]] or [[surveying]] (Taylor 1998)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Participatory planning demands that planners incorporate a variety of interest groups in their process.&lt;ref&gt;[Davidoff, P. Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning. Journal of the American Institute of Planners 31, 331–338 (1965).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In the [[UN Habitat]] document ''Building Bridges Through Participatory Planning'', Fred Fisher, president of the International Development Institute for Organization and Management, identifies '''Participatory Reflection And Action''' (PRA) as the leading school of participatory planning.  He identifies [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Kurt Lewin]] as key pioneers, as well as claiming planning fathers [[Patrick Geddes]] and [[Lewis Mumford]] as participatory planners.  Freire's belief that poor and exploited people can, and should be, enabled to analyze their own reality was a fundamental inspiration for the participatory planning movement. Lewin's relevance lay in his integration of democratic leadership, [[group dynamics]], [[Experiential education|experiential learning]], [[action research]], and [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]]s theory, and his efforts to overcome racial and ethnic injustices.

In general, PRA has been supplanted by '''[[Participatory rural appraisal|Participatory Learning and Action]]''' (PLA), which emphasizes the links between the participatory process and action. Related work has been done on ''[[community-based participatory research]]'' (CBPR).&lt;ref name="REFBETA"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=533&amp;cid=4474&amp;activeid=4471|title=Building Bridges through Participatory Planning|last=Fisher|first=Fred|year=2001|publisher=UN-HABITAT|accessdate=2008-10-21|isbn=92-1-131623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
[[Robert Chambers (development scholar)|Robert Chambers]], whom Fisher considered a leading icon of the movement, defines PRA according to the following principles;
;Handing over the stick (or pen or chalk)
:Facilitating investigation, analysis, presentation and learning by local people themselves, so they generate and own the outcomes and also learn.
;Self-critical awareness
:Facilitators continuously and critically examine their own behavior.
;Personal responsibility
:Taking responsibility for what is done, rather than, for instance, relying on the authority of manuals or on rigid rules.
;Sharing
:Involves the wide range of techniques now available, from chatting across the fence to photocopies and e-mail.

PRA and PLA methods and approaches include:
* Do-it-yourself: local people as experts and teachers, and outsiders as novices
* [[Local analysis]] of [[secondary source]]s
* Mapping and modeling
* Time lines and trend and change analysis
* Seasonal calendars
* Daily [[Time-use research|time-use analysis]]
* Institutional diagramming
* Matrix scoring and ranking
* Shared presentations and analysis, and
* Participatory planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring.

==Tools==

===E-Planning===
Participatory e-planning is relatively new way to engage citizens in urban planning. [[E-participation]] is defined as "technology-mediated interaction between the civil society sphere and the formal politics sphere"&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"&gt;[Saad-Sulonen, J. The Role of the Creation and Sharing of Digital Media Content in Participatory E-Planning: International Journal of E-Planning Research 1, 1–22 (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Horelli and Wallin (2010), "participatory e-planning, similarly to e-participation, can be an important instrument of e-democracy and e-governance".&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; Participatory e-planning is also related to engaging the general public to use tools traditionally used by urban planning experts, such as [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] and Planning Support Systems.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;
Participatory e-planning research has focused on incorporating forms of participation with existing governance and urban planning processes. The e-planning research is also limited to needs of current participatory planning.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The original investigations used tools like online questionnaires, surveys, and polls to consultant citizens.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The feedback from participating citizens is then used or not used by experts and professionals. Before e-planning, citizens could provide only their opinion via direct confrontation, [[snail mail]], phone calls, or e-mails.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt; The e-planning participation tools allow for more organized and substantive participation from the interested public.
The tools are:

{{quote|1."Plans-on-the-map", which is a website that allows citizens to get acquainted with existing plans

2. "Tell-it-on-the-map", which is a questionnaire-based online tool to collect citizens' comments on specific issues presented by planners.

3. The planning competitions website, where citizens can get acquainted with ongoing planning competitions and comment on them.
&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;}}

These tools allow feedback, but still do not allow the public to spotlight issues they find important. Critiques challenge the e-planning tool to empower citizens to collaborate on the same level with experts. More and more citizens own devices that allow them to produce media. Participatory e-planning can not only use customary collaborative urban planning tools but must delve into sharing media content.&lt;ref name="Saad-Sulonen, J 2012"/&gt;

==Managing forests with participatory planning==
[[Forest management]] involves a variety of stakeholders, including the owners of the forest, locals, tourism enterprises, recreational uses, private or official conservationists, or the forest industry. Each of these parties has a different goal in using forests, which complicates planning.&lt;ref&gt;[Kangas, A., Kangas, Jyrki, Kurttila, Mikko. Decision Support for Forest Management. (Springer Science + Business Media B.V, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory approaches and computerized tools like [[Decision support system|decision support systems (DSS)]] have opposing views in sustainable forest management. Researchers question whether these tools can work together and/or combine with other tools to allow for positive participation.&lt;ref name="Menzel, S. 2012"&gt;[Menzel, S. et al. Decision support systems in forest management: requirements from a participatory planning perspective. Eur J Forest Res 131, 1367–1379 (2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; The features of DSS that may help participatory processes are the following: "group decision support, possibilities to include other values than timber production, flexibility of system to include non-traditional forest data and management options, and multi-criteria decision analysis tools.&lt;ref name="Menzel, S. 2012"/&gt;"

==Examples==

===World Bank===
The community-driven development approach advocated by [[World Bank Group|the World Bank]] is an example of participatory planning.

A number of examples link participatory community plans with [[local government]] planning. One widely applied example is [[South Africa]]'s national policy of community-based planning methodology, and an adapted version, the ''Harmonised Participatory Planning Guide for Lower Level Local Governments'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khanya-aicdd.org/publications/CBP%20HPPG_for_Lower_Local%20Governments_0308.pdf/|publisher=Republic of Uganda Ministry of Local Government|title=Harmonized Participatory Planning Guide for Lower Local Governments|date=August 2003|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is national policy in Uganda. Community-Based Planning has been applied across the whole of [[Durban|eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] in South Africa, including the City of Durban, and is being rolled out in [[Ekurhuleni Municipality|Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality]].{{When|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For further information on community-based economic development in Uganda, South Africa, Ghana and Zimbabwe, visit the [http://www.khanya-aicdd.org African Institute for Community-Driven Development's website].&lt;/ref&gt; Community-Based Planning is an example of the practical application of the [[sustainable living]].

===Case Study: Britain in the 1940s===
After the bombing of British cities during World War II, planning advocates wanted to use the reconstruction planning as a way to engage the public.&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"&gt;[Cowan, S. E. "Democracy, Technocracy and Publicity: Public Consultation and British Planning, 1939-1951. (2010). at &lt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jb4j9cz&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The planners wanted more authority in the political system to play a more substantive role within their democracy. The planners created new techniques to, "communicate with laypeople, including mobilizing publicity, measuring public opinion, organizing exhibitions, and experimenting with new visual strategies"&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"/&gt; They also developed a forum to educate and ask the public about various plans and policies.&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"/&gt;

===Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood===
Cincinnati's [[Over-the-rhine|Over-The-Rhine's]] Comprehensive Plan was created in a participatory planning process, but its consistent monitoring of its implementation failed.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt; Looking at Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, geographers saw potential logistical ways to obtain "necessary data, create a land-use GIS to analyze the data, update the data, and monitor the progress of the implementation of the Over-the Rhine Comprehensive Plan".&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt; In the case of Cincinnati, it is proven that plans that are not carried out fail to live up to the participatory planning theory. Failures like that of the Over-the-Rhine plan make it harder for further progress toward plan's goal and objectives as well as muting the participants.&lt;ref name="McTague, C. 2013"/&gt;

==Challenges==
Ensuring that all sections of the community are able to participate is a challenge for participatory planning. Some approaches, such as Community-Based Planning, separate the community so that the livelihoods and preferred outcomes of different [[Group (sociology)|social groups]] can be identified.

Many experiences with ''participatory reflection and action'' and participatory planning suffer from a lack of follow-up. PRA has often not been part of a system, but an ''[[ad hoc]]'' process. Community-Based Planning has tried to overcome this by linking planning to the mainstream local government planning system.

Another challenge is caused by a lack of funds to actually implement the plans, which can lead to participation fatigue and frustration among communities. In the social-investment funds supported by the World Bank, participatory planning is often the first step, often leading to planning of infrastructure. In some cases, such as Community-Based Planning in South Africa, amounts of around{{Quantify|date=September 2010}} US$3,500 to $6,800 are provided to each ward to implement activities arising from the ward plan. This then stimulates more widespread community action.

===Center for Urban Pedagogy===
[[Center for Urban Pedagogy|The Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP)]] in [[New york city|New York City]] "is a nonprofit organization that uses design and art to improve [[civic engagement]]".&lt;ref name="welcometocup.org"&gt;[CUP: About. at http://welcometocup.org/About]&lt;/ref&gt; CUP projects aim to involve more individuals to work on policy and urban planning issues. CUP increases the public understanding of urban planning systems so that more of the community becomes involved. "CUP projects are collaborations of art and design professionals, community-based advocates and policymakers, and our staff"[9]. Together, these community members work on issues ranging from the [[Juvenile justice|juvenile justice system]] to [[Zoning law|zoning]] law to [[Food security#Access|food access]]. CUP takes these issues and simplifies them to accessible, visual interpretations.&lt;ref name="welcometocup.org"/&gt; The tools created by CUP are used by New York City organizers and educators to push for better communities.

A '''pawtograph''' is a print of an animal's paw, regarded in some contexts as equivalent to a human [[signature]]. This term is used in particular for the practice of collecting pawtographs of [[celebrity]] animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23Pwrh-GEOMC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=pawtograph |title=Hounds of the road: a history of the Greyhound Bus Company |first=Carlton |last=Jackson |page=94 |publisher=Popular Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-87972-271-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Daniel |last=Goldberg |publisher=Hartford Courant |title=Jumping dogs stop NYers in their tracks |url=http://www.courant.com/features/style/am-dog0919,0,4381668.story |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=29 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hobby of collecting pawtographs is known as pawtography.

A pawtograph is made by one of two methods:
# directly stamping a paw on a stamp pad, then stamping the item to be autographed.
# creating a [[rubber stamp]] from the paw impression and stamping the item using the stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2003-11-26/news/a-pug-at-the-heartstrings&amp;page=34 |publisher=San Francisco Weekly |first=Silke |last=Tudor |date=26 November 2003 |title=A Pug at the Heartstrings |accessdate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Portraits of Periodical Offering''''' ({{zh|s=职贡图|t=職貢圖|p=Zhígòngtú}}) was a series of official historical paintings (with illustration on each of the portrait) used in the [[China|Chinese]] dynasties. These paintings were official historical documents. The phrase roughly translated to "duty offering pictorial". Throughout Chinese history, kingdoms and tribes conquered by Chinese forces were required to send ambassadors to the imperial court of China periodically and pay tribute with valuable gifts (贡品 ''gongbin'').

Drawings and paintings with short descriptions were used to record the expression of these ambassadors and to a lesser extent to show the cultural aspects of these ethnic groups. These historical descriptions beside the portrait became the equivalent of documents of diplomatic relations with each country. The drawings were reproduced in [[woodblock printing]] after the 9th century and distributed among the bureaucracy in albums. The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Imperial Qing'' by Xie Sui (谢遂), completed in 1751, gives verbal descriptions of outlying tribes as far as the island of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in [[Western Europe]].

The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang'' by the [[Emperor Yuan of Liang|Emperor Yuan of Liang Xiao Yi]], dated to the 6th century, is the earliest surviving of these specially significant paintings. The original of the work was lost, and the only surviving edition of this work was a copy from the 11th century, which is currently preserved at the [[National Museum of China]]. The work originally consisted of twenty five portraits of ambassadors from their respectively country, by the time of [[Song Dynasty]] some portraits were already missing, and the current version consist only about twelve of them.

The envoys from right to left: [[Uar]] ([[Hephthalites]]); [[Persia]]; [[Baekje]]; [[Qiuci]]; [[Wa (Japan)|Wo]] ([[Japan]]); [[Langkasuka]]; Dengzhi (邓至) ([[Qiang people|Qiang]]) ethnic from [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture|Ngawa]]; Zhouguke (周古柯), Hebatan (呵跋檀), Humidan (胡密丹), Baiti (白題, of similar Hephthalite stocks), who dwell close to Hephthalite; Mo ([[Qiemo]]).

{{Wide image|Zhigongtu full.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang'' with descriptions on the back of each ambassador, 6th-century painting in the [[National Museum of China]].}}

Another notable painting of the series is the ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Tang'' by painter [[Yan Liben]], depicting foreign envoys with tribute bearers for the [[Tang Dynasty]] arriving at [[Chang'an]] in 631, during the reign of the [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. The painting consists of 27 people from various states. The original work was lost, and the only surviving edition was a Song Dynasty copy, which is currently preserved at the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Envoys with Tribute Bearers|url=http://tech2.npm.gov.tw/english/dm/painting/b_01.htm|website=National Palace Museum|access-date=2015-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916193338/http://tech2.npm.gov.tw/english/dm/painting/b_01.htm|archive-date=2015-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power engineering''', also called '''power systems engineering''', is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of [[electric power]], and the electrical apparatus  connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of [[three-phase electric power|three-phase AC power]] – the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world – a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between [[rectifier|AC and DC power]] and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its theoretical base from [[electrical engineering]].

==Pioneering years==
[[Electricity]] became a subject of scientific interest in the late 17th century.  Over the next two centuries a number of important discoveries were made including the [[incandescent light bulb]] and the [[voltaic pile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The History Of The Light Bulb | publisher = Net Guides Publishing, Inc. | year = 2004 | url = http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-the-light-bulb.html | accessdate = 2007-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Thomas | last = Greenslade | title = The Voltaic Pile | publisher = [[Kenyon College]] | url = http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Electricity/Voltaic_Pile/Voltaic_Pile.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the greatest discovery with respect to power engineering came from [[Michael Faraday]] who in 1831 discovered that a change in magnetic flux induces an [[electromotive force]] in a loop of wire&amp;mdash;a principle known as [[electromagnetic induction]] that helps explain how generators and transformers work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Faraday Page | publisher = The Royal Institute | url = http://www.rigb.org/heritage/faradaypage.jsp | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080329153140/http://www.rigb.org/heritage/faradaypage.jsp | archivedate = 2008-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 two electricians built the world's first power station at [[Godalming]] in England. The station employed two waterwheels to produce an alternating current that was used to supply seven Siemens [[arc lamp]]s at 250 volts and thirty-four [[incandescent lamp]]s at 40 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=744 | title=Godalming Power Station | publisher=Engineering Timelines | accessdate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However supply was intermittent and in 1882 [[Thomas Edison]] and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City. The [[Pearl Street Station]] consisted of several generators and initially powered around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jasmin | last=Williams | title = Edison Lights The City | publisher =[[New York Post]] | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/11302007/news/cextra/edison_lights_the_city_514905.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | date=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Casey | last = Grant | title = The Birth of NFPA | publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]] | url = http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us/History&amp;cookie%5Ftest=1 | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228104759/http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us%2FHistory&amp;cookie_test=1 | archivedate = 2007-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The power station used [[direct current]] and operated at a single voltage. Since the direct current power could not be easily transformed to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power loss during transmission, the possible distance between the generators and load was limited to around half-a-mile (800 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Bulk Electricity Grid Beginnings  | publisher=New York Independent System Operator |url=http://www.pearlstreetinc.com/NYISO_bulk_elect_beginnings.pdf | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year in London [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] demonstrated the first transformer suitable for use in a real power system. The practical value of Gaulard and Gibbs' transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at [[Turin]] where the transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a single [[alternating current]] generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html | title=Lucien Gaulard | first=Evgeny | last=Katz | date=2007-04-08 | accessdate=2008-05-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072336/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html |archivedate = 2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the success of the system, the pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting the primaries of the transformers in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] so that switching one lamp on or off would affect other lamps further down the line. Following the demonstration [[George Westinghouse]], an American entrepreneur, imported a number of the transformers along with a [[Siemens]] generator and set his engineers to experimenting with them in the hopes of improving them for use in a commercial power system.

One of Westinghouse's engineers, [[William Stanley, Jr.|William Stanley]], recognised the problem with connecting transformers in series as opposed to [[series and parallel circuits|parallel]] and also realised that making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the [[voltage regulation]] of the secondary winding. Using this knowledge he built the world's first practical transformer based alternating current power system at [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html Great Barrington 1886 - Inspiring an industry toward AC power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/stanley.html | title=Alternating Current Electrification, 1886 | publisher=IEEE | first=Thomas | last=Blalock | date=2004-10-02 | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 349611 | y = 1886 | m = 09 | d = 21 | inventor = William Stanley Jr. | title = Induction Coil}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In 1885 the  Italian physicist and electrical engineer [[Galileo Ferraris]] demonstrated an [[induction motor]] and in 1887 and 1888 the Serbian-American engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] filed a range of patents related to power systems including one for a practical two-phase induction motor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j5bJ5OkGpgC&amp;pg=PA36 |title=Fritz E. Froehlich, Allen Kent, The Froehlich/Kent Encyclopedia of Telecommunications: Volume 17, page 36 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petar Miljanic, Tesla's Polyphase System and Induction Motor, Serbian Journal of Electrical Engineering, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–130, Vol. 3, No. 2, November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which Westinghouse licensed for his AC system.

By 1890 the power industry had flourished and power companies had built thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United States and Europe – these networks were effectively dedicated to providing electric lighting. During this time a fierce rivalry in the US known as the "[[War of Currents]]" emerged between Edison and Westinghouse over which form of transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior. In 1891, Westinghouse installed the first major power system that was designed to drive an electric motor and not just provide electric lighting. The installation powered a {{convert|100|hp}} synchronous motor at [[Telluride, Colorado]] with the motor being started by a Tesla induction motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/niagara.htm | title=The Day They Turned The Falls On | first=Jack | last=Foran | accessdate=2008-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151552/http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/niagara.htm | archivedate=2008-05-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the Atlantic, [[Oskar von Miller]] built a 20 kV 176&amp;nbsp;km three-phase transmission line from [[Lauffen am Neckar]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] for the Electrical Engineering Exhibition in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.more-powerful-solutions.com/media/ScreenPDF_Hypower_15_72dpi.pdf | author=Voith Siemens (company) | title=HyPower | pages=7 | date=2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, after a protracted decision-making process, the [[Adams Power Plant|Adams No. 1 generating station]] at [[Niagara Falls]] began transmitting three-phase alternating current power to Buffalo at 11 kV. Following completion of the Niagara Falls project, new power systems increasingly chose [[alternating current]] as opposed to [[direct current]] for electrical transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/adams.html | title=Adams Hydroelectric Generating Plant, 1895 | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generation of electricity was regarded as particularly important following the [[October revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power]]. [[Lenin]] stated "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vladimir|first=Lenin|title=Our Foreign and Domestic Position and Party Tasks|year=1920|location=Moscow|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/nov/21.htm|quote=Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country, since industry cannot be developed without electrification.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently featured on many Soviet posters, stamps etc. presenting this view. The [[GOELRO plan]] was initiated in 1920 as the first Bolshevik experiment in industrial planning and in which Lenin became personally involved. [[Gleb Krzhizhanovsky]] was another key figure involved, having been involved in the construction of a power station in [[Moscow]] in 1910. He had also known Lenin since 1897 when they were both in the St. Petersburg chapter of the ''Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class''.

===Power engineering in the USA===
In 1936 the first commercial [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line using [[mercury-arc valve]]s was built between [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] and [[Mechanicville, New York]]. HVDC had previously been achieved by installing direct current generators in series (a system known as the [[Thury system]]) although this suffered from serious reliability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html | title=A Novel but Short-Lived Power Distribution System | date=2005-05-01 | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=2008-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524013821/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html | archivedate=2011-05-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 [[Siemens]] demonstrated the first solid-state rectifier (solid-state rectifiers are now the standard for HVDC systems) however it was not until the early 1970s that this technology was used in commercial power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Gene Wolf | title=Electricity Through the Ages | url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_electricity_ages/ | work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=2000-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 Westinghouse demonstrated the first [[circuit breaker]] that used [[sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] as the interrupting medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=John Tyner, Rick Bush and Mike Eby | title=A Fifty-Year Retrospective | url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_fiftyyear_retrospective/ | work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=1999-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a far superior [[dielectric]] to air and, in recent times, its use has been extended to produce far more compact switching equipment (known as [[switchgear]]) and [[transformer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.abb.com/product/us/9AAC710047.aspx | publisher=ABB | title=Gas Insulated Switchgear | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.sayedsaad.com/Transformer/SF6_Transformer/sf6_transformer_main.htm | title=SF6 Transformer | first=Sayed | last=Amin | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important developments also came from extending innovations in the [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant [[load flow study|load flow studies]] could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for much better remote control of the power system's switchgear and generators.

==Power==
[[File:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|220px|Transmission lines transmit power across the [[Power grid|grid]].]]

Power Engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electricity distribution|distribution]] and utilization of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s and [[power electronics]].

Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid. These systems are called off-grid power systems and may be used in preference to on-grid systems for a variety of reasons. For example, in remote locations it may be cheaper for a mine to generate its own power rather than pay for connection to the grid and in most mobile applications connection to the grid is simply not practical.

==Fields==

[[Electricity generation]] covers the selection, design and construction of facilities that convert energy from primary forms to electric power.

[[Electric power transmission]] requires the engineering of high voltage transmission lines and substation facilities to interface to generation and distribution systems. [[High voltage direct current]] systems are one of the elements of an electric power grid.

[[Electric power distribution]] engineering covers those elements of a power system from a substation to the end customer.

[[Power system protection]] is the study of the ways an electrical power system can fail, and the methods to detect and mitigate for such failures.

In most projects, a power engineer must coordinate with many other disciplines such as civil and mechanical engineers, environmental experts, and legal and financial personnel. Major power system projects such as a large generating station may require scores of design professionals in addition to the power system engineers. At most levels of professional power system engineering practice, the engineer will require as much in the way of administrative and organizational skills as electrical engineering knowledge.

==Professional societies==
In both the UK and the USA, professional societies had long existed for civil and mechanical engineers.  The [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] was founded in the UK in 1871, and the [[AIEE]] in the United States in 1884. These societies contributed to the exchange of electrical knowledge and the development of electrical engineering education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">The '''rhythm band''' is one of the primary methods of introducing children to playing music.  Children are given [[maracas]], [[tambourine]]s, [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]s, [[claves|rhythm sticks]] and other [[idiophone]]s with which to beat out a simple [[rhythm]] while the teacher plays a song, usually on the [[piano]]. Alternatively, the teacher does not play a melody but also a rhythm instrument, so that only rhythms are played. Children can also make a rhythm band "just for fun" for themselves, without a teacher.

[[File:Rhythmband.ogg|thumb|An ear-deafening loud rhythm band with very loud rhythm instruments and noisemakers]]
If the participants like very loud music, [[noisemaker]]s like the [[pea whistle]], the [[Recorder_(educational_uses)#Unconventional_uses|recorder head joint]], the [[vuvuzela]] or the [[ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]] can be included into the rhythm band, as well as other very loud rhythm instruments like the [[snare drum]].

Rhythm bands are usually found in [[nursery school]]s or [[kindergarten]]s, but of course children also can make a rhythm band at home. Melodic instruments are introduced to the children in the first or second year of regular school. But in principle, a rhythm band can be made in every age, with more difficult rhrythms if the participants are older.

It is not uncommon for adult musical organizations to employ numerous rhythm players,  as in [[Latin American music]], or to distribute rhythm instruments for audience members to accompany a live performance.

[[Image:Scroll.jpg|right|thumb|Scroll of the [[Book of Esther]], [[Seville]], [[Spain]].]]
[[File:Scroll ink materials.JPG|right|thumb|Ingredients used in making ink for Hebrew scrolls today.]]
A '''scroll''' (from the Old French ''escroe'' or ''escroue''), also known as a '''roll''', is a roll of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], or [[paper]] containing writing.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Peter. (2008) "scroll" in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000'' Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H9SWMK4U?url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/ |date=5 June 2013 }} Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A scroll is usually divided up into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges, or may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of [[writing material]]. The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page. It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page. Depending on the language, the letters may be written left to right, right to left, or alternating in direction ([[boustrophedon]]).

Some scrolls are simply rolled up pages; others may have wooden rollers on each end: [[Torah]] scrolls have rather elaborate rollers befitting their ceremonial function.

==History of scroll use==
{{Main|History of scrolls}}
{{double image|right|Giovane con rotolo.JPG|150|MANNapoli 120620 a Fresco young man with rolls from Pompeii Italy.jpg|150|[[Roman portraiture]] [[fresco]]s from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD, depicting two different men wearing [[laurel wreath]]s, one holding the ''[[rotulus]]'', the other a ''[[History of scrolls|volumen]]''}}{{See also|Roman Empire#Literacy, books, and education}}Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean [[ancient Egyptian civilization]]s. Parchment scrolls were used by the [[Israelites]] among others before the [[codex]] or bound [[book]] with parchment pages was invented by the Romans, which became popular around the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-innovations-that-built-ancient-rome|title=10 Innovations That Built Ancient Rome|author=|date=|website=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.

The ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off of scrolls.

==Rolls==
[[File:Parliamentary archives.jpg|thumb|right|Rolls recording UK [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Acts of Parliament]] held in the [[Parliamentary Archives]], [[Palace of Westminster]], London]]
Shorter pieces of [[parchment]] or [[paper]] are called ''rolls'' or ''[[Rotulus|rotuli]]'', although usage of the term by modern historians varies with periods. Historians of the classical period tend to use ''roll'' instead of ''scroll''. Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for [[manuscript]] administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60&amp;nbsp;cm or two feet wide.  Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves.

A special Chinese form of short book, called the "whirlwind book," consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d|title=IDP Education - Bookbinding|author=|date=|website=idp.bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
In [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the term ''scrow'' was used from about the 13th to the 17th centuries for scroll, writing, or documents in list or schedule form. There existed an office of Clerk of the Scrow (''Rotulorum Clericus'') meaning the Clerk of the Rolls or Clerk of the Register.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, 2008, "scrow".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement by the codex==
The Romans invented the ''codex'' form of the book, folding the scroll into pages which made reading and handling the document much easier. Legend has it that Julius Caesar was the first to fold scrolls, concertina-fashion, for dispatches to his forces campaigning in Gaul. Scrolls were awkward to read if a reader wished to consult material at opposite ends of the document. Further, scrolls were written only on one side, while both sides of the codex page were used. 

Eventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or "leaves," and bound together along one edge. The bound pages were protected by stiff covers, usually of wood enclosed with leather. ''Codex'' is Latin for a "block of wood": the Latin ''liber'', the root of "library," and the German ''Buch'', the source of "book," both refer to wood. The codex was not only easier to handle than the scroll, but it also fit conveniently on library shelves. The spine generally held the book's title, facing out, affording easier organization of the collection.

The term ''codex'' technically refers only to manuscript books-those that, at one time, were handwritten. More specifically, a codex is the term used primarily for a bound manuscript from Roman times up through the Middle Ages.

From the fourth century on, the codex became the standard format for books, and scrolls were no longer generally used. After the contents of a parchment scroll were copied in codex format, the scroll was seldom preserved. The majority that did survive were found by archaeologists in burial pits and in the buried trash of forgotten communities.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A.P. (2009) The Library: An Illustrated History. Chicago, IL. Skyhorse Publishing. (p.27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent discovery==
The oldest complete Torah scroll was discovered stored in an academic library in Bolonia, Italy by Professor Mauro Perani in 2013. It had been mislabeled in 1889 as dating from the 17th century, but Perani suspected it was actually older as it was written in an earlier Babylonian script. Two tests conducted by laboratories at Italy’s University of Salento and at the University of Illinois confirmed that the scroll dates from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century. Ancient Torah scrolls are rare because when they are damaged they stop being used for liturgies and are buried. 

The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather. It is 36 meters long and 64 centimeters wide. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy Oldest complete scroll of Torah found in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075932/http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy |date=7 April 2014 }}.

Modern technology may be able to assist in reading ancient scrolls. In January 2015, computer software may be making progress in reading 2,000-year-old Herculaneum scrolls, computer scientists report.

{{Sociology}}
'''Social construction of technology''' (also referred to as '''SCOT''') is a theory within the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]]. Advocates of SCOT—that is, [[Social constructionism|social constructivists]]—argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to [[technological determinism]] and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.

SCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], and its subtopics include [[actor-network theory]]  (a branch of the [[sociology of science and technology]]) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see [[strong program]]). Leading adherents of SCOT include [[Wiebe Bijker]] and [[Trevor Pinch]].

SCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is "the best"—researchers must look at how the criteria of being "the best" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded.  Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.

SCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.

==Legacy of the Strong Programme in the sociology of science==

At the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the [[strong programme]] in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the ''Principle of Symmetry'' as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.

===Symmetry===

The ''Principle of Symmetry'' holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same ''kind'' of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology.  All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, EM García, et al. "Introdução aos estudos CTS (Ciência, Tecnologia e Sociedade)." Cadernos de Ibero America (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their "objective truth", or inherent "technical superiority", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its "advanced technology" compared to the "primitiveness" of the [[Penny farthing|Penny Farthing]], but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing – in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven [[History of the bicycle|Safety Bicycle]]. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.

A weak reading of the ''Principle of Symmetry'' points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.

A strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.

== Core concepts ==

The following concepts and 'stages' of SCOT are adapted from the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR).&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, Trevor J. and Wiebe E. Bijker.  "The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other."  ''Social Studies of Science'' 14 (August 1984): 399-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretative flexibility===
''Interpretative flexibility'' means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly [[aesthetics]] to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker2.pdf | title=The Social Constructions of Technological Systems | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | editor1=Wiebe E. Bijker | editor2= Thomas P. Hughes |editor3=Trevor Pinch |year=1987|isbn=0-262-02262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alternative interpretations generate different ''problems'' to be solved. How should aesthetics, convenience, and speed be prioritized? What is the "best" tradeoff between traction and speed?

====Relevant social groups====
The most basic relevant groups are the ''users'' and the ''producers'' of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated – users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. [[Trevor Pinch]] has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinch|first=Trevor|title=How Users Matter: The Co-Construction of Users and Technology|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-15107-3|pages=247–269|authorlink=Trevor Pinch|editor=Nelly Oudshoorn and Trevor Pinch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.

====Design flexibility====
Just as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.

====Problems and conflicts====
The different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the "Anti-cyclists" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.

The first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.

===Closure&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Closure]] --&gt;===
Over time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:

#'''Rhetorical closure''': When social groups ''see'' the problem as being solved, the need for alternative designs diminishes. This is often the result of advertising.
#'''Redefinition of the problem''': A design standing in the focus of conflicts can be stabilized by using it to solve a different, new problem, which ends up being solved by this very design. As an example, the aesthetic and technical problems of the air tire diminished, as the technology advanced to the stage where air tire bikes started to win the bike races. Tires were still considered cumbersome and ugly, but they provided a solution to the "speed problem", and this overrode previous concerns.

Closure is not permanent.  New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the "green" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)

The second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.

===Relating the content of the technological artifact to the wider sociopolitical milieu===
This is the third stage of the SCOT methodology, but the seminal article of Pinch and Bijker does not proceed to this stage. Many other historians and sociologists of technology nevertheless do. For example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book "The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America | publisher=The MIT Press | author=Paul N. Edwards | year=1997 | isbn=978-0262550284 | series=Inside Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.

==Criticism==
In 1993, [[Langdon Winner]] published an influential critique of SCOT entitled "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|title=Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=Summer 1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=362–378|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:
# It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the consequences of the technologies after the fact. This results in a sociology that says nothing about how such technologies matter in the broader context.
# It examines social groups and interests that contribute to the construction of technology, but ignores those who have no voice in the process, yet are affected by it. Likewise, when documenting technological contingencies and choices, it fails to account for those options that never made it to the table. According to Winner, this results in conservative and elitist sociology.
# It is superficial in that it focuses on how the immediate needs, interests, problems and solutions of chosen social groups influence technological choice, but disregards any possible deeper cultural, intellectual or economic origins of social choices concerning technology.
# It actively avoids taking any kind of moral stance or passing judgment on the relative merits of the alternative interpretations of a technology. This indifference makes it unhelpful in addressing important debates about the place of technology in human affairs.
Other critics include [[Stewart Russell]] with his letter in the journal "[[Social Studies of Science]]" titled "The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker".

The  '''Society of Graphic Designers of Canada''' (GDC®) is Canadaʼs national certification body for graphic and communication design and since 1956 has established standards for design professionals, educators, and leaders. Through our certification program, GDC licenses the unique CGD™ certification mark to members whose services meet rigorous, standardized criteria. The CGD™ certification mark is recognized across Canada as the mark of professional services and ethical business conduct.

GDC is a member-based organization of design professionals, educators, administrators, students, and affiliates in communications, marketing, media and design-related fields. Our members come together via nine chapters across Canada to advocate for the advancement of the design profession.

GDC was Canada’s first distinct group to professionalize graphic design as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modern-canada.blogspot.ca/2011/12/graphic-art-and-design-robert-stacey.html |title=Graphic Art and Design / Robert Stacey |type=Weblog post |author=Duncan |website=Modern Canada |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1956 a visionary group of designers [Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld, and Leslie (Sam) Smart] met in Toronto to form the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC).

Due to the rapid evolution of the profession, in 1968 the organization changed its name to the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC). Thanks to the efforts of a number of dedicated designers and design educators, negotiations between members of the original society, the federal government, and designers from every region of the country culminated in the granting of a Federal Charter in 1976, unifying the country under one national association.

In 1996 GDC’s five Ontario Chapters amalgamated to form the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario and received provincial legislation granting them authority to use the title of Registered Graphic Designer and the R.G.D. designation within the province of Ontario.

GDC celebrated its 50th Anniversary in 2006 with a commemorative stamp from Canada Post.&lt;ref&gt;https://gdc.design/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadianpostagestamps.ca/stamps/17670/50-years-of-canadian-graphic-design&lt;/ref&gt;

Today GDC has chapters throughout Canada and proudly boasts representation in every province and territory as well as many international members.

=== Friends and Affiliates of GDC ===
GDC is well-respected internationally. Our organization is a member of the International Council of Design (ico-D), the worldwide non-governmental body representing graphic and communication designers. This allows our members to attain international recognition, professional development, and a global perspective on graphic design. GDC is one of the ten largest association members in ico-D and has been a member since 1974.

GDC is also allied with the Societe des Designers Graphiques du Quebec (SDGQ), representing graphic designers in Quebec, the University and College Designers Association (UCDA), the Canadian Association of Professional Image Creators (CAPIC)and the Australian Graphic Design Association (AGDA).

In September 2010 the GDC adopted membership changes to replace the MGDC and LGDC certifications&lt;ref name="Roodenburg2010"&gt;{{cite mailing list |title=GDC Adopts New Designation for its Professional Members: CGD |url=http://lists.gdc.net/pipermail/gdc/2010-September/011674.html |mailing-list=gdc |date=September 17, 2010 |first=Rod |last=Roodenburg |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |title=GDC Certification |url=http://gdc.net/join/index/articles99.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705084611/http://gdc.net/join/index/articles99.php |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new CGD™ certification&lt;ref name="gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/article/2010/09/17/gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd |title=GDC Adopts New Mark: CGD |date=September 17, 2010 |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/article/2010/10/19/gdc-adopts-membership-changes-in-historic-meeting |title=GDC Adopts Membership Changes in Historic Meeting |date=October 19, 2010 |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to reduce confusion over the meaning of the MGDC designation.&lt;ref name="Roodenburg2010" /&gt;

==Activities==
The GDC has been an advocate and resource for Canada's graphic and communication design profession since 1956. The GDC maintains a national certified body of graphic and communication designers and promotes high standards of graphic design and ethical business practices for the benefit of Canadian industry, commerce, public service and education.

Through the media, publications, seminars, events, conferences and exhibits, the GDC builds awareness of graphic and communication design and its essential role in business and society.

Since 1960, the GDC has been recognizing as Fellows those designers who make major contributions to Canadian graphic design. Designers who have received the honour include [[Allan Fleming]] (1960), [[Burton Kramer]] (1975), [[Chris Yaneff]] (1983), [[Paul Arthur]] (1996), [[Jim Rimmer]] (2007), and [[Mark Busse]] (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/inspiration/fellows |title=GDC Fellows |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8239">The imitation of [[natural sounds]] in various cultures is a diverse phenomenon and can fill in various functions. In several instances, it is related to the belief system ([[yoik]]s of the [[Sami people|Sami]],&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spell&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ykt&gt;[http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm Somby 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080325110925/http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt; some other shamanic songs and rituals,&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt; [[overtone singing]] of some cultures). It may serve also such practical goals as luring in the hunt;&lt;ref name=natt/&gt; or entertainment ([[katajjaq]]s of [[Inuit]]).&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;&lt;ref name=desch/&gt;

Among some peoples of the [[Altai-Sayan region]], including [[Tofalar|Tofa]], the ability to mimic sounds of the environment includes hunting calls, and is present also in a traditional singing tradition preserved only by some old people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Song ond sound mimesis|publisher=Foundation for Endangered Languages |url=http://www.ogmios.org/164.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields ==
=== Shamanism ===
{{Main|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}
[[Shamanism]] in various cultures shows great diversity.&lt;ref name=div&gt;Hoppál 2005: 15&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, the music or songs related to shamanistic practice may mimic natural sounds, sometimes with [[onomatopoiea]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf  Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment ===

The intention to mimic natural sounds is not necessarily linked to shamanistic beliefs or practice alone. [[Katajjaq]] (a "genre" of [[Inuit music|music of some Inuit groups]]) is a game played by women, for entertainment. In some instances, [[natural sounds]] (mostly those of animals, e.g. geese) are imitated.&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luring animals ===

The kind of [[katajjaq]] mentioned above, which mimics the cry of geese, shows some similarities with the practice of the hunters to lure game.&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;

Some Eskimo peoples used a tool (shaped like a claw) to scratch the ice of the frozen sea in order to attract seals.&lt;ref&gt;Burch &amp; Forman 1988: 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birket-Smith 1969: 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==SSP Program==
SSP programs focus on animals that are in danger of [[extinction]] in the wild, when zoo conservationists believe captive breeding programs may be their only chance to survive.&lt;ref name=CFZ&gt;[http://www.centralfloridazoo.org/speciessurvivalplan "Species Survival Plans help preserve wildlife"] on the Central Florida Zoo website.&lt;/ref&gt;  These programs also help maintain healthy and [[genetic diversity|genetically diverse]] animal populations within the [[zoo]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/vets/ssp.html "Species Survival Plan"] on PBS NOVA Online.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] accredited zoos and [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] conservation partners that are involved in SSP programs engage in cooperative population management and conservation efforts that include research, public education, [[reintroduction]], and ''in situ'' or field conservation projects.&lt;ref name=AZA/&gt; There are currently 172 species covered by 116 SSP programs in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aza.org/zoo-aquarium-statistics/ AZA Conservation Program Statistics] on the AZA website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==SSP Master Plan==
An SSP Master Plan is a document produced by the SSP coordinator (generally a zoo professional under the guidance of an elected management committee)&lt;ref name=AZA/&gt; for a certain species.  This document sets breeding goals and other management recommendations to achieve the maximum [[genetic diversity]] and demographic stability for a species, given transfer and space constraints.&lt;ref name=CFZ/&gt;

[[Image:Station biologique de Roscoff.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Station biologique de Roscoff]]The '''Station biologique de Roscoff (SBR)''' is a French [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]] research and teaching center. Founded by [[:fr:Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers|Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers]] (1821&amp;ndash;1901) in 1872, it is at the present time affiliated to the [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]] (UPMC), the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers et de l'Environnement (INSU) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ([[CNRS]]).

== Overview ==
The Station biologique is situated in [[Roscoff]] on the northern coast of [[Brittany]] ([[France]]) about 60&amp;nbsp;km east of Brest. Its location offers access to exceptional variety of biotopes, most of which are accessible at low tide. These biotopes support a large variety of both plant (700) and animal (3000) marine species. Founded in 1872 by Professor Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers (then Zoology Chair at the Sorbonne University ),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVhAvgAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Hybrid+Shore+The+Marine+Station+Movement+and+Scientific+Uses+of+the+Littoral&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibtcmNu5vTAhUh_4MKHQnqCu0Q6AEIIzAA|title=Soundings and Crossings: Doing Science at Sea, 1800-1970|last=Anderson|first=Katharine|last2=Rozwadowski|first2=Helen M.|date=2016-09-01|publisher=Watson Publishing International, LLC|year=|isbn=9780881351446|location=|pages=145–178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SBR constitutes, since March 1985, the Internal School 937 of the Pierre and Marie Curie University (UPMC). In November 1985, the SBR was given the status of Oceanographic Observatory by the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers et de l'Environnement (National Institute for the Cosmological and Environmental Sciences; INSU). The SBR is also, since January 2001, a Research Federation within the Life Sciences Department of the CNRS.

The personnel of the SBR, which includes about 200 permanent staff, consists of scientists, teaching scientists, technicians, postdoctoral fellows, PhD students and administrative staff. These personnel is organized into various research groups within research units that are recognised by the Life Sciences Department of the CNRS (the current research units have the following codes: FR 2424, UMR 7139, UMR 7144, UMR 7150 and UPS 2682). The various research groups work on a wide range of topics, ranging from investigation of the fine structure and function of biological macromolecules to global oceanic studies. Genomic approaches constitute an important part of many of the research programmes, notably via the European Network of Excellence "Marine Genomics" which is coordinated by the SBR. With the accommodation facilities at its hotel and its teaching facilities and equipment, the SBR provides conditions for teaching a range of subjects including [[zoology]], [[phycology]] and coastal [[oceanography]]. Teaching at the SBR includes courses that form part of the UPMC Master's program and the European Socrates. The SBR is part of the genomics network "OUEST-genopole" and runs a genomics platform "sequencing and mass spectrometry applied to biology". The station publishes (since 1960) a bilingual scientific journal, the ''Cahiers de Biologie Marine'' (CBM). The SBR also hosts between 12 and 15 national and international conferences per year, including the Jacques Monod Conferences.

[[File:SIPRI building.jpg|thumb|right|SIPRI's headquarters in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]] outside [[Stockholm]].]]

'''Stockholm International Peace Research Institute''' ('''SIPRI''') is an  [[international]] [[institute]] based in [[Sweden]], dedicated to research into [[Conflict resolution|conflict]], [[armaments]], [[arms control]] and [[disarmament]]. Established in 1966, SIPRI provides data, analysis and recommendations, based on [[open source]]s, to [[policymaker]]s, researchers, media and the interested public. SIPRI is based in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sipri.org/about|title=About SIPRI {{!}} SIPRI|website=www.sipri.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[Lauder Institute]]'s ''2016 Global Go To Think Tanks Report'', SIPRI was ranked 28th among [[think tank]]s worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;James G. McGann, [https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks 2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report], January 2017, [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[Lauder Institute]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1964, [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] [[Tage Erlander]] put forward the idea of establishing a peace research institute to commemorate Sweden's 150 years of unbroken peace.

A Swedish Royal Commission chaired by Ambassador [[Alva Myrdal]] proposed in its 1966 report to establish an institute, later named the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI. The Institute's research should seek to contribute to "the understanding of the preconditions for a stable peace and for peaceful solutions of international conflicts" and the Commission recommended that research be concentrated on armaments, their limitation and reduction, and [[arms control]]. The Commission also recommended that SIPRI work be of "an applied research character directed towards practical-political questions [which] should be carried on in a constant interchange with research of a more theoretical kind".

SIPRI has built its reputation and standing on competence, professional skills, and the collection of hard data and precise facts, rendering accessible impartial information on weapon developments, arms transfers and production, military expenditure, as well as on arms limitations, reductions and disarmament. The task of the Institute is to conduct "scientific research on questions of conflict and cooperation of importance for international peace and security with the aim of contributing to an understanding of the conditions for peaceful solution of international conflicts and for a stable peace".

The Swedish [[Riksdag]] decided that the Institute be established on 1 July 1966 with the legal status of an independent foundation. All SIPRI research is based exclusively on [[open source]]s.

==Organisation==

SIPRI's organisation consists of a Governing Board, Director, Deputy Director, Research Staff Collegium and support staff. An Advisory Committee serves as a consultative body to the Institute. The Governing Board takes decisions on important matters concerning the research agenda, activities, organisation and financial administration of the Institute. Other matters are decided by the Director. The Research Staff Collegium advises the Director on research matters. The staff of about 50 persons is international. The researchers are recruited for a specific project period and represent various academic disciplines. Located in Sweden, the Institute offers a unique platform for researchers from different countries to work in close cooperation. The Institute also hosts guest researchers who work on issues related to the SIPRI research programme. Although SIPRI is not a teaching institute, it receives interns whose programmes of study can contribute to and benefit from SIPRI's research. Contacts are maintained with other research centres and individual researchers throughout the world. SIPRI cooperates closely with several intergovernmental organisations, notably the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]], and regularly receives parliamentary, scientific and government delegations as well as visiting researchers. Frequent contacts are maintained with [[diplomatic mission]]s in Stockholm and with Swedish research centres.

Within these fields of study, workshops, conferences, seminars and lectures are organised in order to bring together a broad spectrum of expertise and to exchange views on subjects studied at the Institute. Among these the biggest are the Stockholm Forum on Peace and Security and the Stockholm Security Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sipri.org/events/2017-stockholm-security-conference|title=2017 Stockholm Security Conference {{!}} SIPRI|website=www.sipri.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; SIPRI research projects maintain large databases on military expenditure, arms-producing industries, arms transfers, chemical and biological warfare, national and international export controls, arms control agreements, annual chronologies of major arms control events, military manoeuvres and nuclear explosions.

==Publications and information==

SIPRI's publications and information material are distributed to a wide range of policy makers, researchers, journalists, organisations and the interested public. The results of the research are disseminated through the publication of books and reports by SIPRI and commissioned authors as well as through symposia and seminars. The Institute has forged its profile by concentrating on present-day realities, providing unbiased facts to states and individuals. SIPRI's main publication, the SIPRI Yearbook, was first published on 12 November 1969. The Yearbook serves as a single authoritative and independent source to which politicians, diplomats and journalists can turn for an account of what has happened during the past year in armaments and arms control, armed conflicts and conflict resolution, security arrangements and disarmament. It is translated into a number of other languages, notably [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

'''''The Final Days''''' is a humorous [[short film]] produced by the [[White House]] to screen at the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] annual dinner in April 2000. It stars then-[[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]] as himself. The film was designed by officials of the outgoing [[Clinton administration]] to neutralize media portrayals of Bill Clinton as a [[Lame duck (politics)|"lame duck"]] president by exaggerating that narrative to the point of absurdity.

==Plot==
''The Final Days'' is a comedic look at Clinton's last days in the White House as he approached lame duck status. In it, he is shown "roaming the halls of an empty White House like a lost 222-pound [100 kg] puppy in search of a purpose".&lt;ref name="ozy"/&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
The idea for the film came from Clinton's joke writer Mark Katz who had observed that a dominant media narrative in the late days of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] was that the incumbent president, whose [[Hillary Clinton|wife]] was campaigning for [[U.S. Senate]] while national attention was focused on the presidential contest between [[Al Gore]] and [[George W. Bush]], was "increasingly being depicted as the lonely guy minding the store".&lt;ref name="ozy"/&gt; The film was intended to subvert that narrative by establishing ownership of it.&lt;ref name="ozy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Braswell|first1=Sean|title=Bill Clinton Bows Out in Style|url=http://www.ozy.com/flashback/bill-clinton-bows-out-in-style/31335|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=[[OZY Media]]|date=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 analysis of rhetorical humor in American political communication, Michael Andrew Phillips-Anderson argued that the film satirized, not Clinton, but rather the media who had suggested the president had advanced to lame duck status. By showing Clinton involved in mundane tasks that would be extraordinary for a U.S. president to undertake, such as answering the White House switchboard and practicing [[origami]], the film served to erode such assertions by highlighting their absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips-Anderson|first1=Michael|title=A Theory of Rhetorical Humor in American Political Discourse|date=2007|publisher=[[University of Maryland]]|pages=96–101|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/7739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
''The Final Days'' was filmed in and around the White House. Ultimately, several sequences shot by director [[Philip Rosenthal]] were  not incorporated into the film, including one showing a [[crossword puzzle]]-playing Clinton phoning [[Vladimir Putin]] on the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]] (also known as the "red phone") to ask "what's a five-letter word for 'tasty Russian pancake'?"&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;

The film's production was financed by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="clinton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fretts|first1=Bruce|title=Bill Clinton Goes Viral|url=http://ew.com/article/2000/05/12/bill-clinton-goes-viral/|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Final Days'' starred [[Bill Clinton]] as himself, with cameo appearances by a number of journalists and [[U.S. government]] officials, including: [[Helen Thomas]], [[Madeleine Albright]], [[Sam Donaldson]], and Al Gore. [[Kevin Spacey]] also makes a brief appearance, as himself, retrieving the [[Academy Award]] he won at that year's Oscars for Best Actor (in the film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'') from Clinton. Commercial actor [[Mike Maronna]] plays the character "Stuart", a fictional White House staff member.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton's 'Oscar' win slammed by Academy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/16/news.clinton|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Final Days'' was well received by those attending the dinner. It was downloaded more than 200,000 times in the week following its debut, described by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' as having gone "[[viral video|viral]]".&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Russell|title=Strange Bedfellows: How Late-Night Comedy Turns Democracy into a Joke|date=2008|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813544769|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SG87pjG9E44C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Streaming video]] services had not been widely adopted by 2000, meaning most viewers had to download the film in its entirety in order to watch it.}}

Some criticized the film, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42985">'''Turing's proof''' is a proof by [[Alan Turing]], first published in January 1937 with the title '''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; It  was the second proof of the assertion ([[Alonzo Church]]'s proof was first) that some [[decision problem]]s are "[[undecidable problem|undecidable]]": there is no single algorithm that infallibly gives a correct "yes" or "no" answer to each instance of the problem. In his own words:
"...what I shall prove is quite different from the well-known results of Gödel ... I shall now show that there is no general method which tells whether a given formula '''U''' is provable in '''K''' [''[[Principia Mathematica]]'']..." (''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;145).

Turing preceded this proof with two others. The second and third both rely on the first. All rely on his development of type-writer-like "computing machines" that obey a simple set of rules and his subsequent development of a "universal computing machine".

==Richard's paradox==
In 1905, Jules Richard presented this profound paradox. Alan Turing's first proof constructs this paradox with his so-called computing machine and proves that this machine cannot answer a simple question: will this machine be able to determine if ''any'' computing machine (including itself) will become trapped in an unproductive "infinite loop" (i.e. it fails to continue its computation of the diagonal number).

A succinct definition of [[Richard's paradox]] is found in Whitehead and Russell's ''Principia Mathematica'':

:Richard's paradox is as follows. Consider all decimals that can be defined by means of a finite number of words; let E be the class of such decimals. Then E has [aleph-sub-zero — an infinity of] terms; hence its members can be ordered as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... Let N be a number defined as follows [Whitehead &amp; Russell now employ the [[Cantor diagonal method]]]; if the nth figure in the nth decimal is p, let the nth figure in N be p+1 (or 0, if p = 9). Then N is different from all the members of E, since, whatever finite value n may have, the nth figure in N is different from the nth figure in the nth of the decimals composing E, and therefore N is different from the nth decimal. Nevertheless, we have defined N in a finite number of words [i.e. this very word-definition just above!] and therefore N ought to be a member of E. Thus N both is and is not a member of E (''Principia Mathematica'', 2nd edition 1927, p. 61).

==Complications==
Turing's proof is complicated by a large number of definitions, and confounded with what [[Martin Davis]] called "petty technical details" and "...technical details [that] are incorrect as given" (Davis's commentary in ''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;115). Turing himself published "A correction" in 1937: "The author is indebted to [[P. Bernays]] for pointing out these errors" (''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;152).

Specifically, in its original form the third proof is badly marred by technical errors. And even after Bernays' suggestions and Turing's corrections, errors remained in the description of the [[universal machine]]. And confusingly, since Turing was unable to correct his original paper, some text within the body harks to Turing's flawed first effort.

Bernays' corrections may be found in ''Undecidable'', pp.&amp;nbsp;152–154; the original is to be found as:
:"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem. A Correction," ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'' (2), 43 (1936–37), 544-546.''

The on-line version of Turing's paper has these corrections in an addendum; however, corrections to the Universal Machine must be found in an analysis provided by [[Emil Post]].

At first, the only mathematician to pay close attention to the details of the proof was Post (cf. Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;125) — mainly because he had arrived simultaneously at a similar reduction of "algorithm" to primitive machine-like actions, so he took a personal interest in the proof. Strangely (perhaps World War II intervened) it took Post some ten years to dissect it in the ''Appendix'' to his paper ''Recursive Unsolvability of a Problem of Thue'', 1947 (reprinted in ''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;293).

''Before readers tackle "Proof #3" they are advised to place those corrections on their copy of the proof.''

Other problems present themselves: In his ''Appendix'' Post commented indirectly on the paper's difficulty and directly on its "outline nature" (Post in ''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;299) and "intuitive form" of the proofs (''ibid''.). Post had to infer various points:

:"If our critique is correct, a machine is said to be circle-free if it is a Turing computing ... machine which prints an infinite number of 0s and 1s. And the two theorems of Turing's in question are really the following. There is no Turing ... machine which, when supplied with an arbitrary positive integer n, will determine whether n is the D.N of a Turing computing ... machine that is circle-free. [Secondly], There is no Turing convention-machine which, when supplied with an arbitrary positive integer n, will determine whether n is the D.N of a Turing computing ... machine that ever prints a given symbol (0 say)" (Post in ''Undecidable'', p. 300)

Anyone who has ever tried to read the paper will understand Hodges' complaint:

:"The paper started attractively, but soon plunged (in typical Turing manner) into a thicket of obscure German Gothic type in order to develop his instruction table for the universal machine. The last people to give it a glance would be the applied mathematicians who had to resort to practical computation..." (Hodges p. 124)

==Summary of the proofs==
In his proof that the Entscheidungsproblem can have no solution, Turing proceeded from two proofs that were to lead to his final proof. His first theorem is most relevant to the [[halting problem]], the second is more relevant to [[Rice's theorem]].

'''First proof''': that no "computing machine" exists that can decide whether or not an arbitrary "computing machine" (as represented by an integer 1, 2, 3, . . .) is "circle-free" (i.e. goes on printing its number in binary ad infinitum): "...we have no general process for doing this in a finite number of steps" (p.&amp;nbsp;132, ''ibid''.). Turing's proof, although it seems to use the "diagonal process", in fact shows that his machine (called H) cannot calculate its own number, let alone the entire diagonal number ([[Cantor's diagonal argument]]): "The fallacy in the argument lies in the assumption that B [the diagonal number] is computable" (''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;132). The proof does not require much mathematics.

'''Second proof''': This one is perhaps more familiar to readers as [[Rice's theorem]]: "We can show further that ''there can be no machine E which, when supplied with the S.D ["program"] of an arbitrary machine M, will determine whether M ever prints a given symbol (0 say)''" (his italics, ''Undecidable'', p. 134).

'''Third proof''': "Corresponding to each computing machine M we construct a formula Un(M) and we show that, if there is a general method for determining whether Un(M) is provable, then there is a general method for determining whether M ever prints 0" (''Undecidable'', p. 145)

[Readers who brave Proof #3 should come equipped with a solid background in (i) logic (ii) the paper of [[Kurt Gödel]] ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems'' (reprinted in ''Undecidable'', p. 5). For assistance with Gödel's paper they should consult e.g. [[Ernest Nagel]] and [[James R. Newman]], ''Godel's Proof'', New York University Press, 1958.]

This proof requires the use of formal logic to prove a first lemma, followed by a brief word-proof of the second:
:"Lemma 1: If S1 [symbol "0"] appears on the tape in some complete configuration of M, then Un(M) is provable" (''Undecidable'', p. 147)

:"Lemma 2: [The converse] If Un(M) is provable then S1 [symbol "0"] appears on the tape in some complete configuration of M" (''Undecidable'', p. 148)

Finally, in only 64 words and symbols Turing proves by ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' that "the Hilbert Entscheidungsproblem can have no solution" (''Undecidable'', p. 145).

===Summary of the first proof===
Turing created a thicket of abbreviations; see the glossary at the end of this for help.

Some key clarifications:
:Turing's machine H is attempting to print a diagonal number of 0s and 1s
::This diagonal number is created when H actually "simulates" each "successful" machine under evaluation and prints the R-th "figure" (1 or 0) of the R-th "successful" machine
* Turing spent much of his paper actually "constructing" his machines to convince us of their truth. This was required by his use of the ''reductio ad absurdum'' form of proof.
* We must emphasize the "constructive" nature of this proof. Turing describes what could be a real machine, really buildable. The only questionable element is the existence of machine D, which this proof will eventually show to be impossible.

Turing begins the proof with the assertion of the existence of a “decision/determination” machine D. When fed any S.D (string of symbols A, C, D, L, R, N, semicolon “;”) it will determine if this S.D (symbol string) represents a "computing machine" that is either "circular" — and therefore "un-satisfactory u" —  or "circle-free" — and therefore "satisfactory s".

:Turing has previously demonstrated in his commentary that all "computing machines'' — machines that compute a number as 1s and 0s forever — can be written as an S.D on the tape of the “universal machine” U. Most of his work leading up to his first proof is spent demonstrating that a universal machine truly exists, i.e.
::There truly exists a universal machine U
::For each number N, there truly exists a unique S.D,
::Every Turing machine has an S.D
::Every S.D on U’s tape can be “run” by U and will produce the same “output” (figures 1, 0) as the original machine.

Turing makes no comment about how machine D goes about its work. For sake of argument, we suppose that D would first look to see if the string of symbols is "well-formed" (i.e. in the form of an algorithm and not just a scramble of symbols), and if not then discard it. Then it would go “circle-hunting”. To do this perhaps it would use “heuristics” (tricks: taught or learned). For purposes of the proof, these details are not important.

Turing then describes (rather loosely) the algorithm (method) to be followed by a machine he calls H. Machine H contains within it the decision-machine D (thus D is a “subroutine” of H). Machine H’s algorithm is expressed in H’s table of instructions, or perhaps in H’s Standard Description on tape and united with the universal machine U; Turing does not specify this.

:In the course of describing universal machine U, Turing has demonstrated that a machine’s S.D (string of letters similar to a “program”) can be converted to an integer (base 8) and vice versa. Any number N (in base 8) can be converted to an S.D with the following replacements: 1 by A, 2 by C, 3 by D, 4 by L, 5 by R, 6 by N, 7 by semicolon ";".

::As it turns out, machine H's unique number (D.N) is the number "K". We can infer that K is some hugely long number, maybe tens-of-thousands of digits long. But this is not important to what follows.

Machine H is responsible for converting ''any'' number N into an equivalent S.D symbol string for sub-machine D to test.  (In programming parlance: H passes an arbitrary "S.D” to D, and D returns “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory”.) Machine H is also responsible for keeping a tally R (“Record”?) of successful numbers (we suppose that the number of “successful” S.D's, i.e. R, is much less than the number of S.D's tested, i.e. N). Finally, H prints on a section of its tape a diagonal number “beta-primed” B’. H creates this B’ by “simulating” (in the computer-sense) the “motions” of each “satisfactory” machine/number; eventually this machine/number under test will arrive at its Rth “figure” (1 or 0), and H will print it. H then is responsible for “cleaning up the mess” left by the simulation, incrementing N and proceeding onward with its tests, ''ad infinitum''.

:Note: All these machines that H is hunting for are what Turing called "computing machines". These compute binary-decimal-numbers in an endless stream of what Turing called "figures": only the symbols 1 and 0.

An example: Suppose machine H has tested 13472 numbers and produced 5 satisfactory numbers, i.e. H has converted the numbers 1 through 13472 into S.D’s (symbol strings) and passed them to D for test. As a consequence H has tallied 5 satisfactory numbers and run the first one to its 1st “figure”, the second to its  2nd figure, the third to its 3rd figure, the fourth to its 4th figure, and the fifth to its 5th figure. The count now stands at N = 13472, R = 5, and B’ = “.10011” (for example). H cleans up the mess on its tape, and proceeds:

''H'' increments ''N'' = 13473 and converts "13473" to symbol string ADRLD. If sub-machine D deems ADLRD unsatisfactory, then H leaves the tally-record R at 5. H will increment the number N to 13474 and proceed onward. On the other hand, if D deems  ADRLD satisfactory then H will increment R to 6. H will convert N (again) into ADLRD [this is just an example, ADLRD is probably useless] and “run” it using the universal machine U until this machine-under-test (U "running" ADRLD) prints its 6th “figure” i.e. 1 or 0. H will print this 6th number (e.g. “0”) in the “output” region of its tape (e.g. B’ = “.100110”).

H cleans up the mess, and then increments the number ''N'' to 13474.

The whole process unravels when H arrives at its own number K. We will proceed with our example. Suppose the successful-tally/record R stands at 12. H finally arrives at its own number minus 1, i.e. N = K-1 = 4335...321'''4''', and this number is unsuccessful. Then H increments N to produce K = 4355...321'''5''', i.e. its own number. H converts this to “LDDR...DCAR” and passes it to decision-machine D. Decision-machine D must return “satisfactory” (that is: H must ''by definition'' go on and on testing, ''ad infinitum'', because it is "circle-free"). So H now increments tally R from 12 to 13 and then re-converts the number-under-test K into its S.D and uses U to simulate it. But this means that H will be simulating its own motions. What is the first thing the simulation will do? This simulation K-aka-H either creates a new N or “resets” the “old” N to 1. This "K-aka-H" either creates a new R or “resets” the “old” R to 0. Old-H “runs” new "K-aka-H" until it arrives at its 12th figure.

But it never makes it to the 13th figure; K-aka-H eventually arrives at 4355...321'''5''', again, and ''K-aka-H'' must repeat the test. ''K-aka-H'' will never reach the 13th figure. The H-machine probably just prints copies of itself ''ad infinitum'' across blank tape. But this contradicts the premise that H is a satisfactory, non-circular computing machine that goes on printing the diagonal numbers's 1's and 0's forever. (We will see the same thing if N is reset to 1 and R is reset to 0.)

If the reader does not believe this, they can write a "stub" for decision-machine D (stub "D" will return "satisfactory") and then see for themselves what happens at the instant machine H encounters its own number.

===Summary of the second proof===
Less than one page long, the passage from premises to conclusion is obscure.

Turing proceeds by ''reductio ad absurdum''. He asserts the existence of a machine E, which when given the S.D (Standard Description, i.e. "program") of an arbitrary machine M, will determine whether M ever prints a given symbol (0 say). He does not assert that this M is a "computing machine".

Given the existence of machine E, Turing proceeds as follows:
# If machine E exists then a machine G exists that determines if M prints 0 infinitely often, AND
# If E exists then another process exits [we can call the process/machine G' for reference] that determines if M prints 1 infinitely often, THEREFORE
# When we combine G with G' we have a process that determines if M prints an infinity of figures, AND
# IF the process "G with G'" determines M prints an infinity of figures, THEN "G with G'" has determined that M is circle-free, BUT
# This process "G with G'" that determine if M is circle-free, by proof 1, cannot exist, THEREFORE
# Machine E does not exist.

===Details of second proof===
The difficulty in the proof is step 1. The reader will be helped by realizing that Turing is not explaining his subtle handiwork. (In a nutshell: he is using certain equivalencies between the “existential-“ and “universal-operators” together with their equivalent expressions written with logical operators.)

Here's an example: Suppose we see before us a parking lot full of hundreds of cars. We decide to go around the entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some cars have bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the cars have good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the cars have good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the cars have good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a car having a bad tire.”  Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.

This is what Turing does:
From ''M'' he creates a collection of machines {''M''1, ''M''2, ''M''3, ''M''4, ..., ''Mn''} and about each he writes a sentence: “''X'' prints at least one 0” and allows only two “[[truth value]]s”, True = blank or False = :0:. One by one he determines the truth value of the sentence for each machine and makes a string of blanks or :0:, or some combination of these. We might get something like this: “''M''1 prints a 0” = True AND “''M''2 prints a 0” = True AND “''M''3 prints a 0” = True AND “''M''4 prints a 0” = False, ... AND “''Mn'' prints a 0” = False. He gets the string
:BBB:0::0::0: ... :0: ... ad infinitum
if there are an infinite number of machines ''Mn''. If on the other hand if every machine had produced a "True" then the expression on the tape would be
:BBBBB....BBBB ... ad infinitum

Thus Turing has converted statements about each machine considered separately into a single "statement" (string) about all of them. Given the machine (he calls it G) that created this expression, he can test it with his machine E and determine if it ever produces a 0. In our first example above we see that indeed it does, so we know that not all the M's in our sequence print 0s. But the second example shows that, since the string is blanks then every Mn in our sequence has produced a 0.

All that remains for Turing to do is create a process to create the sequence of Mn's from a single M.

Suppose ''M'' prints this pattern:

:''M'' =&gt; ...AB01AB0010AB…

Turing creates another machine F that takes M and crunches out a sequence of Mn's that successively convert the first n 0's to “0-bar” ('''0'''):
:M1 = ...AB'''0'''1AB0010AB...
:M2 = ...AB'''0'''1AB'''0'''010AB...
:M3 = ...AB'''0'''1AB'''00'''10AB...
:M4 = ...AB'''0'''1AB'''00'''1'''0'''AB...
He claims, without showing details, that this machine F is truly build-able. We can see that one of a couple things could happen. F may run out of machines that have 0's, or it may have to go on ''ad infinitum'' creating machines to “cancel the zeros”.

Turing now combines machines E and F into a composite machine G. G starts with the original M, then uses F to create all the successor-machines M1, M2,. . ., Mn. Then G uses E to test each machine starting with M. If E detects that a machine never prints a zero, G prints :0: for that machine. If E detects that a machine does print a 0 (we assume, Turing doesn’t say) then G prints :: or just skips this entry, leaving the squares blank. We can see that a couple things can happen.
:G will print no 0’s, ever, if all the Mn’s print 0’s, OR,
:G will print ad infinitum 0’s if all the M’s print no 0’s, OR,
:G will print 0’s for a while and then stop.

Now, what happens when we apply E to G itself?
:If E(G) determines that G never prints a 0 then we know that all the Mn’s have printed 0’s. And this means that, because all the Mn came from M, that M itself prints 0’s ''ad infinitum'', OR
:If E(G) determines that G does print a 0 then we know that not all the Mn’s print 0’s; therefore M does not print 0’s ''ad infinitum''.

As we can apply the same process for determining if M prints 1 infinitely often. When we combine these processes, we can determine that M does, or does not, go on printing 1's and 0's ''ad infinitum''. Thus we have a method for determining if M is circle-free. By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.

===Summary of the third proof===
Here Turing proves "that the [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] [[Entscheidungsproblem]] can have no solution" (''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;145). Here he
:“…show(s) that there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula U of the functional calculus K is provable.” (''ibid''.)

* Both Lemmas #1 and #2 are required to form the necessary "IF AND ONLY IF" (i.e. [[logical equivalence]]) required by the proof:

:"A set E is computably decidable if and only if both E and its complement are computably enumerable" (Frankél, p. 67)

;Summary of the proof

Turing demonstrates the existence of a formula '''Un'''(M) which says, in effect, that "in some complete configuration of M, '''0''' appears on the tape" (p.&amp;nbsp;146). This formula is TRUE, that is, it is "constructible", and he shows how to go about this.

Then Turing proves two Lemmas, the first requiring all the hard work. (The second is the converse of the first.) Then he uses ''reductio ad absurdum'' to prove his final result:

# There exists a formula '''Un'''(M). This formula is TRUE, AND
# If the ''Entscheidungsproblem'' can be solved THEN a mechanical process exists for determining whether '''Un'''(M) is ''provable'' (derivable), AND
# By Lemmas 1 and 2: '''Un'''(M) is ''provable'' IF AND ONLY IF '''0''' appears in some "complete configuration" of M, AND
# IF '''0''' appears in some "complete configuration" of M THEN a mechanical process exists that will determine whether arbitrary M ever prints '''0''', AND
# By Proof 2 no mechanical process exists that will determine whether arbitrary M ever prints '''0''', THEREFORE
# '''Un'''(M) is not '''provable''' (it is TRUE, but not ''provable'') which means that the ''Entscheidungsproblem'' is unsolvable.

;Discussion of the third proof

''If readers intend to study the proof in detail they should correct their copies of the pages of the third proof with the corrections that Turing supplied''.

To (even attempt to) follow the technical details, the reader will need to understand the definition of "provable" and be aware of important "clues".

"Provable" means, in the sense of Gödel, that (i) the axiom system itself is powerful enough to produce (express) the sentence "This sentence is provable", and (ii) that in any arbitrary "well-formed" proof the symbols lead by axioms, definitions, and substitution to the symbols of the conclusion.

First clue: "Let us put the description of M into the first standard form of §6". Section 6 describes the very specific "encoding" of machine M on the tape of a "universal machine" U. This requires the reader to know some idiosyncrasies of Turing's universal machine U and the encoding scheme.

(i) The universal machine is a set of "universal" instructions that reside in an "instruction table". Separate from this, on U's tape, a "computing machine" M will reside as "M-code". The universal table of instructions can print on the tape the symbols '''A, C, D, 0, 1, u, v, w, x, y, z, :''' . The various machines M can print these symbols only indirectly by commanding U to print them.

(ii) The "machine code" of M consists of only a few letters and the semicolon, i.e. '''D, C, A, R, L, N, ;''' . Nowhere within the "code" of M will the numerical "figures" (symbols) '''1''' and '''0''' ever appear. If M wants U to print a symbol from the collection '''blank, 0,  1''' then it uses one of the following codes to tell U to print them. To make things more confusing, Turing calls these symbols S0, S1, and S2, i.e.
:'''blank''' = S0 = '''D'''
:'''0''' = S1 = '''DC'''
:'''1''' = S2 = '''DCC'''

(iii) A "computing machine", whether it is built directly into a table (as his first examples show), or as machine-code M on universal-machine U's tape, prints its number on blank tape (to the right of M-code, if there is one) as '''1'''s and '''0'''s forever proceeding to the right.

(iv) If a "computing machine" is U+"M-code", then "M-code" appears first on the tape; the tape has a left end and the "M-code" starts there and proceeds to the right on alternate squares. When the M-code comes to an end (and it must, because of the assumption that these M-codes are finite algorithms), the "figures" will begin as '''1'''s and '''0'''s on alternate squares, proceeding to the right forever. Turing uses the (blank) alternate squares (called "E"- "eraseable"- squares) to help U+"M-code" keep track of where the calculations are, both in the M-code and in the "figures" that the machine is printing.

(v) A "complete configuration" is a printing of all symbols on the tape, including M-code [?] and "figures" up to that point, together with the figure currently being scanned (with a pointer-character printed to the left of the scanned symbol ?). If we have interpreted Turing's meaning correctly, this will be a hugely long set of symbols. But whether the entire M-code must be repeated is unclear; only a printing of the current M-code instruction is necessary plus the printing of all figures with a figure-marker).

(vi) Turing reduced the vast possible number of instructions in "M-code" (again: the code of M to appear on the tape) to a small canonical set, one of three similar to this: {qi Sj Sk R ql} e.g. ''If machine is executing instruction #qi and symbol Sj is on the square being scanned, then Print symbol Sk and go Right and then go to instruction ql'': The other instructions are similar, encoding for "Left" L and "No motion" N. It is this set that is encoded by the string of symbols qi = DA...A, Sj = DC...C, Sk = DC...C, R, ql = DA....A. Each instruction is separated from another one by the semicolon. For example, {q5, S1 S0 L q3} means: Instruction #5: If scanned symbol is '''0''' then print '''blank''', go Left, then go to instruction #3. It is encoded as follows
: ; D A A A A A D C D L D A A A

Second clue: Turing is using ideas introduced in Gödel's paper, that is, the "Gödelization" of (at least part of) the formula for '''Un'''(M). This clue appears only as a footnote on page 138 (''Undecidable''): "A sequence of r primes is denoted by [[Exponentiation|^]](r)" (''ibid''.) [Here, r inside parentheses is "raised".] This "sequence of primes" appears in a formula called F^(n).

Third clue: This reinforces the second clue. Turing's original attempt at the proof uses the expression
:(Eu)N(u) &amp; (x)( ... etc. ...) (''Undecidable'', p. 146)
Earlier in the paper Turing had previously used this expression (p.&amp;nbsp;138) and defined N(u) to mean "u is a non-negative integer" (''ibid''.) (i.e. a Gödel number). But, with the Bernays corrections, Turing abandoned this approach (i.e. the use of N(u)) and the only place where "the Gödel number" appears explicitly is where he uses F^(n).

What does this mean for the proof? The first clue means that a simple examination of the M-code on the tape will not reveal if a symbol '''0''' is ever printed by U+"M-code". A testing-machine might look for the appearance of '''DC''' in one of the strings of symbols that represent an instruction. But will this instruction ever be "executed?" Something has to "run the code" to find out. This something can be a machine, or it can be lines in a formal proof, i.e. Lemma #1.

The second and third clues mean that, as its foundation is Gödel's paper,  the proof is difficult.

===Details of the third proof===
* In the example below we will actually construct a simple "theorem"—a little [[Post–Turing machine]] program "run it". We will see just how mechanical a properly designed theorem can be. A proof, we will see, is just that, a "test" of the theorem that we do by inserting a "proof example" into the beginning and see what pops out at the end.
* Both Lemmas #1 and #2 are required to form the necessary "IF AND ONLY IF" (i.e. logical equivalence) required by the proof:

:"A set E is computably decidable if and only if both E and its complement are computably enumerable" (Frankél, p. 67)

* To quote Frankel:
:"A sentence A is said to be decidable in a [[formal system]] S if either A or its negation is provable in S" (Frankél, p. 65)

Frankel has defined "provable" earlier in his book:
:"A formal system is a system of ''axioms'' (expressed in some formally defined language) and ''rules of reasoning'' (also called inference rules), used to derive the ''theorems'' of the system. A ''theorem'' is any statement in the language of the system obtainable by a series of applications of the rules of reasoning, starting from the axioms. A ''proof'' is a finite sequence of such applications, leading to a theorem as its conclusion" (ibid p. 17).

Thus a "sentence" is a string of symbols, and a theorem is a string of strings of symbols.

Turing is confronted with the following tasks:
* to convert a [[Universal Turing machine]] "program", and the numerical symbols on the tape (Turing's "figures", symbols "1" and "0"), into a "theorem"—that is, a (monstrously long) ''string of sentences'' that define the successive actions of the machine, (all) the figures of the tape, and the location of the "tape head".

Thus the "string of sentences" will be strings of strings of symbols. The only allowed individual symbols will come from Godel's symbols defined in his paper.(In the following example we use the "&lt;" and "&gt;" around a "figure" to indicate that the "figure" is the symbol being scanned by the machine).

===An example of what "complete configuration" means===
In the following, we have to remind ourselves that every one of Turing's “computing machines” is a binary-number generator/creator that begins work on “blank tape”. Properly constructed, it always cranks away ad infinitum, but its instructions are always finite. In Turing's proofs, Turing's tape had a “left end” but extended right ad infinitum. For sake of example below we will assume that the “machine” is not a Universal machine, but rather the simpler “dedicated machine” with the instructions in the Table.

Our example is based on a ''modified'' [[Post–Turing machine]] model of a Turing Machine. This model prints only the symbols 0 and 1. The blank tape is considered to be all b's. Our modified model requires us to add two more instructions to the 7 Post–Turing instructions. The abbreviations that we will use are:
: R, RIGHT: look to the right and move tape to left, or move tape head right
: L, LEFT : look to the left and to move tape right, or move tape head left
: E, ERASE scanned square (e.g. make square blank)
: P0,: PRINT 0 in scanned square
: P1,: PRINT 1 in scanned square
: Jb_n, JUMP-IF-blank-to-instruction_#n,
: J0_n, JUMP-IF-0-to-instruction_#n,
: J1_n, JUMP-IF-1-to-instrucntion_#n,
: HALT.
In the cases of R, L, E, P0, and P1 after doing its task the machine continues on to the next instruction in numerical sequence; ditto for the jumps if their tests fail.

But, for brevity, our examples will only use three squares. And these will always start as there blanks with the scanned square on the left: i.e. bbb. With two symbols 1, 0 and blank we can have 27 distinct configurations:

: bbb, bb0, bb1, b0b, b00, b01, b1b, b10, b11, 0bb, 0b0, 0b1, 00b, 000, 001, 01b, 010, 011, 1bb, 1b0, 1b1, 10b, 100, 101, 11b, 110, 111

We must be careful here, because it is quite possible that an algorithm will (temporarily) leave blanks in between figures, then come back and fill something in. More likely, an algorithm may do this intentionally. In fact, Turing's machine does this—it prints on alternate squares, leaving blanks between figures so it can print locator symbols.

Turing always left alternate squares blank so his machine could place a symbol to the left of a figure (or a letter if the machine is the universal machine and the scanned square is actually in the “program”). In our little example we will forego this and just put symbols ( ) around the scanned symbol, as follows:

: b(b)0 this means, “Tape is blanks-to-the-left of left blank but left blank is “in play”, the scanned-square-is-blank, “0”, blanks-to-right”
: 1(0)1 this means, “Tape is blanks-to-the-left, then 1, scanned square is “0”

Let us write a simple program:
: start: P1, R, P1, R, P1, H

Remember that we always start with blank tape. The complete configuration prints the symbols on the tape followed by the next instruction:
: start config: (b) P1,
: config #1: (1) R,
: config #2: 1(b) P1,
: config #3: 1(1) R,
: config #4: 11(b) P1,
: config #5: 11(1) H

Let us add “jump” into the formula. When we do this we discover why the complete configuration must include the tape symbols. (Actually, we see this better, below.) This little program prints three “1”s to the right, reverses direction and moves left printing 0’s until it hits a blank. We will print all the symbols that our machine uses:
: start: P1, R, P1, R, P1, P0, L, J1_7, H
: (b)bb P1,
: (1)bb R,
: 1(b)b P1,
: 1(1)b R,
: 11(b) P1,
: 11(1) P0,
: 11(0) L,
: 1(1)0 J1_7
: 1(1)0 L
: (1)10 J0_7
: (1)10 L
: (b)110 J0_7
: (b)110 H
Here at the end we find that a blank on the left has “come into play” so we leave it as part of the total configuration.

Given that we have done our job correctly, we add the starting conditions and see “where the theorem goes”. The resulting configuration—the number 110—is the PROOF.

* Turing's first task had to write a generalized expression using logic symbols to express exactly what his Un(M) would do.
* Turing's second task is to "Godelize" this hugely long string-of-string-of-symbols using Godel's technique of assigning primes to the symbols and raising the primes to prime-powers, per Godel's method.

==Glossary of terms used by Turing==
1 '''computable number''' — a number whose decimal is computable by a machine, i.e. by finite means (e.g. an algorithm)

2 '''M''' — a machine with a finite instruction table and a scanning/printing head. M moves an infinite tape divided into squares each “capable of bearing a symbol”. The machine-instructions are only the following: move one square left, move one square right, on the scanned square print symbol p, erase the scanned square, if the symbol is p then do instruction aaa, if the scanned symbol is not p then do instruction aaa, if the scanned symbol is none then do instruction aaa, if the scanned symbol is any do instruction aaa [where “aaa” is an instruction-identifier].

3 '''computing machine''' — an M that prints two kinds of symbols, symbols of the first type are called “figures” and are only binary symbols 1 and 0; symbols of the second type are any other symbols.

4 '''figures''' — symbols '''1''' and '''0''', a.k.a. “symbols of the first kind”

5 '''m-configuration''' — the instruction-identifier, either a symbol in the instruction table, or a string of symbols representing the instruction- number on the tape of the universal machine (e.g. "DAAAAA = #5")

6 '''symbols of the second kind''' — any symbols other than '''1''' and '''0'''

7 '''circular''' — an unsuccessful computating machine. It fails to print, ad infinitum, the figures '''0''' or '''1''' that represent in binary the number it computes

14 '''satisfactory''' — a S.D or D.N that represents a circle-free machine

15 '''U''' — a machine equipped with a “universal” table of instructions. If U is “supplied with a tape on the beginning of which is written the S.D of some computing machine M, U will compute the same sequence as M.”

16 '''β’'''—“beta-primed”: A so-called “diagonal number” made up of the n-th figure (i.e. 0 or 1) of the n-th computable sequence [also: the computable number of H, see below]

17 '''u''' — an unsatisfactory, i.e. circular, S.D

18 '''s''' — satisfactory, i.e. circle-free S.D

19 '''D''' — a machine contained in H (see below). When supplied with the S.D of any computing machine M, D will test M's S.D and if circular mark it with “u” and if circle-free mark it with “s”

20 '''H''' — a computing machine. H computes B’, maintains R and N. H contains D and U and an unspecified machine (or process) that maintains N and R and provides D with the equivalent S.D of N. E also computes the figures of B’ and assembles the figures of B’.

21 '''R''' — a record, or tally, of the quantity of successful (circle-free) S.D tested by D

22 '''N''' — a number, starting with 1, to be converted into an S.D by machine E. E maintains N.

23 '''K''' — a number. The D.N of H.

;Required for Proof #3

5 '''m-configuration''' — the instruction-identifier, either a symbol in the instruction table, or a string of symbols representing the instruction's number on the tape of the universal machine (e.g. "DAAAAA = instruction #5"). In Turing's S.D the m-configuration appears twice in each instruction, the left-most string is the "current instruction"; the right-most string is the next instruction.

24 '''complete configuration''' — the number (figure '''1''' or '''0''') of the scanned square, the complete sequence of all symbols on the tape, and the m-configuration (the instruction-identifier, either a symbol or a string of symbols representing a number, e.g. "instruction DAAAA = #5")

25 '''RSi(x, y)''' — "in the complete configuration x of M the symbol on square y is Si. "complete configuration" is definition #5,

26 '''I(x, y)''' — "in the complete configuration x of M the square y is scanned"

27 '''Kqm(x)''' — "in the complete configuration x of M the machine-configuration (instruction number) is qm"

28 '''F(x,y)''' — "y is the ''immediate'' successor of x" (follows Gödel's use of "f" as the successor-function).

29 '''G(x,y)''' — "x precedes y", not necessarily immediately

30 '''Inst{qi, Sj Sk L ql}''' is an abbreviation, as are Inst{qi, Sj Sk R ql}, and Inst{qi, Sj Sk N ql}. See below.

Turing reduces his instruction set to three “canonical forms” – one for Left, Right, and No-movement. Si and Sk are symbols on the tape.
: 		tape				Final
: m-config	Symbol	Operations	m-config
:  qi		Si		PSk, L		qm
:  qi		Si		PSk, R		qm
:  qi		Si		PSk, N		qm
For example, the operations in the first line are PSk = PRINT symbol Sk from the collection '''A, C, D, 0, 1, u, v, w, x, y, z, :''', then move tape LEFT.

These he further abbreviated as:
(N1)	qi Sj Sk L qm
(N2)	qi Sj Sk R qm
(N3)	qi Sj Sk N qm

In Proof #3 he calls the first of these “Inst{qi Sj Sk L ql}”, and he shows how to write the entire machine S.D  as the logical conjunction (logical OR): this string is called “Des(M)”, as in “Description-of-M”.
i.e. if the machine prints 0 then 1's and 0's on alternate squares to the right ad infinitum it might have the table (a similar example appears on page 119):
: q1, blank, P0, R, q2
: q2, blank, P-blank, R, q3
: q3, blank, P1, R, q4
: q4, blank, P-blank, R, q1
(This has been reduced to canonical form with the “p-blank” instructions so it differs a bit from Turing's example.)
If put them into the “ Inst( ) form” the instructions will be the following (remembering: S0 is blank, S1 = 0, S2 = 1):
: Inst {q1 S0 S1 R q2}
: Inst {q2 S0 S0 R q3}
: Inst {q3 S0 S2 R q4}
: Inst {q4 S0 S0 R q1}
The reduction to the Standard Description (S.D) will be:
: ; D A D D C R D A A ; D A A D D R D A A A ; D A A A D D C C R D A A A A ; D A A A A D D R D A ;
This agrees with his example in the book (there will be a blank between each letter and number). Universal machine U uses the alternate blank squares as places to put "pointers".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4224">The '''user illusion''' is the illusion created for the user by a [[human-computer interface|human–computer interface]], for example the [[desktop metaphor|visual metaphor of a desktop]] used in many [[graphical user interfaces]]. The phrase originated at [[Xerox PARC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Tognazzini|authorlink=Bruce Tognazzini|title=Tog on Software Design|isbn=0-201-48917-1|year=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKBQAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Philosophy of mind|philosophers of mind]] have argued that [[consciousness]] is a form of user illusion. This notion is explored by [[Tor Nørretranders]] in his 1991 Danish book ''Mærk verden'', issued in a 1998 English edition as ''The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor Nørretranders|authorlink=Tor Nørretranders|title=The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size|isbn=0-670-87579-1|year=1998|publisher=Viking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwMwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced the idea of [[exformation]] in this book.  Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has also embraced the view that human consciousness is a "user-illusion."&lt;ref&gt;"Human consciousness is unlike all other varieties of animal consciousness in that it is a product in large part of cultural evolution . . . creating thereby a cognitive architecture unlike the ‘bottom-up’ minds of animals. . . . [T]his architecture furnishes each of us with . . . a user-illusion” (Daniel C. Dennett, ''From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds'' (2017), p. 370).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this picture, our experience of the world is not immediate, as all sensation requires processing time. It follows that our conscious experience is less a perfect reflection of what is occurring, and more a simulation produced unconsciously by the brain. Therefore, there may be phenomena that exist beyond our peripheries, beyond what consciousness could create to isolate or reduce them.

== Criticism ==
Critics of the idea of consciousness being a device for justifying preconceptions argue that such a device would consume [[nutrient]]s without producing any useful results, since it would not change the outcome of any decisions. These critics argue that the existence of  [[social insect]]s with extremely small brains [[falsifiability|falsifies]] the notion that social behavior requires consciousness, citing that insects have too small [[brain]]s to be conscious and yet there are observed behaviors among them that for all functional intents and purposes match those of complex social cooperation and manipulation (including hierarchies where each individual has its place among [[paper wasp]]s and [[Jack Jumper]] [[ant]]s and [[honey bee]]s sneaking when they lay eggs). These critics also argue that since social behavior in insects and other extremely small-brained animals have [[convergent evolution|evolved multiple times independently]], there is no evolutionary difficulty in simple reaction sociality to impose selection pressure for the more nutrient-consuming path of consciousness for sociality. These critics do point out that other evolutionary paths to consciousness are possible, such as critical evaluation that enhances plasticity by criticizing [[fallibility|fallible]] notions, while pointing out that such a critical consciousness would be quite different from the justificatory type proposed by Nørretranders, differences including that a critical consciousness would make individuals more capable of changing their minds instead of justifying and persuading.&lt;ref&gt;How the body shapes the way we think: A new view of intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information Processing in Social Insects: Claire Detrain, Jean L.

'''Women's Studies Resource Centre''' is a [[feminist]] [[library]] in [[Adelaide, South Australia]] specialising in resources about women for the education sector: primary and secondary school students and teachers, tertiary students and staff at [[Technical and Further Education]] (TAFE) and University, and the general community.

==History==
The centre began as a result of the first national conference on ''Sexism in Education'' in 1973 convened by the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] and subsequent [[Women's Studies]] courses that were established at [[Flinders University|Flinders]] and [[Adelaide University|Adelaide Universities]].

The Education Department held a conference entitled Women in Education, reflecting its concern with the position of women and girls in our society.

Teachers and students involved in the new Women's Studies courses quickly became aware of the shortage of resources for their needs. A group of women from various fields of education began meeting in 1974 with the aim of developing a Women's Studies curriculum for secondary schools and bringing together the resources necessary for such a course.

With a grant from the Australian National Advisory Committee for [[International Women's Year]], the Women's Studies Resource Centre was established in July 1975, celebrating its 30th year in 2005 and continues today.

The centre and its collection has been located at Wattle Park Teachers centre, Adelaide Girls High School in Grote Street, above the Women's Information Switchboard in Kintore Avenue, the Liverpool Building in Flinders Street and is currently located at 64 Pennington Terrace, North Adelaide.

==Collection==
It houses a comprehensive feminist collection of 17,000 items, including the Women's Liberation archives and provides collating room for 'Liberation' the Adelaide Women's Liberation newsletter, who the ''Oxford Australian Feminism: a companion'', has termed "one of the liveliest women's liberation groups in the country".

The collection includes records from a number of Australian women's groups, including the [[Women's Electoral Lobby]], a national lobbying group established in 1972, and issue specific groups such as Women Against Nuclear Energy, Women’s Abortion Action Campaign, and Women’s Action Against Global Violence.[http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE1033b.htm]
