'''Alix Pasquet''' (unknown–1958) was a [[World War II]] [[fighter pilot]], one of only five [[Haitian people|Haitian]] members of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], a soccer star, and a political revolutionary.&lt;ref name=cassagnol&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7L_yreK_I-YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cassagnol+autobiography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HbGyUPjeJqTD2QX5r4D4Dw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pasquet&amp;f=false |title=Mémoires D'un Révolutionnaire |author=Raymond Cassagnol |publisher=Educa Vision Inc. |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/07/30/archives/haitis-president-quells-revolt-leads-counterattack-on-foes-rebel.html |title=Haiti's President Quells Revolt; Leads Counter-Attack on Foes; Rebel Force Reported 'Wiped Out' in Battle in Capital--American Among the Dead HAITI'S PRESIDENT CRUSHES REVOLT |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 30, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1166756/3/index.htm |title=The Hero Who Vanished |newspaper=Sports Illustrated |date=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed while leading a [[Haitian coup attempt, July 1958|coup attempt]] against Haitian President [[François Duvalier]] in 1958. 

==Fighter pilot==
In 1942, Haitian President [[Élie Lescot]] implemented an aviation corps program.&lt;ref name="cassagnol"/&gt; and chose 3 men out of 42 corps members to receive pilot training in [[Tuskegee, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=cassagnol/&gt; Alix Pasquet, a law graduate of École Millitaire d'Haiti and an officer in the Haitian army at the time, was one of these three chosen officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBlkAZkRrvQ Dead or Victorious but not prisoner]. ''Amistad Films''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government needed the Haitians to organize a patrol of the [[Caribbean Sea]] during [[World War II]] and gave the Haitian government six airplanes. These airplanes could carry bombs and could be used to attack [[German submarines]] within that area. In February 1943, Pasquet, along with Raymond Cassagnol and Philippe Célestin, traveled from [[Port-au-Prince]] to [[Alabama]] to begin training at the famed [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Flight School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tuskegee.edu/about_us/legacy_of_fame/tuskegee_airmen/tuskegee_airmen_pilot_listing.aspx |title=Tuskegee Airmen Pilot Listing |publisher=Tuskegee University |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000349/http://www.tuskegee.edu/about_us/legacy_of_fame/tuskegee_airmen/tuskegee_airmen_pilot_listing.aspx |archive-date=2013-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kreyolicious&gt;{{cite news |url=http://kreyolicious.com/haiti-history-101-the-haitian-tuskegee-airmen/1597/ |title=Haiti History 101: The Haitian Tuskegee Airmen |newspaper=Kreyolicious}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tuskegee Airmen]] were renowned for their unmatched record of more than 200 combat missions with few losses.&lt;ref name=seminolechronicle&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seminolechronicle.com/vnews/display.v/ART/4bcf5103517f1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203023239/http://www.seminolechronicle.com/vnews/display.v/ART/4bcf5103517f1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |title=Tuskegee Airman honored in Oviedo |newspaper=Seminole Chronicle |author=Gary Roberts |date=April 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taichicago.org/archives/950 |title=Haitian-Tuskegee Airman Receives Medal|newspaper=Tuskegee Airmen |date=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasquet's training went through three stages—primary, basic, and advanced—and was extremely rigorous. He was trained by Jimmy Plinton, Jr., who was reputed as one of the best trainers in the Tuskegee Air Force program, over the course of a 7-month program.&lt;ref name=cassagnol/&gt;

''[[Baltimore Afro-American|The Afro-American Newspaper]]'', one of the most widely circulated [[African American newspapers|black newspapers]] at that time, ran a feature story on Pasquet, Cassagnol, and Célestin in April 1943, and the trio was noted for their aptitude with the English language.&lt;ref name=kreyolicious/&gt;&lt;ref name=afroamerican&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2211&amp;dat=19430410&amp;id=0egmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FAMGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4045,1190867 |title=3 Haitians Learning to Fly the U.S. Way at TAFS|newspaper=The Afro American |date=April 10, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally since Pasquet and his compatriots were from Haiti, they were unfamiliar with the pervasive [[racial segregation]] and racism in the [[American South]] at that time and were forced ride on Blacks-Only transportation or sit in the back of trains.&lt;ref name=kreyolicious/&gt; As a result, they rarely ventured off-campus.  Pasquet had a bad case of the flu and lost a month of his training, but ultimately graduated in August 1943 as a member of class 43G.&lt;ref name="cassagnol"/&gt;

==Political revolutionary==
After his distinguished service in World War II, Pasquet returned to Haiti. However, he was exiled in 1957 for supporting [[Louis Déjoie]] in the [[History_of_Haiti#Magloire.60s_Presidency_.281950-1956.29|May 1957 Haitian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5ltAAAAMAAJ&amp;q='alix+pasquet%22+exiled&amp;dq='alix+pasquet%22+exiled&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XHS1UO-MNK6UigK-nYHAAg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw |title=

Walker—with the intention of overpowering the capital's army barracks and capturing the ammunition depot within.&lt;ref name=haitiahshatteredhistory&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6p6QrBL79xEC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;dq='alix+pasquet%22+exiled&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XHS1UO-MNK6UigK-nYHAAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ |title=Haiti: A Shattered Nation |author=Elizabeth Abbott |publisher=Peter Mayer Publishers, Inc. |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2012/01/siege-of-casernes-dessalines-story-of.html |title=The Siege of Casernes Dessalines: the Story of Alix Pasquet, Haitian Tuskegee Airman |newspaper=The Haitian Blogger|date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained entry through the barracks' gate by convincing the sentry that he was an officer delivering prisoners, and then quickly seized control of the barracks.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; However the plot was foiled when an accomplice, Henri Perpignan, sent a prisoner to acquire Haitian-blend cigarettes, who then revealed crucial details to the incumbent government about Pasquet's position.&lt;ref name=haitiahshatteredhistory/&gt;

Pasquet was killed during the attempted coup and buried in Port-au-Prince.&lt;ref name=haitiahshatteredhistory/&gt;

'''Echolocation''', also called '''bio sonar''', is the biological [[sonar]] used by several kinds of [[animals]].
Echolocating animals emit calls out to the environment and listen to the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] of those calls that return from various objects near them. They use these echoes to locate and identify the objects. Echolocation is used for [[animal navigation|navigation]] and for [[foraging]] (or hunting) in various environments.

Echolocating animals include some mammals and a few birds; most notably [[microchiroptera]]n [[bat]]s and [[odontocetes]] (toothed whales and dolphins), but also in simpler form in other groups such as [[shrew]]s, one genus of [[megachiroptera]]n bats (''[[Rousettus]]'') and two cave dwelling [[bird]] groups, the so-called cave [[swiftlet]]s in the genus ''[[Aerodramus]]'' (formerly ''Collocalia'') and the unrelated [[Oilbird]] ''Steatornis caripensis''.&lt;ref name=Rousettus&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=R.

== Early research ==

The term ''echolocation'' was coined by the American zoologist [[Donald Griffin]], whose work with [[Robert Galambos]] was the first to convincingly demonstrate its existence in bats in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Carol Kaesuk. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/14/nyregion/donald-r-griffin-88-dies-argued-animals-can-think.html "Donald R. Griffin, 88, Dies; Argued Animals Can Think"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 14, 2003. Accessed July 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=Donald R. |title=Echolocation in blind men, bats and radar |journal=Science |date=29 December 1944 |volume=100 |issue=2609 |pages=589–590|bibcode=1944Sci...100..589G |doi=10.1126/science.100.2609.589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Griffin described in his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffin, D. R. |year=1958 |title=Listening in the dark |publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th century Italian scientist [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] had, by means of a series of elaborate experiments, concluded that when bats fly at night, they rely on some sense besides vision, but he did not discover that the other sense was hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Spallanzani, Lazzaro, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nYucKchNzIwC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Lettere sopra il sospetto di un nuovo senso nei pipistrelli''] (Letters on the suspicion of a new sense in bats), Turin, Italy:  Stamperia Reale, 1794. [in Italian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dijkgraaf, Sven (March 1960) "Spallanzani's unpublished experiments on the sensory basis of object perception in bats," ''Isis'', '''51''' (1) :  9–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss physician and naturalist [[Louis Jurine]] repeated Spallanzani's experiments (using different species of bat), and concluded that when bats hunt at night, they rely on hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Peschier (1798) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015077781493;view=1up;seq=151  "Extraits des expériences de Jurine sur les chauve-souris qu'on a privé de la vue"] (Extracts of Jurine's experiments on bats that have been deprived of sight), ''Journal de physique, de chimie, d'histoire naturelle'' … , '''46''' :  145–148. [in French], translated as (Peschier) (1798) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000025234138;view=1up;seq=150 "Experiments on bats deprived of sight,"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', '''1''' :  136–140.  From p. 140:   "From these experiments the author concludes:  … that the organ of hearing appears to supply that of sight in the discovery of bodies, and to furnish these animals with different sensations to direct their flight, and enable them to avoid those obstacles which may present themselves."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dijkgraaf | first1=S. | year=1949 | title=Spallanzani und die Fledermäuse | trans-title=Spallanzani and the bat | journal=Experientia | volume=5 | issue=2| pages=90–92 | doi=10.1007/bf02153744}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Walter Louis Hahn confirmed Spallanzani's and Jurine's findings.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Walter Louis (1908) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044106183585;view=1up;seq=159 "Some habits and sensory adaptations of cave-inhabiting bats,"] ''Biological Bulletin of the Marine Laboratory of Woods Hole, Massachusetts'', '''15''' : 135–198; especially pp. 165–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the inventor [[Hiram Maxim]] independently proposed that bats used sound below the human auditory range to avoid obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;Maxim, Hiram (1912 September 7) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015012343854;view=1up;seq=152 "The sixth sense of the bat. Sir Hiram Maxim's contention. The possible prevention of sea collisions."] ''Scientific American Supplement'', '''74''' : 148–150.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the English physiologist [[Hamilton Hartridge]] correctly proposed instead that bats used frequencies above the range of human hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Hartridge H. (1920) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000088598481;view=1up;seq=72 "The avoidance of objects by bats in their flight,"] ''Journal of Physiology'', '''54''' : 54–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe (1958), Review of "Listening in the Dark", https://www.jstor.org/stable/1754799&lt;/ref&gt;

Echolocation in [[odontocetes]] (toothed whales) was not properly described until two decades after Griffin and Galambos' work, by Schevill and McBride in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schevill | first1=W.E. | last2=McBride | first2=A.F. | year=1956 | title=Evidence for echolocation by cetaceans | journal=Deep-Sea Research | volume=3 | issue=2| pages=153–154 | doi=10.1016/0146-6313(56)90096-x|bibcode=1956DSR.....3..153S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1953, [[Jacques Yves Cousteau]] suggested in his first book, ''[[The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure|The Silent World]]'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;206–207) that porpoises had something like [[sonar]], judging by their navigational abilities.

== Principle ==

Echolocation is the same as active [[sonar]], using sounds made by the animal itself. Ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment. The relative intensity of sound received at each ear as well as the time delay between arrival at the two ears provide information about the horizontal angle (azimuth) from which the reflected sound waves arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.051 | author=Jones G. | year=2005 | title=Echolocation | journal=Current Biology | volume =15 | issue=13 | pages=484–488 | pmid=16005275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some human-made sonars that rely on many extremely narrow beams and many receivers to localize a target ([[multibeam sonar]]), animal echolocation has only one transmitter and two receivers (the ears) positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to perceive distance and direction. With echolocation, the bat or other animal can see not only where it is going but also how big another animal is, what kind of animal it is, and other features.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}.

At the most basic level, echolocation is based on the neural anatomy of auditory brain circuitry. In essence, ascending brain pathways in the brain stem allow the brain to calculate the difference between the two ears to very small fractions of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Auditory Pathway: Structure and Function |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=437jBwAAQBAJ |publisher=Springer |date=2012-12-06 |isbn=978-1-468-41300-7 |first=Josef |last=Syka |first2=R. Bruce |last2=Masterton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bats==

[[File:PipiBat.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Spectrogram]] of ''[[Pipistrellus]]'' bat vocalizations.  Detail is shown as the pulses transition to a faster repetition rate.  The bat appears to use a hybrid pulse which combines a sharp falling frequency [[chirp]] with an extended constant frequency tail.  Such a [[waveform]] may offer combined benefits of range estimation as well as Doppler shift detection.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}]]

{{Listen|filename=Pipistrellus.ogg|title=Pipistrellus Pulses|description=Recording of ''Pipistrellus'' bat approaching its prey.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

[[Microbat]]s use echolocation to [[Animal navigation|navigate]] and forage, often in total darkness. They generally emerge from their roosts in caves, attics, or trees at dusk and hunt for insects into the night. Their use of echolocation allows them to occupy a niche where there are often many [[insect]]s (that come out at night since there are fewer predators then), less competition for food, and fewer species that may prey on the bats themselves.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Microbats generate [[ultrasound]] via the [[larynx]] and emit the sound through the open mouth or, much more rarely, the nose. The latter is most pronounced in the [[horseshoe bats]] (''Rhinolophus spp.''). Microbat {{Audio|Ultrasonic_bat_calls.ogg|calls}} range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, mostly beyond the range of the human ear (typical human hearing range is considered to be from 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz). Bats may estimate the elevation of targets by interpreting the [[interference pattern]]s caused by the echoes reflecting from the [[tragus (ear)|tragus]], a flap of skin in the external ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Muller| first=R.| year=2004| title=A numerical study of the role of the tragus in the big brown bat| journal=JASA| volume=116| pages=3701–3712| doi=10.1121/1.1815133 | issue=6 |bibcode=2004ASAJ..116.3701M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two hypotheses about the evolution of echolocation in bats. The first suggests that [[Larynx|laryngeal]] echolocation evolved twice in Chiroptera, once in the [[Yangochiroptera]] and once in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Teeling | display-authors=etal | year=2000 | title=Molecular evidence regarding the origin of echolocation and flight in bats |  journal=Nature | volume=403 | issue=| pages=188–192 |bibcode=2000Natur.403..188T |doi=10.1038/35003188 | pmid=10646602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Order Chiroptera (Bats)| publisher=Animal Diversity Web | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Chiroptera.html | accessdate =2007-12-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071221224447/http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Chiroptera.html| archivedate= 21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second proposes that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in Chiroptera, was subsequently lost in the family [[Pteropodidae]] (all megabats), and later evolved as a system of tongue-clicking in the genus ''[[Rousettus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Springer | display-authors=etal   | year=2001 | title=Integrated fossil and molecular data reconstruct bat echolocation |  journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=98 | issue=11| pages=6241–6246 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111551998 | pmid=11353869 | pmc=33452|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.6241S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual bat species echolocate within specific frequency ranges that suit their environment and prey types. This has sometimes been used by researchers to identify bats flying in an area simply by recording their calls with ultrasonic recorders known as "bat detectors". However echolocation calls are not always species specific and some bats overlap in the type of calls they use so recordings of echolocation calls cannot be used to identify all bats. In recent years researchers in several countries have developed "bat call libraries" that contain recordings of local bat species that have been identified known as "reference calls" to assist with identification.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since the 1970s there has been an ongoing controversy among researchers as to whether bats use a form of processing known from [[radar]] termed [[Coherence (signal processing)|coherent]] cross-correlation. Coherence means that the phase of the echolocation signals is used by the bats, while [[cross-correlation]] just implies that the outgoing signal is compared with the returning echoes in a running process. Today most – but not all – researchers believe that they use cross-correlation, but in an incoherent form, termed a filter bank receiver.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

When searching for prey they produce sounds at a low rate (10–20 clicks/second). During the search phase the sound emission is coupled to respiration, which is again coupled to the wingbeat. This coupling appears to dramatically conserve energy as there is little to no additional energetic cost of echolocation to flying bats.&lt;ref&gt;Speakman and Racey 1991&lt;/ref&gt; After detecting a potential prey item, microbats increase the rate of pulses, ending with the '''terminal buzz''', at rates as high as 200  clicks/second. During approach to a detected target, the duration of the sounds is gradually decreased, as is the energy of the sound.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Calls and ecology===

Bats belonging to the suborder [[Microchiroptera]] (microbats) occupy a diverse set of ecological conditions – they can be found living in environments as different as [[Europe]] and [[Madagascar]], and hunting for food sources as different as insects, frogs, nectar, fruit, and blood.  Additionally, the characteristics of an echolocation call are adapted to the particular environment, hunting behavior, and food source of the particular bat.  However, this adaptation of echolocation calls to ecological factors is constrained by the phylogenetic relationship of the bats, leading to a process known as descent with modification, and resulting in the diversity of the Microchiroptera today.&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"&gt;Jones and Teeling 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"&gt;Grinnell 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"&gt;Zupanc 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"&gt;Fenton 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"&gt;Neuweiler 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"&gt;Simmons and Stein 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustic features===

Describing the diversity of bat echolocation calls requires examination of the frequency and temporal features of the calls. It is the variations in these aspects that produce echolocation calls suited for different acoustic environments and hunting behaviors.&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenton 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiryu et al. 2007"&gt;Hiryu et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frequency====

Bat call frequencies range from as low as 11&amp;nbsp;kHz to as high as 212&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Jones, G. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jones | first1=G. | last2=Holderied | first2=M. W. | year=2007 | title=Bat echolocation calls: Adaptation and convergent evolution | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=274 | issue=1612| pages=905–912 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0200 | pmid=17251105 | pmc=1919403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insectivorous aerial-hawking bats have a call frequency between 20&amp;nbsp;kHz and 60&amp;nbsp;kHz because it is the frequency that gives the best range and image acuity and makes them less conspicuous to insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fenton | first1=M.

''Euderma maculatum'', a species that feeds on moths, uses a particularly low frequency of 12.7&amp;nbsp;kHz that cannot be heard by moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fullard | first1=J. | last2=Dawson | first2=J. | year=1997 | title=The echolocation calls of the spotted bat euderma maculatum are relatively inaudible to moths |  journal=J Exp Biol | volume=200 | issue=| pages=129–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frequency modulation and constant frequency====

Echolocation calls can be composed of two different types of frequency structure: [[frequency modulated]] (FM) sweeps, and constant frequency (CF) tones. A particular call can consist of one, the other, or both structures.  An FM sweep is a broadband signal – that is, it contains a downward sweep through a range of frequencies. A CF tone is a narrowband signal:  the sound stays constant at one frequency throughout its duration.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Intensity====

Echolocation calls have been measured at intensities anywhere between 60 and 140 [[decibels]].&lt;ref&gt;Surlykee et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Certain microbat species can modify their call intensity mid-call, lowering the intensity as they approach objects that reflect sound strongly.  This prevents the returning echo from deafening the bat.&lt;ref name="Hiryu et al. 2007"/&gt; High-intensity calls such as those from aerial-hawking bats (133&amp;nbsp;dB) are adaptive to hunting in open skies. Their high intensity calls are necessary to even have moderate detection of surroundings because air has a high absorption of ultrasound and because insects’ size only provide a small target for sound reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Holderied | first1=M. W. | last2=von Helversen | first2=O. | year=2003 | title=Echolocation range and wing beat period match in aerial-hawking bats | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=270 | issue=1530| pages=2293–2299 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2487 | pmid=14613617 | pmc=1691500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the so-called "whispering bats" have adapted low-amplitude echolocation so that their prey, moths, which are able to hear echolocation calls, are less able to detect and avoid an oncoming bat.&lt;ref&gt;Fullard 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

====Harmonic composition====

Calls can be composed of one frequency or multiple frequencies comprising a [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]].  In the latter case, the call is usually dominated by a certain harmonic ("dominant" frequencies are those present at higher intensities than other harmonics present in the call).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====Call duration====

A single echolocation call (a call being a single continuous trace on a sound [[spectrogram]], and a series of calls comprising a sequence or pass) can last anywhere from 0.2 to 100 milliseconds in duration, depending on the stage of prey-catching behavior that the bat is engaged in.  For example, the duration of a call usually decreases when the bat is in the final stages of prey capture – this enables the bat to call more rapidly without overlap of call and echo. Reducing duration comes at the cost of having less total sound available for reflecting off objects and being heard by the bat.&lt;ref name="Jones, G. 2007"/&gt;

====Pulse interval====

The time interval between subsequent echolocation calls (or pulses) determines two aspects of a bat's perception. First, it establishes how quickly the bat's auditory scene information is updated. For example, bats increase the repetition rate of their calls (that is, decrease the pulse interval) as they home in on a target. This allows the bat to get new information regarding the target's location at a faster rate when it needs it most. Secondly, the pulse interval determines the maximum range that bats can detect objects. This is because bats can only keep track of the echoes from one call at a time; as soon as they make another call they stop listening for echoes from the previously made call. For example, a pulse interval of 100 ms (typical of a bat searching for insects) allows sound to travel in air roughly 34 meters so a bat can only detect objects as far away as 17 meters (the sound has to travel out and back). With a pulse interval of 5 ms (typical of a bat in the final moments of a capture attempt), the bat can only detect objects up to 85&amp;nbsp;cm away. Therefore, the bat constantly has to make a choice between getting new information updated quickly and detecting objects far away.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Moss 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

====FM signal advantages====

[[File:Yannick Dauby - Bats echolocation (CC by).ogg|thumb|Echolocation call produced by ''[[Pipistrellus pipistrellus]]'', an FM bat. The ultrasonic call has been "[[heterodyne]]d" – multiplied by a constant frequency to produce frequency subtraction, and thus an audible sound – by a bat detector. A key feature of the recording is the increase in the repetition rate of the call as the bat nears its target – this is called the "terminal buzz".]]

The major advantage conferred by an FM signal is extremely precise range discrimination, or localization, of the target.  J.A. Simmons demonstrated this effect with a series of elegant experiments that showed how bats using FM signals could distinguish between two separate targets even when the targets were less than half a millimeter apart.  This ability is due to the broadband sweep of the signal, which allows for better resolution of the time delay between the call and the returning echo, thereby improving the cross correlation of the two. Additionally, if harmonic frequencies are added to the FM signal, then this localization becomes even more precise.&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;

One possible disadvantage of the FM signal is a decreased operational range of the call.  Because the energy of the call is spread out among many frequencies, the distance at which the FM-bat can detect targets is limited.&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"/&gt; This is in part because any echo returning at a particular frequency can only be evaluated for a brief fraction of a millisecond, as the fast downward sweep of the call does not remain at any one frequency for long.&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"/&gt;

====CF signal advantages====

The structure of a CF signal is adaptive in that it allows the CF-bat to detect both the velocity of a target, and the fluttering of a target's wings as Doppler shifted frequencies.  A [[Doppler shift]] is an alteration in sound wave frequency, and is produced in two relevant situations:  when the bat and its target are moving relative to each other, and when the target's wings are oscillating back and forth. CF-bats must compensate for Doppler shifts, lowering the frequency of their call in response to echoes of elevated frequency – this ensures that the returning echo remains at the frequency to which the ears of the bat are most finely tuned.  The oscillation of a target's wings also produces amplitude shifts, which gives a CF-bat additional help in distinguishing a flying target from a stationary one.&lt;ref&gt;Schnitzler and Flieger 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;

Additionally, because the signal energy of a CF call is concentrated into a narrow frequency band, the operational range of the call is much greater than that of an FM signal.  This relies on the fact that echoes returning within the narrow frequency band can be summed over the entire length of the call, which maintains a constant frequency for up to 100 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="Grinnell 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"/&gt;

====Acoustic environments of FM and CF signals====

A frequency modulated (FM) component is excellent for hunting prey while flying in close, cluttered environments.  Two aspects of the FM signal account for this fact:  the precise target localization conferred by the broadband signal, and the short duration of the call.  The first of these is essential because in a cluttered environment, the bats must be able to resolve their prey from large amounts of background noise.  The 3D localization abilities of the broadband signal enable the bat to do exactly that, providing it with what Simmons and Stein (1980) call a "clutter rejection strategy."  This strategy is further improved by the use of harmonics, which, as previously stated, enhance the localization properties of the call.  The short duration of the FM call is also best in close, cluttered environments because it enables the bat to emit many calls extremely rapidly without overlap. This means that the bat can get an almost continuous stream of information – essential when objects are close, because they will pass by quickly – without confusing which echo corresponds to which call.&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"/&gt;

A constant frequency (CF) component is often used by bats hunting for prey while flying in open, clutter-free environments, or by bats that wait on perches for their prey to appear.  The success of the former strategy is due to two aspects of the CF call, both of which confer excellent prey-detection abilities.  First, the greater working range of the call allows bats to detect targets present at  great distances – a common situation in open environments.  Second, the length of the call is also suited for targets at great distances:  in this case, there is a decreased chance that the long call will overlap with the returning echo.  The latter strategy is made possible by the fact that the long, narrowband call allows the bat to detect Doppler shifts, which would be produced by an insect moving either towards or away from a perched bat.&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simmons and Stein 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Teeling 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenton 1995"/&gt;

===Neural mechanisms===

Because bats use echolocation to orient themselves and to locate objects, their auditory systems are adapted for this purpose, highly specialized for sensing and interpreting the stereotyped echolocation calls characteristic of their own species.  This specialization is evident from the inner ear up to the highest levels of information processing in the auditory cortex.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Inner ear and primary sensory neurons===

Both CF and FM bats have specialized inner ears which allow them to hear sounds in the ultrasonic range, far outside the range of human hearing.  Although in most other aspects, the bat's auditory organs are similar to those of most other mammals, certain bats ([[horseshoe bats]], ''Rhinolophus spp.'' and the [[moustached bat]], ''Pteronotus parnelii'') with a constant frequency (CF) component to their call (known as high duty cycle bats) do have a few additional adaptations for detecting the predominant frequency (and harmonics) of the CF vocalization. These include a narrow frequency "tuning" of the inner ear organs, with an especially large area responding to the frequency of the bat's returning echoes.&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;

The [[basilar membrane]] within the [[cochlea]] contains the first of these specializations for echo information processing.  In bats that use CF signals, the section of membrane that responds to the frequency of returning echoes is much larger than the region of response for any other frequency.  For example, in the greater horseshoe bat, ''[[Rhinolophus ferrumequinum]]'', there is a disproportionately lengthened and thickened section of the membrane that responds to sounds around 83&amp;nbsp;kHz, the constant frequency of the echo produced by the bat's call.  This area of high sensitivity to a specific, narrow range of frequency is known as an "acoustic [[fovea centralis|fovea]]".&lt;ref&gt;Schuller and Pollack 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Odontocetes (toothed whales and dolphins) have similar cochlear specializations to those found in bats. Odontocetes also have the highest neural investment of any cochleae reported to date with ratios of greater than 1500 ganglion cells/mm of basilar membrane.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Further along the auditory pathway, the movement of the basilar membrane results in the stimulation of primary auditory neurons.  Many of these neurons are specifically "tuned" (respond most strongly) to the narrow frequency range of returning echoes of CF calls.  Because of the large size of the acoustic fovea, the number of neurons responding to this region, and thus to the echo frequency, is especially high.&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"&gt;Carew 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inferior colliculus===

In the [[Inferior colliculus]], a structure in the bat's midbrain, information from lower in the auditory processing pathway is integrated and sent on to the auditory cortex.   As George Pollak and others showed in a series of papers in 1977, the [[interneurons]] in this region have a very high level of sensitivity to time differences, since the time delay between a call and the returning echo tells the bat its distance from the target object. While most neurons respond more quickly to stronger stimuli, collicular neurons maintain their timing accuracy even as signal intensity changes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

These interneurons are specialized for time sensitivity in several ways.  First, when activated, they generally respond with only one or two [[action potential]]s.  This short duration of response allows their action potentials to give a very specific indication of the exact moment of the time when the stimulus arrived, and to respond accurately to stimuli that occur close in time to one another.  In addition, the neurons have a very low threshold of activation – they respond quickly even to weak stimuli.  Finally, for FM signals, each interneuron is tuned to a specific frequency within the sweep, as well as to that same frequency in the following echo.   There is specialization for the CF component of the call at this level as well.  The high proportion of neurons responding to the frequency of the acoustic fovea actually increases at this level.&lt;ref name="Zupanc 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollak 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditory cortex===

The [[auditory cortex]] in bats is quite large in comparison with other mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kanwal |first=Jagmeet S. |last2=Rauschecker |first2=Josef P. |date=2007-05-01 |title=Auditory cortex of bats and primates: managing species-specific calls for social communication |journal=Frontiers in Bioscience |volume=12 |pages=4621–4640 |pmc=4276140 |pmid=17485400 |doi=10.2741/2413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various characteristics of sound are processed by different regions of the cortex, each providing different information about the location or movement of a target object.   Most of the existing studies on information processing in the auditory cortex of the bat have been done by [[Nobuo Suga]] on the mustached bat, ''[[Pteronotus parnellii]]''. This bat's call has both CF tone and FM sweep components.

Suga and his colleagues have shown that the cortex contains a series of "maps" of auditory information, each of which is organized systematically based on characteristics of sound such as [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]]. The neurons in these areas respond only to a specific combination of frequency and timing (sound-echo delay), and are known as [[combination-sensitive neurons]].

The systematically organized maps in the auditory cortex respond to various aspects of the echo signal, such as its delay and its velocity.  These regions are composed of "combination sensitive" neurons that require at least two specific stimuli to elicit a response.  The neurons vary systematically across the maps, which are organized by acoustic features of the sound and can be two dimensional.  The different features of the call and its echo are used by the bat to determine important characteristics of their prey.  The maps include:

[[File:BatAuditoryCortex.JPG|thumb|420px|right|Sketch of the regions of the auditory cortex in a bat's brain]]

*'''FM-FM area''':  This region of the cortex contains FM-FM combination-sensitive neurons.  These cells respond only to the combination of two FM sweeps: a call and its echo.  The neurons in the FM-FM region are often referred to as "delay-tuned," since each responds to a specific time delay between the original call and the echo, in order to find the distance from the target object (the range).  Each neuron also shows specificity for one harmonic in the original call and a different harmonic in the echo.  The neurons within the FM-FM area of the cortex of ''Pteronotus'' are organized into columns, in which the delay time is constant vertically but increases across the horizontal plane.  The result is that range is encoded by location on the cortex, and increases systematically across the FM-FM area.&lt;ref name="Neuweiler 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1975"&gt;Suga et al. 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suga et al. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''CF-CF area''':  Another kind of combination-sensitive neuron is the CF-CF neuron.  These respond best to the combination of a CF call containing two given frequencies – a call at 30&amp;nbsp;kHz (CF1) and one of its additional [[harmonics]] around 60 or 90&amp;nbsp;kHz (CF2 or CF3) –  and the corresponding echoes.  Thus, within the CF-CF region, the changes in echo frequency caused by the [[Doppler shift]] can be compared to the frequency of the original call to calculate the bat's velocity relative to its target object.  As in the FM-FM area, information is encoded by its location within the map-like organization of the region.  The CF-CF area is first split into the distinct CF1-CF2 and CF1-CF3 areas.  Within each area, the CF1 frequency is organized on an axis, perpendicular to the CF2 or CF3 frequency axis.  In the resulting grid, each neuron codes for a certain combination of frequencies that is indicative of a specific velocity&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1987"&gt;Suga et al. 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''DSCF area''':  This large section of the cortex is a map of the acoustic fovea, organized by frequency and by amplitude.  Neurons in this region respond to CF signals that have been Doppler shifted (in other words, echoes only) and are within the same narrow frequency range to which the acoustic fovea responds.  For ''Pteronotus'', this is around 61&amp;nbsp;kHz.  This area is organized into columns, which are arranged radially based on frequency.  Within a column, each neuron responds to a specific combination of frequency and amplitude. Suga's studies have indicated that this brain region is necessary for frequency discrimination.&lt;ref name="Carew 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suga et al. 1987"/&gt;

==Toothed whales==

[[File:Toothed whale sound production.png|thumb|420px|right|Diagram illustrating sound generation, propagation and reception in a toothed whale. Outgoing sounds are red and incoming ones are green]]

Biosonar is valuable to [[toothed whales]] (suborder [[Odontoceti]]), including [[dolphin]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[river dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s and [[sperm whale]]s, because they live in an underwater habitat that has favourable acoustic characteristics and where [[visual perception|vision]] is extremely limited in range due to [[underwater|absorption]] or [[turbidity]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Cetacean evolution consisted of three main radiations. Throughout the middle and late Eocene periods (49-31.5 million years ago), [[archaeocete]]s, primitive toothed Cetacea that arose from terrestrial mammals with the creation of aquatic adaptations, were the only known archaic Cetacea.&lt;ref name="Fordyce, R. E 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fordyce | first1=R.

These early mysticetes (baleen whales) and odontocetes can be dated back to the middle Oligocene in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Fordyce, R. E 1980"/&gt; Based on past phylogenies, it has been found that the evolution of odontocetes is monophyletic, suggesting that echolocation evolved only once 36 to 34 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D.R. 2007"/&gt; Dispersal rates routes of early odontocetes included transoceanic travel to new adaptive zones. The third radiation occurred later in the Neogene, when present dolphins and their relatives evolved to be the most common species in the modern sea.&lt;ref name="Fordyce, R. E 2003"/&gt;

The evolution of echolocation could be attributed to several theories. There are two proposed drives for the hypotheses of cetacean radiation, one biotic and the other abiotic in nature. The first, adaptive radiation, is the result of a rapid divergence into new adaptive zones. This results in diverse, ecologically different clades that are incomparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Slater | first1=G. J. | last2=Price | first2=S.

A second, more abiotic drive is better supported. Physical restructuring of the oceans has played a role in echolocation radiation. This was a result of global climate change at the [[Eocene-Oligocene boundary]]; from a greenhouse to an icehouse world. Tectonic openings created the emergence of the Southern ocean with a free flowing Antarctic Circumpolar current.&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg &amp; Pyenson 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steeman et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These events allowed for a selection regime characterized by the ability to locate and capture prey in turbid river waters, or allow odontocetes to invade and feed at depths below the photic zone. Further studies have found that echolocation below the photic zone could have been a predation adaptation to [[Diel vertical migration|diel migrating]] [[cephalopods]].&lt;ref name="Lindberg, D.R. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fordyce | first1=R.E. | last2=Barnes | first2=L.G. | year=1994 | title=The evolutionary history of whales and dolphins |  journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume=22 | issue=1| pages=419–455 | doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.22.1.419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its advent, there has been [[adaptive radiation]] especially in the family [[Delphinidae]] (dolphins) in which echolocation has become extremely derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McGowen | first1=M.R. | last2=Spaulding | first2=M. | last3=Gatesy | first3=J. | year=2009 | title=Divergence date estimation and a comprehensive molecular tree of extant cetaceans |  journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume=53 | issue=3| pages=891–906 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2009.08.018 | pmid=19699809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two proteins have been found to play a major role in toothed whale echolocation. Prestin, a motor protein of the outer hair cells of the inner ear of the mammalian cochlea, has an association between the number of nonsynonymous substitutions and hearing sensitivity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Y. |title=Cetaceans on a Molecular Fast Track to Ultrasonic Hearing |journal=Current Biology |date=2010|volume=20 |pages=1834–1839 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.09.008 |issue=20 |pmid=20933423}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has undergone two clear episodes of accelerated protein evolution in cetaceans: on the ancestral branch of odontocetes and on the branch leading to delphinioidae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first episode of acceleration is connected to odontocete divergence, when echolocation first developed, and the second occurs with the increase in echolocation frequency seen in the family Delphinioidae. Cldn14, a member of the tight junction proteins which form barriers between inner ear cells, shows exactly the same evolutionary pattern as Prestin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=H. H.|title=Adaptive evolution of tight junction protein claudin-14 in echolocating whales |journal=Gene |date=2013|volume=530 |pages=208–214|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2013.08.034 |issue=2|pmid=23965379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two events of protein evolution, for Prestin and Cldn14, occurred at the same times as the tectonic opening of the [[Drake Passage]] (34-31 Ma) and the Antarctic ice growth at the middle Miocene climate transition (14 Ma), with the divergence of odontocetes and mysticetes occurring with the former, and the speciation of delphinioidae with the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steeman |first1=M.

[[File:Killer_whale_residents_broadband.ogg|left|thumb|Southern resident [[killer whale]]s using echolocation.]]
One specific type of echolocation, narrow-band high frequency (NBHF) clicks, evolved at least four times in groups of odontocetes, including the pygmy sperm whale ([[Kogiidae]]) and porpoise ([[Phocoenidae]]) families, ''[[La Plata dolphin|Pontoporia blainvillei]]'', the genus ''[[Cephalorhynchus]]'', and part of the genus ''[[Lagenorhynchus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Morisaka | first1=T. | last2=Connor | first2=R.C. | year=2007 | title=Predation by killer whales (''Orcinus orca'') and the evolution of whistle loss and narrow-band high frequency clicks in odontocetes |  journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume=20 | issue=4| pages=1439–1458 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01336.x | pmid=17584238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kyhn, L.A. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kyhn | first1=L.A. | last2=Jensen | first2=F.H. | last3=Beedholm | first3=K. | last4=Tougaard | first4=J. | last5=Hansen | first5=M. | last6=Madsen | first6=P.T. | year=2010 | title=Echolocation in sympatric Peale's dolphins (''Lagenorhynchus australis'') and Commerson's dolphins (''Cephalorhynchus commersonii'') producing narrow-band high-frequency clicks |  journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=213 | issue=11| pages=1940–1949 | doi=10.1242/jeb.042440 | pmid=20472781}}&lt;/ref&gt; These high frequency clicks likely evolved as adaptation of predator avoidance, as they inhabit areas that have many killer whales and the signals are inaudible to killer whales due to the absence of energy below 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Another reason for variation in echolocation is habitat. For all sonar systems the limiting factor deciding whether a returning echo is detected is the echo-to-noise ratio (ENR). The ENR is given by the emitted source level (SL) plus the target strength, minus the two-way transmission loss (absorption and spreading) and the received noise.&lt;ref name="Kyhn, L.A. 2010" /&gt; Animals will adapt either to maximize range under noise-limited conditions (increase source level) or to reduce noise clutter in a shallow and/or littered habitat (decrease source level). In cluttered habitats, such as coastal areas, prey ranges are smaller, and species like  Commerson's dolphin (''[[Cephalorhynchus commersonii']]') have lowered source levels to better suit their environment.&lt;ref name="Kyhn, L.A. 2010" /&gt;

Toothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency clicks in the direction that their head is pointing. Sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic lips. These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the 'melon'. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities. Most toothed whales use clicks in a series, or click train, for echolocation, while the sperm whale may produce clicks individually. Toothed whale whistles do not appear to be used in echolocation. Different rates of click production in a click train give rise to the familiar barks, squeals and growls of the [[bottlenose dolphin]]. A click train with a repetition rate over 600 per second is called a burst pulse. In bottlenose dolphins, the auditory brain response resolves individual clicks up to 600 per second, but yields a graded response for higher repetition rates.&lt;ref&gt;Cranford, T.W., (2000). "In Search of Impulse Sound Sources in Odontocetes." In ''Hearing by Whales and Dolphins'' (Springer Handbook of Auditory Research series), W.W.L. Au, A.N. Popper and R.R. Fay, Eds. Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that some smaller toothed whales may have their tooth arrangement suited to aid in echolocation.  The placement of teeth in the jaw of a bottlenose dolphin, for example, are not symmetrical when seen from a vertical plane, and this asymmetry could possibly be an aid in the dolphin sensing if echoes from its biosonar are coming from one side or the other.&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, A.D., and Klinowska, M.A., (1990). "A proposed echolocation receptor for the Bottlenose Dolphin (''Tursiops truncatus''): modeling the receive directivity from tooth and lower jaw geometry." In ''Sensory Abilities of Cetaceans'' vol 196 ed J A Thomas and R A Kastelein (New York: Plenum) pp 255–67 (NATO ASI Series A)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobbins | first1=P | year=2007 | title=Dolphin sonar—modeling a new receiver concept |  journal=Bioinspired Biomimicry | volume=2 | issue=1| pages=19–29 | doi=10.1088/1748-3182/2/1/003|bibcode=2007BiBi....2...19D | url=http://biomimetic.pbworks.com/f/Dolphin+sonar%E2%80%94modelling+a+new+receiverDobbins.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea lacks experimental support.

Echoes are received using complex fatty structures around the lower jaw as the primary reception path, from where they are transmitted to the middle ear via a continuous fat body. Lateral sound may be received though fatty lobes surrounding the ears with a similar density to water. Some researchers believe that when they approach the object of interest, they protect themselves against the louder echo by quietening the emitted sound. In bats this is known to happen, but here the hearing sensitivity is also reduced close to a target.&lt;ref&gt;Ketten 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ketten 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oilbirds and swiftlets==
[[File:Palawan swiftlet (Aerodramus palawanensis) hunting by echolocation.JPG|thumb|A Palawan swiftlet (''Aerodramus palawanensis'') flies in complete darkness inside the Puerto Princesa subterranean river cave.]]

[[Oilbird]]s and some species of [[swiftlet]] are known to use a relatively crude form of echolocation compared to that of bats and dolphins. These nocturnal birds emit calls while flying and use the calls to navigate through trees and caves where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Birds of the High Andes: a manual to the birds of the temperate zone of the Andes and Patagonia, South America |author1=Jon Fjeldså |author2=Niels Krabbe | publisher=Apollo Books | year=1990 | isbn=978-87-88757-16-3 | page=232 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NmXSeVrmlgIC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=oilbird+echo+trees+caves+nocturnal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Exploring Life Biology | author=Marshall Cavendish | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-7614-7142-4 | page=547 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vC4cwlhjGxsC&amp;pg=PA547&amp;dq=swiftlet+echo+trees+caves+nocturnal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shrews, tenrecs and rats==
{{Main article|Shrews#Echolocation}}

Terrestrial mammals other than bats known to echolocate include two genera (''[[Sorex]]'' and ''[[Blarina]]'') of shrews and the [[tenrec]]s of [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tomasi | first1=Thomas E. | year=1979 | title=Echolocation by the Short-Tailed Shrew ''Blarina brevicauda'' |  journal=Journal of Mammalogy | volume=60 | issue=4| pages=751–759 | doi=10.2307/1380190}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the wandering shrew (''[[Sorex vagrans]]''), the common or Eurasian shrew (''[[Sorex araneus]]''), and the short-tailed shrew (''[[Blarina brevicauda]]'').&lt;ref name="Siemers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Siemers | first1=BM | last2=Schauermann | first2=G | last3=Turni | first3=H | last4=von Merten | first4=S | year=2009 | title=Why do shrews twitter?

In contrast to bats, shrews use echolocation only to investigate their habitat rather than additionally to pinpoint food.&lt;ref name="Siemers"/&gt;

There is evidence that blinded [[laboratory rats]] can use echolocation to navigate mazes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Echolocation in rats|author1=Riley, D.A.  |author2=Rosenzweig, M.R.|journal=Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology|volume=50|issue=4year=1957|pages=323–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Echolocation jamming==
{{main article|Echolocation jamming in animals}}

Echolocation systems are susceptible to interference known as [[echolocation jamming]] or sonar jamming. Jamming occurs when non-target sounds interfere with target echoes. Jamming can be purposeful or inadvertent and can be caused by the echolocation system itself, other echolocating animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiu |first=C. |author2=Xian, W. |author3=Moss, C.

Echolocating animals have evolved to minimize jamming; however, echolocation avoidance behaviors are not always successful.

== Avoidance by prey animals ==
''[[Galleria mellonella]]'' exhibits predator avoidance behaviors such as dropping, looping, and freezing when emitters sent out ultrasound waves, indicating that ''G. mellonella'' can both detect and differentiate between ultrasound frequencies used by predators or from other members of their species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spangler|first=Hayward G.|date=1988|title=Sound and the Moths That Infest Beehives|jstor=3495006|journal=The Florida Entomologist|volume=71|issue=4|pages=467–477|doi=10.2307/3495006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annie Arniel''' (May 1873 – February 9, 1924) was a [[women's suffrage|suffragist]] and women's rights advocate. Born in [[Harrington, Delaware|Harrington]], [[Delaware]], United States, as Anna L. Melvin, she married George Arniel of Canada and was widowed in 1910. Annie played a key role in helping to win the women's vote in the United States.

Arniel was a factory worker, living in downtown [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]], when she was recruited by [[Mabel Vernon]] and [[Alice Paul]] for membership in the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP). As a member of the [[Silent Sentinels]] she was among the first six suffragists arrested and jailed on June 27, 1917, at the [[White House]]. She served eight jail terms for suffrage protesting: three days in June 1917; 60 days in the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan prison]] in [[Virginia]], from August to September 1917, for picketing; 15 days for a meeting in [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]]; and five sentences of five days each in January and February 1919 for the NWP's watchfire demonstrations.

Two forms of '''black-tailed deer''' or '''blacktail deer''' that occupy coastal woodlands in the [[Pacific Northwest]] are [[subspecies]] of the [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''). They have sometimes been treated as a species, but virtually all recent authorities maintain they are subspecies.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN2010.4|assessor=Sanchez Rojas, G.|assessor2=Gallina Tessaro, S.|last-assessor-amp=yes|year=2008|id=42393|title=Odocoileus hemionus|downloaded=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;{{MSW3|id=14200267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;Novak, R.

==Range==
Black-tailed deer once lived at least as far east as Wyoming. In [[Francis Parkman]]'s ''The Oregon Trail,'' an eyewitness account of his 1846 trek across the early West, while within a two-day ride from [[Fort Laramie]], Parkman writes of shooting what he believes to be an [[elk]], only to discover he has killed a black-tailed deer.&lt;ref&gt;Parkman, Francis (1910) ''The Oregon Trail'', Ginn and company&lt;/ref&gt;

California Fish and Game 77:201–209.&lt;/ref&gt; western Oregon, Washington, in coastal and interior [[British Columbia]], and north into the Alaskan panhandle. It is a popular [[game animal]].

==Taxonomy==
Though it has been argued that the black-tailed deer is a species, virtually all recent authorities maintain it as a subspecies of the [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus'').&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MSW3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=hybrid/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeerEvolution/&gt;&lt;ref name=WMNA/&gt; Strictly speaking, the black-tailed deer group consists of two subspecies, as it also includes ''O. h. sitkensis'' (the [[Sitka deer]]).&lt;ref name=MSW3/&gt; The black-tailed deer group and the mule deer group (''[[sensu stricto]]'') [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]], and mule deer appear to have [[Evolution|evolved]] from the black-tailed deer group.&lt;ref name=DeerEvolution/&gt; Despite this, the [[mtDNA]] of the [[white-tailed deer]] and mule deer are similar, but differ from that of the black-tailed deer.&lt;ref name=DeerEvolution/&gt; This may be the result of [[introgression]], although hybrids between the mule deer and white-tailed deer are rare in the wild (apparently more common locally in [[West Texas]]), and the hybrid [[survival rate]] is low even in captivity.&lt;ref name=hybrid/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeerEvolution/&gt;

==Ecology==
These two subspecies thrive on the edge of the forest, as the dark forest lacks the [[underbrush]] and grasslands the deer prefer as food, and completely open areas lack the hiding spots and cover they prefer for harsh weather. One of the plants that black-tailed deer browse is [[western poison oak]], despite its irritant content.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 ''Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721044257/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |date=July 21, 2009 }}, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg.&lt;/ref&gt; This deer often is most active at dawn and dusk, and is frequently involved in collisions with automobiles.

==Behavior==
[[File:Blacktail.jpg|thumb|The characteristic black tail of a black-tailed deer.]]
Deer are browsers. During the winter and early spring, they feed on Douglas-fir, western red cedar, red huckleberry, salal, deer fern, and lichens growing on trees. Late spring to fall, they consume grasses, blackberries, apples, fireweed, pearly everlasting, forbs, salmonberry, salal, and maple. The mating or 'rutting' season occurs during November and early December. Bucks can be observed running back and forth across the roads in the pursuit of does. After the rut, the bucks tend to hide and rest, often nursing wounds. They suffer broken antlers, and have lost weight. They drop their antlers between January and March. Antlers on the forest floor provide a source of calcium and other nutrients to other forest inhabitants. Bucks regrow their antlers beginning in April through to August.

The gestation period for does is six to seven months, with fawns being born in late May and into June. Twins are the rule, although young does often have only single fawns. Triplets can also occur. Fawns weigh {{convert|2.7|to|4|kg|lb}} and have no scent for the first week or so. This enables the mother to leave the fawn hidden while she goes off to browse and replenish her body after giving birth. She must also eat enough to produce enough milk to feed her fawns. Although does are excellent mothers, fawn mortality rate is 45 to 70%. Does are very protective of their young and humans are viewed as predators.

Deer communicate with the aid of scent and pheromones from several glands located on the lower legs. The metatarsal (outside of lower leg) produces an alarm scent, the tarsal (inside of hock) serves for mutual recognition and the interdigital (between the toes) leave a scent trail when deer travel. Deer have excellent sight and smell. Their large ears can move independently of each other and pick up any unusual sounds that may signal danger.

At dawn and dusk and moonlit nights, deer are seen browsing on the roadside. Wooded areas with forests on both sides of the road and open, grassy areas, i.e. golf courses, attract deer. Caution when driving is prudent because often as one deer crosses, another one or two follow.

==Controversy over habitat management==
In Southeast Alaska, the Sitka deer is the primary prey of the rare [[Alexander Archipelago wolf]] (''Canis lupus ligoni''), which is endemic to the region.&lt;ref name="wolf-assessment"&gt;Person, D.K. (Univ. Alaska); Kirchhoff, M. (ADF&amp;G); van Ballenberghe, V. (USFS-FSL); Iverson, G.C. (USFS); Grossman, E. (USF&amp;WS). 1996. [http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/3056 "The Alexander Archipelago Wolf: A Conservation Assessment,"] Gen. Tech. Rep. PNW-GTR-384. Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] evaluated a petition to list this wolf subspecies as threatened, and decided a listing was not warranted in August 1997, largely on the basis of provisions the Forest Service had included to protect the viability of the wolf subspecies in its Forest Plan for the [[Tongass National Forest]], adopted three months earlier.&lt;ref name="1997-Finding"&gt;USF&amp;WS. 1997 (August 28) 12-month finding, re: Petition to List the Alexander Archipelago Wolf under Provisions of the Endangered Species Act.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tongass NF is important in wolf conservation because it includes about 80% of the region's land area. The protections for the wolf included a standard and guideline intended to retain, in the face of logging losses, enough habitat [[carrying capacity]] for deer in winter to assure the viability of the Alexander Archipelago wolf and an adequate supply of deer for hunters. The needed carrying capacity was originally specified as 13 deer per square mile, but was corrected in 2000 to 18. Use of a deer model is specified for determining carrying capacity, and is the only tool available for the purpose.&lt;ref name="XI"&gt;1997 TLMP Wolf standard and guideline: reproduced at Wildlife Habitat Planning: WILD112, XI.A.3 in [http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/planning/helilanding/appendix_b.htm]. The 13 deer per square mile carrying capacity was an error, corrected in 1998 to 17, and in 2002 to 18 deer per square mile.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tongass Forest Plan Implementation Clarification, 1998; and directive of Tom Puchlerz, Tongass Forest Supervisor, August 6, 2002. See also: [http://tongass-constratreview.net/CSR_Background.htm Background] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215184125/http://tongass-constratreview.net/CSR_Background.htm |date=December 15, 2013 }}. USDA Forest Service – Tongass National Forest&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Forest Service's implementation of the deer provision in the Tongass wolf standard and guideline has been controversial for many years, and led to a lawsuit by Greenpeace and Cascadia Wildlands in 2008, over four logging projects. The [[data set]] the Forest Service was using in the deer model was known through the agency's own study (done in 2000) to generally overestimate the carrying capacity for deer and underestimate the impacts of logging.&lt;ref name="Sit" /&gt; The study showed the data set (called Vol-Strata) is not correlated to habitat quality.&lt;ref name="caouette"&gt;Caouette, J.; Kramer, M.; Nowacki, G. 2000. [http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/2958 Deconstructing the Tongass Timber Paradigm]. USDA Forest Service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Forest Service, [http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Final_EIS_VolumeI.pdf 2008 Final Environmental Impact Statement for Tongass Land Management Plan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724111548/http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Final_EIS_VolumeI.pdf |date=July 24, 2011 }}. Vol. 1 (January 2008) pp. 3–265 to 3–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a conversion factor, known as the "deer multiplier" (used in calculating carrying capacity) was incorrectly applied, causing — by itself – a 30% overestimation of carrying capacity and corresponding underestimation of impacts.&lt;ref name="Sit"&gt;[http://www.sitnews.us/0708news/071108/071108_suit.html "Suit Filed to Stop Four Timber Sales on Largest National Forest" – Sit News]. Sitnews.us (2008-07-11). Retrieved on 2012-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The combined effect of the two errors is variable because Vol-Strata is not correlated to habitat quality. Regarding the Traitors Cove Timber Sales project, in 2011 the plaintiffs noted in oral arguments before the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] that the difference is between a claimed 21 deer per square mile carrying capacity in the project EIS, and 9.5 deer per square mile (about half of the Tongass Forest Plan's requirement) according to unpublished corrections the agency made in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_subpage.php?pk_id=0000007379 Audio recording of oral arguments before 9th Circ. Ct. of Appeals], May 3, 2011. Hear: argument by Chris Winter (Crag Law Center) attorney for Greenpeace v. Cole plaintiffs generally, and at 13:20 concerning Traitors Cove. Recording includes arguments by Winters and federal attorney Charles Scott, and Winter's rebuttal.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th Circuit panel ruled unanimously on August 2, 2011 in favor of the plaintiffs, remanding the four timber sale decisions to the Forest Service and giving guidance for what is necessary during reanalysis of impacts to deer.&lt;ref name="Memorandum"&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2011/08/02/10-35567.pdf Memorandum. Issued unanimously by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel of Judges Alarcon, Graber and Bybee]. August 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling says in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not think that USFS has adequately explained its decision to approve the four logging projects in the Tongass. ... USFS has failed to explain how it ended up with a table that identifies 100 deer per square mile as a maximum carrying capacity, but allows 130 deer per square mile as a potential carrying capacity. 'The agency is obligated to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made,' which the agency has not done here. Pac. Coast Fed'n of Fisherman's Ass'ns v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 426 F.3d 1082, 1091 (9th Cir. 2005)..."&lt;ref name="Memorandum"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have similar questions about USFS's use of VolStrata data, which identifies total timber volume and not forest structure, to approve the projects, where forest structure—and not total timber volume—is relevant to the habitability of a piece of land. USFS itself has recognized the limitations in the VolStrata data. ... Because we must remand to the agency to re-examine its Deer Model, we need not decide whether the use of the VolStrata data was arbitrary and capricious. We anticipate that, in reviewing the proposed projects, USFS will use the best available data ...&lt;ref name="Memorandum"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a statement to the press, a spokesman for the plaintiffs said the errors in this lawsuit apply to every significant Tongass timber sale decision between 1996 and 2008, before the Forest Service corrected errors in the deer model when the agency issued its revised Tongass Forest Plan in 2008. But he said despite those corrections, the agency still fails to address cumulative impacts to deer, especially on Prince of Wales Island, as is being challenged in the Logjam timber sale lawsuit, by ignoring substantial logging on nonfederal lands.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Grass, [http://juneauempire.com/local/2011-08-03/appeals-court-overturns-4-tongass-logging-projects#.Tjuogm8ZSgP Appeals court overturns 4 Tongass logging projects]. Juneau Empire, August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, under the same litigation, the U.S. District Court in Anchorage made a second remand to the Forest Service because the agency's further work under the first remand had not resolved the modeling issues. Activity on the four timber sales involved in the litigation has been suspended since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;SitNews (2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2899">As a novel type of semi-discrete [[dynamical systems]], '''Boolean delay equations (BDEs)''' are models with Boolean-valued variables that evolve in continuous time.  Since at the present time, most phenomena are too complex to be modeled by [[partial differential equations]] (as continuous infinite-dimensional systems), BDEs are intended as a ([[heuristic]]) first step on the challenging road to further understanding and [[scientific model|modeling]] them.  For instance, one can mention complex problems in [[fluid dynamics]], [[climate]] dynamics, solid-earth [[geophysics]], and many problems elsewhere in [[natural sciences]] where much of the discourse is still [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]].

==Hopes and promises==
Although in recent centuries, [[differential equation]]s (both ordinary and partial) have extensively served as [[quantitative property|quantitative]] models of vast categories of problems, by the recent greedy and rapid burst of complexities everywhere, the gap between [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and [[qualitative property|qualitative]] modeling and [[reasoning]] techniques is widening.  BDEs offer a formal [[mathematical]] language that is promising to help bridge that gap.

[[File:Cavalieri's Principle in Coins.JPG|thumb|250px|Two stacks of British coins with the same volume, illustrating Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions]]

In [[geometry]], '''Cavalieri's principle''', a modern implementation of the '''method of indivisibles''', named after [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, "Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence", ''The College Mathematics Journal'', volume 22, number 2, March, 1991), pages 118&amp;ndash;124&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in a plane are included between two parallel lines in that plane. If every line parallel to these two lines intersects both regions in line segments of equal length, then the two regions have equal areas.
* '''3-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in three-space (solids) are included between two parallel planes. If every plane parallel to these two planes intersects both regions in [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] of equal area, then the two regions have equal volumes.

Today Cavalieri's principle is seen as an early step towards [[integral calculus]], and while it is used in some forms, such as its generalization in [[Fubini's theorem]], results using Cavalieri's principle can often be shown more directly via integration. In the other direction, Cavalieri's principle grew out of the ancient Greek [[method of exhaustion]], which used limits but did not use [[infinitesimal]]s.

== History ==
[[File:Bonaventura Cavalieri.jpeg|thumb|right|140px|[[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], the mathematician the principle is named after.]]
Cavalieri's principle was originally called the method of indivisibles, the name it was known by in [[Renaissance Europe]]. Cavalieri developed a complete theory of indivisibles, elaborated in his ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'' (''Geometry, advanced in a new way by the indivisibles of the continua'', 1635) and his ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (''Six geometrical exercises'', 1647).&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor J.

In the 3rd century BC, [[Archimedes]], using a method resembling Cavalieri's principle,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Archimedes-Lost-Method-1084593 "Archimedes' Lost Method"]&lt;/ref&gt; was able to find the volume of a sphere given the volumes of a cone and cylinder in his work ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]''. In the 5th century AD, [[Zu Chongzhi]] and his son [[Zu Gengzhi]] established a similar method to find a sphere's volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |edition=3 |first1=Dennis G. |last1=Zill |first2=Scott |last2=Wright |first3=Warren S. |last3=Wright |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |year=2009 |isbn=0-7637-5995-3 |page=xxvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C&amp;pg=PR27 Extract of page 27]&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Cavalieri's indivisibles to [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s and [[John Wallis]]'s [[infinitesimal]]s was a major advance in the history of the [[integral calculus|calculus]]. The indivisibles were entities of [[codimension]] 1, so that a plane figure was thought as made out of an infinity of 1-dimensional lines. Meanwhile, infinitesimals were entities of the same dimension as the figure they make up; thus, a plane figure would be made out of "parallelograms" of infinitesimal width. Applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, Wallis computed the area of a triangle by partitioning it into infinitesimal parallelograms of width&amp;nbsp;1/∞.

== Examples ==

=== Spheres ===
[[Image:sphere cavalieri.svg|500px|thumb|The disk-shaped cross-section of the sphere has the same area as the ring-shaped cross-section of that part of the cylinder that lies ''outside'' the cone.]]

If one knows that the volume of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}\left(\text{base} \times \text{height}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then one can use Cavalieri's principle to derive the fact that the volume of a [[sphere]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius.

That is done as follows: Consider a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and a cylinder of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Within the cylinder is the cone whose apex is at the center of one base of the cylinder and whose base is the other base of the cylinder. By the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the plane located &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; units above the "equator" intersects the sphere in a circle of area &lt;math&gt;\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The area of the plane's intersection with the part of the cylinder that is ''outside'' of the cone is also &lt;math&gt;\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;. As we can see, the area of every intersection of the circle with the horizontal plane located at any height &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; equals the area of the intersection of the plane with the part of the cylinder that is "outside" of the cone; thus, applying Cavalieri's principle, we could say that the volume of the half sphere equals the volume of the part of the cylinder that is "outside" the cone. The aforementioned volume of the cone is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the volume of the cylinder, thus the volume ''outside'' of the cone is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; the volume of the cylinder. Therefore the volume of the upper half of the sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder is

:&lt;math&gt;\text{base} \times \text{height} = \pi r^2 \cdot r = \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;

("Base" is in units of ''area''; "height" is in units of ''distance''. Area&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;distance&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;volume.)

Therefore the volume of the upper half-sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt; and that of the whole sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Cones and pyramids ===

The fact that the volume of any [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], regardless of the shape of the base, whether circular as in the case of a cone, or square as in the case of the Egyptian pyramids, or any other shape, is (1/3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;base&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;height, can be established by Cavalieri's principle if one knows only that it is true in one case. One may initially establish it in a single case by partitioning the interior of a triangular prism into three pyramidal components of equal volumes. One may show the equality of those three volumes by means of Cavalieri's principle.

In fact, Cavalieri's principle or similar infinitesimal argument is ''necessary'' to compute the volume of cones and even pyramids, which is essentially the content of [[Hilbert's third problem]] – polyhedral pyramids and cones cannot be cut and rearranged into a standard shape, and instead must be compared by infinite (infinitesimal) means. The ancient Greeks used various precursor techniques such as Archimedes's mechanical arguments or [[method of exhaustion]] to compute these volumes.

===The napkin ring problem===

{{main|Napkin ring problem}}

[[Image:sphere bands.svg|thumb|400px|If a hole of height ''h'' is drilled straight through the center of a sphere, the volume of the remaining band does not depend on the size of the sphere. For a larger sphere, the band will be thinner but longer.]]

In what is called the [[napkin ring problem]], one shows by Cavalieri's principle that when a hole is drilled straight through the centre of a sphere where the remaining band has height ''h'', the volume of the remaining material surprisingly does not depend on the size of the sphere.  The cross-section of the remaining ring is a plane annulus, whose area is the difference between the areas of two circles.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the area of one of the two circles is ''π'' times ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the sphere's radius and ''y'' is the distance from the plane of the equator to the cutting plane, and that of the other is ''π'' times ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;(''h''/2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  When these are subtracted, the ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; cancels; hence the lack of dependence of the bottom-line answer upon&amp;nbsp;''r''.

=== Cycloids ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[visual calculus]]. --&gt;

[[Image:Folded cycloid.svg|thumb|400px|The horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by two cycloidal arcs traced by a point on the same circle rolling in one case clockwise on the line below it, and in the other counterclockwise on the line above it, has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the circle.]]

N. Reed has shown&lt;ref&gt;N. Reed, "[[Elementary proof]] of the area under a cycloid", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'', volume 70, number 454, December, 1986, pages 290&amp;ndash;291&lt;/ref&gt; how to find the area bounded by a [[cycloid]] by using Cavalieri's principle. A circle of radius ''r'' can roll in a clockwise direction upon a line below it, or in a counterclockwise direction upon a line above it. A point on the circle thereby traces out two cycloids. When the circle has rolled any particular distance, the angle through which it would have turned clockwise and that through which it would have turned counterclockwise are the same. The two points tracing the cycloids are therefore at equal heights. The line through them is therefore horizontal (i.e. parallel to the two lines on which the circle rolls). Consequently each horizontal cross-section of the circle has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by the two arcs of cyloids.  By Cavalieri's principle, the circle therefore has the same area as that region.

Consider the rectangle bounding a single cycloid arch. From the definition of a cycloid, it has width {{math|2π''r''}} and height {{math|2''r''}}, so its area is four times the area of the circle. Calculate the area within this rectangle that lies above the cycloid arch by bisecting the rectangle at the midpoint where the arch meets the rectangle, rotate one piece by 180° and overlay the other half of the rectangle with it. The new rectangle, of area twice that of the circle, consists of the "lens" region between two cycloids, whose area was calculated above to be the same as that of the circle, and the two regions that formed the region above the cycloid arch in the original rectangle. Thus, the area bounded by a rectangle above a single complete arch of the cycloid has area equal to the area of the circle, and so, the area bounded by the arch is three times the area of the circle.

'''Christian values''' historically refers to the [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] derived from the [[teachings of Jesus]] Christ and taught by [[Christians]] throughout the history of the religion. The term has various applications and meanings, and specific definitions can vary widely between [[Christian denominations|denominations]], geographical locations, and different schools of thought.

The terms "Christian values" and "family values" are often used as a euphemism for [[Familialism]] by the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref name="SimkinsRisch2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald Simkins|author2=Gail S. Risch|title=Religion and the Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QASRyYixtEC|date=1 March 2008|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-1-881871-49-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgellDocka2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgell|first1=Penny|last2=Docka|first2=Danielle|title=Beyond the Nuclear Family?

==New Testament teaching==
The [[life of Jesus in the New Testament|biblical teachings of Jesus]] include:&lt;ref&gt;''The Holy Bible'', King James Version, Meridian, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Great Commandment#Love the Lord thy God|Love of God and Neighbors]]: "You shall love the Lord your God with all of your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might." (an excerpt from the [[Shema]] Deut.6:5), -Matthew 22:37  This is the first half of the statement, and the second half, given equal weight, is "love your neighbor as yourself" upon which hang all the Law and all the prophets. -[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-40 Matthew 22:36-40]
*[[Christian views on marriage|Fidelity in marriage]]: "Whom God has joined together let no man put asunder", derived from -Matthew 19:6
*[[Evangelical counsels|Renunciation of worldly goods]]: "Gather not your riches up upon this earth, for there your heart will be also", (Matthew 6:21)
*[[Christian pacifism|Renunciation of vengeance]]: "If a man strikes you on one cheek, [[turning the other cheek|turn the other cheek]]", (Luke 6:29)
*[[Christian views on sin|Forgiveness of sins]]: "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us", (Matthew 6:12)
*[[Unconditional love]]: "[[Matthew 5:44|Love your enemies]] and [[Lord's Prayer|pray]] for those who persecute you." (Luke 6:27-28)

Explicit directions in the New Testament text include:

* Jesus' enumeration of the intention of the 10 commandments, contained in the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205-7 sermon on the mount] is considered [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205-7 a key component of Christian ethics and a fundamental recipe for Christian conduct for centuries.]  This large unified text was meant as a counter to the practices of the day that followed the letter of the law but denied the spirit of the law.
* One of the characteristic contrasts between Christianity and its Jewish roots occurs along the axis of "Law". The Christian holds that for un-redeemed mankind it is [[Total depravity|impossible to follow]] any holy law at all, and further holds that only regeneration makes it possible for an individual to start and persist not breaking at least some of the body of holy law.  Within this context falls the only letter from the totality of New Testament authorship to the totality of the Christian church on that topic.  It is also profoundly important to recognize that these are "placeholders" that refer to Old Testament texts which more completely elaborate what each means. Acts 15:24 enumerates the four things that Christianity requires abstinence from: 1) food sacrificed to idols, 2) blood, 3) meat of strangled animals, and 4) sexual immorality. These all were part of the practices included in the [[polytheism]] of Greek and Roman civilizations.

==Modern use in worldwide conservative or center-right politics==
In the 21st century United States, Australia, UK and other countries, the phrases "Christian values" and "[[family values]]" are used by [[Christian right]] and conservative parties to describe some or all of the following political stances:
*[[censorship]] of sexual content, especially in movies and on television.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory D. Black, ''Hollywood Censored'', p. 39. "Daniel Lord drafted a Hollywood censorship code. What emerged was a fascinating combination of conservative politics, Catholic theology, and pop psychology.", Cambridge University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0521452991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the desirability of laws against induced [[abortion]]
*[[sexual abstinence]] outside [[marriage]] and [[abstinence-only sex education]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcongress.nl/en/wcf-ii-geneva-declaration/,"Marriage between a man and a woman forms the sole moral context for natural sexual union. Whether through pornography, promiscuity, incest or homosexuality, deviations from these sexual norms cannot truly satisfy the human spirits."&lt;/ref&gt;
*the promotion of [[intelligent design]] to be taught in public schools and colleges as an alternative to evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Political commentators have noted the rise of the religious right during the presidency of George W. Bush. Though Christianity and politics have often been intertwined in American culture, the Bush administration funded faith-based initiatives more profoundly than any previous president. Moreover, President Bush remarked that he supported the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolutionary theory in public schools." http://connection.ebscohost.com/science/intelligent-design/intelligent-design-movements-us&lt;/ref&gt;
*the desirability of laws against [[same-sex marriage]]
*support for laws against the acceptance of homosexuality into mainstream society&lt;ref&gt;"The Bible clearly condemns homosexuality as a sin and Christians who seriously follow God's Word must also condemn it as sin.", http://carm.org/write-about-homsexuality&lt;/ref&gt;
*the desirability of organized [[school prayer]] in public schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prayer InPublic School - A Brief History|url=http://www.allabouthistory.org/prayer-in-public-school.htm|publisher=AllAboutHistory.org|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use in worldwide liberal or center-left politics==
In the 21st century United States, Australia, UK and other countries, the phrases "Christian values" and "[[family values]]" are used by some liberal or social democratic political groups to describe some or all of the following political stances:
*support for a culture of empathy and [[compassion]], seen as central to Christianity among a diverse range of religions and worldviews; favoring individuals, families (of all compositions) and small communities' interests over the interests of large corporations and the powerful;
*protection of the [[natural environment|environment]] as the product of a deep reverence for God's creation;
*the undesirability of [[war]] other than as a last resort, and a respect for diplomacy (see [[Swords to ploughshares]]);
*embrace inclusion and acceptance of [[immigrants]] and [[refugees]]
*a [[living wage]] for all and the right of workers to form trade unions as keeping with the solidaristic nature of man. 
*a high, progressive income tax to promote greater income equality in keeping with Jesus' words in support of the [[poverty|poor]] and against excessive riches;
*promoting [[Render unto Caesar]] as an endorsement of secular governance [[separation of church and state]] (secular laws do not affect or no relations with religious freedom, such as [[same-sex marriage]], churches can reject holding weddings for same-sex couples) and religious tolerance, consistent with the concept of Christ's kingdom not being "of this world" and warnings against the hunger for potentially corrupting temporal power throughout the Bible.

{{redirect|Compactness}}
[[File:Compact.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|The interval {{math|''A'' {{=}} (−∞, −2]}} is not compact because it is not bounded. The interval {{math|''C'' {{=}} (2, 4)}} is not compact because it is not closed. The interval {{math|''B'' {{=}} [0, 1]}} is compact because it is both closed and bounded.]]
In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[general topology]], '''compactness''' is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of [[Euclidean space]] being [[closed set|closed]] (that is, containing all its [[limit point]]s) and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other). Examples include a [[closed interval]], a [[rectangle]], or a finite set of points. This notion is defined for more general [[topological space]]s than Euclidean space in various ways.

One such generalization is that a topological space is [[sequentially compact|''sequentially'' compact]] if every [[infinite sequence]] of points sampled from the space has an infinite [[subsequence]] that converges to some point of the space. The [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]] states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact in this sequential sense if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, if one chooses an infinite number of points in the ''closed'' [[unit interval]] {{math|[0, 1]}} some of those points will get arbitrarily close to some real number in that space. For instance, some of the numbers {{nowrap|1/2, 4/5, 1/3, 5/6, 1/4, 6/7, &amp;hellip;}} accumulate to 0 (others accumulate to 1). The same set of points would not accumulate to any point of the ''open'' unit interval {{math|(0, 1)}}; so the open unit interval is not compact. Euclidean space itself is not compact since it is not bounded. In particular, the sequence of points {{nowrap|0, 1, 2, 3, …}} has no subsequence that converges to any real number.

Apart from closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space, typical examples of compact spaces include spaces consisting not of geometrical points but of [[function space|functions]]. The term ''compact'' was introduced into mathematics by [[Maurice Fréchet]] in 1904 as a distillation of this concept.  Compactness in this more general situation plays an extremely important role in [[mathematical analysis]], because many classical and important theorems of 19th-century analysis, such as the [[extreme value theorem]], are easily generalized to this situation.  A typical application is furnished by the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] or the [[Peano existence theorem]], in which one is able to conclude the existence of a function with some required properties as a limiting case of some more elementary construction.

Various equivalent notions of compactness, including [[Sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] and [[limit point compact]]ness, can be developed in general [[metric space]]s. In general topological spaces, however, different notions of compactness are not necessarily equivalent. The most useful notion, which is the standard definition of the unqualified term ''compactness'', is phrased in terms of the existence of finite families of [[open set]]s that "[[Cover (topology)|cover]]" the space in the sense that each point of the space lies in some set contained in the family. This more subtle notion, introduced by [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]] in 1929, exhibits compact spaces as generalizations of [[finite set]]s.  In spaces that are compact in this sense, it is often possible to patch together information that holds [[local property|locally]]&amp;mdash;that is, in a neighborhood of each point&amp;mdash;into corresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many [[#Theorems|theorems]] are of this character.

The term '''compact set''' is sometimes a synonym for compact space, but usually refers to a [[#Compactness of subsets|compact subspace]] of a topological space.

== Historical development ==
In the 19th century, several disparate mathematical properties were understood that would later be seen as consequences of compactness.  On the one hand, [[Bernard Bolzano]] ([[#CITEREFBolzano1817|1817]]) had been aware that any bounded sequence of points (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a [[limit point]].  Bolzano's proof relied on the [[method of bisection]]: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected.  The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts until it closes down on the desired limit point.  The full significance of [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem|Bolzano's theorem]], and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by [[Karl Weierstrass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=952–953}}; {{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, it became clear that results similar to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem could be formulated for [[function spaces|spaces of functions]] rather than just numbers or geometrical points. The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of [[Giulio Ascoli]] and [[Cesare Arzelà]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|loc=Chapter 46, §2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The culmination of their investigations, the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]], was a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to families of [[continuous function]]s, the precise conclusion of which was that it was possible to extract a [[uniform convergence|uniformly convergent]] sequence of functions from a suitable family of functions.  The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano's "limit point".  Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzelà and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of [[integral equation]]s, as investigated by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Erhard Schmidt]].  For a certain class of [[Green's function|Green functions]] coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem held in the sense of [[mean convergence]]&amp;mdash;or convergence in what would later be dubbed a [[Hilbert space]].  This ultimately led to the notion of a [[compact operator]] as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space. It was [[Maurice René Fréchet|Maurice Fréchet]] who, in [[#CITEREFFréchet1906|1906]], had distilled the essence of the Bolzano–Weierstrass property and coined the term ''compactness'' to refer to this general phenomenon (he used the term already in his 1904 paper&lt;ref&gt;Frechet, M. 1904. Generalisation d'un theorem de Weierstrass. Analyse Mathematique.&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the famous 1906 thesis).

However, a different notion of compactness altogether had also slowly emerged at the end of the 19th century from the study of the [[linear continuum|continuum]], which was seen as fundamental for the rigorous formulation of analysis.  In 1870, [[Eduard Heine]] showed that a [[continuous function]] defined on a closed and bounded interval was in fact [[uniformly continuous]].  In the course of the proof, he made use of a lemma that from any countable cover of the interval by smaller open intervals, it was possible to select a finite number of these that also covered it. The significance of this lemma was recognized by [[Émile Borel]] ([[#CITEREFBorel1895|1895]]), and it was generalized to arbitrary collections of intervals by [[Pierre Cousin]] (1895) and [[Henri Lebesgue]] ([[#CITEREFLebesgue1904|1904]]).  The [[Heine–Borel theorem]], as the result is now known, is another special property possessed by closed and bounded sets of real numbers.

This property was significant because it allowed for the passage from [[local property|local information]] about a set (such as the continuity of a function) to global information about the set (such as the uniform continuity of a function).  This sentiment was expressed by {{harvtxt|Lebesgue|1904}}, who also exploited it in the development of the [[Lebesgue integral|integral now bearing his name]].  Ultimately the Russian school of [[point-set topology]], under the direction of [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Urysohn]], formulated Heine–Borel compactness in a way that could be applied to the modern notion of a [[topological space]].  {{harvtxt|Alexandrov|Urysohn|1929}} showed that the earlier version of compactness due to Fréchet, now called (relative) [[sequential compactness]], under appropriate conditions followed from the version of compactness that was formulated in terms of the existence of finite subcovers.  It was this notion of compactness that became the dominant one, because it was not only a stronger property, but it could be formulated in a more general setting with a minimum of additional technical machinery, as it relied only on the structure of the open sets in a space.
&lt;!--
One of the main reasons for studying compact spaces is because they are in some ways very similar to [[finite set]]s: there are many results which are easy to show for finite sets, whose proofs carry over with minimal change to compact spaces. Here is an example:

* Suppose ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space]], and we have a point ''x'' in ''X'' and a finite subset ''A'' of ''X'' not containing ''x''. Then we can [[separated sets|separate]] ''x'' and ''A'' by [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhoods]]: for each ''a'' in ''A'', let ''U''(''x'') and ''V''(''a'') be disjoint neighborhoods containing ''x'' and ''a'', respectively. Then the intersection of all the ''U''(''x'') and the union of all the ''V''(''a'') are the required neighborhoods of ''x'' and ''A''.

Note that if ''A'' is [[Infinity|infinite]], the proof fails, because the intersection of arbitrarily many neighborhoods of ''x'' might not be a neighborhood of ''x''. The proof can be "rescued", however, if ''A'' is compact: we simply take a finite subcover of the cover {{math|{''V''(''a'') : ''a'' ∈ A}}} of ''A'', then intersect the corresponding finitely many ''U''(''x''). In this way, we see that in a Hausdorff space, any point can be separated by neighborhoods from any compact set not containing it. In fact, repeating the argument shows that any two disjoint compact sets in a Hausdorff space can be separated by neighborhoods&amp;nbsp;– note that this is precisely what we get if we replace "point" (i.e. [[singleton set]]) with "compact set" in the Hausdorff [[separation axiom]]. Many of the arguments and results involving compact spaces follow such a pattern.

==Basic examples==
Any [[finite topological space|finite space]] is trivially compact. A non-trivial example of a compact space is the (closed) [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}} of [[real number]]s.  If one chooses an infinite number of distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some [[accumulation point]] in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence {{nowrap|1, 1/2, 1/3, 3/4, 1/5, 5/6, 1/7, 7/8, ...}} get arbitrarily close to&amp;nbsp;0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to&amp;nbsp;1.  The given example sequence shows the importance of including the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] points of the interval, since the [[limit point]]s must be in the space itself — an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be [[bounded set|bounded]], since in the interval {{closed-open|0,∞}} one could choose the sequence of points {{nowrap|0, 1, 2, 3, ...}}, of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.

In two dimensions, closed [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] are compact since for any infinite number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary.  However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior.  Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can tend to the missing point, thereby not getting arbitrarily close to any point ''within'' the space.  Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of equally-spaced points in any given direction without approaching any point.

==Definitions==
Various definitions of compactness may apply, depending on the level of generality.  A subset of [[Euclidean space]] in particular is called compact if it is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]].  This implies, by the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]], that any infinite [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] from the set has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in the set.  Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as [[sequential compactness]] and [[limit point compact]]ness, can be developed in general [[metric space]]s.

In general [[topological space]]s, however, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent, and the most useful notion of compactness&amp;mdash;originally called ''bicompactness''&amp;mdash;is defined using [[cover (topology)|cover]]s consisting of [[open set]]s (see ''Open cover definition'' below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known [[local property|locally]]&amp;mdash;in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of each point of the space&amp;mdash;and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space.  An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is [[uniformly continuous]]; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.

===Open cover definition===

Formally, a [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}} is called ''compact'' if each of its [[open cover]]s has a [[finite set|finite]] [[subcover]]. That is, {{mvar|X}} is compact if for every collection {{mvar|C}} of open subsets of {{mvar|X}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;X = \bigcup_{x \in C}x&lt;/math&gt;,

there is a '''finite''' subset {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|C}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;X = \bigcup_{x \in F}x.&lt;/math&gt;

Some branches of mathematics such as [[algebraic geometry]], typically influenced by the French school of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], use the term ''quasi-compact'' for the general notion, and reserve the term ''compact'' for topological spaces that are both [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and ''quasi-compact''.  A compact set is sometimes referred to as a ''compactum'', plural ''compacta''.

===Compactness of subsets===
A subset {{mvar|K}} of a topological space {{mvar|X}} is said to be compact if it is compact as a subspace (in the [[subspace topology]]).  That is, {{mvar|K}} is compact if for every arbitrary collection {{mvar|C}} of open subsets of {{mvar|X}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;K \subseteq \bigcup_{c \in C} c&lt;/math&gt;,

there is a '''finite''' subset {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|C}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;K \subseteq \bigcup_{c \in F} c&lt;/math&gt;.

Compactness is a "topological" property. That is, if &lt;math&gt;K \subset Z \subset Y&lt;/math&gt;, with subset {{mvar|Z}} equipped with the subspace topology, then {{mvar|K}} is compact in {{mvar|Z}} if and only if {{mvar|K}} is compact in {{mvar|Y}}.

===Equivalent definitions===
Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the following are equivalent:
# A topological space ''X''  is compact.
# Every [[open cover]] of ''X'' has a finite [[subcover]].
# ''X'' has a sub-base such that every cover of the space by members of the sub-base has a finite subcover ([[Alexander's sub-base theorem]])
# Any collection of closed subsets of ''X'' with the [[finite intersection property]] has nonempty intersection.
# Every [[Net (mathematics)|net]] on ''X'' has a convergent subnet (see the article on [[Net (mathematics)|nets]] for a proof).
# Every [[mathematical filter|filter]] on ''X'' has a convergent refinement.
# Every net on ''X'' has a cluster point.
# Every filter on ''X'' has a cluster point.
# Every [[ultrafilter]] on ''X'' converges to at least one point.
# Every infinite subset of ''X'' has a [[complete accumulation point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kelley|1955|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Euclidean space====
For any [[subset]] ''A'' of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A'' is compact if and only if it is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]]; this is the [[Heine–Borel theorem]].

As a [[Euclidean space]] is a metric space, the conditions in the next subsection also apply to all of its subsets. Of all of the equivalent conditions, it is in practice easiest to verify that a subset is closed and bounded, for example, for a closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] or closed ''n''-ball.

====Metric spaces====
For any metric space (''X'', ''d''), the following are equivalent:
# (''X'', ''d'') is compact.
# (''X'', ''d'') is [[completeness (topology)|complete]] and [[totally bounded]] (this is also equivalent to compactness for [[uniform space]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.3.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (''X'', ''d'') is sequentially compact; that is, every [[sequence]] in ''X'' has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in ''X'' (this is also equivalent to compactness for [[first-countable]] [[uniform space]]s).
# (''X'', ''d'') is limit point compact; that is, every infinite subset of ''X'' has at least one [[limit point]] in ''X''.
# (''X'', ''d'') is an image of a continuous function from the [[Cantor set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willard|1970}} Theorem 30.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A compact metric space (''X'', ''d'') also satisfies the following properties:
# [[Lebesgue's number lemma]]: For every open cover of ''X'', there exists a number {{nowrap|''δ'' &gt; 0}} such that every subset of ''X'' of diameter &lt; ''δ'' is contained in some member of the cover.
# (''X'', ''d'') is [[second-countable space|second-countable]], [[Separable space|separable]] and [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] – these three conditions are equivalent for metric spaces. The converse is not true; e.g., a countable discrete space satisfies these three conditions, but is not compact.
# ''X'' is closed and bounded (as a subset of any metric space whose restricted metric is ''d''). The converse may fail for a non-Euclidean space; e.g. the [[real line]] equipped with the [[discrete metric]] is closed and bounded but not compact, as the collection of all [[Singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. It is complete but not totally bounded.

====Characterization by continuous functions====
Let ''X'' be a topological space and C(''X'') the ring of real continuous functions on ''X''.  For each ''p''&amp;isin;''X'', the evaluation map &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ev}_p\colon C(X)\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
given by ev&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'')=''f''(''p'') is a ring homomorphism.  The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ev&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[maximal ideal]], since the [[residue field]] {{nowrap|C(''X'')/ker ev&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the field of real numbers, by the [[first isomorphism theorem]].  A topological space ''X'' is [[pseudocompact space|pseudocompact]] if and only if every maximal ideal in C(''X'') has residue field the real numbers.  For [[completely regular space]]s, this is equivalent to every maximal ideal being the kernel of an evaluation homomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillman|Jerison|1976|loc=§5.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are pseudocompact spaces that are not compact, though.

In general, for non-pseudocompact spaces there are always maximal ideals ''m'' in C(''X'') such that the residue field C(''X'')/''m'' is a ([[non-archimedean field|non-archimedean]]) [[hyperreal field]].  The framework of [[non-standard analysis]] allows for the following alternative characterization of compactness:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson||loc=Theorem 4.1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a topological space ''X'' is compact if and only if every point ''x'' of the natural extension ''*X'' is [[infinitesimal|infinitely close]] to a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' (more precisely, ''x'' is contained in the [[monad (non-standard analysis)|monad]] of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

====Hyperreal definition====
A space ''X'' is compact if its [[hyperreal number|hyperreal extension]] ''*X'' (constructed, for example, by the [[ultrapower construction]]) has the property that every point of ''*X'' is infinitely close to some point of ''X''⊂''*X''. For example, an open real interval {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} (0, 1)}} is not compact because its hyperreal extension *(0,1) contains infinitesimals, which are infinitely close to 0, which is not a point of ''X''.

== Properties of compact spaces ==

===Functions and compact spaces===
A [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] image of a compact space is compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.2}}; See also {{planetmathref|id=4689|title=Compactness is preserved under a continuous map}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implies the [[extreme value theorem]]: a continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Corollary 5.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Slightly more generally, this is true for an upper semicontinuous function.) As a sort of converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a [[proper map]] is compact.

===Compact spaces and set operations===
A closed subset of a compact space is compact,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|loc=Theorem 5.2.3}}; {{planetmathref|id=4177|title=Closed set in a compact space is compact}}; {{planetmathref|id=4691|title=Closed subsets of a compact set are compact}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a finite union of compact sets is compact.

The [[product topology|product]] of any collection of compact spaces is compact. (This is [[Tychonoff's theorem]], which is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].)

Every topological space ''X'' is an open [[dense topological subspace|dense subspace]] of a compact space having at most one point more than ''X'', by the [[Compactification (mathematics)|Alexandroff one-point compactification]].  By the same construction, every [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space ''X'' is an open dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space having at most one point more than ''X''.

===Ordered compact spaces===
A nonempty compact subset of the [[real number]]s has a greatest element and a least element.

Let ''X'' be a [[total order|simply ordered]] set endowed with the [[order topology]]. Then ''X'' is compact if and only if ''X'' is a [[complete lattice]] (i.e. all subsets have suprema and infima).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steen|Seebach|1995|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* Any [[finite topological space]], including the [[empty set]], is compact.  More generally, any space with a [[finite topology]] (only finitely many open sets) is compact; this includes in particular the [[trivial topology]].
* Any space carrying the [[cofinite topology]] is compact.
* Any [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space can be turned into a compact space by adding a single point to it, by means of [[Alexandroff one-point compactification]]. The one-point compactification of '''R''' is homeomorphic to the circle '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; the one-point compactification of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is homeomorphic to the sphere '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Using the one-point compactification, one can also easily construct compact spaces which are not Hausdorff, by starting with a non-Hausdorff space.
* The [[right order topology]] or [[left order topology]] on any bounded [[totally ordered set]] is compact. In particular, [[Sierpiński space]] is compact.
* No [[discrete space]] with an infinite number of points is compact. The collection of all [[Singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. Finite discrete spaces are compact.
* In '''R''' carrying the [[lower limit topology]], no uncountable set is compact.
* In the [[cocountable topology]] on an uncountable set, no infinite set is compact. Like the previous example, the space as a whole is not [[locally compact]] but is still [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]].
* The closed [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}} is compact. This follows from the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. The open interval {{open-open|0,1}} is not compact: the [[open cover]] &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{1}{n}, 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right )&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|1={{mvar|n}} = 3, 4, … }} does not have a finite subcover. Similarly, the set of ''[[rational numbers]]'' in the closed interval {{closed-closed|0,1}} is not compact: the sets of rational numbers in the intervals &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\frac{1}{\pi}-\frac{1}{n}\right] \ \text{and} \ \left[\frac{1}{\pi}+\frac{1}{n},1\right]&lt;/math&gt; cover all the rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] for {{math|1={{mvar|n}} = 4, 5, ... }} but this cover does not have a finite subcover. Here, the sets are open in the subspace topology even though they are not open as subsets of&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.
* The set '''R''' of all real numbers is not compact as there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals {{open-open|{{mvar|n}}−1, {{mvar|n}}+1}} , where {{mvar|n}} takes all integer values in '''Z''', cover '''R''' but there is no finite subcover.
* On the other hand, the [[extended real number line]] carrying the analogous topology ''is'' compact; note that the cover described above would never reach the points at infinity.  In fact, the set has the [[homeomorphism]] to [-1,1] of mapping each infinity to its corresponding unit and every real number to its sign multiplied by the unique number in the positive part of interval that results in its absolute value when divided by one minus itself, and since homeomorphisms preserve covers, the Heine-Borel property can be inferred.
* For every [[natural number]] {{mvar|n}}, the [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]] is compact. Again from the Heine–Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional [[normed vector space]] is compact. This is not true for infinite dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its [[closed unit ball]] is compact.
* On the other hand, the closed unit ball of the dual of a normed space is compact for the weak-* topology. ([[Alaoglu's theorem]])
* The [[Cantor set]] is compact. In fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.
* Consider the set ''K'' of all functions ''f'' : '''R''' → [0,1] from the real number line to the closed unit interval, and define a topology on ''K'' so that a sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f_n\}&lt;/math&gt; in ''K'' converges towards &lt;math&gt;f\in K&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{f_n(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; converges towards ''f''(''x'') for all real numbers ''x''. There is only one such topology; it is called the topology of [[pointwise convergence]] or the [[product topology]]. Then ''K'' is a compact topological space; this follows from the [[Tychonoff theorem]].
* Consider the set ''K'' of all functions ''f''&amp;nbsp;: {{closed-closed|0,1}}&amp;nbsp;→ {{closed-closed|0,1}} satisfying the [[Lipschitz condition]] |''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''(''y'')|&amp;nbsp;≤ |''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y''| for all ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{{closed-closed|0,1}}.  Consider on ''K''&amp;thinsp; the metric induced by the [[uniform convergence|uniform distance]] &lt;math&gt;d(f,g)=\sup_{x \in [0, 1]} |f(x)-g(x)|.&lt;/math&gt; Then by [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] the space ''K'' is compact.
* The [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of any [[bounded linear operator]] on a [[Banach space]] is a nonempty compact subset of the [[complex number]]s '''C'''. Conversely, any compact subset of '''C''' arises in this manner, as the spectrum of some bounded linear operator. For instance, a diagonal operator on the Hilbert space [[sequence spaces#ℓp spaces|&lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt;]] may have any compact nonempty subset of '''C''' as spectrum.

=== Algebraic examples ===
* [[Compact group]]s such as an [[orthogonal group]] are compact, while groups such as a [[general linear group]] are not.
* Since the [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic integers]] are [[homeomorphic]] to the Cantor set, they form a compact set.
* The [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of any [[commutative ring]] with the [[Zariski topology]] (that is, the set of all prime ideals) is compact, but never [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (except in trivial cases). In algebraic geometry, such topological spaces are examples of quasi-compact [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], "quasi" referring to the non-Hausdorff nature of the topology.
* The [[spectrum of a boolean algebra|spectrum of a Boolean algebra]] is compact, a fact which is part of the [[Stone representation theorem]]. [[Stone space]]s, compact [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] Hausdorff spaces, form the abstract framework in which these spectra are studied.  Such spaces are also useful in the study of [[profinite group]]s.
* The [[structure space]] of a commutative unital [[Banach algebra]] is a compact Hausdorff space.
* The [[Hilbert cube]] is compact, again a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem.
* A [[profinite group]] (e.g., Galois group) is compact.

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], a '''complete Heyting algebra''' is a [[Heyting algebra]] that is [[completeness (order theory)|complete]] as a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. Complete Heyting algebras are the [[object (category theory)|objects]] of three different [[category (category theory)|categories]]; the category '''CHey''', the category '''Loc''' of locales, and its [[opposite (category theory)|opposite]], the category '''Frm''' of frames. Although these three categories contain the same  objects, they differ in their [[morphism]]s, and thus get distinct names. Only the morphisms of '''CHey''' are [[homomorphism]]s of complete Heyting algebras.

Locales and frames form the foundation of [[pointless topology]], which, instead of building on [[point-set topology]], recasts the ideas of [[general topology]] in categorical terms, as statements on frames and locales.

== Definition ==
Consider a [[partially ordered set]] (''P'', ≤) that is a [[complete lattice]]. Then ''P'' is a ''complete Heyting algebra'' if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
* ''P'' is a Heyting algebra, i.e. the operation {{nowrap|1=( ''x'' &amp;and; &amp;minus; )}} has a [[Adjoint functors|right adjoint]] (also called the lower adjoint of a (monotone) [[Galois connection]]), for each element ''x'' of ''P''.
* For all elements ''x'' of ''P'' and all subsets ''S'' of ''P'', the following infinite [[distributivity (order theory)|distributivity]] law holds:
: &lt;math&gt;x \wedge \bigvee_{s \in S} s = \bigvee_{s \in S} (x \wedge s).&lt;/math&gt;
* ''P'' is a distributive lattice, i.e., for all ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in ''P'', we have
: &lt;math&gt;x \wedge ( y \vee z ) = ( x \wedge y ) \vee ( x \wedge z )&lt;/math&gt;

: and the meet operations {{nowrap|1=( ''x'' &amp;and; &amp;minus; )}} are [[Scott continuous]] for all ''x'' in ''P'' (i.e., preserve the suprema of [[directed set]]s) .

==Examples==
The system of all open sets of a given [[topological space]] ordered by inclusion is a complete Heyting algebra.

== Frames and locales ==
The [[object (category theory)|objects]] of the category '''CHey''', the category '''Frm''' of frames and the category '''Loc''' of locales are the complete lattices satisfying the infinite distributive law. These categories differ in what constitutes a [[morphism]].

The morphisms of '''Frm''' are (necessarily [[monotonic|monotone]]) functions that [[limit preserving function (order theory)|preserve]] finite meets and arbitrary joins. Such functions are not homomorphisms of complete Heyting algebras.  The definition of Heyting algebras crucially involves the existence of right adjoints to the binary meet operation, which together define an additional [[implication operation]] ⇒. Thus, a ''homomorphism of complete Heyting algebras'' is a morphism of frames that in addition preserves implication. The morphisms of '''Loc''' are [[dual (category theory)|opposite]] to those of '''Frm''', and they are usually called maps (of locales).

The relation of locales and their maps to topological spaces and continuous functions may be seen as follows. Let
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;
be any map. The [[power set]]s ''P''(''X'') and ''P''(''Y'') are [[complete Boolean algebra]]s, and the map
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon P(Y)\to P(X)&lt;/math&gt;
is a homomorphism of complete Boolean algebras. Suppose the spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[topological space]]s, endowed with the topology ''O''(''X'') and ''O''(''Y'') of [[open set]]s on ''X'' and ''Y''. Note that ''O''(''X'') and ''O''(''Y'') are subframes of ''P''(''X'') and ''P''(''Y''). If ''ƒ'' is a continuous function, then
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon O(Y)\to O(X)&lt;/math&gt;
preserves finite meets and arbitrary joins of these subframes.  This shows that ''O'' is a [[functor]] from the category '''Top''' of topological spaces to the category '''Loc''' of locales, taking any continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;
to the map
: &lt;math&gt;O(f)\colon O(X)\to O(Y)&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''' that is defined in '''Frm''' to be the inverse image frame homomorphism
: &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\colon O(Y)\to O(X).&lt;/math&gt;
It is common, given a map of locales
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''', to write
: &lt;math&gt;f^{*}\colon B\to A&lt;/math&gt;
for the frame homomorphism that defines it in '''Frm'''. Hence, using this notation, ''O''(''ƒ'') is defined by the equation {{nowrap|1=''O''(''&amp;fnof;'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

Conversely, any locale ''A'' has a topological space ''S''(''A'') that best approximates the locale, called its ''spectrum''. In addition, any map of locales
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt;
determines a continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;S(A)\to S(B),&lt;/math&gt;
and this assignment is functorial: letting ''P''(1) denote the locale that is obtained as the powerset of the terminal set {{nowrap|1=1 = { * },}} the points of ''S''(''A'') are the maps
: &lt;math&gt;p\colon P(1)\to A&lt;/math&gt;
in '''Loc''', i.e., the frame homomorphisms
: &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon A\to P(1).&lt;/math&gt;
For each {{nowrap|1=''a'' &amp;isin; ''A''}} we define the set {{nowrap|1=''U&lt;sub&gt;a''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sube; ''S''(''A'')}} that consists of the points {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''S''(''A'')}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p''*(''a'') = { * }.}} It is easy to verify that this defines a frame homomorphism {{nowrap|1=''A'' &amp;rarr; ''P''(''S''(''A'')),}} whose image is therefore a topology on ''S''(''A''). Then, if
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is a map of locales,
to each point {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''S''(''A'')}} we assign the point ''S''(''ƒ'')(''q'') defined by letting ''S''(''ƒ'')(p)* be the composition of ''p''* with ''ƒ''*, hence obtaining a continuous map
: &lt;math&gt;S(f)\colon S(A)\to S(B).&lt;/math&gt;

This defines a functor &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; from '''Loc''' to '''Top''', which is right adjoint to ''O''.

Any locale that is isomorphic to the topology of its spectrum is called ''spatial'', and any topological space that is homeomorphic to the spectrum of its locale of open sets is called ''sober''. The adjunction between topological spaces and locales restricts to an [[equivalence of categories]] between sober spaces and spatial locales.

Any function that preserves all joins (and hence any frame homomorphism) has a right adjoint, and, conversely, any function that preserves all meets has a left adjoint. Hence, the category '''Loc''' is isomorphic to the category whose objects are the frames and whose morphisms are the meet preserving functions whose left adjoints preserve finite meets. This is often regarded as a representation of '''Loc''', but it should not be confused with '''Loc''' itself, whose morphisms are formally the same as frame homomorphisms in the opposite direction.

{{Expert-subject|philosophy|WikiProject|talk=Major inadequacies -- For the intrepid expert|reason=the article does not provide an adequate portrayal of the philosophical literature on this issue|date=March 2015}}
{{one source|talk=Single source|date=June 2017}}

In [[epistemology]], '''criteria of truth''' (or '''tests of truth''') are standards and rules used to judge the accuracy of statements and claims. They are tools of verification. Understanding a [[philosophy]]'s criteria of [[truth]] is fundamental to a clear evaluation of that philosophy. This necessity is driven by the varying, and conflicting, claims of different philosophies. The rules of [[logic]] have no ability to distinguish truth on their own. An individual must determine what standards distinguish truth from [[Falsity|falsehood]]. Not all criteria are equally valid. Some standards are sufficient, while others are questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=William|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|year=1993|title= Ideas of the Great Philosophers|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=1-56619-271-4|pages=3&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria listed represent those most commonly used by scholars and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Dolhenty states there seem to be only three functional, effective tests of truth. He lists these as the correspondence, coherence and pragmatic [[theories of truth]].&lt;ref name="dolhenty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoralliberal.com/theradicalacademy/2011/08/17/truth-and-certainty/ |title=Truth and Certainty |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Dolhenty |first=Jonathan |work= The Problem of Knowledge: A brief introduction to epistemology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority==
{{See also|Appeal to authority}}
The opinions of those with significant experience, highly trained or possessing an advanced degree are often considered a form of [[logical argument|proof]]. Their [[knowledge]] and familiarity within a given field or area of knowledge command respect and allow their statements to be criteria of truth. A person may not simply declare themselves an authority, but rather must be properly qualified. Despite the wide respect given to [[expert testimony]], it is not an infallible criterion. For example, multiple authorities may conflict in their claims and conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coherence==
{{See also|Coherence theory of truth}}
Coherence refers to a consistent and overarching explanation for all facts. To be coherent, all pertinent facts must be arranged in a consistent and cohesive fashion as an integrated whole. The theory that most effectively reconciles all facts in this fashion may be considered most likely to be true. Coherence is the most potentially effective test of truth because it most adequately addresses all elements. The main limitation lies not in the standard, but in the [[fallibility|human inability]] to acquire all facts of an experience. Only an [[omniscient]] mind could be aware of all of the relevant information. A scholar must accept this limitation and accept as true the most coherent explanation for the available facts. Coherence is difficult to dispute as a criterion of truth, since arguing against coherence is validating incoherence, which is inherently illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consensus gentium==
{{See also|Argumentum ad populum}}
Some view opinions held by all people to be valid criteria of truth. According to ''consensus gentium'', the universal consent of all mankind, all humans holding a distinct belief proves it is true. There is some value in the criterion if it means innate truth, such as the laws of logic and [[mathematics]]. If it merely means agreement, as in a unanimous vote, its value is questionable. For example, general assent once held the [[flat earth|earth was flat]] and that the [[geocentricism|sun revolved about the earth]].&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p7&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency (mere)==
Mere [[Consistency proof|consistency]] is when correct statements do not contradict, but are not necessarily related. Accordingly, an individual is consistent if he does not contradict himself. It is inadequate as a criterion because it treats facts in an isolated fashion without true cohesion and integration; nevertheless it remains a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] for the truth of any argument, owing to the [[law of noncontradiction]]. The value of a proof largely lies in its ability to reconcile individual facts into a coherent whole.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p10&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency (strict)==
Strict consistency is when claims are connected in such a fashion that one statement follows from another. [[Formal system|Formal logic]] and mathematical rules are examples of rigorous consistency. An example would be: [[multiple modus ponens|if all As are Bs and all Bs are Cs, then all As are Cs]]. While this standard is of high value, it is limited. For example, the premises are ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (or self-apparent), requiring another test of truth to employ this criterion. Additionally, strict consistency may produce results lacking coherence and completeness. While a philosophical system may demonstrate rigorous consistency with the facts it considers, all facts must be taken into consideration for an adequate criterion of truth, regardless of their detriment to any given system.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p10/&gt;

==Correspondence==
{{See also|Correspondence theory of truth}}
{{See also|Scientific method}}
Correspondence is quite simply when a claim corresponds with its object. For example, the claim that the White House is in Washington, D.C. is true, if the White House is actually located in Washington. Correspondence is held by many philosophers to be the most valid of the criteria of truth. An idea that corresponds to its object is indeed true, but determining if the correspondence is perfect requires additional tests of truth. This indicates that correspondence is a perfectly valid ''definition'' of truth, but is not of itself a valid criterion of truth. An additional test beyond this "definition" is required to determine the precise degree of similarity between what is posited and what exists in [[objective reality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Custom==
Most people consciously or unknowingly employ [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] as a criterion of truth, based on the assumption that doing what is customary will prevent error. It is particularly applied in the determination of moral truth and reflected in the statement "when in Rome, do as the Romans do". People stick closely to the principle of custom when they use common vernacular, wear common fashions and so forth; essentially, when they do what is [[Mainstream (terminology)|popular]]. Custom is not considered a serious, or valid, test of truth. For example, public opinion polls do not determine truth.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p4&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotions==
Many people allow feelings to determine judgment, often in the face of contrary evidence or without even attempting to collect evidence and facts. They are implicitly accepting [[emotions]] as a criterion of truth. Most people will admit that feelings are not an adequate test for truth. For example, a seasoned businessman will put aside his emotions and search for the best available facts when making an investment. Similarly, scholars are trained to put aside such [[Qualia|subjective]] judgments when evaluating knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions are real, however, and thus must be considered within any social scientific system of coherence.

==Instinct==
The existence of distinct [[instinct]]s has long been debated. Proponents of instinct argue that we eat because of hunger, drink because of thirst, and so forth. Some have even argued for the existence of God based on this criterion, arguing that the object of every instinct has a referent in reality. The counterpoint of hunger is food; for thirst it is liquid; for the sex drive it is a mate. Instincts are not accepted as a reliable test because they are most often indistinct, variant and difficult to define. Additionally, universal instincts are so few that they offer little to the greater body of philosophy as a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 5&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intuition==
[[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] is an assumed truth with an unknown, or possibly unexamined, source. It is a judgment that is not dependent on a [[Rationality|rational]] examination of the facts. It is usually experienced as a sudden sensation and/or rush of thoughts that feel "right". Many persons experience intuitive epiphanies which later prove to be true. Scholars have sometimes come upon valid theories and proofs while daydreaming or otherwise mentally occupied with something bearing no apparent relationship to the truth they seek to reveal. Intuition is at best a source for truths, rather than a criterion with which to evaluate them. Intuitive knowledge requires testing by means of other criteria of truth in order to confirm its accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Majority rule==
[[Majority rule]] is a statistical method of accepting assertions and proposals. In [[democracy|democratic systems]], majority rule is used to determine group decisions, particularly those relating to personal [[morality]] and [[social behavior]]. Some systems divided into several oppositional factions may depend on mere [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]. While majority rule may make for a good democratic system, it is a poor determinant of truth, subject to the criticisms of the broad version of ''[[consensus gentium]]''.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p7/&gt;

==Naïve realism==
[[Naïve realism]] posits that only that which is directly observable by the [[human senses]] is true. First-hand observation determines the truth or falsity of a given statement. Naïve Realism is an insufficient criterion of truth. A host of natural phenomena are demonstrably true, but not observable by the unaided sense. For example, Naïve Realism would deny the existence of [[ultrasound|sounds beyond the range of human hearing]] and the existence of [[x-rays]]. Similarly, there are a number of sense experiments which show a disconnect between the perceived sensation and the reality of its cause.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatic==
{{See also|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{See also|Scientific method}}
If an idea works then it must be true, to the Pragmatist. The consequences of applying a concept reveal its [[truth value]] upon examination of the results. The full meaning of an idea is self-apparent in its application. For example, the therapeutic value and effect of penicillin in relation to infections is proven in its administration. Although [[Pragmatism]] is considered a valuable criterion, it must be used with caution and reservation, due to its potential for false positives. For example, a doctor may prescribe a patient medication for an illness, but it could later turn out that a placebo is equally effective. Thus, untrue concepts could appear to be working contrary to the purpose of the pragmatic test. However, it has validity as a test, particularly in the form [[William Ernest Hocking]] called "Negative Pragmatism". In essence, it states that ideas that do not work cannot possibly be true, though ideas which do work may or may not be true.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas of the Great Philosophers'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelation==
The principal distinction between intuition and [[revelation]] is that revelation has an assumed source: [[God]] (or another higher power). Revelation may be defined as truth emanating from God. Many [[religion]]s fundamentally rely on revelation as a test of truth. This criterion is subject to the same criticisms as intuition. It may be a valid reference of truth for an individual, but it is inadequate for providing a coherent proof of the knowledge to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time==
Time is a criterion commonly appealed to in debate, often referred to as "[[the test of time]]". This criterion posits that over time erroneous beliefs and logical errors will be revealed, while if the belief is true, the mere passage of time cannot adversely affect its [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Time is an inadequate test for truth, since it is subject to similar flaws as custom and tradition (which are simply specific variations of the time factor). Many demonstrably false beliefs have endured for centuries and even millennia (e.g. [[vitalism]]). It is commonly rejected as a valid criterion. For example, most people will not convert to another faith simply because the other religion is centuries (or even millennia) older than their current beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 4&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition==
[[Tradition]], closely related to custom, is the standard stating that which is held for generations is true. Those accepting tradition argue that ideas gaining the loyalty multiple generations possesses a measure of credibility. Tradition possesses many of the same failings as custom. It is possible for falsehoods to be passed down from generation to generation, since tradition generally emphasizes repetition over [[critical thinking|critical evaluation]].&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p4/&gt;

'''Disappointment''' is the feeling of [[dissatisfaction]] that follows the failure of expectations or [[hope]]s to manifest. Similar to [[regret (emotion)|regret]], it differs in that a person who feels regret focuses primarily on the personal choices that contributed to a poor outcome, while a person feeling disappointment focuses on the outcome itself.&lt;ref name="Regret"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, David E. |title=Putting a premium on regret |journal=Management Science |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=117–20 |date=January 1985 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.31.1.117 |jstor=2631680}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a source of psychological [[stress (biological)|stress]].&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;Ma, Lybi.

Disappointment is a subjective response related to anticipated rewards. Disappointment recovery time can vary among people. For some it can take a few minutes while for some it can take a few days.

Disappointment, and an inability to prepare for it, has also been hypothesized as the source of occasional [[immune system]] compromise in [[optimism|optimists]].&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;Schwartz, Todd.

Retrieved 22 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; they may alternatively exhibit less immunity when under prolonged or uncontrollable stress, a phenomenon which researchers have attributed to the "disappointment effect".&lt;ref name="Todd"/&gt; The "disappointment effect" posits that optimists do not utilize "emotional cushioning" to prepare for disappointment and hence are less able to deal with it when they experience it.&lt;ref name="Jill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grohol, John M.

Retrieved 22 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This disappointment effect has been challenged since the mid-1990s by researcher [[Suzanne Segerstrom]], who has published, alone and in accord, several articles evaluating its plausibility.

In 1994, [[psychotherapist]] [[Ian Craib]] published the book ''The Importance of Disappointment'', in which he drew on the works of [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] in advancing the theory that disappointment-avoidant culture—particularly [[Psychotherapy|therapy]] culture—provides false expectations of perfection in life and prevents people from achieving a healthy [[self-concept|self-identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Seale  | first = Clive  | title = Media and Health | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc | year = 2002  | location = London  | pages=167, 242 | isbn = 0-7619-4730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craib offered as two examples [[Lawsuit|litigious]] victims of [[Malpractice|medical mistakes]], who once would have accepted accidents as a course of life, and people suffering [[grief]] following the death of a loved one who, he said, are provided a false [[Kübler-Ross model|stage model of recovery]] that is more designed to comfort bereavement therapists than the bereaved.&lt;ref&gt;Seale, p. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacanians]] considered childhood disappointment essential to entry into the [[The Symbolic|symbolic world of culture]];&lt;ref&gt;W.

[[File:Untitled (Disappointed).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Untitled - Woman with a peacock'' (1919), by [[Jogesh Chandra Seal]]]]

Disappointment theory, pioneered in the mid-1980s by [[David E. Bell]] with further development by [[Graham Loomes]] and [[Robert Sugden (economist)|Robert Sugden]],&lt;ref name="INSEAD"&gt;[http://knowledge.insead.edu/abstract.cfm?ct=15268 "Disappointment Without Prior Expectation Cause and Affect" - Understanding emotion in decisions under risk] [[INSEAD]] (2005). Retrieved 22/02/08.&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around the notion that people contemplating [[risk]]s are disappointed when the outcome of the risk is not evaluated as positively as the expected outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Delquié, Philippe  |author2=Alessandra Cillo |title=Disappointment without prior expectation: a unifying perspective on decision under risk |journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=197–215 |date=December 2006 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/8206761u7760120x/ |doi=10.1007/s11166-006-0499-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disappointment theory has been utilized in examining such diverse decision-making processes as return [[Emigration|migration]], taxpayer compliance and customer willingness to pay.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://ciep.itam.mx/~cuecuecha/Whydopeople2.pdf Why Do People Go Home Again?

Disappointed individuals focus on "upward counterfactuals"—alternative outcomes that would have been better than the one actually experienced—to the point that even positive outcomes may result in disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartz, Alan |chapter=Expected feelings about risky options |editor=Moore, Simon |title=Emotional Cognition: From Brain to Behavior (Advances in Consciousness Research, 44) |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Co |location= |year=2002 |pages=183–96 |isbn=1-58811-224-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example, supplied by Bell, concerns a [[lottery]] win of $10,000.00, an event which will theoretically be perceived more positively if that amount represents the highest possible win in the lottery than if it represents the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, David E. |title=Disappointment in Decision Making under Uncertainty |journal=Operations Research |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |date=Jan–Feb 1985 |doi=10.1287/opre.33.1.1 |jstor=170863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision analysts operate on the assumption that individuals will anticipate the potential for disappointment and make decisions that are less likely to lead to the experience of this feeling.&lt;ref name="INSEAD"/&gt; Disappointment aversion has been posited as one explanation for the [[Allais paradox]], a problematic response in [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility theory]] wherein people prove more likely to choose a certain reward than to risk a greater reward while at the same time being willing to attempt a greater reward with lower [[probability]] when both options include some risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jianmin Jia |author2=James S.

While earlier developers of disappointment theory focused on anticipated outcomes, more recent examinations by Philippe Delquié and Alessandra Cillo of [[INSEAD]] have focused on the impact of later disappointment resulting when an actual outcome comes to be regarded negatively based on further development; for example, if a person receives higher than expected [[Gain (finance)|gains]] in the [[stock market]], she may be [[Happiness|elated]] until she discovers a week later that she could have gained much more [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] if she had waited a few more days to sell.&lt;ref name="INSEAD"/&gt; This experience of disappointment may influence subsequent behavior, and, the analysts state, an incorporation of such variables into disappointment theory may enhance the study of [[Behavioral economics|behavioral finance]].&lt;ref name="INSEAD"/&gt; Disappointment is, along with regret, measured by direct questioning of respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marcatto, Francesco  |author2=Donatella Ferrante |title=The Regret and Disappointment Scale: An instrument for assessing regret and disappointment in decision making |journal=Judgment and Decision Making |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=87–99 |date=January 2008 |url=http://journal.sjdm.org/bb8/bb8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EPA Safer Choice industrial logo.svg|thumb|right]]
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]’s (EPA’s) Safer Choice label, previously known as the [[Design for the Environment |Design for the Environment (DfE)]] label, helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients, without sacrificing quality or performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edf.org/blog/2016/04/04/epa-label-ids-safer-choice-cleaning-products |title=This EPA label IDs "Safer Choice" cleaning products |last=McPartland |first=Jennifer |date=2016-04-04 |publisher=Environmental Defense Fund |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a product has the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists. Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label.

Safer Choice is a voluntary partnership program that is grounded in more than 40 years of EPA experience in evaluating the human health and environmental characteristics of chemicals. As of January 2015, more than 2,000 products qualify to carry the Safer Choice label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/frequently-asked-questions-safer-choice |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Safer Choice |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-11-21 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses can apply to become partners by submitting their products to the Safer Choice program for review.

== Introduction ==
Since the mid-2000s, EPA's label for safer chemical products has been known as the Design for the Environment, or the DfE label.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/history-safer-choice-and-design-environment |title=History of Safer Choice and Design for the Environment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending more than a year collecting ideas and discussing new label options with stakeholders, such as product manufacturers and environmental and health advocates, the EPA took its ideas to consumers and asked what worked best. The result is the new Safer Choice label.

Products that carry the Safer Choice label must meet requirements for:
* Safer chemical ingredients
* Product performance
* Packaging sustainability
* Ingredient disclosure 
* Surveillance and audits 
* Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn About the Safer Choice Label |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/learn-about-safer-choice-label |date=2017-04-06 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
EPA’s Safer Choice Program is a renaming of the Design for the Environment (DfE) Safer Product Labeling Program.  DfE began in the early 1990s as an innovative, voluntary program to help companies consider human health, environmental, and economic effects of chemicals and technologies.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"/&gt; DfE started the Safer Product Labeling Program as a project with the chemical-based products industry (e.g. cleaners and detergents) to help leading companies use safer chemicals to make high-performing products. DfE developed this certification program based on its Standard for Safer Products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safer Choice Standard and Criteria |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/standard |date=2016-12-20 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and safer chemical criteria, allowing companies to differentiate their products in the marketplace and making it easier for consumers and business purchasers to identify products that are safer for workers, families, pets, and the environment.

Using its science-based criteria that defines safer chemistry by chemical class, Safer Choice has helped the industry innovate and develop safer chemicals and chemical-based products. A number of companies have designed new chemicals to meet Safer Choice criteria, or invested in research to show that existing chemicals are safer.

In March 2015, the Safer Choice label replaced the DfE product label, marking the transition from the Safer Product Labeling Program to the Safer Choice Program. The new Safer Choice label helps consumers, businesses and institutional buyers easily recognize products that have earned EPA’s Safer Choice certification.

In addition to the Safer Choice label above, Safer Choice offers an optional label that product manufacturers may use on products designated for businesses, office buildings, sports venues and schools. Safer Choice also has a label that indicates that a product is fragrance-free, to help consumers who prefer products without fragrance.

== Meaning of the label ==
When a product carries the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally added ingredient—no exceptions, no ''[[de minimis]]''—in the product has been reviewed by EPA scientists. Only products that meet the Safer Choice Standard, which includes stringent human health and environmental criteria, are allowed to carry the label.

Safer Choice evaluates the individual constituents of every proprietary component of a product to ensure that it does not contain chemicals that may present potential health or environmental effects, including ingredients used in small percentages, like fragrances, preservatives, and dyes.

Safer Choice further requires its partners to undergo annual reviews, including on-site audits, to verify product ingredients and ensure compliance with all Safer Choice Program requirements.

== Qualifications to receive the label ==
Companies that enter into partnership with the Safer Choice Program and meet the Safer Choice Standard do so voluntarily. Companies that manufacture Safer Choice products have invested heavily in research and reformulation to ensure that their ingredients and finished products line up on the greener end of the health and environmental spectrum. These companies are leaders in safer products and sustainability.

== Types of products Safer Choice labels ==
Safer Choice labels a wide range of products for consumer and industry use, including:
* All-purpose cleaners
* Athletic field paints
* Bathroom cleaners
* Car cleaners
* Carpet cleaners
* Degreasers
* Dish detergents and hand soaps
* Floor care products
* Glass cleaners
* Laundry products
* Metal cleaners
* Pet care products
* Septic treatment products
* Wood cleaners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleaning with care—a safe ingredient for tough dirt |url=http://www.eastman.com/Brands/Eastman_Omnia/Pages/Safety.aspx |publisher=Eastman |location=Kingsport, TN |access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fragrances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leamy |first=Elisabeth |date=2018-03-20 |title=Bothered by fragrances? This story will be a breath of fresh air. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/bothered-by-fragrances-this-story-will-be-a-breath-of-fresh-air/2018/03/19/ace83e8a-26cd-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html?noredirect=on |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safer Chemical Ingredients List ==
The Safer Chemical Ingredients List (SCIL) is a list of chemical ingredients that the Safer Choice Program has evaluated and determined to be safer than traditional chemical ingredients used for the same function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safer Chemical Ingredients List |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients |date=2018-02-06 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is arranged by functional-use class and is designed to help manufacturers find safer chemical alternatives that meet the criteria of the Safer Choice Program. Safer Choice ensures that no confidential or trade secret information appears in the list.

The Safer Choice Standard and the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients are protective and address a broad range of potential toxicological effects (e.g., carcinogenicity, chronic toxicity and aquatic toxicity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/standard#tab-2 |date=2016-12-20 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; All chemicals in the listing are among the safest for their functional use.

== Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards ==
In 2015, the Safer Choice Program launched its Partner of the Year Awards to recognize program participants who have demonstrated leadership in furthering safer chemistry and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards |url=https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-choice-partner-year-awards |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|End of the world (disambiguation)}}
The '''end of history''' is a political and philosophical concept that supposes that a particular political, economic, or social system may develop that would constitute the end-point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government. A variety of authors have argued that a particular system is the "end of history" including [[Thomas More]] in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=J. J.|title="The End of History": A Reappraisal of Marx's Views on Alienation and Human Emancipation|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique|date=1971|volume=4|issue=3|pages=367–380|jstor=3231359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Alexandre Kojève]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/kojeve-s.htm|title = History and Desire in Kojève|last = Boucher|first = Geoff|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Francis Fukuyama]] in the 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="SpiegelFukuyamaInterview"&gt;Fukuyama himself began to revise his ideas and abandon some of the neoconservative components of his thesis since the [[Iraq War]]. [http://www.spiegel.de/international/interview-with-ex-neocon-francis-fukuyama-a-model-democracy-is-not-emerging-in-iraq-a-407315.html Interview with Ex-Neocon Francis Fukuyama: "A Model Democracy Is not Emerging in Iraq"] Spiegel Online, March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an end of history differs from ideas of an [[Eschatology|end of the world]] as expressed in various religions, which may forecast a complete destruction of the Earth or of life on Earth, and the end of the human race as we know it. The end of history instead proposes a state in which human life continues indefinitely into the future without any further major changes in society, system of governance, or economics.

==History==
The phrase, 'the end of history' was first used by French philosopher and mathematician [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1861 "to refer to the end of the historical dynamic with the perfection of civil society".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"&gt;[[Mike Featherstone]], "Global and Local Cultures", in John Bird, Barry Curtis, Tim Putnam, ''Mapping the Futures: Local Cultures, Global Change'' (1993), p. 184, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Arnold Gehlen]] adopted it in 1952 and it has been taken up more recently by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Gianni Vattimo|Vattimo]]".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"/&gt;

The formal development of an idea of an "end of history" is most closely associated with Hegel, although Hegel discussed the idea in ambiguous terms, making it unclear whether he thought such a thing was a certainty or a mere possibility.&lt;ref&gt;William Desmond, "Hegel, Art, and History", in Robert L. Perkins, ed., ''History and System: Hegel's Philosophy of History'' (1984), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Postmodernism==
A postmodern understanding of the term differs in that "The idea of an 'end of history' does not imply that nothing more will ever happen. Rather, what the [[postmodern]] sense of an end of history tends to signify is, in the words of contemporary historian [[Keith Jenkins]], the idea that 'the peculiar ways in which the past was historicized (was conceptualized in modernist, linear and essentially metanarrative forms) has now come to an end of its productive life; the all-encompassing "experiment of modernity" ... is passing away into our postmodern condition'."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'' (2004), p. 89, quoting Keith Jenkins (2001), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extraordinary rendition''', also called '''irregular rendition''' or '''forced rendition''', is the government-sponsored [[kidnapping|abduction]] and [[extrajudicial]] transfer of a person from one country to another that has predominantly been carried out by the [[United States]] government with the consent of other countries.&lt;ref name="54 countries"&gt;{{cite news |author=Max Fisher |title=A staggering map of the 54 countries that reportedly participated in the CIA's rendition program|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/05/a-staggering-map-of-the-54-countries-that-reportedly-participated-in-the-cias-rendition-program/ |quote= |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/22/us-extraordinary-rendition-programme|title=New light shed on US government's extraordinary rendition programme|first1=Ian|last1=Cobain|first2=James|last2=Ball|date=22 May 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/cia-photographed-naked-detainees|title=CIA photographed detainees naked before sending them to be tortured|first=Spencer|last=Ackerman|date=28 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
By 2004, critics alleged that torture was used against subjects with the knowledge or acquiescence of the United States (a transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law).&lt;ref name=bbc2004jan23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=statesman2004may17&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/147955 America's gulag]. By Stephen Grey. 17 May 2004. ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some former detainees claimed to have been transferred to other countries for interrogation under torture, such as the Australian citizen [[Mamdouh Habib]]. In December 2005 [[Condoleezza Rice]] (then the [[United States Secretary of State]]) stated that:&lt;ref name=rice1&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Upon Her Departure for Europe, 5 Dec 2005|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/57602.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;-- The United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 2001 to 2005 CIA officers captured an estimated 150 people and transported them around the world.&lt;ref name="NYT-17-Feb-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA-Background-Memo"&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc97.pdf Background Paper on CIA's Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques]". 30 December 2004.

Under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], rendered persons were reported to have undergone torture by the receiving countries. Journalists, civil and constitutional rights groups, and former detainees have alleged that this occurred with the knowledge or cooperation of the administrations of the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="britain-condemned"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/4963949/Britain-condemned-over-extraordinary-rendition.html|title=Britain condemned over extraordinary rendition|first=Rosa|last=Prince|date=21 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelations about the US program prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving [[Council of Europe]] member states. A [[#27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution|June 2006 report]] from the Council of Europe estimated 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory (with the cooperation of Council of Europe members), and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centers ("[[black site]]s") used by the CIA, some located in Europe. According to the separate [[#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|European Parliament report of February 2007]], the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/ERES1507.htm Resolution 1507 (2006).]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612123848/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta06%2FERES1507.htm |date=12 June 2010 }} Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of the [[European Union Parliament]] endorsed the report's conclusion that many member states tolerated illegal actions by the CIA, and criticized several European governments and intelligence agencies for their unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation.

Within days of his inauguration in 2009, US President [[Barack Obama]] signed an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] opposing rendition torture and established a task force to provide recommendations about processes to prevent rendition torture.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/ |title=Ensuring Lawful Interrogations &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=17 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061153/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/ |archivedate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Obama administration has distanced itself from some of the harshest counter-terrorism techniques, it has also said that at least some forms of renditions will continue.&lt;ref name="LA-Times-2009-Feb-01"&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/01/nation/na-rendition1 Obama preserves renditions as counter-terrorism tool]".

== Definitions ==
[[Rendition (law)|Rendition]], in law, is a transfer of persons from one jurisdiction to another, and the act of handing over, both after legal proceedings and according to law. "Extraordinary rendition," however, is a rendition which is extralegal, i.e. outside the law (see: [[kidnapping]]). Rendition refers to the transfer; the apprehension, detention, interrogation, and any other practices occurring before and after the movement and exchange of extrajudicial prisoners do not fall into the strict definition of ''extraordinary rendition''. In practice, the term is widely used to describe such practices, particularly the initial apprehension. This latter usage extends to the transfer of suspected terrorists by the US to countries known to torture prisoners or to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture.&lt;ref name="MJC-2009-09-08"&gt;Michael John Garcia, Legislative Attorney American Law Division. [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32890.pdf "Renditions: Constraints Imposed by Laws on Torture"], 8 September 2009; link from the United States [http://www.counterterrorismtraining.gov/leg/index.html Counter-Terrorism Training and Resources for Law Enforcement web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014042245/http://www.counterterrorismtraining.gov/leg/index.html |date=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush administration freely admitted to this practice; stating, among other provisions, that they have specifically asked that torture not be used. Torture can still occur, however, despite these provisions, and much documentation exists alleging that it has happened in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4502986.stm "Rendition: Tales of Torture"], BBC News Online, 7 December 2005. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="italydidntknow" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/15/arar-agent.html "Mystery surrounds former customs agent in Arar case"], CBC.CA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo050906 /&gt; In these instances, the initial captor allows the possibility of torture by releasing the prisoner into the custody of nations that practice torture.

The next distinction of degree is that of intent, where much of the search for evidence continues. It has been alleged that some of those detainees have been tortured with the knowledge, acquiescence, or even participation of US agencies. A transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture would be a violation of US law.&lt;ref name="MJC-2009-09-08" /&gt; New York attorney Marc D. Falkoff stated that such evidence, i.e. transfer for the purposes of torture, was an operational practice. In a court filing, Falkoff described a classified prisoner transfer memo from [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] as noting that information could not be retrieved, as torture could not be used, and recommending that the prisoner be sent to a nation that practiced torture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/938331331.html?dids=938331331:938331331&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+8%2C+2005&amp;author=Ken+Silverstein&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.10&amp;desc=Pentagon+Memo+on+Torture-Motivated+Transfer+Cited%3B+A+court+filing+describes+a+classified+proposal+to+send+a+detainee+away+for+information+extraction.

== Historical instances ==

=== Historical cases ===
An early case involves [[Adolf Eichmann#Capture in Argentina|Israel's rendition of Adolf Eichmann]] from Argentina in 1960.

The first well-known American rendition case involved the ''[[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]]'' hijackers in 1985: after they were given a plane and were en route in international air space, they were forced by [[United States Navy]] fighter planes to land at the [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]], an Italian military base in [[Sicily]] used by the US Navy and [[NATO]]. The US was trying to get them within judicial reach of [[United States government]] representatives for transport to and trial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Clancy, [[Carl Stiner]], Tony Koltz (2002), ''Shadow Warriors: Inside the Special Forces''. {{ISBN|0-399-14783-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1987, during the Reagan administration, the United States executed an extraordinary rendition, code named "Goldenrod," in a joint FBI-CIA operation. Agents lured [[Fawaz Yunis]], who was wanted in the U.S. courts for his role in the hijacking of a Jordanian airliner that had American citizens on board, onto a boat off the coast of Cyprus and taken to international waters, where he was arrested.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Reagan administration did not undertake this kidnapping lightly. Then-FBI Director [[William H. Webster]] had opposed an earlier bid to snatch Yunis, arguing that the United States should not adopt the tactics of Israel, which had abducted [[Adolf Eichmann]] on a residential street in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1960 ... In 1984 and 1986, during a wave of terrorist attacks, Congress passed laws making air piracy and attacks on Americans abroad federal crimes. Ronald Reagan added teeth to these laws by signing a secret covert-action directive in 1986 that authorized the CIA to kidnap, anywhere abroad, foreigners wanted for terrorism. A new word entered the dictionary of U.S. foreign relations: rendition.&lt;ref name="Naftali" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] alleges that extraordinary rendition was developed during the [[Clinton administration]]. CIA officials in the mid-1990s were trying to track down and dismantle [[Islamic fundamentalism|militant Islamic]] organizations in the Middle East, particularly [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="ACLU-Fact-Sheet" /&gt;

According to Clinton administration official [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]]:

{{quote|'extraordinary renditions', were operations to apprehend terrorists abroad, usually without the knowledge of and almost always without public acknowledgment of the host government ... The first time I proposed a snatch, in 1993, the White House Counsel, Lloyd Cutler, demanded a meeting with the President to explain how it violated international law. Clinton had seemed to be siding with Cutler until Al Gore belatedly joined the meeting, having just flown overnight from South Africa. Clinton recapped the arguments on both sides for Gore: 'Lloyd says this. Dick says that.' Gore laughed and said, 'That's a no-brainer. Of course it's a violation of international law, that's why it's a covert action. The guy is a terrorist. Go grab his ass.'&lt;ref&gt;Richard Clarke, [[#References|Enemies]] pp143–4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both the Reagan and Clinton cases involved apprehending known terrorists abroad, by covert means if necessary. The Bush administration expanded the policy after the [[9/11 attacks]].

In a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' interview with CIA veteran [[Michael Scheuer]], an author of the rendition program under the Clinton administration, writer [[Jane Mayer]] noted,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1995, American agents proposed the rendition program to Egypt, making clear that it had the resources to track, capture, and transport terrorist suspects globally—including access to a small fleet of aircraft. Egypt embraced the idea ... 'What was clever was that some of the senior people in Al Qaeda were Egyptian,' Scheuer said. 'It served American purposes to get these people arrested, and Egyptian purposes to get these people back, where they could be interrogated.' Technically, U.S. law requires the CIA to seek 'assurances' from foreign governments that rendered suspects won't be tortured. Scheuer told me that this was done, but he was 'not sure' if any documents confirming the arrangement were signed.&lt;ref name="mayer" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scheuer testified in 2007 before Congress that no such assurances were received.&lt;ref&gt;"I have read and been told that Mr. Clinton, Mr. Berger and Mr. Clarke have said, since 9/11, that they insisted that each receiving country treat the rendered person it received according to U.S. legal standards. To the best of my memory, that is a lie." [http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf ''Extraordinary Rendition in U.S. Counter terrorism Policy: The Impact on Transatlantic Relations''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101093745/http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf |date=1 November 2007 }}, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, Subcommittee on Europe, 17 April 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that treatment of prisoners may not have been "up to U.S. standards." He stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a matter of no concern as the Rendition Program's goal was to protect America, and the rendered fighters delivered to Middle Eastern governments are now either dead or in places from which they cannot harm America. Mission accomplished, as the saying goes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf Extraordinary Rendition in U.S. Counter terrorism Policy: The Impact on Transatlantic Relations.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101093745/http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf |date=1 November 2007 }}, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, Subcommittee on Europe, 17 April 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thereafter, with the approval of President Clinton and a presidential directive (PDD 39), the CIA elected to send suspects to Egypt, where they were turned over to the Egyptian [[Egyptian General Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]].

=== 20th century ===
The US has used rendition increasingly as a tool in the US-led "[[war on terror]]" to deal with foreign [[defendant]]s, ignoring the normal [[extradition]] processes in international law.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Bonner: [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19777 "The CIA's Secret Torture"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Modern methods of rendition include a form where suspects are taken into US custody but delivered to a third-party state, often without ever being on US soil, and without involving the rendering countries, termed "extraordinary rendition." Hundreds of documents retrieved from [[Foreign relations of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan foreign ministry]] offices in [[Tripoli]] following the [[2011 Libyan civil war]] show that the CIA and the United Kingdom's [[MI6]] rendered suspects to Libyan authorities knowing they would be tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/06/libyan-dissident-tortured-sues-britain |title=Libyan dissident tortured by Gaddafi to sue Britain over rendition |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/9/7/discovered_files_show_us_britain_had |title=Discovered Files Show U.S., Britain Had Extensive Ties with Gaddafi Regime on Rendition, Torture |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2011 |publisher=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source speaks of MI6 cooperation, it never suggests active rendition|date=June 2015}} The CIA was granted permission to use rendition (to the USA of indicted terrorists) in a [[presidential directive]] signed by US President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1995, following a procedure&lt;ref&gt;[[Presidential directive]] [https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd39.htm PDD 39], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; established by US President [[George H.

Critics have accused the CIA of [[rendition (law)|rendering]] suspects to other countries in order to avoid US laws mandating [[due process]] and prohibiting [[torture]].

=== 21st century ===
Following the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] the United States, in particular the [[CIA]], has been accused of rendering hundreds of people suspected by the government of being terrorists—or of aiding and abetting terrorist organizations—to third-party states such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Uzbekistan. Such "[[ghost detainees]]" are kept outside [[judicial]] oversight, often without ever entering US territory, and may or may not ultimately be transferred to the custody of the United States.&lt;ref name="mayer"&gt;Mayer, Jane. ''The New Yorker'', 14 February 2005. {{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?050214fa_fact6|title=Outsourcing Torture: The secret history of America's 'extraordinary rendition' program.|accessdate=20 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the former CIA case officer [[Bob Baer]], "If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to [[Forced disappearance|disappear]]—never to see them again—you send them to Egypt."&lt;ref name="CP05-12-05"&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/rajiva12052005.html Lila Rajiva, "The CIA's Rendition Flights to Secret Prisons: The Torture-Go-Round"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814072703/http://www.counterpunch.org/rajiva12052005.html |date=14 August 2011 }}, ''CounterPunch'', 5 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 4 December 2005 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' by [[Dana Priest]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members of the Rendition Group follow a simple but standard procedure: Dressed head to toe in black, including masks, they blindfold and cut the clothes off their new captives, then administer an [[enema]] and sleeping drugs. They outfit detainees in a diaper and jumpsuit for what can be a day-long trip. Their destinations: either a detention facility operated by cooperative countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, or one of the CIA's own covert prisons—referred to in classified documents as "black sites", which at various times have been operated in eight countries, including several in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="WaPo051204"&gt;{{cite news | author=Dana Priest | title=Wrongful Imprisonment: Anatomy of a CIA Mistake | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120301476.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 | work=The Washington Post | date=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following mounting scrutiny in Europe, including investigations held by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] senator [[Dick Marty]] who released a public report in June 2006, the [[United States Senate|US Senate]], in December 2005, was about to approve a measure that would include amendments requiring the Director of National Intelligence to provide regular, detailed updates about secret detention facilities maintained by the United States overseas, and to account for the treatment and condition of each prisoner.&lt;ref name="NyTimes051215"&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate is Set to Require White House to Account for Secret Prisons |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1071FFA34550C768DDDAB0994DD404482 |date=15 December 2005 |accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The New York Times |first=Douglas |last=Jehl |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408042758/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1071FFA34550C768DDDAB0994DD404482 |archivedate=8 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Boeing Jeppesen international trip planning ====
On 23 October 2006, the ''New Yorker'' reported that [[Jeppesen]], a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], handled the logistical planning for the CIA's extraordinary rendition flights. The allegation is based on information from an ex-employee who quoted Bob Overby, managing director of the company as saying "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights—you know, the torture flights. Let's face it, some of these flights end up that way. It certainly pays well." The article went on to suggest that this may make Jeppesen a potential defendant in a lawsuit by [[Khaled El-Masri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/061030ta_talk_mayer The C.I.A.'s Travel Agent], Jane Mayer, ''The New Yorker'', 23 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeppesen was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the [[ACLU]] on 30 May 2007, on behalf of several other individuals who were allegedly subject to extraordinary rendition.

The suit was dismissed on 8 September 2010 by a federal appeals court on the grounds that "going forward would reveal state secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/08/AR2010090807334.html |title=Suit dismissed against firm in CIA rendition case |date=9 September 2010 |author=Peter Finn |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Black sites" ===
In 2005, ''The Washington Post'' and [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) published revelations concerning CIA flights and "[[black site]]s", covert prisons operated by the CIA and whose existence is denied by the US government. The [[European Parliament]] published a report in February 2007 concerning the use of such secret detention centers and extraordinary rendition (''[[Extraordinary rendition#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below]]''). These detention centers violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|UN Convention Against Torture]], treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Europeans Probe Secret CIA Flights | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111602198.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= EU to look into 'secret US jails' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4403166.stm | accessdate=18 December 2005 |publisher=BBC News  | date=3 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Faces Scrutiny Over Secret Prisons | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110300422.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=4 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ABC News]] two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the recent publicity. CIA officers say the captives were relocated to the North African desert. All but one of these 11 high-value [[al Qaeda]] prisoners were subjected to the harshest interrogation techniques in the CIA's secret arsenal, sometimes referred to as "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" authorized for use by about 14 CIA officers.&lt;ref name="AbcNews051205"&gt;{{cite news | title=Exclusive: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123 | accessdate=18 December 2005 | publisher=ABC News | date=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, Swiss senator [[Dick Marty]], representative at the [[Council of Europe]] in charge of the European investigations, concluded that 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA in Europe—thus qualifying as ghost detainees—and then rendered to a country where they may have been tortured.

==== Criticisms of ''The Washington Post'''s decision to withhold locations of the black sites ====
A comment by [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]]&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005" /&gt; on ''The Washington Post'''s decision to withhold the locations of these secret prisons was that since the revelations "could open the [[U.S. government]] to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad," the ''Post'' did its part to minimize these risks. Yet, according to FAIR, "the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however—it's the whole point of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. First Amendment]]. ... Without the basic fact of where these prisons are, it's difficult if not impossible for 'legal challenges' or 'political condemnation' to force them to close." FAIR argued that the damage done to the global reputation of the United States by the continued existence of black-site prisons was more dangerous than any threat caused by the exposure of their locations.&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Consequences of Covering Up | url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2715 | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Raw Story]]'', the Polish site identified by reporter [[Larisa Alexandrovna]] and Polish intelligence officer [[David Dastych]] is [[Stare Kiejkuty (base)|Stare Kiejkuty]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified—but never named—when the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Soviet-era compound in northern Poland was site of secret CIA interrogation, detentions | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Sovietera_compound_in_Poland_was_site_0307.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Alexandrovna and Dastych have stated that their sources told them that the same information and documents were provided to ''The Washington Post'' in 2005. In addition, they also identified the methodology of concealing the black sites:

{{quote|Former European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union, first identified by the Washington Post, are likely not permanent locations, making them difficult to identify and locate.

What some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed, officials say. Interim "black sites"—secret facilities used for covert activities—can be as small as a room in a government building, which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short-term detainment and interrogation.}}

They go on to explain that "Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport." The airport in question is the [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]], according to Alexandrovna and Dastych.

In response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, [[Zbigniew Siemiatkowski]], embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations made by Alexandrovna and Dastych were "... part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush," according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Former Polish intelligence chief who says report on CIA detention site part of US domestic battle admitted CIA had access to facility | url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Former_Polish_intelligence_chief_who_says_0308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison ships ====
The United States has also been accused of operating "[[Prison ship|floating prisons]]" to house and transport those arrested in its [[war on terror#US objectives|''War on Terror'']], according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duncan Campbell |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights |title=US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships |work=The Guardian  |location=London |date= 2 June 2008|accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a written opinion upholding the arrest warrant, judge Enrico Manzi wrote that the evidence taken from Lady's home "removes any doubt about his participation in the preparatory phase of the abduction."&lt;ref name="WaPo051206"&gt;{{cite news | title=CIA Ruse is Said to Have Damaged Probe in Milan: Italy Allegedly Misled on Cleric's Abduction | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/04/AR2005120400885.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | date=6 December 2005 | first=Craig | last=Whitlock}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lady, however, alleged that the evidence had been gathered illegally, and has denied involvement in the abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blythe-systems.com/pipermail/nytr/Week-of-Mon-20051205/028234.html|title=Former CIA Agent to Fight Italian Warrant|date=9 December 2005|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photos of Robert (Bob) Lady and other defendants recently have surfaced on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;Renditioner photos: [http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2007/03/30/18385947.php Wanted Poster for CIA's Robert Lady in Imam Rapito], ''[[Indymedia]] San Francisco'', 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Mancini]], the [[SISMI]] director of anti-terrorism and counterespionage, and Gustavo Pignero, the department's director in 2003, have been arrested on charges of complicity in a kidnapping, with the aggravating circumstances of [[abuse of power]].

On 4 November 2009, an Italian judge convicted 22 suspected or known CIA agents, a U.S. Air Force (USAF) colonel, and two Italian secret agents of the kidnapping. These were the first legal convictions in the world against people involved in the CIA's extraordinary renditions program.

=== Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad case ===
{{Main|Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad}}
A story in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on 8 December 2005 seems to corroborate the claims of "torture by proxy." It mentions the attorneys for [[Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad]], a detainee held by the Pentagon at Guantanamo Bay, filed a petition to prevent his being transferred to foreign countries. According to the petition's description of a redacted classified [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] memo from 17 March 2004, its contents say  "officials suggested sending Ahmad to an unspecified foreign country that employed torture in order to increase chances of extracting information from him."

Mr Falkoff, representing Ahmad, continued: "There is only one meaning that can be gleaned from this short passage," the petition says. "The government believes that Mr. Ahmad has information that it wants but that it cannot extract without torturing him." The petition goes on to say that because torture is not allowed at Guantanamo, "the recommendation is that Mr. Ahmad should be sent to another country where he can be interrogated under torture."&lt;ref name="LaTimes051208"&gt;{{Cite news

In a report, regarding the allegations of CIA flights, on 13 December 2005, the rapporteur and Chair of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]'s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, Swiss councillor [[Dick Marty]], concluded: "The elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees—outside all judicial procedure—in European countries."&lt;ref name="Bbc051213"&gt;{{cite news | title=CIA abduction claims 'credible' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4524864.stm | accessdate=18 December 2005 |publisher=BBC News | date=13 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muhammad Bashmila case ===
Muhammad Bashmila, a former secret prisoner, now free in Yemen, gave an interview to the [[BBC]] [[Newsnight]] programme, where he spoke of being transferred from Afghanistan to a [[Internment camp|detention center]] where it was cold, where the food appeared European and where evening prayers were held.

=== Maher Arar case ===
{{Main|Maher Arar}}
Maher Arar, a Syrian-born dual Syrian and Canadian citizen, was detained at [[Kennedy International Airport]] on 26 September 2002, by US [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] officials. He was heading home to Canada after a family holiday in Tunisia. After almost two weeks, enduring hours of interrogation chained, he was sent, shackled and bound, in a private jet to Jordan and then Syria, instead of being deported to Canada. There, he was interrogated and tortured by Syrian intelligence. Maher Arar was eventually released a year later. He told the BBC that he was repeatedly tortured during 10 months' detention in Syria—often whipped on the palms of his hands with metal cables. Syrian intelligence officers forced him to sign a [[Confession (law)|confession]] linking him to [[Al Qaeda]].

He was finally released following intervention by the Canadian government. The Canadian government lodged an official complaint with the US government protesting Arar's deportation. On 18 September 2006, a Canadian public enquiry presented its findings, entirely clearing Arar of any terrorist activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sirc-csars.gc.ca/pdfs/cm_arar_rec-eng.pdf |title=Report of the Events Relating to Maher Arar: Analysis and Recommendations }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.17&amp;nbsp;MB)}}, Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Arar filed a lawsuit in a federal court in New York against senior U.S. officials, on charges that whoever sent him to Syria knew he would be tortured by intelligence agents.&lt;ref name="Talesoftorture"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4502986.stm "Renditions: Tales of Torture"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 7 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[US Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Tom Ridge]] and [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] were all named in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=bbc2004jan23&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3421743.stm Canadian sues US over deportation], BBC News, 23 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that U.S. law did not allow victims of extraordinary rendition to sue U.S. officials for torture suffered overseas.&lt;ref name=maher_arar_appeal_rejected /&gt;

On 18 October 2006, Arar received the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award from the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] for his ordeal. On 18 October 2007, Maher Arar received a public apology from the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Representative [[Dana Rohrabacher]], who apologized, stated that he would fight any efforts to end the practice.

In 2007, Arar was awarded $10.5&amp;nbsp;million in compensation from the Canadian government for pain and suffering in his ordeal and a formal apology from Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]].&lt;ref name="USlegislatorsapologize"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/10/18/arar.html U.S. legislators apologize to Maher Arar], ''CBCNews'', 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''This is a non-exhaustive list of some alleged examples of extraordinary rendition.  Most cannot be confirmed.''
* A Pakistani newspaper reported that in the early hours of 23 October 2001 a Yemeni citizen, Jamil Qasim Saeed Mohammed, a 27-year-old [[microbiology]] student at [[Karachi University]], was spirited aboard a private plane at Karachi's airport by Pakistani security officers.&lt;ref name="Washpost041227"&gt;{{cite news | title=Jet is an Open Secret in Terror War | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A27826-2004Dec26?language=printer| accessdate=12 February 2007 |work=The Washington Post | date=27 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2001, [[Mamdouh Habib]], who lives in Australia and has both Australian and Egyptian nationality (having been born in Egypt), was detained in Pakistan, where he was interrogated for three weeks, and then flown to Egypt in a private plane. From Egypt, he was later flown to a US airbase in Afghanistan. He told the BBC that he did not know who had held him, but had seen Americans, Australians, Pakistanis, and Egyptians among his captors. He also said that he had been beaten, given electric shocks, [[deprived of sleep]], blindfolded for eight months and brainwashed.&lt;ref name="Talesoftorture" /&gt; After signing confessions of involvement with al-Qaeda, which he has now retracted, Mr Habib was transferred to Guantanamo Bay.

However, he contradicted himself a few minutes later, in the same interview, saying that Habib had been assumed guilty because he was in the restricted province of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]] without proper visa documents.&lt;ref name="Habib"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4214747.stm Profile: Mamdouh Habib], BBC News, 7 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

At a news conference he told reporters and U.S. officials he had been wrongly imprisoned for allegedly plotting to kill [[Osama bin Laden]]. He was then taken to a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, where he was stripped, bound and thrown behind bars. According to U.S. lawyers who represent him, in January 2002 he was sent to the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Nearly four years later, Turkistani remained there, despite being cleared for release early 2005 after a government review concluded he is "no longer an [[enemy combatant]]."

The information he provided to his interrogators formed a fundamental part of the Bush administration case for attacking Iraq, alleging links between Al Qaeda and Iraq.

They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to Swedish investigative programme ''Kalla fakta''.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript from a Swedish television show, "''Kalla Fakta''" (Cold Facts) in May 2004 in which the abduction is the topic.

Agiza was previously charged and sentenced in absentia with being an Islamic militant and was sentenced to 25 years, a sentence that was reduced to 15 years due to the political pressure after the Rendition became known. Al-Zery wasn't charged, and after two years in jail without ever seeing a judge or prosecutor he was sent to his village in Egypt. In 2008 AL Zery was awarded $500,000 in damages by the Swedish government for the wrongful treatment he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.
* In March 2002, [[Abou Elkassim Britel]], an Italian citizen with Moroccan origins, was arrested in Pakistan and subsequently interrogated by Pakistani and US officials. He was then rendered to Moroccan authorities, detained and tortured in a secret [[Temara interrogation centre]]. He was finally released without any charges brought against him, before being rearrested in May 2003 at the border crossing of the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] in North Africa. He is currently imprisoned in [[Äin Bourja prison]] in [[Casablanca]] after having been sentenced to nine years in January 2004 for membership of a subversive organisation and for activities including holding unauthorised meetings. This in spite of conclusions in September 2006 by Italian Justice, after a five years investigation, that there was "an absolute lack of grounds of evidence of charge which may be used in trial" and that the suspicion motivating the inquiries had proved unfounded. Nonetheless, allegations in the Italian press and the judicial proceedings that were underway in Italy influenced court proceedings against Britel in Morocco that led to him being sentenced.

==== Council of Europe investigation and its two reports ====
On 25 November 2005, the lead investigator for the [[Council of Europe]], Swiss lawmaker [[Dick Marty]] announced that he had obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for suspected black sites, and he was planning to use satellite imagery over the last several years as part of his investigation. On 28 November 2005, EU Justice Commissioner [[Franco Frattini]] asserted that any EU country which had operated a secret prison would have its voting rights suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Ames |title=EU May Suspend Nations With Secret Prisons | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=[[ABC News]] | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=1352347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preliminary report, Dick Marty declared that it was "highly unlikely that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware" of the CIA kidnapping of a "hundred" persons on European territory and their subsequent rendition to countries where they may be tortured.&lt;ref name="DickMarty_PDF_2006-01-22"&gt;Directed by Swiss senator Dick Marty, Entitled "Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states," see: {{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_01_06_detention.pdf |title=Information memorandum II on the alleged secret detentions in Council of Europe states }}, Dick Marty, 22 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Council of Europe directed by Dick Marty, and made public on 7 June 2006, was titled: "Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states."&lt;ref&gt;June 2006 Council of Europe report available here: [http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.htm HTML] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610064258/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=%2FCommitteeDocs%2F2006%2F20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.htm |date=10 June 2006 }} and [http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.pdf PDF] formats.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of this report, the Council of Europe published its draft Recommendation and Resolution document which
found grounds for concern with the conduct of both the US and member states of the EU and expresses concern for the disregard of international law and the Geneva Convention. Following a 23-point resolution the document makes five recommendations.
* 1 refers to its Resolution on alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states.
* 2 recalling its previous recommendation on the legality of the detention of persons by the United States in Guantanamo Bay
* 3 urges the Committee of Ministers to draft a recommendation to Council of Europe member States containing:
:common measures to guarantee more effectively the human rights of persons suspected of terrorist offences who are captured from, detained in or transported through Council of Europe member States; and a set of minimum requirements for "human rights protection clauses", for inclusion in bilateral and multilateral agreements with third parties, especially those concerning the use of military installations on the territory of Council of Europe member States.
* 4 urgently requests that: an initiative be launched on an international level, expressly involving the United States, an Observer to the Council of Europe, to develop a common, truly global strategy to address the terrorist threat. The strategy should conform in all its elements with the fundamental principles of our common heritage in terms of democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law. Also, a proposal be considered, in instances where States are unable or unwilling to prosecute persons accused of terrorist acts, to bring these persons within the jurisdiction of an international court that is competent to try them. One possibility worth considering would be to vest such a competence in the International Criminal Court, whilst renewing invitations to join the Court to the United States and other countries that have not yet done so.
* 5 recommends improving the Council of Europe's ability to react rapidly and effectively to allegations of systematic human rights abuse involving several member States.

Several months before the publication of the Council of Europe report directed by Dick Marty, [[Gijs de Vries]], the EU's antiterrorism coordinator, asserted in April 2006 that no evidence existed that extraordinary rendition had been taking place in Europe. It was also said that the European Union's probe, and a similar one by the continent's leading human rights group had not found any human rights violations nor other crimes that could be proven to the satisfaction of the courts.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe060421"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2006/04/21/eu_official_no_evidence_of_illegal_cia_action/ EU official: No evidence of illegal CIA action: Antiterror chief advises committee], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 21 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This denial from a member of the [[executive power]] of the EU institutions has been questioned by the [[European Parliament]] report, which was accepted by a vast majority of the Parliament in February 2007 (''[[Extraordinary renditions#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below:The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report]]'').

On the other hand, Dick Marty explained the difference of approach concerning terrorism between the EU and the US as following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While the states of the Old World have dealt with these threats primarily by means of existing institutions and legal systems, the United States appears to have made a fundamentally different choice: considering that neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism, it decided to develop new legal concepts. This legal approach is utterly alien to the European tradition and sensibility, and is clearly contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5055872.stm Rendition and the rights of the individual], ''[[BBC News]]'', 7 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, despite Marty's claims, the European Parliament investigations uncovered cooperation between European [[secret services]] and governments and the extraordinary renditions programs, making such a clear-cut distinction over-simplistic (''[[Extraordinary renditions#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|see below]]''). Dick Marty himself has not accepted such a dualistic approach, as he showed that for the British government also, the phenomenon of Islamic terrorism was alleged to be so grave that the balance of liberties had to be reconsidered.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07" /&gt; Marty's report stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The compilation of so-called "black lists" of individuals and companies suspected of maintaining connections with organisations considered terrorist and the application of the associated sanctions clearly breach every principle of the fundamental right to a fair trial: no specific charges, no right to be heard, no right of appeal, no established procedure for removing one's name from the list.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== 27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution ====
The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) accused the United States of operating a "clandestine spiderweb of disappearances, secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers" and called for EU regulations governing foreign intelligence services operating in Europe, and demanded "human rights clauses" in military base agreements with the USA.

In a resolution and recommendation approved by a large majority, the Assembly also called for:
* The dismantling by the US of its system of detentions and transfers.
* A review of bilateral agreements between Council of Europe member states and the US, particularly on the status of US forces stationed in Europe and on the use of military and other instrastructures, to ensure they conform to international human rights norms.
* Official apologies and compensation for victims of illegal detentions against whom no formal accusations, nor any court proceedings, have ever been brought
* An international initiative, expressly involving the United States, to develop a common, truly global strategy to address the terrorist threat which conforms to democracy, human rights and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/ERES1507.htm |title=Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=17 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612123848/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta06%2FERES1507.htm |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Parliament's investigation and report ====
The [[European Parliament]] launched its own investigation into the reports. In April 2006, [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] leading the investigations expressed concerns that the CIA had conducted more than 1,000 secret flights over European territory since 2001, some to transfer terror suspects to countries that used torture. Investigators said that the same US agents and planes were involved over and over again.&lt;ref name="NyTimes060427"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/world/europe/27cia.html?ex=1303790400&amp;en=f28193a7c7a919c0&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss European Inquiry Says C.I.A.

Thursday, 6 July 2006 – Strasbourg. Final edition: Extraordinary renditio]&lt;/ref&gt;

"In a resolution passed on 14 February 2007 MEPs approved by a large majority (382 voting in favour, 256 against and 74 abstaining) their committee's final report, which criticized the rendition program and concluded that many European countries tolerated illegal [[CIA]] activities including secret flights over their territories. The countries named were: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Bbc070214"&gt;{{cite news | title=EU endorses damning report on CIA | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6360817.stm | accessdate=14 February 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date=14 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report ...

{{quote|''Denounces'' the lack of co-operation of many member states and of the [[Council of the European Union]] with the investigation;

''Regrets'' that European countries have been relinquishing control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the CIA which, on some occasions, were being used for illegal transportation of detainees;

''Calls'' for the closure of [the US military detention mission in] Guantanamo and for European countries immediately to seek the return of their citizens and residents who are being held illegally by the US authorities;

''Considers'' that all European countries should initiate independent investigations into all stopovers by civilian aircraft [hired by] the CIA;

According to the report, the CIA had operated 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture. The Parliament also called for the creation of an independent investigation commission and the closure of the Guantanamo camp. According to Italian Socialist [[Giovanni Fava]], who drafted the document, there was a "strong possibility" that the intelligence obtained under the illegal extraordinary rendition program had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained. The report also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used in Europe, including Romania and Poland. The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where "an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture".

=== Investigations by national governments ===

==== France ====
The French [[attorney general]] of [[Bobigny]] opened up an instruction in order "to verify the presence in [[Le Bourget Airport]], on 20 July 2005, of the plane numbered N50BH." This instruction was opened following a complaint deposed in December 2005 by the ''[[Ligue des droits de l'homme]]'' (LDH) NGO ("Human Rights League") and the ''[[International Federation of Human Rights Leagues]]'' (FIDH) NGO on charges of "arbitrary detention", "crime of torture" and "non-respect of the rights of [[war prisoners]]". It has as objective to determine if the plane was used to transport CIA prisoners to [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]] and if the French authorities had knowledge of this stop. However, the lawyer defending the LDH declared that he was surprised that the instruction was only opened on 20 January 2006, and that no verifications had been done before.
On 2 December 2005, conservative newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' had revealed the existence of two CIA planes that had landed in France, suspected of transporting CIA prisoners. But the instruction concerned only N50BH, which was a [[Gulfstream III]], which would have landed at Le Bourget on 20 July 2005, coming from [[Oslo]], Norway. The other suspected aircraft would have landed in [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 31 March 2002. It is investigated by the Canadian authorities, as it would have been flying from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] in Canada, via [[Keflavík]] in Iceland before going to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}{{cite news | title=La France enquête sur les avions de la CIA |work=Le Figaro  |language=French |date=2 February 2006 | url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20060302.FIG000000200_la_france_enquete_sur_les_avions_de_la_cia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
Business daily ''[[Handelsblatt]]'' reported 24 November 2005, that the CIA used an American military base in Germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the German government. The ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'' reported the following day there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a "high probability" of being operated by the CIA, at [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]], the [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] and others. The newspaper cited experts and "[[Aircraft spotting|plane-spotters]]" who observed the planes as responsible for the tally.&lt;ref name="refbot.947"&gt;{{cite web | title=CIA Uses German Bases to Transport Terrorists, Paper Says | publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] | date=25 November 2005 | url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1792376,00.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal opened up an investigation concerning CIA flights in February 2007, on the basis of declarations by [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Ana Gomes]] and by Rui Costa Pinto, journalist of ''[[Visão]]'' review. The Portuguese general prosecutor, [[Cândida Almeida]], head of the [[Central Investigation and Penal Action Department]] (DCIAP), announced the opening of investigations on 5 February 2007. They were to be centered on the issue of "torture or inhuman and cruel treatment," and instigated by allegations of "illegal activities and serious human rights violations" made by MEP Ana Gomes to the attorney general, Pinto Monteiro, on 26 January 2007.&lt;ref name="StateFeb07"&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/feb/03cia-portugal.htm Portugal: Renditions: Judicial investigation into CIA flights begins], ''[[Statewatch]] News Online'', 5 February 2007 – 6 February 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, the UK NGO [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] published a report based on flight logs obtained by Ana Gomes, confirming that over 728 prisoners were flown to Guantánamo through Portuguese airspace, and hence through Portuguese jurisdiction, in at least 28 flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=www.statewatch.org|title= Portugal: Over 700 prisoners flown to Guantánamo through Portuguese airspace|url= http://www.statewatch.org/news/2008/feb/02reprieve-rendition-portugal.htm|accessdate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most critic voice against the scarce collaboration provided by the Portuguese government to the European Parliament Commission which investigated CIA flights, Ana Gomes declared that, although she had no doubt that permission of these illegal flights were frequent during [[Durão Barroso]] (2002–2004) and [[Santana Lopes]] (2004–2005)' governments, "during the [Socialist] government of [[José Sócrates]] [2005– ], 24 flights which passed through Portuguese territory" are registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/noticia.aspx?cod=20070205202548&amp;ch=69 Portugal/CIA – La Fiscalía General abre una investigación sobre los supuestos vuelos ilegales de la CIA en Portugal], ''[[Europa Press]]'', 5 February 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active in the TDIP commission, Ana Gomes complained about the Portuguese state's reluctance to provide information, leading her to tensions with the Foreign minister, [[Luís Amado]], member of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|same party]]. Ana Gomes declared herself satisfied with the opening of the investigations, but underlined that she had always claimed that a parliamentary inquiry would be necessary.&lt;ref name="StateFeb07" /&gt;

On the other hand, journalist Rui Costa Pinto was heard by the DCIAP, as he had written an article, refused by ''Visão'', about flights passing by [[Lajes Field]], a Portuguese airbase used by the US Air Forces, in the [[Azores]].&lt;ref name="StateFeb07" /&gt;

==== Romania ====
[[Franco Frattini]] the European Union Justice Commissioner requested an explanation from the governments of Poland and Romania about the accusations made by Dick Marty. Doris Mircea (Romanian spokeswoman in [[Brussels]]) replied to this in November 2007 in a letter stating "no person was kept illegally as a prisoner within Romanian jails and no illegal transfer of detainees passed through Romanian territory" and that that was the official finding of a committee of inquiry set up by the government to investigate the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7097253.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Romania says it had no CIA bases | date=15 November 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spain ====
In November 2005, Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' reported that CIA planes had landed in the [[Canary Islands]] and in [[Palma de Mallorca]]. Spanish magistrate [[Baltasar Garzón]], notable for his earlier attempt to prosecute Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]], opened up an investigation concerning these landings which, according to Madrid, were made without official knowledge, thus being a breach of [[national sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='El Gobierno canario pide explicaciones sobre vuelos de la CIA en Tenerife' |date=16 November 2005 |work=El Pais |url=http://www.elpais.es/articulo/elpepinac/20051116elpepinac_3/Tes/Canarias%20pide%20explicaciones%20sobre%20las%20escalas%20de%20vuelos%20de%20la%20CIA%20en%20Tenerife |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301012114/http://www.elpais.es/articulo/elpepinac/20051116elpepinac_3/Tes/Canarias%20pide%20explicaciones%20sobre%20las%20escalas%20de%20vuelos%20de%20la%20CIA%20en%20Tenerife |archivedate=1 March 2006 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='La Fiscalía de Canarias investigará las escalas de vuelos de la CIA en Tenerife y Gran Canaria' |date=18 November 2005 |work=El Mundo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/11/18/espana/1132315880.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Un supuesto avión de la CIA aterriza en la base portuguesa de Azores' |date=28 November 2005 |publisher=Canarias 7 |url=http://www.canarias7.es/articulo.cfm?Id=14607&amp;dia=29%20November%202005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomatic cables exposed in 2010 by [[WikiLeaks]] suggest that the United States government including the American ambassador, worked with parts of the Spanish government to subvert the Spanish judicial process to control and ultimately stymie and thwart the investigation.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks Cables" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wikileaks judicial interference"&gt;Tremlett, Giles,[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/30/wikileaks-us-spain-guantanamo- Wikileaks: US pressured Spain over CIA rendition and Guantánamo torture rendition] The Guardian, 1 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horton Interview DemocraqcyNow"&gt;Horton, Scott [http://www.democracynow.org/2010/12/1/wikileaks_cables_reveal_us_tried_to WikiLeaks Cables Reveal U.S. Tried to Thwart Spanish Probes of Gitmo Torture and CIA Rendition] Interview with Amy Goodman, 1 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sweden ====
{{Main|Repatriation of Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery}}
Extraordinary rendition provoked a diplomatic crisis between the United States and Sweden in 2006 when Swedish authorities put a stop to CIA rendition flights.&lt;ref name="Sweden Stops Flights"&gt;Nylander, Johan, [http://www.swedishwire.com/politics/7497-cia-rendition-flights-stopped-by-swedish-military CIA rendition flights stopped by Swedish military] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208232249/http://www.swedishwire.com/politics/7497-cia-rendition-flights-stopped-by-swedish-military |date=8 December 2010 }} The Swedish Wire, 5 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001 Swedish police detained Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery, two Egyptians who had been seeking asylum in Sweden. The police took them to Bromma airport in Stockholm, and then stood aside as masked alleged CIA operatives cut their clothes from their bodies, inserted drugged suppositories in their anuses, and dressed them in diapers and overalls, handcuffed and chained them and put them on an executive jet with American registration N379P.  They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to extensive investigate reports by Swedish programme "Kalla fakta".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/de/news/2004/11/21/swedish-tv4-kalla-fakta-program-broken-promise-part-iv |title=Kalla Facta program Part IV-"The Broken Promise" |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=21 November 2004 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Swedish Parliamentary investigator concluded that the degrading and inhuman treatment of the two prisoners violated Swedish law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/20/AR2005052001605.html New Swedish Documents Illuminate CIA Action] The Washington Post, 21 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the United Nations found Sweden had violated an international torture ban in its complicity in the CIA's transfer of al-Zari to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/11/09/sweden-violated-torture-ban-cia-rendition Sweden Violated Torture Ban in CIA Rendition] Human Rights Watch 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden imposed strict rules on rendition flights, but Swedish Military Intelligence posing as airport personnel who boarded one of two subsequent extraordinary rendition flights in 2006 during a stopover at Stockholm's Arlanda International Airport found the Swedish restrictions were being ignored.&lt;ref name="Sweden Stops Flights" /&gt; In 2008 the Swedish government awarded al-Zery $500,000 in damages for the abuse he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Sweden Stops Flights" /&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
After claims by [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] that British airports had been used by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|"CIA]] for extraordinary rendition flights, the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] launched an investigation in November 2005. The report was published in June 2007 and found no evidence to support the claim. This was on the same day the Council of Europe released its report with evidence that the UK had colluded in extraordinary rendition, thus directly contradicting ACPO's findings. Liberty has challenged the findings and has stated that its original claims were based on "credible evidence".&lt;ref name="BBC News 9 June"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6736227.stm Police reject UK rendition claims], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 9 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, the government's Intelligence and Security Committee released their Rendition report, detailing U.S. and U.K. activities and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/upload/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/publications/intelligence/20070725_isc_final.pdf Rendition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227144826/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/upload/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/publications/intelligence/20070725_isc_final.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }}; Intelligence and Security Committee; The [[Rt Hon]] [[Paul Murphy (UK politician)|Paul Murphy MP]], Chairman; July 2007.

Retrieved July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2008, British Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] admitted (despite previous government denials) that two U.S. extraordinary rendition flights had stopped on [[Diego Garcia]] in 2002, a U.K. territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7256587.stm|title=UK apology on US terror flights|publisher=BBC|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned as to whether the government had deliberately misled the public over rendition, the Foreign Secretary apologised and stated that the government had simply "made a mistake". His statement also laid out the current UK Government view on Extraordinary rendition;

{{quote|Our counter-terrorism relationship with the United States is vital to UK security. I am absolutely clear that there must and will continue to be the strongest possible intelligence and counter-terrorism relationship with the US, consistent with UK law and our international obligations.

As part of our close co-operation, there has long been a regular exchange with the US authorities, in which we have set out: that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including Overseas Territories; that we will grant that permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations; and how we understand our obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7257500.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=In full: Miliband rendition statement | date=21 February 2008 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Miliband}}

A judicial inquiry, chaired by [[Sir Peter Gibson]] was announced by the government in July 2010, but was never formally launched and was scrapped in January 2012. According to the government, this was due to ongoing criminal investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-16614514 |publisher=BBC News | title=UK inquiry into rendition and torture collusion scrapped | date=19 January 2012 | accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 the CIA and FBI won a court ruling in the USA, exempting them from releasing documentation requested by British members of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cia-wins-fight-to-keep-mps-in-dark-on-rendition-7631357.html |publisher=The Independent| title=CIA wins fight to keep MPs in dark on rendition|date=11 April 2012|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that relevant 2002 flight records from Diego Garcia had been destroyed by [[water damage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|page=15|last=Leith|first=Sam|title=To back up, or not to back up|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Erroneous rendition" ==
An article published in 5 December 2005, ''The Washington Post'' reported that the [[CIA]]'s [[Inspector General]] was investigating what it calls '''erroneous renditions'''.&lt;ref name="WaPo051205"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120301476_pf.html Wrongful Imprisonment: Anatomy of a CIA Mistake: German Citizen Released After Months in 'Rendition'], [[Dana Priest]], ''The Washington Post'', 4 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears to refer to cases in which innocent people were subjected to extraordinary rendition.

[[Khalid El-Masri]] is the most well-known person who is believed to have been subjected to the process of "extraordinary rendition", as a result of mistaken identity. [[Laid Saidi]], an Algerian detained and tortured along with El-Masri, was apprehended apparently because of a taped telephone conversation in which the word ''tirat'', meaning "tires" in Arabic, was mistaken for the word ''tairat'', meaning "airplanes".&lt;ref name="NyTimes060707" /&gt;

The Post's anonymous sources say that the Inspector General is looking into a number of similar cases—possibly as many as thirty innocent men who were captured and transported through what has been called "erroneous renditions".

A 27 December 2005 story quotes anonymous CIA insiders claiming there have been 10 or fewer such erroneous renditions.&lt;ref name="ApNews"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-12-27-cia-renditions_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA CIA watchdog probes 'renditions' of suspects], [[Associated Press]], 27 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
It names the CIA's [[inspector general]], [[John Helgerson]], as the official responsible for the inquiry.

The AP story quotes Tom Malinowski, Washington office director of Human Rights Watch who said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am glad the CIA is investigating the cases that they are aware of, but by definition you are not going to be aware of all such cases, when you have a process designed to avoid judicial safeguards.&lt;ref name="ApNews" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Obama Executive Order on rendition ==

Two days after President Barack Obama was sworn into office, on 22 January 2009, he signed an executive order entitled "Ensuring Lawful Interrogations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations |title=Ensuring Lawful Interrogations |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=19 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218212240/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations |archivedate=18 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This order specifically addresses the practice of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov" /&gt; It establishes a committee that will provide recommendations within 180 days of the executive order. It specifically has as its goal a process to ensure that the United States practices do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov" /&gt;

Overall, the executive order calls for more oversight of interrogation by third parties, but does not end extraordinary rendition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/us/politics/25rendition.html | title=U.S. Says Rendition to Continue, but With More Oversight | author=Johnston, David | work=The New York Times | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section of the Executive Order relating to extraordinary rendition provides as follows:

{{quote|
* '''(e) Mission.'''  The mission of the Special Task Force shall be:
** '''(i)'''   to study and evaluate whether the interrogation practices and techniques in [[FM 2-22.3 Human Intelligence Collector Operations|Army Field Manual 2 22.3]], when employed by departments or agencies outside the military, provide an appropriate means of acquiring the intelligence necessary to protect the Nation, and, if warranted, to recommend any additional or different guidance for other departments or agencies; and
** '''(ii)'''  to study and evaluate the practices of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.
* '''(f) Administration.'''  The Special Task Force shall be established for administrative purposes within the Department of Justice and the Department of Justice shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide administrative support and funding for the Special Task Force.
* '''(g) Recommendations.''' The Special Task Force shall provide a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Counsel to the President, on the matters set forth in subsection (d) within 180 days of the date of this order, unless the Chair determines that an extension is necessary.
* '''(h) Termination.'''  The Chair shall terminate the Special Task Force upon the completion of its duties.}}

On 2 November 2009 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that victims of extraordinary rendition cannot sue Washington for torture suffered overseas, because Congress has not authorized such lawsuits, in ruling on Canadian citizen Maher Arar's case.&lt;ref name=maher_arar_appeal_rejected&gt;{{cite web | title= Appeals Court Rules in Maher Arar Case: Innocent Victims of Extraordinary Rendition Cannot Sue in US Courts | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/11/3/appeals_court_rules_in_maher_arar| accessdate=4 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September 2010 [[PolitiFact.com]] wrote about the Obama administration's record on renditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The administration has announced new procedural safeguards concerning individuals who are sent to foreign countries. President Obama also promised to shut down the CIA-run "black sites," and there seems to be anecdotal evidence that extreme renditions are not happening, at least not as much as they did during the Bush administration. Still, human rights groups say that these safeguards are inadequate and that the DOJ Task Force recommendations still allow the U.S. to send individuals to foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Obama's extreme rendition policy is issued, but results still uncertain | url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/176/end-the-use-of-extreme-rendition/ |accessdate=7 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other Countries ==

=== CIA participating countries ===
According to a report by the [[Open Society Foundations]], 54 countries participated at one point or another with the CIA's extraordinary rendition program:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/globalizing-torture-cia-secret-detention-and-extraordinary-rendition|title=Globalizing Torture: CIA Secret Detention and Extraordinary Rendition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fact-checking''' is the act of checking factual assertions in [[non-fiction]]al text in order to determine the veracity and correctness of the factual statements in the text.

'''Ante hoc fact-checking''' (fact-checking before dissemination) aims to remove errors and allow text to proceed to dissemination (or to rejection if it fails confirmations or other criteria). '''Post hoc fact-checking''' is most often followed by a written report of inaccuracies, sometimes with a visual metric from the checking organization (e.g., [[#Organizations and individuals|Pinocchios]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ''Fact Checker,'' or ''TRUTH-O-METER'' ratings from [[PolitiFact]]). Several organizations are devoted to ''post hoc'' fact-checking, such as [[FactCheck.org]] and [[PolitiFact.com|PolitiFact]].

Research on the impact of fact-checking is relatively recent but the existing research suggests that fact-checking does indeed correct misperceptions among citizens, as well as discourage politicians from spreading misinformation.

== Post hoc fact-checking ==

=== Consistency across fact-checkers ===
One study finds that fact-checkers PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and ''Washington Post's'' Fact Checker overwhelmingly agree on their evaluations of claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amazeen|first=Michelle A.|date=1 October 2016|title=Checking the Fact-Checkers in 2008: Predicting Political Ad Scrutiny and Assessing Consistency|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15377857.2014.959691|journal=Journal of Political Marketing|volume=15|issue=4|pages=433–464|doi=10.1080/15377857.2014.959691|issn=1537-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amazeen|first=Michelle A.|date=2 January 2015|title=Revisiting the Epistemology of Fact-Checking|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08913811.2014.993890|journal=Critical Review|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1080/08913811.2014.993890|issn=0891-3811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study by Morgan Marietta, David C. Barker and Todd Bowser found "substantial differences in the questions asked and the answers offered." They concluded that this limited the "usefulness of fact-checking for citizens trying to decide which version of disputed realities to believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Barker|first2=David C.|last3=Bowser|first3=Todd|date=2015|title=Fact-Checking Polarized Politics: Does The Fact-Check Industry Provide Consistent Guidance on Disputed Realities?|url=https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Marietta-Barker-Bowser-2015-Forum.pdf|journal=[[American Press Institute|The Forum]]|volume=13|page=577|last1=Marietta|first1=Morgan|accessdate=27 September 2016|doi=10.1515/for-2015-0040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by Chloe Lim, Ph.D. student at Stanford University, finds little overlap in the statements that fact-checkers check. Out of 1065 fact-checks by PolitiFact and 240 fact-checks by ''The Washington Post''{{'}}s Fact-Checker, there were only 70 statements that both fact-checkers checked. The study found that the fact-checkers gave consistent ratings for 56 out of 70 statements, which means that one out every five times, the two fact-checkers disagree on the accuracy of statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_wUaJ01JSddZTNWVWpkRzVXUzg/view|title=Checking how fact-checkers check|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects ===
Studies of ''post hoc'' fact-checking have made clear that such efforts often result in changes in the behavior, in general, of both the speaker (making them more careful in their pronouncements) and of the listener or reader (making them more discerning with regard to the factual accuracy of content); observations include the propensities of audiences to be completely unswayed by corrections to errors regarding the most divisive subjects, or the tendency to be more greatly persuaded by corrections of negative reporting (e.g., "attack ads"), and to see minds changed only when the individual in error was someone reasonably like-minded to begin with.&lt;ref name="AmazeenWaPost15"&gt;Amazeen, Michelle (2015) "Monkey Cage: Sometimes political fact-checking works. Sometimes it doesn't. Here's what can make the difference.," ''The Washington Post'' (online), 3 June 2015, see [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/03/sometimes-political-fact-checking-works-sometimes-it-doesnt-heres-what-can-make-the-difference/], accessed 27 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Correcting misperceptions ====
A 2015 study found evidence a "backfire effect" (correcting false information may make partisan individuals cling more strongly to their views): "Corrective information adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website significantly reduced belief in the myth that the flu vaccine can give you the flu as well as concerns about its safety. However, the correction also significantly reduced intent to vaccinate among respondents with high levels of concern about vaccine side effects--a response that was not observed among those with low levels of concern."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nyhan|first=Brendan|last2=Reifler|first2=Jason|date=9 January 2015|title=Does correcting myths about the flu vaccine work?

A 2016 study found little evidence for the "backfire effect": "By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Thomas|last2=Porter|first2=Ethan|date=5 August 2016|title=The Elusive Backfire Effect: Mass Attitudes' Steadfast Factual Adherence|ssrn=2819073}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[Donald Trump]] supporters during the 2016 race similarly found little evidence for the backfire effect: "When respondents read a news article about Mr. Trump's speech that included F.B.I. statistics indicating that crime had "fallen dramatically and consistently over time," their misperceptions about crime declined compared with those who saw a version of the article that omitted corrective information (though misperceptions persisted among a sizable minority)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/upshot/fact-checking-can-change-views-we-rate-that-as-mostly-true.html|title=Fact-Checking Can Change Views?

Studies have shown that fact-checking can affect citizens' belief in the accuracy of claims made in political advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fridkin|first=Kim|last2=Kenney|first2=Patrick J.|last3=Wintersieck|first3=Amanda|date=2 January 2015|title=Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire: How Fact-Checking Influences Citizens' Reactions to Negative Advertising|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2014.914613|journal=Political Communication|volume=32|issue=1|pages=127–151|doi=10.1080/10584609.2014.914613|issn=1058-4609}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by a group of [[Paris School of Economics]] and [[Sciences Po]] economists found that falsehoods by [[Marine Le Pen]] during the 2017 French presidential election campaign (i) successfully persuaded voters, (ii) lost their persuasiveness when fact-checked, and (iii) did not reduce voters' political support for Le Pen when her claims were fact-checked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=Barrera|last2=David|first2=Oscar|last3=Guriev|first3=Sergei M.|last4=Henry|first4=Emeric|last5=Zhuravskaya|first5=Ekaterina|date=18 July 2017|title=Facts, Alternative Facts, and Fact Checking in Times of Post-Truth Politics|ssrn=3004631}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study in the ''Journal of Politics'' found that "individuals consistently update political beliefs in the appropriate direction, even on facts that have clear implications for political party reputations, though they do so cautiously and with some bias...

A study by Yale University cognitive scientists Gordon Pennycook and [[David G. Rand]] found that Facebook tags of fake articles "did significantly reduce their perceived accuracy relative to a control without tags, but only modestly".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennycook|first=Gordon|last2=Rand|first2=David G.|date=12 September 2017|title=Assessing the Effect of "Disputed" Warnings and Source Salience on Perceptions of Fake News Accuracy|ssrn=3035384}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dartmouth study led by Brendan Nyhan found that Facebook tags had a greater impact than the Yale study found.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/upshot/why-the-fact-checking-at-facebook-needs-to-be-checked.html|title=Why the Fact-Checking at Facebook Needs to Be Checked|last=Nyhan|first=Brendan|date=2017-10-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "disputed" tag on a false headline reduced the number of respondents who considered the headline accurate from 29% to 19%, whereas a "rated false" tag pushed the number down to 16%.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Yale study found evidence of a backfire effect among Trump supporters younger than 26 years whereby the presence of both untagged and tagged fake articles made the untagged fake articles appear more accurate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In response to research which questioned the effectiveness of the Facebook "disputed" tags, Facebook decided to drop the tags in December 2017 and would instead put articles which fact-checked a fake news story next to the fake news story link whenever it is shared on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.axios.com/facebook-drops-fake-news-flags-because-they-had-reverse-effect-2520310212.html|title=Facebook stops putting "Disputed Flags" on fake news because it doesn't work|date=2017-12-27|work=Axios|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the findings of a 2017 study in the journal ''Psychological Science,'' the most effective ways to reduce misinformation through corrections is by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/business/media/fight-fake-news.html|title=How to Fight 'Fake News' (Warning: It Isn't Easy)|last=Chokshi|first=Niraj|date=18 September 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=19 September 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* limiting detailed descriptions of / or arguments in favor of the misinformation; 
* walking through the reasons why a piece of misinformation is false rather than just labelling it false; 
* presenting new and credible information which allows readers to update their knowledge of events and understand why they developed an inaccurate understanding in the first place; 
* using video, as videos appear to be more effective than text at increasing attention and reducing confusion, making videos more effective at correcting misperception than text.
A forthcoming study in the ''Journal of Experimental Political Science'' found "strong evidence that citizens are willing to accept corrections to fake news, regardless of their ideology and the content of the fake stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Ethan|last2=Wood|first2=Thomas|last3=Kirby|first3=David|date=2017-11-17|title=Sex Trafficking, Russian Infiltration, Birth Certificates, and Pedophilia: A Survey Experiment Correcting Fake News|ssrn=3073294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by Andrew Guess (of Princeton University), Brendan Nyhan (Dartmouth College) and Jason Reifler (University of Exeter) found that consumers of fake news tended to have less favorable views of fact-checking, in particular Trump supporters.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-2016.pdf|title=Selective Exposure to Misinformation: Evidence from the consumption of fake news during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper found that fake news consumers rarely encountered fact-checks: "only about half of the Americans who visited a [[fake news website]] during the study period also saw any fact-check from one of the dedicated fact-checking website (14.0%)."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that Republicans were more likely to correct their false information on voter fraud if the correction came from Breitbart News rather than a non-partisan neutral source such as PolitiFact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=They See Dead People (Voting): Correcting Misperceptions about Voter Fraud in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15377857.2018.1478656?journalCode=wplm20|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/15377857.2018.1478656|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political discourse ====
A 2015 experimental study found that fact-checking can encourage politicians to not spread misinformation. The study found that it might help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. The researchers sent, "a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Effect of Fact-Checking on Elites: A Field Experiment on U.S. State Legislators|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12162/abstract|journal = American Journal of Political Science|date = 1 July 2015|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 628–40|volume = 59|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12162|first = Brendan|last = Nyhan|first2 = Jason|last2 = Reifler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political preferences ====

A study of Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign found that while fact-checks of false claims made by Trump reduced his supporters' belief in the false claims in question, the corrections did not alter their attitudes towards Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=n.d. |first=Brendan |last=Nyhan |authorlink=Brendan Nyhan |first2=Ethan |last2=Porter |first3=Jason |last3=Reifler |first4=Thomas J. |last4=Wood |title=Taking Fact-checks Literally But Not Seriously?

== Ante hoc fact-checking ==
Among the benefits of printing only checked copy is that it averts serious, sometimes costly, problems, e.g. lawsuits and [[Discrediting tactic|discreditation]]. Fact-checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes; they are not [[guarantee]]d safeguards against those who wish to commit [[journalistic fraud]]s

The possible societal benefit of honing the fundamental skill of fact-checking has been noted in a round table discussion by Moshe Benovitz, who observes that "modern students use their wireless worlds to augment skepticism and to reject dogma," but goes on to argue that this has positive implications for values development. He argues:{{quote|1="We can encourage our students to embrace information and vigorously pursue accuracy and veracity. Fact-checking can become a learned skill, and technology can be harnessed in a way that makes it second nature… By finding opportunities to integrate technology into learning, students will automatically sense the beautiful blending of… their cyber… [and non-virtual worlds]. Instead of two spheres coexisting uneasily and warily orbiting one another, there is a valuable experience of synthesis…".&lt;ref name=Benovitz12&gt;Moshe Benovitz et al., 2012, "Education: The Social Media Revolution: What Does It Mean for Our Children?" ''Jewish Action'' (online), August 24, 2012, New York, NY, USA:Orthodox Union, see [https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/08/2012/the-social-media-revolution-what-does-it-mean-for-our-children/], accessed 28 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He closes, noting that this constitutes "new opportunities for students to contribute to the discussion like never before, inserting technology positively into academic settings" (rather than it being seen as purely as agent of distraction).&lt;ref name=Benovitz12/&gt;

===Controversy===
One journalistic controversy is that of admitted and disgraced reporter and plagiarist [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]], who began his journalism career as a fact-checker. The fact-checkers at ''[[The New Republic]]'' and other weeklies for which he worked never flagged the numerous fictions in Glass's [[reportage|reporting]]. [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], who edited some of Glass's concocted stories, blamed himself, rather than the fact-checkers, saying: "Any fact-checking system is built on trust ... If a reporter is willing to fake notes, it defeats the system. Anyway, the real vetting system is not fact-checking but the editor." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Watson |url=https://factchecksrilanka.com/2017/04/02/what-is-fact-checking/ |title=What is Fact Checking? – FactCheck Sri Lanka |publisher=Factchecksrilanka.com |date=2017-04-02 |accessdate=2017-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015349/https://factchecksrilanka.com/2017/04/02/what-is-fact-checking/ |archive-date=7 November 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individuals===
* Sarah Harrison Smith spent some time and also headed the fact-checking department for ''[[The New York Times]]''. She is the author of the book, ''The Fact Checker's Bible''.
* Jim Fingal worked for several years as a fact-checker at ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'' and ''[[McSweeney's]]'' and is co-author with [[John D'Agata]] of ''The Lifespan of a Fact'' which is an inside look of a battle between himself as fact-checker and author D'Agata regarding one of his essays that pushes the limits of "artistic license" that is acceptable of a non-fiction work.

Jacoby and Dallas (1981) found that if an object "jumps out" at a person and is readily perceived, then they have likely seen it before even if they do not consciously remember seeing it.&lt;ref name="JacobyDallas1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacoby|first1=Larry|last2=Dallas|first2=Mark|title=On the relationship between autobiographical memory and perceptual learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=110|issue=3|year=1981|pages=306–340|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.3.306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''As a proxy for real-world quantities:'''

Hertwig et al. (2008) investigated whether retrieval fluency, like [[Recognition heuristic|recognition]], is a proxy for real-world quantities across five different reference classes in which they expected retrieval fluency to be effective.&lt;ref name="Hertwig2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertwig|first1=Ralph|last2=Herzog|first2=Stefan M.|last3=Schooler|first3=Lael J.|last4=Reimer|first4=Torsten|title=Fluency heuristic: A model of how the mind exploits a by-product of information retrieval|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=2008|volume=34|issue=5|pages=1191–1206|doi=10.1037/a0013025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

a) cities in the U.S with more than 100,000 inhabitants

b) the 100 German companies with the highest revenue in 2003

c) the top 106 music artists in the U.S. in terms of cumulative sales of recordings from 1958 to 2003

d) the highest paid athletes of 2004

e) the 100 wealthiest people in the world

Hertwig et al. measured response time latencies for participants presented with each object. The names of objects were presented in random order and participants were asked if they recognized each object.  Hertwig et al. found that differences in recognition latencies are indicative of criteria across five different environments. The strength of the relationship varied across environments. Environments with low ecological validity such as the companies and music artists environments yielded low levels of fluency across five environments. The resulting data provides evidence for the idea that we can at least theoretically infer distal properties of the world.&lt;ref name="Hertwig2008"/&gt;

'''Are people able to exploit retrieval fluency?'''

To exploit retrieval fluency, people need to be able to judge accurately whether recognizing object a's name takes longer than recognizing object b's name, or vice versa. Hertwig et al. investigated the extent to which people can accurately tell such differences apart. They observed three results: First, people prove to be quite good at discriminating between recognition latencies whose differences exceeds 100 ms. Second, even when taking less-than perfectly accurate discriminations into account, subjective fluency judgments are a moderately good predictor of the criterion, except in environments in which ecological validity of fluency information is too low to begin with (e.g. music artist's environment). Last, they found that people's ability to discriminate is highest for those pairs in which the validity of fluency peaks.&lt;ref name="Hertwig2008"/&gt;

'''Are people's inferences in line with the fluency heuristic?'''

In about two thirds to three fourths of inferences in which the fluency heuristic was applicable, people's actual choices conformed to those predicted by the heuristic. Hertwig et al. also found that the larger the difference between recognition latencies (for two objects), the greater the likelihood that the actual inference adheres to that predicted by the fluency heuristic.&lt;ref name="Hertwig2008"/&gt;

'''Neural correlates of the fluency heuristic:'''

Volz, Schooler, and von Cramon (2010) used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] to isolate fluency-heuristic-based judgments to map the use of fluency onto specific brain areas that might give a better understanding of the heuristic's underlying processes. They determined that there was activation within the [[claustrum]] for fluency heuristic decisions. Given that claustrum activation is thought to reflect the integration of perceptual and memory elements into a conscious gestalt, they suggest that activation correlates with the experience of fluency.&lt;ref name="Volz2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volz|first1=Kirsten G.|last2=Schooler|first2=Lael J.|last3=von Cramon|first3=D. Yves|title=It just felt right: The neural correlates of the fluency heuristic|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=2010|volume=19|issue=3|pages=829–837|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.05.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The effect of repetition:'''

Lloyd, Westerman, and Miller (2003) used five experiments to investigate whether the attribution of processing fluency to recognition memory depends on the amount of fluency that is expected from targets based on the frequency with which they appeared during an earlier study phase. Subjects studied targets either one or five times and then were given a recognition test that included a [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] phase to enhance the fluency of half of the test items. Results showed that the priming phase had a greater influence on recognition responses when targets had been presented once than when they had been presented five times. However, an interaction between fluency and target frequency was found only when frequency was manipulated [[Between-group design|between-subjects]]. An interaction between the priming manipulation and target frequency was also found using a "counterfeit" manipulation of frequency, suggesting that attributions of fluency are adjusted according to subjects' expectations for the amount of fluency that should result from previous experiences with a stimulus.&lt;ref name="Lloyd2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd|first1=Marianne E |title=The fluency heuristic in recognition memory: The effect of repetition|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=2003|volume=48|issue=3|pages=603–614|doi=10.1016/S0749-596X(02)00535-1|first2=Deanne L |last2=Westerman|first3= Jeremy K |last3=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7734">The '''free will theorem''' of [[John Horton Conway|John H. Conway]] and [[Simon B. Kochen]] states that if we have a [[free will]] in the sense that our choices are not a function of the past, then, subject to certain assumptions, so must some [[elementary particles]]. Conway and Kochen's paper was published in ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Conway | first = John |author2=Simon Kochen | year = 2006 | title = The Free Will Theorem | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 36 | issue = 10 | pages = 1441 | doi = 10.1007/s10701-006-9068-6 |arxiv = quant-ph/0604079 |bibcode = 2006FoPh...36.1441C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 they published a stronger version of the theorem in the [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society|Notices of the AMS]].&lt;ref name=Later&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Conway, John H. |author2=Simon Kochen |title=The strong free will theorem |journal= Notices of the AMS |volume=56 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=226–232 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200226p.pdf?q=will&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=k71jU8X7DoypyASw9YGoCA&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAB&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7L-k87yWE32ru0rDjkLOdg12LRQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Simon  elaborated some details.&lt;ref&gt;Kochen S., (2017), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00868''Born's Rule, EPR, and the Free Will Theorem'' ] [[arxiv]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
The proof of the theorem as originally formulated relies on three axioms, which Conway and Kochen call "fin", "spin", and "twin". The spin and twin axioms can be verified experimentally.
# Fin: There is a maximal [[speed]] for propagation of [[information]] (not necessarily the [[speed of light]]). This assumption rests upon [[causality]].
# Spin: The squared [[spin (physics)|spin]] component of certain elementary particles of spin one, taken in three orthogonal directions, will be a permutation of (1,1,0).
# Twin: It is possible to "entangle" two elementary particles and separate them by a significant distance, so that they have the same squared spin results if measured in parallel directions.  This is a consequence of [[quantum entanglement]], but full entanglement is not necessary for the ''twin'' axiom to hold (entanglement is sufficient but not necessary).

In their later paper, "The Strong Free Will Theorem",&lt;ref name=Later/&gt; Conway and Kochen replace the Fin axiom by a weaker one called Min, thereby strengthening the theorem. Min asserts only that two experimenters separated in a [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|space-like]] way can make choices of measurements independently of each other. In particular it is not postulated that the speed of transfer of ''all'' information is subject to a maximum limit, but only of the particular information about choices of measurements.

== The theorem ==
The free will theorem states:
 
{{quotation|Given the axioms, if the two experimenters in question are free to make choices about what measurements to take, then the results of the measurements cannot be determined by anything previous to the experiments.}} That is an "outcome open" theorem.

{{quotation|If the outcome of an experiment was open, then one or two of the experimenters might have acted under free will.}}

Since the theorem applies to any arbitrary physical theory consistent with the axioms, it would not even be possible to place the information into the universe's past in an ad hoc way. The argument proceeds from the [[Kochen–Specker theorem]], which shows that the result of any individual measurement of spin was not fixed independently of the choice of measurements. As stated by Cator and Landsman regarding [[Hidden-variable theory|hidden-variable theories]]:&lt;ref name=Cator&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cator, Eric |author2=Klaas Landsman |title=Constraints on determinism: Bell versus Conway–Kochen |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=44 |issue=7 |year=2014 |pages=781–791 |doi=10.1007/s10701-014-9815-z|arxiv = 1402.1972 |bibcode = 2014FoPh...44..781C }}&lt;/ref&gt; "There has been a similar tension between the idea that the hidden variables (in the pertinent causal past) should on the one hand include all ontological information relevant to the experiment, but on the other hand should leave the experimenters free to choose any settings they like."

==Reception==

According to Cator and Landsman&lt;ref name=Cator/&gt;, Conway and Kochen prove that "determinism is incompatible with a number of ''a priori'' desirable assumptions". Cator and Landsman compare the Min assumption to the locality assumption in [[Bell's theorem]] and conclude in the strong free will theorem's favor that it "uses fewer assumptions than Bell’s 1964 theorem, as no appeal to probability theory is made". The philosopher David Hodgson supports this theorem as showing quite conclusively that "science does not support determinism": that quantum mechanics proves that particles do indeed behave in a way that is not a function of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Hodgson |title=Rationality + Consciousness = Free Will |chapter=Chapter 7: Science and determinism |isbn=9780199845309 |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SGsmowYARsC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Conway+and+Kochen+call+the+free+will+theorem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UiMYVeTBII3woATFkoKAAQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Conway%20and%20Kochen%20call%20the%20free%20will%20theorem%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue that the theorem applies only to deterministic models.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Goldstein, Daniel V.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intellectually, it was based on the close relationship between the library and the teaching departments.  The library at UCL rejected the major published classification schemes because "none of them would generally acceptable to the teaching departments without such major modifications as would have destroyed its essential character."&lt;ref name="Garside1955" /&gt;
instead, it was modeled around the "subject reading rooms" into which the collection had been divided.  The intent was to utilise the expertise of the departments, and their teaching needs in drawing up the divisions within the scheme.

==Main outline==

The principles of the scheme were "To provide the optimum arrangement of books in each subject; to permit the revision of the classification to meet a changing academic approach to a subject without disturbing in any way other parts of the scheme; and to provide as simple a shelf mark as possible to help the reader find the book he wants with the minimum mental effort." &lt;ref name=Folklore&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article ''The basic principles of the new library classification at University College London''&lt;ref name="Garside1955" /&gt; Garside set out the generic structure of the system.  The library would be divided into subject based reading rooms such as, in the below example, a dedicated space for biology related materials. These would then be subdivided according to the below table, using alphabetical characters:
{|border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|A
|The subject generally
|-
|B-W
|Main sections of the subject
|-
|X-Y
|Subsidiary works studied in conjunction with the main topic
|-
|Z
|Works not properly belonging to the subject but required to be shelved with it
|}

The alphabetical sub-divisions were designed in consultation with the teaching department.&lt;ref name=Folklore /&gt;
These subsections would then be divided by numbers:
{|border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|1
|Bibliographies
|-
|2
|Reference works
|-
|3
|Periodicals and series
|-
|4

|-
|5

|-
|6
|Miscellanies
|-
|7
|Monographs
|-
|8
|History of the subject
|-
|9
|Methodology
|-
|10 &gt;
|Special topics
|}

The completed shelf mark would then include the first three letters of the author's surname.

In an interview in the ''[[New York Press]]'' in 2002, McInnes said that he was pleased that most [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] were white.&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite web|date=8 October 2002|title=Vice Rising: Corporate Media Woos Magazine World's Punks|url=http://www.nypress.com/vice-rising-corporate-media-woos-magazine-worlds-punks/|publisher=New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; McInnes later wrote in a letter to [[Gawker]] that the interview was done as a prank intended to ridicule "baby boomer media like ''The Times''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavin McInnes |url=http://gawker.com/013468/letter-to-gawker-from-gavin-mcinnes |title=Letter to Gawker from Gavin McInnes |publisher=Gawker.com |date= |accessdate=10 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070627/http://gawker.com/013468/letter-to-gawker-from-gavin-mcinnes |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After he became the focus of a letter-writing campaign by a black reader, ''Vice'' apologized for McInnes's comments.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; McInnes was featured in a 2003 ''[[New York Times]]'' article about ''Vice'' magazine expressing his political views.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/28/style/the-edge-of-hip-vice-the-brand.html|title=The Edge of Hip: Vice, the Brand|date=28 September 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McInnes was featured in Season 3 of the Canadian reality TV show ''[[Kenny vs. Spenny]]'', as a judge in the "Who is Cooler?" episode. In 2010, McInnes was approached by [[Adult Swim]] and asked to play the part of Mick, an anthropomorphic Scottish soccer ball, in the short-lived ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' spin-off ''[[Soul Quest Overdrive]]''.&lt;ref name="roosternewyork.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roosternewyork.com/2011/05/adult-swim-soul-quest-overdrive/|title=ADULT SWIM – SOUL QUEST OVERDRIVE|publisher=Rooster|date=27 May 2011|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After losing a 2010 pilot contest to ''[[Cheyenne Cinnamon and the Fantabulous Unicorn of Sugar Town Candy Fudge]]'', six episodes of ''Soul Quest Overdrive'' were ordered, with four airing in Adult Swim's 4 AM DVR Theater block on 25 May 2011 before quickly being cancelled. McInnes jokingly blamed the show's cancellation on the other cast members ([[Kristen Schaal]], [[David Cross]], and [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) not being "as funny" as him.&lt;ref name="streetcarnage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://streetcarnage.com/blog/soul-quest-overdrive-watch-the-whole-series-here/|title=SOUL QUEST OVERDRIVE: WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES HERE|publisher=StreetCarnage.com|date=27 May 2011|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suspension was ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Unite the Right rally, and the scheduled [[2018 Unite the Right rally]].&lt;ref name="twitter1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mac |first1=Ryan |last2=Montgomery |first2=Blake |title=Twitter Suspends Proud Boys And Founder Gavin McInnes Accounts Ahead Of Unite The Right Rally |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/twitter-suspends-proud-boys-and-founder-gavin-mcinnes |accessdate=11 August 2018 |work=BuzzFeed News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Roettgers |first1=Janko |title=Twitter Shuts Down Accounts of Vice Co-Founder Gavin McInnes, Proud Boys Ahead of ‘Unite the Right’ Rally |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/twitter-shuts-down-accounts-of-vice-co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-proud-boys-ahead-of-unite-the-right-rally-1202902397/ |accessdate=11 August 2018 |work=Variety |date=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 2018, McInnes participated in a reenactment of the 1960 assassination of [[Inejiro Asanuma]] by [[Otoya Yamaguchi]] at the Metropolitan Republican Club. After the event, a contingent of Proud Boys were caught on tape beating a protester outside the venue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gavin McInnes 'Personally I think the guy was looking to get beat up for optics' |url=https://spectator.us/2018/10/gavin-mcinnes/ |website=Spectator USA |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; after members of [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]] threw a plastic bottle filled with urine at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Feuer |first1=Alan |title=Founder of Proud Boys Says He’s Arranging Surrender of Men in Brawl |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/nyregion/the-proud-boys-gavin-mcinnes-arrested.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 16, 2018 |language=en |quote=The police said the violence started after one of the leftist protesters threw a plastic bottle at the Proud Boys, who had with them members of far-right groups, like the 211 Bootboys and Batalion 49.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21st, shortly after news broke that, according to an alleged, unconfirmed Police report, the FBI had classified the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to white nationalists, McInnes said that his lawyers had advised him that quitting might help the nine members being prosecuted for the incidents in October and he said "this is 100% a legal gesture, and it is 100% about alleviating sentencing", and said it was a "stepping down gesture, in quotation marks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes quits 'extremist' far-right group|author=Wilson, Jason|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/proud-boys-founder-gavin-mcinnes-quits-far-right-group |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 21, 2018|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prengel |first1=Kate |title=Gavin McInnes Says He Is Quitting the Proud Boys [VIDEO] |url=https://heavy.com/news/2018/11/gavin-mcinnes-quits-proud-boys-video/ |work=Heavy.com |date=November 21,  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later that month, McInnes was planning on traveling to Australia for a speaking tour with [[Milo Yiannopolous]] and [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] (Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), but was informed by Australian immigration authorities that "he was judged to be of bad character" and would be denied a visa to enter the country.  Issuing a visa to McInnes was opposed by an online campaign called "#BanGavin", which collected 81,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jason (November 30, 2018) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/30/gavin-mcinnes-proud-boys-australia-visa "Gavin McInnes: founder of far-right Proud Boys denied Australian visa – report"] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 McInnes said, "I love being white and I think it's something to be very proud of. I don't want our culture diluted.

===Judaism and anti-Semitism===
In March 2017, during a trip to Israel with The Rebel Media, McInnes made controversial comments defending [[Holocaust deniers]], accused the Jews of being responsible for the [[Holodomor]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and said he was "becoming anti-Semitic". He later said his comments were taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Islam===
McInnes is [[Islamophobia|anti-Islam]].&lt;ref name="VillageVoice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wpr.org/controversial-proud-boys-embrace-western-values-reject-feminism-and-political-correctness |title=Controversial Proud Boys Embrace 'Western Values,' Reject Feminism And Political Correctness |date=26 November 2017 |publisher=[[Wisconsin Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that "Muslims are stupid ... the only thing they really respect is [[violence]] and being tough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/features/inside-ezra-levants-rebel-media |title=Inside Rebel Media |date=16 August 2018 |publisher=''[[National Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has equated Islam with fascism, stating "[[Nazis]] are not a thing.

They tend to marry their first cousins... and that is a major problem [in the U.S.] because when you have mentally damaged inbreds – which not all Muslims are, but a disproportionate number are – and you have a hate book called the [[Koran]]... you end up with a perfect recipe for [[mass murder]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys |title=Proud Boys |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

===Gender===
McInnes has described himself as "an [[Archie Bunker]] sexist."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As early as 2003, [[Vanessa Grigoriadis]] in ''The New York Times'' quoted McInnes saying, "'No means no' is puritanism. I think Steinem-era feminism did women a lot of injustices, but one of the worst ones was convincing all these indie norts that women don't want to be dominated."&lt;ref name="Grigoriadis" /&gt; McInnes has been accused of [[sexism]] by various [[media outlets]] including ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sutton |first=Scott |author-link= |date=15 May 2015 |title=Gavin McInnes might be the most sexist man on the planet |url=http://national.suntimes.com/national-politics/7/72/1126269/gavin-mcinnes-most-sexist-man-on-the-planet/ |dead-url=yes |department=National |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518013148/http://national.suntimes.com/national-politics/7/72/1126269/gavin-mcinnes-most-sexist-man-on-the-planet|archive-date=2015-05-18|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Independent Journal Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ijr.com/2015/05/326424-gavin-mcinnes-explains-sexist-comments-that-ruffled-feathers-by-totally-doubling-down-on-them/ |title=Gavin McInnes Explains 'Sexist' Comments That Ruffled Feathers...By Totally Doubling Down on Them |last=Bonk |first=Lawrence |author-link= |date=20 May 2015 |website=[[Independent Journal Review]] |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2017/03/16/bad-boy-gone-worse-is-vice-co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-flirting-with-a-dangerous-fringe/ |title=Bad boy gone worse: Is Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes flirting with a dangerous fringe? |last=Marcotte |first=Amanda |author-link=  |date=16 March 2017 |website=[[Salon (website)]] |publisher=  |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/vice-co-founder-throws-epic-tantrum-about-women-defying-1450163938|title=Vice Co-Founder Throws Epic Tantrum About Women Defying Gender Roles|first=Madeleine|last=Davies |date=22 October 2013 |website=[[Jezebel (website)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gavin-mcinnes-interview-im-not-796177|title=Vice Co-Founder Gavin McInnes on Trolling Feminists: I'm Not Andy Kaufman; This Isn't a Joke|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/10/31/gavin_mcinnes_says_women_work_because_they_are_forced_to_pretend_to_be_men.html |title=Most Women Work Because They Have To|first=Amanda|last=Marcotte|date=31 October 2013|website=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, McInnes said during a panel interview that "people would be happier if women would stop pretending to be men", and that [[feminism]] "has made women less happy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/10/vice-co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-feminism-has-made-women-less-happy/ |title=Gavin McInnes: 'Feminism has Made Women Less Happy' |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that "We've trivialized childbirth and being domestic so much that women are forced to pretend to be men.

==Age of formation==
There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's [[Language acquisition|lack of language]] requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"&gt;Boles, 2013. Pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few authorities say it forms between ages 3-4 rather than precisely at age 3, e.g. George J. Bryjak and Michael P. Soraka, ''Sociology: Cultural Diversity in a Changing World'' (ed. Karen Hanson), Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997; 209-245&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bates Doob, ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society''&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Coleman, ''Developmental stages of the coming out process'', in ''Journal of homosexuality'', 1982: "Core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 (Money &amp; Ehrhardt, 1972). This is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth&lt;ref name="Kleeman"&gt;J.

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this "peak of rigidity," fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C. | last2 = Ruble | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Children's Search for Gender Cues Cognitive Perspectives on Gender Development | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13| issue = 2|pages = 67–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning [[gender role]] standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newmann|first=Barbara|title=Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111344665|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTY_7osGmqUC|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing formation==

===Nature vs. nurture===
{{Main|Nature versus nurture}}

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as "nature versus nurture". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"&gt;''Effects of male sex hormones on gender identity, sexual behavior, and cognitive function'', ''Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao, Yi Xue Ban'' (''Journal of Central South University, Medical Sciences''), April 2006, 31(2):149-61&lt;/ref&gt; While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not inflexibly determine it.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Golombok, Robyn Fivush, ''Gender Development'' (1994, {{ISBN|0521408628}}), page 44: "When assigned and raised as boys, these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role, showing that a Y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction."&lt;/ref&gt;

Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life.&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=978-0-536-94185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/factors-influencing-gender-identity/|title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Michael, "Cultural Identity, Language Identity, Gender Identity", "The English Academy of South Africa", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social learning theory]] posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way,&lt;ref name=myers&gt;Myers, David G. (2008). ''Psychology''. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C.

A well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of [[David Reimer]], otherwise known as "John/Joan". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781308211503|pages=368|edition=6}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Carol |author2=Diane Ruble |author3=Joel Szkrybalo |title=Cognitive Theories of Early Gender Development |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2002 |volume=128|issue=6 |pages=903–913|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 |pmid=12405137|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Several prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shuvo|title=Gender Identity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/917990-overview|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization.

Hormonal influences are also complex; [[Sexual differentiation in humans|sex-determining hormones]] are produced at an early stage of foetal development,&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke, ''In Pursuit Of Difference, scientific studies of women and men'', in ''The Gender and Science Reader'', page 310&lt;/ref&gt; and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|date=2017-02-02|title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=170–182|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006|issn=0091-3022| pmc=3296090 |pmid=21333673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones may affect differences between males' and females' verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with "women's sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke suggests that during the early stage of fetal development, specific hormones will enter the brain and “permanently affect how the hypothalamus works. As before, high levels of hormones known as androgens will stop the hypothalamus from ever organizing hormone cycles. If there are low levels, then it will be cyclic.” This early influence on brain determines the different frequency of hormone secretion later in male or female’s life. “Obviously, women’s sex hormones usually follow a monthly cycle,” while “men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.” {{cite book|last=Birke|first=Lynda|title=The Gender and Science Reader|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised [[46,XY]] persons with [[penile agenesis]], [[cloacal exstrophy]] of the bladder, or penile [[ablation]], found that 78% of the study subjects were living as female, as opposed to 22% who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=423–38 |pmid=16010465 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9 |title=Gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile ablation |last=Meyer-Bahlburg |first=HF |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study concludes: "The findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood, but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens."

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity.

Swaab, ''Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation'', in ''Gynecological Endocrinology'', 2004: "...direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation. Solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. C. Wallien, ''Psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the attitudes of the child's parents may affect the child's gender identity, although evidence is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;M Weinraub, LP Clemens, A Sockloff, T Ethridge, ''The development of sex role stereotypes in the third year: relationships to gender labeling, gender identity, sex-types toy preference, and family characteristics'', in ''Child Development'', 1984: "Previous investigators have failed to observe a relationship between parental attitudes and children's early sex role acquisition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parental establishment of gender roles====
Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"/&gt; Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite book|last=Spade|first =Joan|title=The Kaleidoscope of Gender|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=978-1-4129-7906-1|pages= 177–184|date =2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; with Kane stating that "the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity."&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as [[ultrasound]]. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class "professional" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Hillary Paul|title=Parents' Gender Ideology and Gendered Behavior as Predictors of Children's Gender-Role Attitudes: A Longitudinal Exploration|journal=Sex Roles|volume=74|issue=11–12|pages=527–542|doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0539-0|pmid=27445431|pmc=4945126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

In recent decades it has become possible to [[sex reassignment surgery|reassign sex surgically]]. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see [[transsexual]] for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms ''gender identity'' and ''core gender identity'' were first used with their current meaning — one's personal experience of one's own gender&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101"&gt;Boles, 2013. Page 101: "Gender identity is the individual's personal and private experience of his/her gender."&lt;/ref&gt; — sometime in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=GID&gt;"The term 'gender identity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. ... gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness." {{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the Psychology of Women and Gender'' (2004, {{ISBN|0471653578}}), page 102: "''Gender identity'' was introduced into the professional lexicon by Hooker and Stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s (see Money, 1985). For example, Stoller (1964) used the slightly different term ''core gender identity''..."&lt;/ref&gt; To this day they are usually used in that sense,&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the [[sexual orientation]] and [[sexual identity]] categories ''[[gay]]'', ''[[lesbian]]'' and ''[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brym, Roberts, Lie, Rytina. "Sociology". Nelson Education Ltd., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called "inverts", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a "dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework". During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their "correct" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.&lt;ref name = Padawer&gt;{{cite news|last=Padawer|first=Ruth|title=What's So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress?| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress.html | accessdate = October 29, 2012|work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud and Jung's views===
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] presented his theory of [[psychosexual development]] in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the [[phallic stage]], at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt; In 1913, [[Carl Jung]] proposed the [[Electra complex]] as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freud | first1 = Sigmund | year = 1931 | title = Female Sexuality | url = | journal = The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume = 21 | issue = | page = 229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of [[homosexuality]] (which was viewed as a [[mental disorder]] at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] for the study of [[intersex]] and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst [[Robert Stoller]] generalized many of the findings of the project in his book ''Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity'' (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term ''gender identity'' to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] in 1963. Behavioral psychologist [[John Money]] was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medical School]]'s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an [[interactionist]] theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'' (1972) became widely used as a [[college textbook]], although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraway |first=Donna |authorlink=Donna Haraway |year=1991 |title=Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature |page=133 |publisher=[[Free Association Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-90386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] by Katrina Karkazis, Duke University Press, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's views===
In the late 1980s, [[Judith Butler]] began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]'', introducing the concept of [[gender performativity]] and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |year=1990 |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |pages=front/backmatter |publisher=[[Routledge Classic]] |location=London |isbn=978-0415389556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present views==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}&lt;!--also needs expansion--&gt;

===Medical field===
{{As of|2018}}, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Medical practitioners, as well as an increasing number of parents, generally no longer support or believe in the idea of [[conversion therapy]],&lt;ref name="nymag-7feb2016"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got a Leading Sex Researcher Fired|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely discredited as unethical and ineffective.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - prayer and pain"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tom Dart |title=Prayer and pain: why gay conversion therapy is still legal despite dangers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/gay-conversion-therapy-republican-party-platform |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=July 15, 2016 |ref=Prayer_and_pain |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stonewall - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conversion Therapy |url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy |website=Stonewall |publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=stonewall_conversion|date=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the [[NHS]], have concluded that conversion therapy to 'cure' sexual orientation is dangerous and work is being done to extend this position to include gender identity.&lt;ref name="MOU - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Memorandum-of-understanding-on-conversion-therapy.pdf |website=www.pyschotherapy.org |publisher=UKCP - UK Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=MOU_CT |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are still a number of clinicians who continue to believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name="Padawer"/&gt;

[[Transsexual]] self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their [[primary sexual characteristics]], secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, [[sex reassignment surgery]] is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|title=Sex and Gender are Different: Sexual Identity and Gender Identity are Different|journal=Clinical Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=7|issue=3|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2002-sex-and-gender.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, it was decided under the Affordable Care Act that [[health insurance exchange]]s would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Kellan|title=FAQ: Collecting Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2012/10/16/41620/faq-collecting-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-data/|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===
[[Gender dysphoria]] (previously called "gender identity disorder" or GID in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant [[dysphoria]] (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Identity Disorder | Psychology Today." Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness Find a Therapist. Psychology Today, 24 Oct. 2005.

The concept of gender identity appeared in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in its third edition, [[DSM-III]] (1980), in the form of two [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the [[DSM-III-R]], added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Historical Note"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zucker | first1 = KJ | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL  |date=Jan–Feb 2005 | title = Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a [[mental disorder]], speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,&lt;ref name="Historical Note"/&gt; although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.

===International human rights law===
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on the application of [[international human rights law]], provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual [[experience]] of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that "Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], ''Principle 3. The Right to recognition before the law''&lt;/ref&gt; and Principle 18 states that "Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, ''Principle 18. Protection from medical abuse''&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to this principle, the "Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles" observed that "Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected [[gender expression]], have been treated as a form of [[mental illness]]. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques — including [[electroshock therapy]] — as a 'cure'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles, page 43] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf |date=November 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Yogyakarta Principles in Action" says "it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, 'gender identity' or 'gender identity disorder' often remains in consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypinaction.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Activists_Guide_English_nov_14_2010.pdf|title=Activist's Guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, p. 100|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Principles influenced the [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]]
In 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges  in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-binary gender identities==
{{See also|Gender binary|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a [[gender binary|binary]] in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms ''non-binary'' or ''[[genderqueer]]''. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman." These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

===Fa'afafine===
{{Main|Fa'afafine}}
In some [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies, [[fa'afafine]] are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (''see references''), fa'afafine in [[Samoa]] at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Sua'ali'i, Tamasailau, "[[Samoa]]ns and Gender: Some Reflections on Male, Female and Fa'afafine Gender Identities", in: ''Tangata O Te Moana Nui: The Evolving Identities of Pacific Peoples in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]'', Palmerston North (NZ): Dunmore Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86469-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Johanna|title=Paradise Lost?

===Hijras===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}
In some cultures of [[Asia]], a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically [[male]] or [[intersex]], but some are anatomically [[female]]. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes [[prostitute]]s, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to [[transvestism|transvestites]] or [[drag queen]]s of contemporary western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khanith===
{{Main|Khanith}}
The [[khanith]] form an accepted third gender in [[Oman]]. The khanith are [[male]] [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]]s whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at [[wedding]]s or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their [[society]], khaniths can marry women, proving their [[masculinity]] by consummating the [[marriage]]. Should a [[divorce]] or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-spirit identities===
{{Main|Two-Spirit}}
&lt;!--section needs slight expansion--&gt;
Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North American Nations]] had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond [[cisgender]] man and woman, are now often collectively termed "two-spirit" or "two-spirited." There are parts of the community that take "two-spirit" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sarah|year=2016|title=An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|journal=National Collaborative Centre Aboriginal Health|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004508/http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''infinity plus one''' has meaning for the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]], and also as the number [[ω+1]] ([[omega]] plus one) in the [[ordinal number]]s and [[Surreal number#.22... and Beyond..22|surreal number]]s. 

== Mathematics ==
There are several mathematical theories which include both infinite values and addition.

* [[Cardinal number]]s are representations of sizes (cardinalities) of abstract sets, which may be [[infinite set|infinite]]. [[Cardinal addition|Addition of cardinal numbers]] is defined as the cardinality of the [[disjoint union]] of sets of given cardinalities. It can be easily shown that κ + 1 = κ for any infinite cardinal κ, as illustrated by [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]. Moreover, if one assumes the [[axiom of choice]], then κ + λ = max { κ, λ } if at least one of κ or λ is infinite.
* [[Ordinal number]]s represent [[order type]]s of [[well-order]]ed sets. [[Ordinal addition]] is defined as the order type of the [[concatenation]] of orders. This operation is not [[commutative]]: ω + 1 is a strictly larger ordinal than ω, but 1 + ω = ω.
* [[Hyperreal number]]s are an extension of the [[real number]] system which contains infinite and [[infinitesimal number]]s. The resulting system is an [[ordered field]] thanks to the [[transfer principle#Transfer principle for the hyperreals|transfer principle]], which states that any [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentence which is true for real numbers also holds for hyperreals. Since ∀''x'': ''x'' &amp;lt; ''x'' + 1 is a first-order sentence holding for reals (as it follows from the ordered field axioms), adding one to an infinite hyperreal produces infinity. The same will hold for any [[non-Archimedean ordered field]].
* [[Surreal number]]s also extend real numbers to a system which satisfies the axioms of an [[ordered field]], and so addition behaves similarly to hyperreals, in that ''x'' &amp;lt; ''x'' + 1 for all surreals ''x''. In this system, one may find elements corresponding to infinite ordinals; however, surreal addition and multiplication correspond not to the usual ordinal operations, but to the [[ordinal arithmetic#Natural operations|natural sum and natural product]].

The '''international trade in parrots''' is a lucrative enterprise, and forms an important part of the international [[wildlife trade]]. As [[parrot]]s have become increasingly endangered, many countries have placed restrictions on the trade and/or prohibited the trade altogether. Despite the restriction on trade in many countries however, the market still operates both legally and illegally.

Approximately 2,600 of the more than 9,600 species of birds in existence are subject to trade,&lt;ref name=Latin&gt;

==International trade==

===Top exporters===
The greatest number of parrots came from [[Latin America]]n countries (mostly [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[Argentina]]).&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;

===Top importers===
The largest importers of parrots are:&lt;ref name = Latin/&gt;
* The [[European Union]]
* The United States
* [[Singapore]]
* [[Central America]]
* The [[Caribbean]]

Prior to 1992, the United States was the largest importer, but after the Wild Bird Conservation Act was passed in 1992, the European Union emerged as the leading importer.&lt;ref name=Latin/&gt; In the 2000-2003 period, the EU imported 2.8 million wild bird species, accounting for 93% of imports worldwide.&lt;ref name=Latin/&gt;

The chart below graphs the gross exports of true parrots, belonging to the family Psittacidae, a sub-taxa of the Psittaciformes order.

However, the statistics greatly underestimate the quantity of birds channeled into the pet trade. Mortalities that occur prior to export are excluded.&lt;ref name=Latin/&gt; An estimated 60% of the birds taken from the wild for trade may perish before reaching the market and many die in transport.&lt;ref&gt;

==Legal rules and restrictions regarding Psittacidae trade==
The Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA)&lt;ref&gt;

  |title=Wild Bird Conservation Act

  |accessdate=21 February 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was enacted on October 23, 1992, to protect exotic bird species from international trade. The Act maintains that wild-caught birds may only be imported into the United States if they are produced in accordance with service-approved management plans for sustainable use of the species.&lt;ref name = US/&gt; After the WBCA, the number of parrots imported in the US declined from over 100,000 annually to only hundreds annually.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

The [[European Union]] placed a temporary ban on wild bird imports in October 2005 after imported birds died from the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 bird flu]]. The ban was made permanent in 2007, allowing only captive-bred birds from approved countries to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention on International Trade protects certain endangered species by law, and prohibits them from being traded internationally. Several true parrots from the genus [[Ara (genus)|''Ara'']] ([[great green macaw]], [[blue-throated macaw]], [[scarlet macaw]], [[military macaw]]), are all protected under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.&lt;ref&gt;“Appendices 1,2, and 3” Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade in Mexico==
Although it is difficult to account for the exact number of birds trafficked each year, a comprehensive survey of parrot trappers by [[Defenders of Wildlife]], a national nonprofit organization in Mexico, estimates that anywhere from 65,000 to 78,500 birds are captured and traded annually. The same report indicates that [[Psittacidae]] populations have declined as much as 30% in Mexico over the past century due to a combination of habitat loss and overexploitation of the trade of these animals.&lt;ref name = Guzman&gt;

===History===
Although declining parrot populations in Mexico are a modern worry, the [[Psittacine]] trade is deeply rooted in the country’s history and culture. The [[Aztecs]] often kept parrots and macaws as pets, and their feathers were used to make ceremonial tokens. Smaller tribes taken over by the Aztec empire often provided their conquerors with Macaw feathers as a form of tribute and a symbol of submission.&lt;ref name = Guzman&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1990s two major factors prompted the decrease of the flow of these birds into the U.S. First, the passage of the Wild Bird Conservation Act in the United States in 1992 led to a dramatic increase in the regulation of exotic birds entering the United States, naturally followed by a decrease in trade.&lt;ref name="Cornell University Law School"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Wild Bird Conservation Act authorized the creation of captive breeding centers in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cornell University Law School"/&gt; Although captive bred birds are usually more expensive due to the costs of being raised in captivity, Americans looking for exotic pets are generally able to afford these higher prices. The sale of captive bred parrots has largely overtaken that of illegal exotics in the U.S.&lt;ref name = Pires&gt;

However, it has been determined that internal trade of Psittacines within Mexico is now actually far more detrimental and widespread than international [[smuggling]].&lt;ref name = Guzman1&gt;

===Illegal Trade Within Mexico===

The regulation of the parrot trade in Mexico has proven to be a problematic process. Until 2003, the parrot trade was authorized on a species by species basis. The number of species that could be legally trapped and sold had steadily declined since 1979, and in 2003 the [[Mexican government]] banned the trade of all Psittacines. However, in 2006 permits were once again issued for the capture and trade of select species. Although some trade in Psittacines was legal between 2006 and 2008, the absence of law enforcement for wildlife crimes meant that even trade in authorized species was usually perpetrated illegally.&lt;ref name = Guzman22&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2008, many parrots were captured and sold by bird trapper and salesman unions. These unions were often registered with the state, and agreed to terms that attempted to protect parrot populations in return for official trapping authorizations. Although these stipulations aimed to protect Psittacine populations, they proved to be largely ineffective in practice.&lt;ref name = Guzman33&gt;

The law also set quotas and other specific rules for trappers within these UMA’s. However, the Mexican wildlife law enforcement agency, PROFEPA, was too understaffed and underfunded to enforce these laws. It was not capable of monitoring each UMA for illicit activity. Instead, it visited a select group of predetermined UMA’s each year, and performed inspections of UMA’s where illegal activity had been reported.&lt;ref name = Guzman3&gt;

An absence of a concrete body of knowledge regarding Psitaccine populations and the activity of trappers within these areas meant that quotas were often exceeded and authorizations were bypassed. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that as much as 75% of the parrot trade, even in authorized species, was being perpetrated illegally.&lt;ref name = Guzman43&gt;

A 2006 report by Cantu et al. report demonstrated that the illegal trade of Psittacines actually ''increased'' when [[trapping]] was authorized by government agencies. This was because illegal activity was much more easily concealed under the auspices of legal trade.&lt;ref name = Guzman4&gt;

PROFEPA attempts to combat the illegal parrot trade using several methods including directly attending to reports regarding illegal activity; making scheduled inspections of markets, pet shops, zoos, and UMA’s; pinpointing identified locations for sale and transport; and patrolling ports, airports, and borders. However, these efforts do not make a significant impact. Much of PROFEPA’s enforcement activity is concentrated on the point of sale, but the high rate of mortality in trafficked parrots means that intervention efforts often occur too late to save the smuggled birds. The agency also lacks the resources to conduct raids on warehouses and markets that are used to store and sell parrots. Even when these operations can be implemented, PROFEPA is hindered by insiders who tip off the bird traders so that they can hide their animals before the raids occur. (new info, defenders, 54) Because of its ineffective system of management, it has been estimated that PROFEPA’s seizures of wildlife represent only 2% of the total annual Psittacine trade.&lt;ref name="Guzman53"&gt;{{cite report

A 2006 report by Cantu. et al. is one of the only comprehensive and concentrated bodies of knowledge regarding the extent of the Psittacine trade in Mexico. This report is largely based on interviews with bird traders and union leaders, and attempts to organize data collected by a variety of Mexican agencies regarding the issue. However, the document is limited by a lack of concrete evidence specifically regarding the number of birds taken from the wild each year, and relies on interviews and speculation to fill in the gaps left by the absence of scientific data. It advocates for an increase in Psittacine [[population studies]] to regulate trade and to be able to formulate effective measures for reducing the exploitation of Psittacine populations.&lt;ref name="Clarkeandpires1"&gt;{{cite journal

Alternative forms of prevention were suggested in several different studies. A 2011 report by Pires and Moreto advocates a system of situational crime prevention in which enforcement is targeted on a community basis. They write, “…in areas where parrot poaching is concentrated, possible solutions to poaching include: removing ladders from trees, keeping a watch out by citizens/police during breeding periods, shutting down illegal pet markets, and [[CCTV]] for the most poached species.”&lt;ref name = Moreto1&gt;

A similar study by Pires and Clarke suggests that campaigns to build national pride for the Psitaccines of Mexico could be effective in lowering trafficking rates, but they acknowledge that the campaign may not be successful due to [[Mexico]]’s large urban population and diversity of parrot species. A more comprehensive and concrete suggestion, also by Pires and Clarke, is to promote and invest in ecotourist lodges that partner with local communities in order to conserve Psittacine populations by using them to attract tourists who stimulate the local economy. If these lodges were effective in providing adequate support to surrounding communities, it is foreseeable that the parrot trade in those areas would decrease as opportunistic trappers realize the value of psittacines as a [[natural resource]]. Need based trapping would decline as primary or secondary incomes would become dependent on the [[ecotourism]] business.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite report

Until ignorance ceases the Jiva remains caught in experience of the results of actions bringing merit and demerit, and in the state of individuality (''jivatva'') ([[Brahma Sutras|Brahma Sutra]] I.iv.6), and so long as the connection with the intellect as conditioning adjunct lasts, so long the individuality and transmigration of soul lasts (Brahma Sutra II.iii.30).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of the Vedanta: A Critical Account of the advaita Tradition|author=Swami Satchidanandendra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMkbWhjE2M4C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Jivatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2t3dUuC7OOKS7Aanq4CgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Jivatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jiva==
{{main|Jiva}}
According to [[Dvaitadvaita]] (dualism) Brahman and Jiva are different entities; that God, Soul and the Universe are three separate entities with the former governing the latter two. The Jiva (individual soul that lives in the world) is one of the three categories of realities, the other two being Jagat (the Universe or the world) and Brahman (the Universal Soul and the substratum behind the Jagat and the Jivas).The soul can migrate to the heaven and live with God. According to [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified dualism), God alone exists who is formless.  The Jagat and the Jivas form his body and the soul becomes liberated when it realizes that it is a part of God. According to [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), Brahman is the ultimate supreme sole Reality beyond names and forms. Brahman, which is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss, and the soul are non-different, identical, unchangeable and eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Indian Scriptures|url=http://indianscriptures.50webs.com/vedanta.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the dvaita schools, jiva is essentially an eternal spiritual entity (ajada-dravya) whose essence is constituted by knowledge (jnana). As jnana-svarupa it is a sentient being (cetna) and self-revealing (svayam-prakasa), as the knower or subject of knowledge (jnata) and as the agent of action (karta) it experiences both pleasure and pain (bhokta). It is monadic in character (anu) unlike Ishvara who is all-pervasive ([[vibhu]]).

==Relation between Jiva and Brahman==

In the [[Katha Upanishad]] the Jiva, the individual soul, and Brahman, the Universal Soul, are regarded as being at par with each other as enjoying equally the fruits of their action. In the [[Mundaka Upanishad]] only the individual soul is described as tasting of the fruits of action, the Universal Soul described simply as the on-looker. In the [[Śvetāśvatara|Svetasvatra Upanishad]] the individual soul enjoys the unborn [[Prakṛti|Prakrti]] consisting of three qualities, which the Universal Soul leaves off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is with regard to the relation of the Two Souls first dealt with by the Rig Veda in mantra I.164.17 which reads:-

:द्वा सुवर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षं परि षस्वजाते |
:तयोरन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्यनश्नन्नयो अभि चाकशीति ||

:“Two birds of beautiful plumage closely united in friendship reside on the same tree. 
:One of them eats the sweet fruit thereof, the other witnesses without eating.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mundaka and Mandukya Upanishads|author=Swami Sharvananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=51|url= http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Mundaka_and_Mandukya_Upanishads%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20[Sanskrit-English].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And, adapting which ideation and imagery the sage of the Mundaka Upanishad (III.1.2) proceeds to tell us that:-

:समाने वृक्षे पुरुषो निमग्नोऽनीशया शोचति मुह्यमानः |
:जुष्टं यदा पश्यत्यन्यमीशमस्य महिमानमिति वीतशोकः || 

:“Being seated on the same tree, the [[Purusha]] deluded grieves over his helplessness. 
:But when he upholds the other worshipful Lord and His Glory, he becomes free from grief.”

Jiva is limited by the inner sense organ, being limited it is distinct from the substratum consciousness of objects which is the all-pervasive consciousness (saksi). It always feels its distinction from God, because Brahman is not the object of ordinary knowledge. Jiva is the locus ([[asraya]]) of avidya. The identification between Jiva, a false entity, and Brahman, occurs only when the Jiva aspect of the Self is totally eliminated by true knowledge of the real nature of the Self dispelling the primordial avidya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita Vedanta and Vaishnism|author=Sanjukta Gupta|publisher=Routledge|page=85|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4AFxluCHsoAC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=jiva+in+advaita+vedanta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lh1k4TlWck&amp;sig=DmH5izrXJNDTwSszmFTLMqZsViY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nkTeUrG5HoLb7AbG-IG4Dg&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwCTgK#v=snippet&amp;q=jiva%20&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Svatantryavada is the doctrine of the absolute sovereignty and freedom of the Divine Will to express and manifest itself in any way it likes; Svatantrya makes the moveable and the immoveable objects appear as separate though in essence they are not separate from samvit (Universal Consciousness) and which does not conceal the nature of the Supreme. From the point of its manifestation, it is known as Abhasavada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pratyabhijnahrdayam: The Secret of Self-recognition|author=Jaideva Singh|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=17|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dVJSChd9hOoC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BQXeUra8OIbQ7Aaoq4HgDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhasavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abhasavada]] is the theory of appearance, the creation theory of the Saiva and the Sakta schools according to which theory the universe consists of appearances which are all real as the aspects of the ultimate reality; the world is an abhasa (prakasa or light) of [[Shiva]], it is not [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. In the Advaita Vedanta this is the theory according to which the Jiva is the illusory appearance of Brahma-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Co.|pages=50,74,95|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BQXeUra8OIbQ7Aaoq4HgDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=achhedavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of Abhasavada finds its roots in Brahma Sutra II.iii.50 which reads – 

:आभास एव च | 

:(And, (the individual soul) is only a reflection (of the supreme Self) to be sure), 

This theory was advocated by [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Suresvara]] in which the Jivas are as real as Brahman, they being primary appearances in and through avidya, while the objects of the world are unreal, they being secondary appearances, mere reflections of the primary appearances.  The Vivarna School upholds the theory of Bimba-pratibimbavada or theory of reflection, in which the Absolute Reality, reflected in upadhis, appears as numerous selves due to the intervening adjuncts and their cause Avidya. The Bhamati School of [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vacaspati Misra]] upholds the Avacchedavada, the theory of limitation, in which the jivas are Brahman Itself but appearing as though limited by adjuncts such as the mind-body-complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhamati and Vivarna Schools of Advaita Vedanta: A Critical Approach|author=Poolasth Soobah Roodurmum|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=160|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2pU2ZQB2wUYC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Abhasavada+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MBfeUoTBF4qL7Aa2hoGADQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhasavada%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

According to [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]], the Jivatva of the Jiva is a consequence of the Jiva’s false sense of identity i.e. one-ness, with the body, making Jiva an empirical individual. The sense of bodied being-hood (sasariratvam) of the Jiva is entirely due to false conviction (mithyapratiyayanimittantvat), the truly enlightened person is bodyless even when living in this life and in this body. Avidya or ignorance consists in the wrong identification of the Self with the psycho-physical complex called the individual’s body and in the development of the self-sense (atmabhimana) in the bodied being; this is the [[upadhi]] cutting into the very nature of the Jiva. The apparent modification is an epistemic fact, and the totality of cosmic plurality is also an epistemic fact. The apparently substantial Jivatva is an offshoot of avidya sustained and nourished by mithyajnana. Jivatva, the phenomenal individuality, although beginning-less, is terminable (santa) in the case of one getting release and gaining Brahmatva. The Jivatva of the Jiva is Jiva’s limitedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Shankar’s Advaita|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadayaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=170,369-375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;dq=Pratibimbavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2B3eUof-DM-V7Aak44BQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=jivatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jivahood of the atman (the individualization of the soul) is unreal, it is merely an imagination caused by the delusion of buddhi, and vanishes with the annulment of the delusion that comes about by the realization of one’s real nature. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III]] of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;dq=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cSjAUOuVM4vprQe-moHoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA|quote=Sloka 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">'''Legal consciousness''' is a ''collection'' of understood and/or imagined to have understood, [[legal awareness]] of ideas, views, feelings and traditions imbibed through [[legal socialization]]; which reflects as [[legal culture]] among given individual, or a group, or a given society at large. The legal consciousness evaluates the existing [[law]] and also bears in mind an image of the desired or ideal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juridicainternational.eu/?id=12433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legal Consciousness Among Youth at the Red Hook Community Justice Center By Aviad Lael Brisman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consciousness]] is not an individual trait nor solely ideational; legal consciousness is a type of [[Social Practice|social practice]] reflecting and forming [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref name="Silbey Susan 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan|title=legal consciousness|journal=New Oxford Companion to Law|date=2008|pages=2|url=http://web.mit.edu/~ssilbey/www/pdf/Legal_consciousness.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2015|ref=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of legal Consciousness documents the forms of participation and interpretation through which act or sustain, reproduce, or amend the circulating contested or hegemonic structures of meanings concerning [[law]]. Legal consciousness is the way in which [[law]] is experienced and interpreted by specific individuals as they engage, avoid, resist or just assume the [[law]] and legal meanings.

Legal consciousness is a state of being, [[legal socialisation]] is the process to Legal consciousness; where as [[legal awareness]] &amp; [[legal mobilisation]] are means to achieve  the same.

==Definition==
The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia (1979) defined legal consciousness as " ''the sum of views and ideas expressing the attitude of people toward law, legality, and justice and their concept of what is lawful and unlawful. Legal consciousness is a form of social consciousness. Legal ideology, the system of legal views based on certain social and scientific viewpoints, is a concentrated expression of legal consciousness. The customs and feelings of people in relation to legal phenomena constitute the psychological aspect of legal consciousness; among these are a sense of justice and a loathing of crimes and illegal actions'' "

Legal consciousness is defined by Ewick and Silbey as the process by which people make sense of their experiences by relying on legal categories and concepts. People do this even when they are not familiar with the details and minutia of law or the legal system. They explain that there are cultural schemas provided by law that people use to make sense of their experiences. They refer to this as legality. The concept of legality includes "the meanings, sources, authority and cultural practices that are commonly recognized as legal, regardless of who employs them or for what ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewick; Silbey|first1=Patricia; Susan|title=The Common Place of Law: Stories from Everyday Life|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meanings and sources and different ways of knowing and understanding enable people to make sense of what happens to them and what that might mean in terms of their rights and options. This process of understanding legal experiences occurs within a larger ecosystem in which there are disputes over meaning and values. Seron and Munger explain that ""in addition, class may affect legal consciousness: Law may mean different things depending on an individual's location in the various hierarchies of status, prestige, and knowledge associated with membership in a social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seron; Munger|first1=Carroll; Frank|last2=Munger|first2=Frank|title=Law and Inequality: Race, Gender... and of Course, Class|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=1996|volume=22|pages=187–212|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is in contrast to Cornell Law professor [[Michael C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22974">The following systems arose from [[Ancient weights and measures|earlier systems]], and in many cases utilise parts of much older systems. For the most part they were used to varying degrees in the [[Middle Ages]] and surrounding time periods.  Some of these systems found their way into later systems, such as the [[Imperial unit|Imperial system]] and even [[SI]]. There were several types to measure that is given below.

== English system ==
Before Roman units were reintroduced in 1066 by Norman [[William the Conqueror]], there was an [[Anglo-Saxon]] (Germanic) system of measure based on the units of the ''barleycorn'' and the ''gyrd'' (rod).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The systems partly merged.

Later development of the [[English unit|English system]] continued by issuing measurement standards from the then capital [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] in about 1215. Standards were renewed in 1496, 1588 and 1758.

The last ''Imperial Standard Yard'' in bronze was made in 1845; it served as the standard in the [[United Kingdom]] until the yard was internationally redefined as 0.9144 metre in 1959 (statutory implementation: Weights and Measures Act of 1963).

Much of the units would go on to be used in later [[Imperial units]] and in the [[U.S. customary units|US system]], which are based on the [[English unit|English system]] from the 1700s.

== Danish system ==
From May 1, 1683, King [[Christian V of Denmark]] introduced an office to oversee weights and measures, a ''justervæsen'', to be led by [[Ole Rømer]]. The definition of the ''alen'' was set to 2 Rhine feet. Rømer later discovered that differing standards for the Rhine foot existed, and in 1698 an [[iron]] [[Copenhagen]] standard was made. A pendulum definition for the foot was first suggested by Rømer, introduced in 1820, and changed in 1835. The metric system was introduced in 1907.

=== Length ===
* ''mil'' &amp;ndash; Danish mile. Towards the end of the 17th century, Ole Rømer connected the mile to the circumference of the earth, and defined it as 12000 ''alen''. This definition was adopted in 1816 as the Prussian ''Meile''. The coordinated definition from  1835 was 7.532&amp;nbsp;km. Earlier, there were many variants, the most commonplace the ''[[Sjælland]]sk miil'' of 17600 ''fod'' or 11.130&amp;nbsp;km.
* ''palme'' &amp;ndash; Palm, for circumference, 8.86&amp;nbsp;cm
* ''alen'' &amp;ndash; Forearm, 2 ''fod''
* ''fod'' &amp;ndash; Defined as a ''Rheinfuss'' 31.407&amp;nbsp;cm from 1683, before that 31.41&amp;nbsp;cm with variations.
* ''kvarter'' &amp;ndash; Quarter, 1 / 4 ''alen''
* ''tomme'' &amp;ndash; Inch, 1 / 12 ''fod''
* ''linie'' &amp;ndash; Line, 1 / 12 ''tomme''
* ''skrupel'' &amp;ndash; Scruple, 1 / 12 ''linie''

=== Volume ===
* ''potte'' &amp;ndash; Pot, from 1683 1 / 32 ''fot''³
* ''smørtønde'' &amp;ndash; Barrel of butter, from 1683 136 ''potter''
* ''korntønde'' &amp;ndash; Barrel of corn, from 1683 144 ''potter''

=== Weight ===
* ''pund'' &amp;ndash; Pound, from 1683 the weight of 1 / 62 ''fot''³ of water, 499.75&amp;nbsp;g

=== Miscellaneous ===
* ''dusin'' &amp;ndash; 12
* ''snes'' &amp;ndash; 20
* ''gross'' &amp;ndash; 144

== Dutch system ==
The Dutch system was not standardised until Napoleon introduced the metric system.  Different towns used measures with the same names but differing sizes.

Some common measures:

=== Weight ===
*''Ons, Once'' &amp;ndash; 1/16 pond = 30.881&amp;nbsp;g
*''Pond'' (Amsterdam) &amp;ndash; 494.09&amp;nbsp;g (other ponds were also in use)
*''Scheepslast'' &amp;ndash; 4000 Amsterdam ''pond'' = 1976.4&amp;nbsp;kg = 2.1786 short tons

=== Length ===
*''duim'' &amp;ndash;2.54&amp;nbsp;cm
*''kleine palm'' &amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;cm
*''grote palm'' &amp;ndash;9.6&amp;nbsp;cm, after 1820, 10&amp;nbsp;cm
*''voet'' &amp;ndash;12 duim = abt. 29.54&amp;nbsp;cm, many local variations
*''el'' &amp;ndash; about 70&amp;nbsp;cm

=== Volume ===
*''Pint'' &amp;ndash; 0.6 l

== Finnish system ==
In [[Finland]], approximate measures derived from body parts and were used for a long time, some being later standardised for the purpose of commerce. Some [[Sweden|Swedish]], and later some [[Russia]]n units have also been used.
*''vaaksa'' &amp;ndash; The distance between the tips of little finger and thumb, when the fingers are fully extended.
*''kyynärä'' &amp;ndash; c. 60&amp;nbsp;cm &amp;ndash; The distance from the elbow to the fingertips.
*''syli'' &amp;ndash; fathom, c. 180&amp;nbsp;cm &amp;ndash; The distance between the fingertips of both hands when the arms are raised horizontally on the sides.
*''virsta'' &amp;ndash; 2672 m (Swedish), 1068.84&amp;nbsp;m (Russian)
*''peninkulma'' &amp;ndash; 10.67&amp;nbsp;km &amp;ndash; The distance a barking dog can be heard in still air.
*''poronkusema'' &amp;ndash; c. 7.5&amp;nbsp;km &amp;ndash; The distance a [[reindeer]] walks between two spots it urinates on. This unit originates from Lapland (i.e. [[Sápmi]]).
*''leiviskä'' &amp;ndash; 8.5004&amp;nbsp;kg

*''kannu'' &amp;ndash; 2.6172 l
*''kortteli'' &amp;ndash; 148&amp;nbsp;mm (length) or 0.327&amp;nbsp;l (volume)

== French system ==
In [[France]], again, there were many local variants. For instance, the ''lieue'' could vary from 3.268&amp;nbsp;km in [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] to 5.849&amp;nbsp;km in [[Provence]]. Between 1812 and 1839, many of the traditional units continued in ''metrified'' adaptations as the ''mesures usuelles''.

In Paris, the redefinition in terms of metric units made 1&amp;nbsp;m = 443.296 ''ligne'' = 3&amp;nbsp;''pied'' 11.296 ''ligne''.

In Quebec, the surveys in French units were converted using the relationship 1 ''pied'' (of the French variety; the same word is used for English feet as well) = 12.789 inches (of English origin).  Thus a square arpent was 5299296.0804&amp;nbsp;in² or about 36,801&amp;nbsp;ft² or 0.8448 acre.

There were many local variations; the metric conversions below apply to the Quebec and Paris definitions.

=== Length ===
* ''lieue commune'' &amp;ndash; French land league, 4.452&amp;nbsp;km, 1/25 Equatorial degree
*  1 Roman cubit = 444&amp;nbsp;mm so 1000 Roman cubits = 4.44&amp;nbsp;km, a closer approximation to 1/25 degree
* ''lieue marine'' &amp;ndash; French (late) sea league, 5.556&amp;nbsp;km, 3 [[nautical mile]]s.
* ''lieue de poste'' &amp;ndash; Legal league, 2000 ''toises'', 3.898&amp;nbsp;km
* ''lieue metrique'' &amp;ndash; Metric system adaptation, 4.000&amp;nbsp;km
* ''arpent'' &amp;ndash; 30 ''toises'' or 180 ''pieds'', 58.471&amp;nbsp;m
* ''toise'' &amp;ndash; Fathom, 6 ''pieds''. Originally introduced by [[Charlemagne]] in 790, it is now considered to be 1.949&amp;nbsp;m.
* ''pied'' &amp;ndash; Foot, varied through times, the Paris ''pied de roi'' is 324.84&amp;nbsp;mm.  Used by [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]] in manuscripts relating to the inverse square law of electrostatic repulsion. [[Isaac Newton]] used the "Paris foot" in his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''.
* ''pouce'' &amp;ndash; Inch, 1/12 ''pied''  27.070&amp;nbsp;mm
* ''ligne'' &amp;ndash; 1/12 ''pouce'' 2.2558&amp;nbsp;mm

* ''livre'' &amp;ndash; 0.4895&amp;nbsp;kg

== German system ==
Up to the introduction of the [[metric system]], almost every town in [[Germany]] had their own definitions. It is said that by 1810, in [[Baden, Germany|Baden]] alone, there were 112 different ''Ellen''.

=== Length ===
* ''Meile'' &amp;ndash; A German ''geographische Meile'' or ''Gemeine deutsche Meile'' was defined as 7.420&amp;nbsp;km, but there were a wealth of variants:

== Norwegian system ==
Before 1541, there were no common definition for length measures in [[Norway]], and local variants flourished. In 1541, an ''alen'' in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] was defined by law to be the [[Sjælland]] ''alen''. Subsequently, the ''alen'' was defined by law as 2 Rhine feet from 1683. From 1824, the basic unit was defined as a ''fot'' being derived from [[astronomy]] as the length of a one-second pendulum times 12/38 at a [[latitude]] of 45°. The [[metric system]] was introduced in 1887.

=== Length ===
* ''alen'' &amp;ndash; Forearm, 62.748&amp;nbsp;cm from 1824, 62.75&amp;nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] from 1683, 63.26&amp;nbsp;cm from 1541. Before that, local variants.

== Romanian system ==
The measures of the old Romanian system varied greatly not only between the three Romanian states ([[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]], [[Transylvania]]), but sometimes also inside the same country. The origin of some of the measures are the Latin (such as ''iug&amp;#259;r'' unit), Slavic (such as ''vadr&amp;#259;'' unit) and Greek (such as ''dram'' unit) and Turkish (such as ''palmac'' unit) systems.

This system is no longer in use since the adoption of the metric system in 1864.

In [[Sweden]], a common system for weights and measures was introduced by law in 1665. Before that, there were a number of local variants. The system was slightly revised in 1735. In 1855, a decimal reform was instituted that defined a new Swedish inch as 1/10 foot. It did not last long, because the metric system was subsequently introduced in 1889. Up to the middle of the 19th century there was a death penalty for falsifying weights or measures.

The '''monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force''', also known as the '''monopoly on violence''' ({{lang-de|Gewaltmonopol des Staates}}), is a core concept of modern public law, which goes back to [[Jean Bodin]]'s 1576 work ''[[Jean Bodin#Les Six livres de la R.C3.A9publique|Les Six livres de la République]]'' and [[Thomas Hobbes]]' 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.{{Citation needed|reason=If first described by Weber, how does it date to Bodin and Hobbes?|date=February 2016}} As the defining conception of the [[state (polity)|state]], it was first described in sociology by [[Max Weber]] in his essay ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Books, 2015, pp. 129-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber claims that the state is the "only human [[Gemeinschaft]] which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimated [[use of force|use of physical force]]. However, this monopoly is limited to a certain geographical area, and in fact this limitation to a particular area is one of the things that defines a state."&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. Palgrave Books 2015, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Weber describes the state as any organization that succeeds in holding the exclusive right to use, threaten, or authorize  physical force against residents of its territory. Such a monopoly, according to Weber, must occur via a process of [[Legitimation#Power and influence|legitimation]].

==Max Weber's theory==
[[Max Weber]] wrote in ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' that a fundamental characteristic of statehood is the claim of such a monopoly.  His expanded definition was that something is "a 'state' if and insofar as its administrative staff successfully upholds a claim on the 'monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force' ({{lang-de|das Monopol legitimen physischen Zwanges}}) in the enforcement of its order."&lt;ref name=weber64&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|title=The Theory Of Social And Economic Organization|year=1964|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0684836409|pages=154|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-WaBpsJxaOkC&amp;dq=The+Theory+of+Social+and+Economic+Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber1921&gt;Weber, Max. Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft (1921). p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's concept has been formalized to show that the exclusive policing power of the state benefits social welfare via private property, provided the state acts benevolently in the interest of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;K. Grechenig, M. Kolmar, The State's Enforcement Monopoly and the Private Protection of Property, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2404617 Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) 2014, vol. 170 (1), 5-23].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Weber, the state is that "human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of violence within a given territory."  The public [[police]] and [[military]] are its main instruments, but [[private security]] might also be considered to have "the 'right' to use violence" so long as the sole source of this perceived right is state sanction.  Weber applied several caveats to his discussion of the state's monopoly of violence:
* He intended the statement as a contemporary observation, noting that the connection between the state and the use of physical force has not always been so close. He uses the examples of [[feudalism]], where [[feud|private warfare]] was permitted under certain conditions, and of [[Church courts|religious courts]], which had sole jurisdiction over some types of offenses, especially [[heresy]] and sex crimes (thus the nickname "bawdy courts"). Regardless, the state exists wherever a single authority can legitimately authorize violence.
* For the same reasons, the "monopoly" does not mean that only the government may use physical force, but that the state is that human community that successfully claims for itself to be the only source of legitimacy for all physical coercion or adjudication of coercion. For example, the law might permit individuals to use force in defense of one's [[Self-defense|self]] or [[Defence of property|property]], but this right derives from the state's authority. This conflicts directly with enlightenment principles of individual sovereignty that delegates power to the state by consent, and concepts of [[natural law]] that hold that individual rights deriving from sapient [[self-ownership]] preexist the state and are only recognised and guaranteed by the state which may be restricted from limiting them by [[constitutional law]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Criticisms of Weber ===
[[Robert Bates (political scientist)|Robert Hinrichs Bates]] argues that the state itself has no violent power; rather, the people hold all the power of coercion to ensure that order and other equilibriums hold up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BATES|first=R.|last2=GREIF|first2=A.|last3=SINGH|first3=S.|title=Organizing Violence|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=46|issue=5|pages=599–628|doi=10.1177/002200202236166|year=2002|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3707095}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this is that there is a frontier of well-being in stateless societies, that can only be surpassed if some level of coercion or violence is used to elevate the complexity of the state. In other words, without investing in troops, police, or some sort of enforcement mechanism, early states cannot enjoy the law and order (or prosperity) of more developed states.

==Relation to state capacity ==
The capacity of a state is often measured in terms of its [[Fiscal capacity|fiscal]] and [[Capacity (law)|legal capacity]]. Fiscal capacity meaning the state's ability to recover taxation to provide public goods, and legal capacity meaning the state's supremacy as sole arbiter of conflict resolution and contract enforcement. Without some sort of [[coercion]], the state would not otherwise be able to enforce its legitimacy in its desired sphere of influence.  In early and developing states, this role was often played by the "stationary bandit" who defended villagers from roving bandits, in the hope that the protection would incentivize villagers to invest in economic production, and the stationary bandit could eventually use its coercive power to expropriate some of that wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=September 1993|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where state presence is minimally felt, non-state actors can use their monopoly of violence to establish legitimacy and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sicilian Mafia: the business of private protection|last=Gambetta|first=Diego|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Sicilian Mafia originated as a [[protection racket]] providing buyers and sellers in the black market with protection. Without this type of enforcement, market participants would not be otherwise confident enough to trust their counter-parties for valid contract enforcement and the market would collapse.

Even in illicit and underground markets (somewhat akin to stateless societies), violence is used to enforce contracts in the absence of accessible legal conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owens|first=Emily Greene|date=2011|title=Are Underground Markets Really More Violent? Evidence from Early 20th Century America|url=|journal=American Law and Economics Review|volume=v13, N1|pages=1–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles Tilly continues this comparison to say that warmaking and statemaking are actually the best representations of what organized crime can grow into.&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, Charles (1985). “War making and state making as organized crime,” in Bringing the State Back In, eds P.B. Evans, D. Rueschemeyer, &amp; T. Skocpol. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985. • Introduction and Chapt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
According to [[Raymond Aron]], [[international relations]] are characterized by the absence of widely acknowledged legitimacy in the use of force between states.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Aron. ''Paix et guerre entre les nations'', Paris 1962; English: ''Peace and War'', 1966. New edition 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martha Lizabeth Phelps, writing in ''[[Politics &amp; Policy]]'', takes Weber's ideas on the legitimacy of private security a step further.  Phelps claims that the use of private actors by the state remains legitimate if and only if military contractors are perceived 
as being controlled by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phelps|first1=Martha Lizabeth|title=Doppelgangers of the State: Private Security and Transferable Legitimacy|journal=Politics &amp; Policy|date=December 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=824–849|doi=10.1111/polp.12100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1381">'''Moral evil''' is the result of any morally negative event caused by the intentional action or inaction of an agent, such as a person. An example of a moral evil might be [[murder]], or any other [[evil]] event for which someone can be held responsible or culpable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil." BBC News. BBC, n.d. Web. 13 Sept. 2014. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml Christianity: good and evil]&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept can be contrasted with [[natural evil]], in which a bad event occurs naturally, without the intervention of an agent. The dividing line between natural and moral evil is not absolutely clear however, as some behaviour can be unintentional yet morally significant and some natural events (for example, global warming) can be caused by intentional actions.

The distinction of evil from 'bad' is complex. Evil is more than simply 'negative' or 'bad' (i.e. undesired or inhibiting good) as evil is on its own, and without reference to any other event, morally incorrect. The validity of 'moral evil' as a term, therefore, rests on the validity of morals in [[ethics]].

'''''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991''''' is a book written by [[Jeff Goodwin]].&lt;ref name="Voice of Russia - 31Dec2011 - 2011: Year of worldwide protests "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/12/31/63180970/|title=2011: Year of worldwide protests |last=Russell-Sluchansky |first=Carmen|date=31 December 2011|publisher=[[Voice of Russia]]|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It analyzes revolutions through the state-centered perspective.

==Comparing Revolutionary Movements==
In ''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991'', 
Goodwin offers another comparative study on revolutions focusing on the second half of the twentieth century from 1914 to 1991.  According to 
Goodwin, “revolutionary movements are not simply or exclusively a response to economic exploitation or inequality, but also and more directly a response to political oppression and violence, typically brutal and indiscriminate”. This idea is Goodwin’s main thesis throughout the book and he further expands on it. Goodwin believes that understanding revolutions is “worthwhile  not only because of the enormous importance of these movements for the national societies in which they occurred,  but also for their effects on the configuration of power and beliefs in other societies and thus on the international balance of power as well".&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Jeff Goodwin]]|title=No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=4 June 2001|isbn=978-0521629485}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparative study on revolutions is worthwhile because it is different from all the others that exist. First, Goodwin uses a unique set of revolutions and revolutionary movements to analyze, making this analysis interesting and very instructive. Second, Goodwin analyzes not only those revolutions that were successful; he also includes failed revolutionary movements that did not succeed. By analyzing these failed revolutions, Goodwin is able to analyze the reasons why some revolutions occur and others simply deteriorate. Goodwin’s goal for his analysis on revolutions is “to discover the general causal mechanics that do the most to explain the origins and trajectory of several important revolutionary movements".&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Before beginning to analyze revolutions Goodwin’s guess is that, “the diverse political fortunes of the revolutionary movements in peripheral societies during this era were not fortuitous nor randomly distributed, but were the result of general causal mechanisms” &lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press - Goodwin - No Other Way Out"/&gt;{{rp|8}}
(2001:8).

===Defining Terms===
Goodwin offers a definition of several important key terms that he will use throughout his analysis. To commence, he acknowledges that there are two different definitions for revolutions. For the first definition, the term revolution can “refer to any and all instances in which a state or political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extra constitutional, and/or violent fashion” (Goodwin 2009:9) With this interpretation, there needs to be a mobilization of people against the state. The second definition states that “revolutions entail not only mass mobilization and regime change, but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic, and/or cultural change during or soon after the struggle for state power” (Goodwin 2001:8). Goodwin chooses the concept from the concept of the first revolution since it is more general and includes many more revolutionary movements.

Goodwin also defines other important terms that will be essential to his theory. Political context is defined as, “the ways in which a national society, or some component of it, is governed and regulated by, has access to, and otherwise relates to the national state as well as to the larger state system” (Goodwin 2001: 14). To Goodwin, political concept is the single most important factor that explains the formation and fate of revolutionary movements. Lastly he defines peripheral state as “a state whose power and projects are more or less strictly determine or at least very tightly constrained by a much more powerful ‘core’ or ‘metropolitan’ state within the state system” (Goodwin 2001:14). Throughout his theory, Goodwin will use these terms in order to further his argument and it is essential to define them correctly.

===Theoretical Approaches to Revolutionary Movements===
Before Goodwin offers his own theory on revolutions, he first discusses two other popular theories, the modernization theory and the Marxist theory. The “modernization theory links revolutions to the transitions from traditional to modern societies, that is, to the very process of modernization itself” (Goodwin 2001:17). Those who believe in the Marxist theory, “view revolutions as occurring in ‘transitional’ societies- only in this case transition which is seen as the result of class struggle, is from one economic mode of production to another” (Goodwin 2001:19-20).  Goodwin believes that both of these theories, although not completely wrong, fail to completely analyze the political concept in which they are made. In addition to that there is a lot of disagreement in these theories that makes them less reliable.

The State-Centered Perspective
When studying revolutions, Goodwin places the focus on states, also known as the state-centered perspective. He focuses on the state because of two main reasons. The first is that any successful revolution will cause the breakdown or incapacitation of the state. The second reason is that “strong revolutionary movements, even if they ultimately fail to seize state power, will emerge only in opposition to states that are configured and that act in certain ways” (Goodwin 2001: 25) There are two reasons why the development of revolutionary movements is dependent on the state. Primarily, people will not support revolutionary movements unless they feel that the state is at fault for their everyday problems. The second reason is that individuals will not join revolutionary movements if they feel that doing so will only lead to more violence from the state. This second reason introduces another idea of people not joining revolutions unless they feel they have no other way out, which is exactly the title of the book. 
	
	Goodwin concludes in No Other Way Out that certain states lead to revolutions while others do not. According to him the formation of revolutionary movement in the periphery has been mainly caused by the “subset of violence and exclusionary authoritarian states that are also organizational incoherent and military weak” (Goodwin 2001: 26). Although there are many more factors that lead to revolutions, Goodwin’s main focus is on the state itself. The state itself is at the center of his analysis since according to him the state-centered perspective is the most powerful tool when analyzing revolutions

Four Types of State- Centered Analysis
	There are four approaches to the state-centered analysis which are the state- autonomy, the state-capacity, the political-opportunity, and the state-constructionism. All four of these approaches emphasize a set of causal mechanisms which are “those processes whereby states shape, enable, or constrain economic, associational, cultural, and even social-psychological phenomena” (Goodwin 2001: 36).  The state-autonomy perspective emphasizes on the autonomy of the state officials from the dominant social class. This dominant class includes politicians and military officials, among others, and they sometimes develop interests that are opposing to those interests of the popular will. The state-capacity approach focuses on the material and organizational capacity of the state officials’ political agenda. The political-opportunity approach on the other hand “emphasizes how the apparent tolerance, or responsiveness of states or “polities” influences the ability of mobilized social groups to act collectively and/or to influence state policies” (Goodwin 2001: 38).  Lastly, the state-constructionism approach focuses on how the states share and alter the identities, goals, and ideas of actors in civil society.

Analytic Strengths of State-Centered Approaches to Revolution 
	Goodwin argues that his statist approach is imperative when solving key problems of the study of revolutions. This state-centered analysis has much strength that makes it the best tools for analyzing revolutions. Revolutions are phenomenons that are fairly modern and have occurred with much more frequency in the twentieth century. Many have asked themselves why revolutions became more frequent in the twentieth century and the state-centered perspective answers this question. The answer is that revolutions need states to occur and this international state system that is present now thus makes revolutions much more frequent. This is not the only question that this statist perspective is able to answer. The state-centered perspective is able to answer why radical movements are concerned with destroying and seizing state power. Following this is also the question as to why it is necessary for the state to break down. This statist perspective also solves the question of why, when, and where revolutions occur. Lastly through this method analysts can figure out why some groups are able to attract much support and others are not. Through the state-centered perspectives all of these questions are answered in the analysis of revolutions.

	Goodwin believes that there are certain characteristics from states that make revolutionary movement more likely to develop. The first characteristic is that the state not only protects but also sponsors unpopular economic and social arrangements as well as cultural institutions. Another main characteristic is the repression and exclusion of mobilized groups from state power or resources. States where revolutions are more likely to develop also are indiscriminate and violent towards mobilized oppositional groups and figures. States that have weak policing capacities and infrastructural power are also more likely to produce revolutions. Lastly states that are characterized by a, “corrupt and arbitrary personalistic rule that alienates, weakens, or divides counterrevolutionary elites,” are more likely to develop revolutionary movements (Goodwin 2001: 49).

Critiques and Limitations of State-Centered Approaches 
	Goodwin acknowledges that there are many criticisms to his state-centered perspective on revolutions, but he argues that these critiques make unrealistic assumptions and they are completely unreliable. One of these critiques is that societies affect states just as much as states affect societies. Goodwin argues how even though states are not the only things that affect revolutions, and there are certainly other factors, they do tend to be at the center of the whole process and that is why they are at the center of the analysis. Another criticism states that in reality state officials are not the autonomous actors and they in fact are just being driven by the dominant class, challenging the state-autonomy approach. Again Goodwin disagrees with this claim as well as the other two critiques. One being that the state-centered analysis ignores the purpose and cultural dimensions of social action and the last one being that the distinction between states and societies is indefensible and should be eliminated. Although Goodwin disagrees with the critiques to the statist perspective he chooses to analyze revolutions, he does in fact acknowledge that there are certain limitation to this approach. Even though some limitations do exist, Goodwin argues that there are certain solutions to these. The main limitation in the state-centered perspective is that it fails to theorize sources that are not political or from the state. However even though this may be the case Goodwin argues that the state-centered perspective is still the best method for analyzing revolutions.

The Case of The Cuban Revolution 
The Cuban Revolution is a clear example that not only shows the strengths of the 
state-centered perspective, it also shows its limitations. Goodwin explains how in Cuba there were two main reasons as to why Cuba was susceptible to a radical revolution. The first reason was the weakness of Cuba’s clases economicas and the second was its strength of it clases populares or popular sectors. The Cuban state was also characterized by its “mediated sovereignty” and a “near-chronic crisis of political authority” (Goodwin 2001:60). Although the state had a lot to do in the Cuban revolution, this event was also marked by the mobilization of the masses. This is one of the reasons why the state-centered perspective is limited; it fails to analyze certain aspects of the revolution that were very important. On the other hand Goodwin argues that the Cuban revolution needs to be analyzed in different forms in order to fully explain it since no one theory alone can fully analyze any revolution.

The Formation of Revolutionary Movements in Southeast Asia
	Southeast Asia circa 1950 was a very important time in history in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia was defined during this time by seven regional similarities. This region was defined by Western conquest and colonial rule, it had an integration of local economics into the capitalist world system, and it was marked by its development of widespread social grievances and social protests. In addition to these similarities, this region was defined by its formation of reformist and revolutionary parties and movements, the Japanese occupation and privations of World War II, the formation of anti-Japanese resistance movements, and lastly it was defined by the Western colonial powers’ attempt to reassert their dominance over Southeast Asia after the war.

	After World War II, many dominating countries wanted to assert back their power on Southeast Asia, yet they were greeted by resistance. By the year 1950 there were several mass-based Communist movements that were challenging colonial and neocolonial regions in Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines. By contrast, the Indonesian struggle, which is seen by Goodwin as a political revolution, had already been won by non-Communist “populist” nationalists. Indonesian is a rare case and there are many explanations for what caused this anti-communism ideology. One main factor is the Japanese rule in Indonesia that ultimately brought many Indonesians into the middle class and liberated many popular non-communist nationalist leaders, thus spreading the dislike for communism.  This anti-communism ideology was not caused solely by economic, class, or cultural factors; it was the cause of circumstances “of a highly contingent character” (Goodwin 2001:89). In order to fully analyze the situation in Southeast Asia Goodwin goes on to use the state-centered perspective come up with answers and patterns to these revolutionary movements in Southeast Asia.
	

The Only Domino: The Vietnamese Revolution in Comparative Perspective
	In Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines, many colonial regions were in the process of revolutionary movements. The outcome was of course very different in every region and Goodwin states that in order to analyze these different outcomes the state-centered perspective is the best tool to do so. Goodwin argues that “two political variables, against a general backdrop of colonial rule, widespread socioeconomic problems, and Japanese occupation, determined whether strong Communist-led national movements would form and take power in Southeast Asia” (2001:130-131). The formation and fate of the communist party therefore depended one two variables. One was “whether the Japanese relied upon Europeans or existing indigenous elites on the one hand, or sponsored populist nationalists on the other” (Goodwin 2001:131). The second variable is whether the rule of Western powers was inclusionary and reformist. Goodwin creates a figure that clearly shows the steps and outcomes of every possibility thus providing a generalization to the events in Southeast Asia.

Conclusion 
	The state-centered perspective is the strongest and most efficient tool when analyzing revolutions. States are ultimately an important factor that in all the cases determines the fate of the revolutionary movement and it also explains why revolutionary movements have different outcomes in different situations. According to Goodwin, “states powerfully determine the precise ways in which a range of other factors may contribute to both the mobilization and impact of revolutionary movements. He goes on to argue that, “a state-centered approach, in sum, is important not just or even mainly because of the importance of state breakdowns or political opportunities for seizures of power by preexisting movements, but also because the very formation and strength of revolutionary movements vis-a-vis other political challengers are strongly shaped by the ways in which political authorities rule and respond to challengers” (Goodwin 2001:133). State power, and its use, constructs the possibilities and outcomes for revolutionary movements, and that is why they must be at the center of the study of revolutions.

The '''Nuremberg International Human Rights Award''' is a German award founded on September 17, 1995. The date chosen is significant; 60 years earlier, the [[Nuremberg Race Laws]] were adopted. Also, on September 17, 1939, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland was invaded]] by the [[Soviet Union]], soon after the [[invasion of Poland|German invasion]] that marked the beginning of World War II

The winner is endowed with 15,000 euros (20,235 USD).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6821">[[Image:Path.svg|thumb|The points traced by a path from ''A'' to ''B'' in '''R'''². However, different paths can trace the same set of points.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''path''' in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] ''f'' from the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0,1] to ''X''
:''f'' : ''I'' &amp;rarr; ''X''.
The ''initial point'' of the path is ''f''(0) and the ''terminal point'' is ''f''(1). One often speaks of a "path from ''x'' to ''y''" where ''x'' and ''y'' are the initial and terminal points of the path. Note that a path is not just a subset of ''X'' which "looks like" a [[curve]], it also includes a [[parameterization]]. For example, the maps ''f''(''x'') =  ''x'' and ''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; represent two different paths from 0 to 1 on the real line.

A '''[[Loop (topology)|loop]]''' in a space ''X'' based at ''x'' ∈ ''X'' is a path from ''x'' to ''x''. A loop may be equally well regarded as a map ''f'' : ''I'' → ''X'' with ''f''(0) = ''f''(1) or as a continuous map from the [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X''
:''f'' : ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''X''.
This is because ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; may be regarded as a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of ''I'' under the identification 0 ∼ 1. The set of all loops in ''X'' forms a space called the [[loop space]] of ''X''.

A topological space for which there exists a path connecting any two points is said to be [[path-connected space|path-connected]]. Any space may be broken up into a set of [[path-connected component]]s. The set of path-connected components of a space ''X'' is often denoted π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'');.

One can also define paths and loops in [[pointed space]]s, which are important in [[homotopy theory]]. If ''X'' is a topological space with basepoint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then a path in ''X'' is one whose initial point is ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Likewise, a loop in ''X'' is one that is based at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Homotopy of paths==
{{Main|Homotopy}}
[[Image:Homotopy between two paths.svg|thumb|right|A homotopy between two paths.]]
Paths and loops are central subjects of study in the branch of [[algebraic topology]] called [[homotopy theory]]. A [[homotopy]] of paths makes precise the notion of continuously deforming a path while keeping its endpoints fixed.

Specifically, a homotopy of paths, or '''path-homotopy''', in ''X'' is a family of paths ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''I'' → ''X'' indexed by ''I'' such that
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are fixed.
* the map ''F'' : ''I'' &amp;times; ''I'' → ''X'' given by ''F''(''s'', ''t'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') is continuous.
The paths ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; connected by a homotopy are said to be '''homotopic''' (or more precisely '''path-homotopic''', to distinguish between the relation defined on all continuous functions between fixed spaces). One can likewise define a homotopy of loops keeping the base point fixed.

The relation of being homotopic is an [[equivalence relation]] on paths in a topological space. The [[equivalence class]] of a path ''f'' under this relation is called the '''homotopy class''' of ''f'', often denoted [''f''].

==Path composition==
One can compose paths in a topological space in an obvious manner. Suppose ''f'' is a path from ''x'' to ''y'' and ''g'' is a path from ''y'' to ''z''. The path ''fg'' is defined as the path obtained by first traversing ''f'' and then traversing ''g'':
:&lt;math&gt;fg(s) = \begin{cases}f(2s) &amp; 0\leq s \leq \frac{1}{2} \\ g(2s-1) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \leq s \leq 1.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly path composition is only defined when the terminal point of ''f'' coincides with the initial point of ''g''. If one considers all loops based at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then path composition is a [[binary operation]].

Path composition, whenever defined, is not [[associative]] due to the difference in parametrization. However it ''is'' associative up to path-homotopy. That is, [(''fg'')''h''] = [''f''(''gh'')]. Path composition defines a [[group (mathematics)|group structure]] on the set of homotopy classes of loops based at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X''. The resultant group is called the [[fundamental group]] of ''X'' based at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, usually denoted π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

In situations calling for associativity of path composition "on the nose," a path in ''X'' may instead be defined as a continuous map from an interval [0,''a''] to X for any real ''a'' ≥ 0.  A path ''f'' of this kind has a length |''f''| defined as ''a''.  Path composition is then defined as before with the following modification:
:&lt;math&gt;fg(s) = \begin{cases}f(s) &amp; 0\leq s \leq |f| \\ g(s-|f|) &amp; |f| \leq s \leq |f|+|g|\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Whereas with the previous definition, ''f'', ''g'', and ''fg'' all have length 1 (the length of the domain of the map), this definition makes |''fg''| = |''f''| + |''g''|.  What made associativity fail for the previous definition is that although (''fg'')''h'' and ''f''(''gh'') have the same length, namely 1, the midpoint of (''fg'')''h'' occurred between ''g'' and ''h'', whereas the midpoint of ''f''(''gh'') occurred between ''f'' and ''g''.  With this modified definition (''fg'')''h'' and ''f''(''gh'') have the same length, namely |''f''|+|''g''|+|''h''|, and the same midpoint, found at (|''f''|+|''g''|+|''h''|)/2 in both (''fg'')''h'' and ''f''(''gh''); more generally they have the same parametrization throughout.

==Fundamental groupoid==
There is a [[category theory|categorical]] picture of paths which is sometimes useful. Any topological space ''X'' gives rise to a [[category (mathematics)|category]] where the objects are the points of ''X'' and the [[morphism]]s are the homotopy classes of paths. Since any morphism in this category is an [[isomorphism]] this category is a [[groupoid]], called the [[fundamental groupoid]] of ''X''. Loops in this category are the [[endomorphism]]s (all of which are actually [[automorphism]]s). The [[automorphism group]] of a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' is just the fundamental group based at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. More generally, one can define the fundamental groupoid on any subset ''A'' of ''X'', using homotopy classes of paths joining points of ''A''. This is convenient for the [[Van Kampen's Theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10576">A '''point particle''' ('''ideal particle'''&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Ohanian, J. T. Markert (2007), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''point-like particle''', often spelled '''pointlike particle''') is an [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]] of [[particle]]s heavily used in [[physics]]. Its defining feature is that it lacks [[spatial dimension|spatial]] [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]]: being zero-dimensional, it does not take up space.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Udwadia, R. E. Kalaba (2007), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A point particle is an appropriate representation of any object whose size, shape, and structure is irrelevant in a given context. For example, from far enough away, any finite-size object will look like and behave as a point-like object.

In the theory of [[gravity]], physicists often discuss a '''{{vanchor|point mass|POINT_MASS}}''', meaning a point particle with a nonzero [[mass]] and no other properties or structure. Likewise, in [[electromagnetism]], physicists discuss a '''{{vanchor|point charge|POINT_CHARGE}}''', a point particle with a nonzero [[charge (physics)|charge]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Snieder (2001), pp. 196–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, due to specific combinations of properties, extended objects behave as point-like even in their immediate vicinity.  For example, spherical objects interacting in [[3-dimensional space]] whose interactions are described by the [[inverse square law]] behave in such a way as if all their matter were concentrated in their [[center of mass|centers of mass]]. In [[Law of universal gravitation|Newtonian gravitation]] and classical [[electromagnetism]], for example, the respective [[Field (physics)|fields]] outside a spherical object are identical to those of a point particle of equal charge/mass located at the center of the sphere.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, I. B Cohen, A. Whitmann (1999), p. 956 (Proposition 75, Theorem 35).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewtonMotteMachin1&gt;I. Newton, A. Motte, J. Machin (1729), p. 270–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], the concept of a point particle is complicated by the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], because even an [[elementary particle]], with no internal structure, occupies a nonzero volume. For example, the [[atomic orbital|atomic orbit]] of an [[electron]] in the [[hydrogen atom]] occupies a volume of ~10&lt;sup&gt;−30&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. There is nevertheless a distinction between elementary particles such as [[electron]]s or [[quark]]s, which have no known internal structure, versus [[composite particle]]s such as [[proton]]s, which do have internal structure: A proton is made of three quarks. Elementary particles are sometimes called "point particles", but this is in a different sense than discussed above.

==Property concentrated at a single point==
When a point particle has an additive property, such as mass or charge, concentrated at a single point in space, this can be represented by a [[Dirac delta function]].

==Physical point mass==
[[Image:Example of a point.svg|220px|thumb|right|220px|thumb|right|An example of a point mass graphed on a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]]. The grey mass can be simplified to a point mass (the black [[circle]]). It becomes practical to represent point mass as small [[circle]], or dot, as an actual [[Point (geometry)|point]] is invisible.]]

'''Point mass''' ('''pointlike mass''') is the concept, for example in [[classical physics]], of a physical object (typically [[matter]]) that has nonzero mass, and yet explicitly and specifically is (or is being thought of or modeled as) [[infinitesimal]] (infinitely small) in its volume or [[length|linear dimension]]s.

===Application===

A common use for point mass lies in the analysis of the [[gravitational field]]s. When analyzing the gravitational forces in a system, it becomes impossible to account for every unit of [[mass]] individually. However, a spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as if all of its mass were concentrated at its center.

==Probability point mass==
A '''point mass''' in [[probability]] and [[statistics]] does not refer to mass in the sense of physics, but rather refers to a finite nonzero probability that is concentrated at a point in the [[probability mass function|probability mass distribution]], where there is a discontinuous segment in a [[probability density function]]. To calculate such a point mass, an [[integral|integration]] is carried out over the entire range of the [[random variable]], on the probability density of the continuous part. After equating this integral to 1, the point mass can be found by further calculation.

==Point charge==
[[File:Scalar potential of a point charge.jpg|left|thumb|Scalar potential of a point charge shortly after exiting a dipole magnet, moving left to right.]]
A '''point charge''' is an idealized model of a particle which has an [[electric charge]]. A point charge is an electric charge at a [[Point (geometry)|mathematical point]] with no dimensions.

The fundamental [[equation]] of [[electrostatics]] is [[Coulomb's law]], which describes the electric force between two point charges.  The [[electric field]] associated with a classical point charge increases to infinity as the distance from the point charge decreases towards [[0 (number)|zero]] making energy (thus mass) of point charge [[Infinity|infinite]].

[[Earnshaw's theorem]] states that a collection of point charges cannot be maintained in an [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] configuration solely by the electrostatic interaction of the charges.

==In quantum mechanics==
[[Image:Proton quark structure.svg|thumb|200px|right|A proton is a combination of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], held together by [[gluon]]s.]]
{{main|Elementary particle}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], there is a distinction between an [[elementary particle]] (also called "point particle") and a [[composite particle]]. An elementary particle, such as an [[electron]], [[quark]], or [[photon]], is a particle with no internal structure. Whereas a composite particle, such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]], has an internal structure (see figure).
However, neither elementary nor composite particles are spatially localized, because of the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. The particle [[wavepacket]] always occupies a nonzero volume. For example, see [[atomic orbital]]: The electron is an elementary particle, but its quantum states form three-dimensional patterns.

Nevertheless, there is good reason that an elementary particle is often called a point particle. Even if an elementary particle has a delocalized wavepacket, the wavepacket can be represented as a [[quantum superposition]] of [[quantum state]]s wherein the particle is exactly localized. Moreover, the ''interactions'' of the particle can be represented as a superposition of interactions of individual states which are localized.  This is not true for a composite particle, which can never be represented as a superposition of exactly-localized quantum states. It is in this sense that physicists can discuss the intrinsic "size" of a particle: The size of its internal structure, not the size of its wavepacket. The "size" of an elementary particle, in this sense, is exactly zero.

For example, for the electron, experimental evidence shows that the size of an electron is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29724|title=Precision pins down the electron's magnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the expected value of exactly zero. (This should not be confused with the [[classical electron radius]], which, despite the name, is unrelated to the actual size of an electron.)

== Film career ==

After graduating in 1977 from the Architectural Institute in [[Alma-Ata]], Nugmanov enrolled at the prestigious [[VGIK|Moscow State Film Institute]] (VGIK), the world's first institute of [[cinematography]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brashinsky |first=Michael |year=2000 |title=Igla |journal=International Dictionary of Film and Filmmakers |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5212/is_2000/ai_n19127240 |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His directorial debut, ''[[The Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]]'', premiered in September 1988 at the "Golden Duke" Festival in Odessa, where it won the Un Certain Regard prize. Starring popular Soviet rock musician [[Viktor Tsoi]], it was one of the first films to break the [[taboo]] against talking about [[drug addiction]] in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="drieu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drieu |first=Cloe |date=October 2000 |title=Don't Blink Now, It's Kazakhstan  |journal=UNESCO Courier |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2000_Oct/ai_66495271 |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the [[USSR]] in February 1989 with 1,000 prints in circulation and became a [[box office]] hit viewed by over 30 million cinemagoers.&lt;ref name="drucker"/&gt; The film was also a critical success, winning First Prize at the [[Perspektive - Filmfestival der Menschenrechte|Nuremberg Film Festival]] and initiating the "Kazakh New Wave". He declared, in 1990, the motto of the New Wave of Kazakh cinema: "We demand no unified philosophy nor uniform artistic views on art. We are unified, instead, in our freedom and love of art".&lt;ref&gt;"Tysiacha i odna zabota," ''Iskusstuo kino'' 4 [1990]: 37)&lt;/ref&gt; Nugmanov served as President of the Union of Kazakh Filmmakers from 1989 until 1992, when he wrote, directed and produced ''[[The Wild East]]'', a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[punk subculture|punk]] [[samurai]] [[Ostern]] which attracted international acclaim at [[film festival]]s in [[Venice]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Tokyo]], and was awarded the Prix Special du Jury in [[Valenciennes]], France. The film marked the end of both the Kazakh New Wave and Nugmanov's active directorial career,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9551">'''Regression''' ({{lang-de|Regression}}), according to [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]], is a [[defense mechanism]] leading to the temporary or long-term reversion of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more [[adaptive]] way. The defense mechanism of regression, in psychoanalytic theory, occurs when an individual's personality reverts to an earlier stage of development, adopting more childish mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;

==Freud, regression, and neurosis==

Freud saw development, [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]], and regression as centrally formative elements in the creation of a neurosis. Arguing that 'the [[Libido|libidinal]] function goes through a lengthy development', he assumed that 'a development of this kind involves two dangers - first, of ''inhibition'', and secondly, of ''regression'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Inhibitions produced fixations; and the 'stronger the fixations on its path of development, the more readily will the function evade external difficulties by regressing to the fixations'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Introductory Lectures'' p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurosis for Freud was thus the product of a flight from an unsatisfactory reality 'along the path of involution, of regression, of a return to earlier phases of sexual life, phases from which at one time satisfaction was not withheld. This regression appears to be a twofold one: a ''temporal'' one, in so far as the libido, the erotic needs, hark back to stages of development that are earlier in time, and a ''formal'' one, in that the original and primitive methods of psychic expression are employed in manifesting those needs'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 19950 p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;Behaviors associated with regression can vary greatly depending upon which [[Psychosexual development#Freud.27s_model_of_psychosexual_development|stage]] the person is fixated at:
An individual fixated at the [[oral stage]] might begin eating or smoking excessively, or might become very verbally aggressive.
A fixation at the anal stage might result in excessive tidiness or messiness. Freud recognised that 'it is possible for several fixations to be left behind in the course of development, and each of these may allow an irruption of the libido that has been pushed off - beginning, perhaps, with the later acquired fixations, and going on, as the lifestyle develops, to the original ones'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (Penguin Freud Library 9) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the service of the ego==

[[Ernst Kris]] supplements Freud's general formulations with a specific notion of "regression in the service of the ego"...the specific means whereby preconscious and unconscious material appear in the creator's consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Rothenberg/Carl R. Hausman, ''The Creativity Question'' (Duke UP 1976) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Kris thus opened the way for [[ego psychology]] to take a more positive view of regression. [[Carl Jung]] had earlier argued that 'the patient's regressive tendency...is not just a relapse into infantilism, but an attempt to get at something necessary...the universal feeling of childhood innocence, the sense of security, of protection, of reciprocated love, of trust'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Practice of Psychotherapy'' (London 1993) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Kris however was concerned rather to differentiate the way that 'Inspiration -...in which the ego controls the primary process and puts it into its service - needs to be contrasted with the opposite...condition, in which the ego is overwhelmed by the primary process'.&lt;ref&gt;Kris, quoted in Maynard Solomon, ''Beethoven Essays'' (Harvard 1988) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless his view of regression in the service of the ego could be readily extended into a quasi-[[Romanticism|Romantic]] image of the creative process, in which 'it is only in the fiery storm of a profound regression, in the course of which the personality undergoes both dissolution of structure and reorganization, that the genius becomes capable of wresting himself from the traditional pattern that he had been forced to integrate through the identifications necessitated and enforced by the [[oedipal]] constellation'.&lt;ref&gt;Eissler, quoted in Solomom, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

From there it was perhaps only a small step to the 1960s valorisation of regression as a positive good in itself. 'In this particular type of journey, the direction we have to take is ''back'' and ''in''....They will say we are regressed and withdrawn and out of contact with them. True enough, we have a long, long way to back to contact the reality'.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'' (Middlesex 1984) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Jungians had however already warned that 'romantic regression meant a surrender to the non-rational side which had to be paid for by a sacrifice of the rational and individual side';&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Adler, ''Studies in Analytical Psychology''(London 1999) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and Freud for his part had dourly noted that 'this extraordinary plasticity of mental developments is not unrestricted in direction; it may be described as a special capacity for involution - regression - since it may well happen that a later and higher level of development, once abandoned, cannot be reached again'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later views==

[[Anna Freud]] (1936) ranked regression first in her enumeration of the defense mechanisms',&lt;ref&gt;Michael Balint, ''The Basic Fault'' (1992) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly suggested that people act out behaviors from the stage of psychosexual development in which they are fixated. For example, an individual fixated at an earlier developmental stage might cry or sulk upon hearing unpleasant news.

[[Michael Balint]] distinguishes between two types of regression: a nasty "malignant" regression that the Oedipal level neurotic is prone to... and the "benign" regression of the basic-fault patient.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; The problem then is what the analyst can do 'to ensure that his patient's regression should be therapeutic and any danger of a pathological regression avoided'.&lt;ref&gt;Balint, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have highlighted the technical dilemmas of dealing with regression from different if complementary angles. On the one hand, making premature 'assumptions about the patient's state of regression in the therapy...regarded as still at the breast', for example, might block awareness of more adult functioning on the patient's part: of ''the patient's view of the therapist'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite mistake would be 'justifying a retreat from regressive material presented by a patient. When a patient begins to trust the analyst or therapist it will be just such disturbing aspects of the internal world that will be presented for understanding - not for a panic retreat by the therapist'.&lt;ref&gt;Casement, p. 180-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Blos suggested that 'revisiting of early psychic positions...helps the adolescent come out of the family envelope', and that 'Regression during [[adolescence]] thus advances the cause of development'.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2009) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Olinick speaks of 'regression in the service of the other' on the part of the analyst 'during his or her clinical work. Such ego regression is a pre-condition for [[empathy]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
* A clear example of regressive behavior in fiction can be seen in [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. Holden constantly contradicts the progression of time and the aging process by reverting to childish ideas of escape, unrealistic expectations and frustration produced by his numerous shifts in behavior. His tendencies to reject responsibility and society as a whole because he 'doesn't fit in' also pushes him to prolonged use of [[reaction formation]], unnecessary generalizations, and compulsive lying.
* A similar example occurs in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Krapp's Last Tape]]''. Krapp is fixated on reliving earlier times, and reenacts the fetal condition in his 'den'. He is unable to form mature relationships with women, seeing them only as replacements for his deceased mother. He experiences physical ailments that are linked to his fetal complex, struggling to perform digestive functions on his own. This literal [[anal retentive]]ness exemplifies his inefficacy as an independent adult.

'''Rolfing''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɔː|l|f|ɪ|ŋ|,_|ˈ|r|ɒ|l|-}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rolfing "Rolfing"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[alternative medicine]] originally developed by [[Ida Rolf]] (1896–1979) as '''Structural Integration'''.&lt;ref name=recipe1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherman KJ, Dixon MW, Thompson D, Cherkin DC |title=Development of a taxonomy to describe massage treatments for musculoskeletal pain |journal=BMC Complement Altern Med |volume=6 |issue= |pages=24 |year=2006 |pmid=16796753 |pmc=1544351 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-6-24 |type=Review |quote=Some massage styles with different names may be essentially the same (e.g., Structural Integration and Rolfing®)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically delivered as a series of ten hands-on physical manipulation sessions sometimes called "the recipe". It is based on Rolf's ideas about how the human body's "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy field]]" can benefit when aligned with the Earth's [[gravitational field]].&lt;ref name=gospel&gt;{{cite book|author=Ida P. Rolf, Ph.D.|title=Rolfing and Physical Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sndnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=1 November 1990|orig-year=1978|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-1-62055-338-1|page=31|quote="This is the gospel of Rolfing: When the body gets working appropriately, the force of gravity can flow through.

The principles of Rolfing contradict established medical knowledge,&lt;ref name=clow/&gt; and there is no good evidence Rolfing is effective for the treatment of any health condition.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt; It is recognized as a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref name= "pop"&gt;{{citation |author=Cordón, LA |work=Popular Psychology: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uy1gmwcAgg4C&amp;pg=PA218 |date=January 2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-32457-4 |pages=217–218 |title=Rolfing }}: "The idea of vital energy... does not correspond to known facts of how the human body operates.  Similarly, there is absolutely no support in psychological literature for the idea of traumatic experiences being repressed in the form of muscle memory, and so the basic ideas of Rolfing certainly fall into the category of pseudoscience."&lt;/ref&gt; and has been characterized as [[quackery]].&lt;ref name="agin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2010"/&gt; It is not known whether Rolfing is safe or cost-effective.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;&lt;ref name=barden/&gt;

== Conceptual basis ==
[[Ida Rolf]] described the body as organized around an axis perpendicular to the earth, parallel to the pull of gravity, and she believed the function of the body was optimal when it was organized in that way. She saw the body as continually in a struggle with gravity; in her view, gravity tends to shorten [[fascia]], leading to disorder of the body's arrangement around its axis and creating imbalance, inefficiency in movement, and pain.&lt;ref name="Houglum"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Therapeutic Exercise for Musculoskeletal Injuries|last=Houglum|first=Peggy|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2016|isbn=9780736075954|edition=4th|location=|pages=432–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVcvDAAAQBAJ|quote=Dr. Rolf based her techniques on the realization that fascia surrounded all tissue and body structures, so it also influenced those tissues and structures when it is modified. She observed that the body centers on a vertical line of pull created by gravity. It was her theory that the body is most efficient and healthy when it can function in an aligned and balanced arrangement. With gravity's continuing pull, stresses and injuries occur to pull the body out of its normal alignment; imbalance occurs and causes the body to become painful, malaligned, and inefficient. Rolf's philosophy and techniques focus on improving the body's posture so all functions including breathing, flexibility, strength, and coordination are optimally efficient.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfers aim to lengthen the fascia in order to restore the body's arrangement around its axis and facilitate improved movement.&lt;ref name="Houglum"/&gt;  Rolf also discussed this in terms of "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]" and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rolfers make a life study of relating bodies and their fields to the earth and its gravity field, and we so organize the body [so] that the gravity field can reinforce the body's energy field. This is our primary concept.&lt;ref name=rolf1976&gt;{{cite book|last=Rolf|first=Ida P.|title=Rolfing and Physical Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sndnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86|year=1990|orig-year=1978|publisher=Healing Arts Press|isbn=978-1-62055-338-1|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sd/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On its website as of August 2016, the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration described Rolfing as "a form of bodywork that reorganizes the connective tissues, called fascia, that permeate the entire body."&lt;ref name=broc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rolf.org/rolfingreg.php |title=What is Rolfing® Structural Integration? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Rolf Institute of Structural Integration |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160328160654/http://www.rolf.org/rolfingreg.php |archivedate=2016-03-28 |dead-url=no |access-date=2016-07-13|quote="Named after its founder, Dr. Ida P.

The manipulation is sometimes referred to as a type of [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], or as a type of [[massage]].&lt;ref name="Sherman"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Levine"&gt;{{cite book |last= Levine |first= Andrew |year= 1998 |title= The Bodywork and Massage Sourcebook |publisher= [[Lowell House]] |pages= 209–234 |isbn= 9780737300987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Cassar"&gt;{{cite book |last= Cassar |first= Mario-Paul |year= 2004 |title= Handbook of Clinical Massage: A Complete Guide for Students and Practitioners |edition= 2nd |publisher= [[Churchill Livingstone]] |pages= 48–49 |isbn= 9780443073496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Mental"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://librarum.org/book/22665/154|title=The Gale Encyclopedia Of Mental Disorders|last=|first=|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|year=2003|isbn=9780787657697|editor1-last=Thackery|editor1-first=Ellyn|location=|page=[http://librarum.org/book/22665/154 153–7]|pages=|editor2-last=Harris|editor2-first=Madeline|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808050455/http://librarum.org/book/22665/154|archive-date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some osteopaths were influenced by Rolf,&lt;ref name=riggs&gt;{{cite book |editor= Stillerman E |date= 2016 |edition= 2nd |title= Modalities for Massage and Bodywork |publisher=Elsevier |pages= 152 |isbn= 0323239315|author=Riggs A |chapter=Myofascial Release|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pi9yBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of her students became teachers of massage, including one of the founders of [[myofascial release]].&lt;ref name= "Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] |pages= 195–208 |isbn= 9780307575500}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|188,208}}

Rolf claimed to have found an association between emotions and the soft tissue, writing "although rolfing is not primarily a psychotherapeutic approach to the problems of humans", it does constitute an "approach to the personality through the myofascial collagen components of the physical body".&lt;ref name=ipr&gt;Ida Rolf ''quoted in'' {{cite book |editor=Rosemary Feitis |title=Rolfing and Physical Reality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7mtgps33gEC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1990 |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-89281-380-3 |pages=26–27 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed Rolfing could balance the mental and emotional aspects of subjects, and that "the amazing psychological changes that appeared in Rolfed individuals were completely unexpected".&lt;ref name=ipr/&gt; Rolfers suggest their manipulations can cause the release of painful repressed memories.&lt;ref name="contro" /&gt; Rolfers also hold that by manipulating the body they can bring about changes in personality so, for example, teaching somebody to walk with confidence will make them a more confident person.&lt;ref name=elpsy&gt;{{cite book |author=Roeckelein JE |title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA530 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-046064-2 |page=530 |chapter=Rolfing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between physical structure and psychology has not been proven by scientific studies.&lt;ref name=sd&gt;{{cite book |title= The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter= Rolfing |url= http://www.skepdic.com/rolfing |date= 22 January 2014 |last= Carroll |first= Robert Todd |authorlink= Robert Todd Carroll |edition= Online |accessdate= 2014-03-03 |isbn= 9780471272427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
Rolfers posit that they manipulate the body's fascial layers.&lt;ref name=broc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Daniels |editor1-first= Rick |editor2-last= Nicoll |editor2-first= Leslie |year= 2011 |chapter= Ch. 14: Complementary and Alternative Therapies |title= Contemporary Medical-Surgical Nursing |volume= 1  |edition= 2nd  |publisher= Cengage Learning |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=-tmHtnxutW4C&amp;pg=PA306 306] |isbn= 1439058660 |ref= {{SfnRef|Daniels &amp; Nicoll|2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfing also uses a combination of active and passive movement retraining.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book |last1= Schultz |first1= Richard Louis |last2= Feitis |first2= Rosemary |year= 1996 |title= The Endless Web: Fascial Anatomy and Physical Reality |publisher= [[North Atlantic Books]] |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=BIKubGskvtsC&amp;pg=PA33 33] |isbn= 1556432283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolfing is typically performed in a progression of 10 sessions, sometimes called "the recipe".&lt;ref name=recipe1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Myers TW |title=Structural integration—developments in Ida Rolf's 'Recipe'—I |journal=Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies |volume=8 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=131–142 |issn=1360-8592 |doi=10.1016/S1360-8592(03)00088-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three sessions of the protocol focus on superficial tissues, the next four focus on deeper tissues and specifically the pelvis, and the final sessions address the whole body.&lt;ref name=Deutsch&gt;{{cite book |last= Deutsch |first= Judith E. |chapter= The Ida Rolf Method of Structural Integration |editor-first= Judith E. |editor-last= Deutsch |year= 2008 |title= Complementary Therapies for Physical Therapy: A Clinical Decision-Making Approach |publisher= [[Saunders (imprint)|Saunders]] |pages= 266–7 |isbn= 0721601111 |ref= {{SfnRef|Deutsch|2008}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houglum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine" /&gt;

A session typically lasts between 60 and 90 minutes. The recipient wears undergarments.&lt;ref name="contro"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KGNwokGP20C&amp;pg=PA202|title=Controversies in the Practice of Medicine|last=|first=|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2001|isbn=978-0-313-31131-4|location=|page=202|pages=|quote=Practitioners suggest pent-up mental anguish tied to initial traumatic event or subsequent chronic pain is released as the fascias become more pliable.|via=|vauthors=Goldstein MC, Goldstein MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positions for the work include lying on a table, sitting, and standing.&lt;ref name="riggs" /&gt;{{rp|370}}

Rolfing treatments are sometimes painful.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; For adults, there may be moments of intense sensation during a treatment or soreness afterward.&lt;ref name=Knaster/&gt; However, the technique can be done gently enough for children and the elderly.&lt;ref name=Claire/&gt; Rolf believed fascia tightens as a protective mechanism, and therefore thought an aggressive approach could be counter-productive.&lt;ref name= Salvo&gt;{{cite book |last= Salvo |first= Susan G. |year= 2012 |title= Massage Therapy: Principles and Practice |edition= 4th |publisher= Elsevier Saunders |page= 423 |isbn= 1437719775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness and reception ==
In 2015 the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published a review of 17 alternative therapies including Rolfing which concluded no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |pages=16, 19, 125–8 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly In 2017 the Australian government named Rolfing as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence".&lt;ref name=nosubsidy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homeopathy, naturopathy struck off private insurance list |author=Paola S |year=17 October 2017 |journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy |url=https://ajp.com.au/news/homeopathy-naturopathy-struck-off-private-insurance-list/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Cancer Society]] says the deep soft tissue manipulations such as those used in Rolfing are a concern if practiced on people with cancer near tumor sites.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editors=Russell J, Rovere A |page=170 |chapter=Bodywork |url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Complete-Complementary-Alternative-Therapies/dp/0944235719}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Proponents of Rolfing claim it can be used to alleviate pain.&lt;ref name="Thompson2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Thompson|title=Counseling Techniques: Improving Relationships with Others, Ourselves, Our Families, and Our Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8JzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|date=27 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-61441-7|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Rolfing's focus on appropriate "alignment" of structures of the body does not reflect modern science about pain.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Edzard|last2=Pittler|first2=Max|last3=Wider|first3=Barbara|title=Complementary Therapies for Pain Management: An Evidence-Based Approach|date=2007|publisher=Elsevier|location=Moseby|isbn=978-0-7234-3400-9|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9oES85plfgC&amp;dq=complementary+therapies+for+pain+management&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moseley2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=G.

In 2010 ''The New York Times'' reported that Rolfing was enjoying a "resurgence" following an endorsement from [[Mehmet Oz]] on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/fashion/07rolfing.html |title=Rolfing, Excruciatingly Helpful |date=6 October 2010 |author=Considine A}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of its dependence on [[vitalistic]] concepts and its unevidenced propositions about the connection between physical manipulation and psychology, Rolfing is classified as a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Medical historian Barbara Clow writes that, in common with many other types of alternative medicine, Rolfing takes a view of illness and of therapy which conflicts with mainstream medicine.&lt;ref name=clow&gt;{{cite book |title=Negotiating Disease: Power and Cancer Care, 1900-1950 |year=2001 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |page=63 |author=Clow B|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFyee0XcIfoC&amp;pg=PA63 |quote=Before we explore medical reactions to therapeutic innovations in this era, we must stop to consider the meaning of 'alternative medicine' in this context.  Often scholars use the term to denote systems of healing that are philosophically as well as therapeutically distinct from regular medicine: homeopathy, reflexology, rolfing, macrobiotics, and spiritual healing, to name a few, embody interpretations of health, illness, and healing that are not only different from, but also at odds with conventional medical opinion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist and attorney [[Christopher Barden]] has numbered Rolfing among "dangerous and controversial" methods that pose a risk to the public.&lt;ref name=barden&gt;{{cite book|editors=Lorandos D, Bernet W, Sauber SR|title=Parental Alienation: The Handbook for Mental Health and Legal Professionals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNfCCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA279|year=2013|publisher=Charles C Thomas |isbn=978-0-398-08750-0|page=279|chapter=Chapter 9: Protecting the Integrity of the Family Law System: Multidisciplinary Processes and Family Law Reform |author=Barden RC |authorlink=Christopher Barden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologist Dan Agin has identified Rolfing as a popular kind of "quack medicine" in the "raucous bazaar" of the [[United States]]'s alternative medicine scene,&lt;ref name=agin&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Agin|title=Junk Science: How Politicians, Corporations, and Other Hucksters Betray Us|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4VzaPjTnxUC&amp;pg=PA114|date=27 November 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-3853-6|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health journalist [[Rose Shapiro]] lists Rolfing among the many popular "quack treatments" that rally today under the banner of [[integrative medicine]],&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rose Shapiro]]|title=[[Suckers (book)|Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All]]|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-5916-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib_IbOu_d9gC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and skeptic [[Robert Todd Carroll]] has said the vague health claims made by Rolfers are characteristic of those made by "quacks".&lt;ref name=sd/&gt;

== History ==

'''Roman-Dutch law''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Rooms-Hollands recht'', [[Afrikaans]]: ''Romeins-Hollandse reg'') is an [[Common law|uncodified]], [[Legal doctrine|scholarship]]-driven, [[Precedent|judge-made]] [[legal system]] based on [[Roman law]] as applied in the [[Netherlands]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. As such, it is a variety of the European continental [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or ''[[ius commune]]''. While Roman-Dutch law was superseded by [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic codal law]] in the [[Netherlands]] proper as early as the beginning of the 19th century, Roman-Dutch law is still applied by the courts of [[South Africa]] (and its neighbours [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Guyana]], [[Indonesia]], [[East Timor]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. It was largely drawn upon by [[Scots law]].&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cairns, “Importing our Lawyers from Holland: Netherlands Influences on Scots Law and Lawyers in the Eighteenth Century”, in ''Scotland and the Low Countries, 1124–1994'', ed. G. G. Simpson (East Linton: Tuckwell, 1996), 136; reprinted in ''Law, Lawyers, and Humanism: Selected Essays on the History of Scots Law'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; It also had some minor impact on the laws of the American state of [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Schout In Rensselaerswijck: Conflict Of Interests | journal = Colonial Albany Social History Project | date = April 1979 | first = Stefan | last = Bielinski| id = | url = http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/download_file/view/285/741/ | accessdate = 2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in introducing the office of Prosecutor (''[[schout]]-fiscaal'').

==History ==
[[Roman law]] was progressively abandoned during the early [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and excerpts of latter-day imperial enactments (''constitutiones'') were well known in the successor Germanic states and vital to maintaining the commonplace principle of folk-right which applied pre-existing Roman law to Roman provincials and Germanic law to Germans. The ''[[Breviary of Alaric]]'' and the ''[[Lex Burgundionum|Lex Gundobada Romana]]'' are two of the several hybrid Romano-Germanic law codes that incorporated much Roman legal material. However, because the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]] preceded the drafting of the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinianic Code]], early Byzantine law was never influential in Western Europe. Also, much of this early law was superseded by later feudal law. Only [[canon law]] successfully retained any substantial amount of Roman law to be influential.

Interest in the doctrines of Byzantine lawyers came when—around the year {{smallcaps|a.d.}} 1070—a copy of the ''[[Pandects|Digest]]'' of [[Byzantine Empire|Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] found its way into northern Italy. Scholars in the emerging [[University of Bologna]], who previously had access to only a limited portion of the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinianic code]], sparked an intellectual rediscovery of Roman law through the teaching of law based on Byzantine law texts. Courts gradually applied Byzantine law—as taught in Bologna (and soon elsewhere)—first as law ''in subsidium'' to be applied when there was no local statute or custom in point, and later because judicial officers (judges, magistrates, assessors) felt that its refined legal concepts were more apt to solve complex cases than the [[customary law]]s of western and central Europe. This process, referred to as [[doctrine of reception|reception]], took place in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the Mediterranean in the 13th-14th centuries, but was much slower to come to northern Europe (e.g., [[Saxony]], [[Northern France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Scandinavia]]).

In the 15th century, reception ''in complexu'' reached the Netherlands while it was associated with the Holy Roman Empire. While Italian lawyers (''mos italicus'') were the first to contribute to the new Byzantine-based jurisprudence, in the 16th century, French humanistic doctrinal scholars (''mos gallicus'') were most influential. In the 17th and 18th century, it was the Dutch who had the greatest influence. Members of the ''Hollandse Elegante School'' (“school of elegant jurisprudence”; 1500–1800) included [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Johannes Voet]], [[Ulrich Huber]], Gerard Noodt, J. and F. van de Sande, and many others. These scholars managed to merge Roman law with legal concepts taken from traditional Dutch feudal [[Custom (law)|customary]] law, especially from the province of [[Holland]]. The resulting mixture was predominantly Roman, but it contained some features which were characteristically Dutch: this hybrid is known as Roman-Dutch law. The Dutch applied their legal system in their colonial empire. In so doing, the distinctly Dutch branch of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (or ''ius commune'') came to be applied in far-flung places, e.g., the [[Dutch East Indies]], [[Dutch West Indies]], [[Cape Colony]], and [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Dutch Ceylon]].&lt;ref name=Smits&gt;{{cite book|last=Smits|first=J.M.|title=The Making of European Private Law: Towards a Ius Commune Europaeum As a Mixed Legal System|year=2002|publisher=Intersentia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156–157}}

In the Netherlands, Roman-Dutch law abruptly ended when, in 1809, the Dutch puppet state—the [[Kingdom of Holland]]—adopted the French [[Napoleonic Code]], a different system but nonetheless a branch of civil law. Yet, in the then-Dutch colonies, French law was never introduced during or after the Napoleonic era. As a result, Roman-Dutch law has managed to survive, usually in a hybrid form mixed with English law, otherwise known as “Anglo-Dutch law”.

==Law reform in former Dutch colonies==

The Netherlands participated in international seminars and training programmes organized by international partner organisations, ranging from a two-day seminar to a two-week programme for different legal professionals around the world. Programmes have been developed for Surinam, Aruba, Sint Maarten and Indonesia.

'''''Schutzjude''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃʊtsˌjuːdə|lang}}, "protected Jew") was a status for [[History of the Jews in Germany| German Jew]]s granted by the imperial, princely or royal courts. 

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], except some eastern territories gained by the Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries (e.g. [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]), Jews usually had the status of [[Servi camerae regis]]. This status included imperial protection and the levying of special taxes on the Jews for the Empire's treasury (Latin: camera regis). But the emperors, always short of money, alienated — by sale or pledge — their privilege to levy extra taxes on Jews, not all at once, but territory by territory to different creditors and purchasers. Thus Jews lost their — not always reliable — imperial protection. 

Many territories that gained supremacy over the Jews living within their boundaries subsequently expelled them. After the general expulsions of the Jews from a given territory often only single Jews&amp;nbsp;— if any at all&amp;nbsp;— would be granted the personal privilege to reside within the territory. This personal privilege, documented by a ''Schutzbrief'' (writ of protection), a ''Geleitsbrief'' (writ of escort), or (in Brandenburg) a ''Patent'', was sometimes inheritable by only one son (in rare instances, by all sons), and was sometimes uninheritable. Jews holding such a privilege were thus called ''Schutzjuden'', ''vergeleitete Juden'', or ''Patentjuden'', as opposed to Jews who had no right of residence, who were known as ''unvergeleitete Juden''. The latter were not allowed to marry, and might spend their life unmarried as a member of the household of a privileged relative or employer. 

For example, in October 1763 King [[Frederick II "the Great", King in Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] granted [[Moses Mendelssohn]], until then under protection by being employed by a ''Patentjude'', a personal, uninheritable privilege, which assured his right to undisturbed residence in [[Berlin]]. His wife and children, who had no independent permission to reside, lost their status of family member of a ''Patentjude'' when Mendelssohn died in 1786. They were later granted multi-son inheritable ''Patents''. In 1810 [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein's]] [[Prussian reforms]] introduced a freely inheritable Prussian citizenship for all subjects of the king, doing away with the different prior legal status of the Estates, such as the Nobility, the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of the chartered cities, the unfree peasants, the officialdom at the court, the Patent Jews, and the [[Huguenot]]s.

'''Scottish Common Sense Realism''', also known as the '''Scottish School of Common Sense''',&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=George|title=Dominant themes of modern philosophy: a history|publisher=Ronald Press Co|location=New York|year=1957|pages=660|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-AYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Scottish+School+of+Common+Sense%22&amp;dq=%22Scottish+School+of+Common+Sense%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] school of [[philosophy]] that originated in the ideas of Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]], and [[Dugald Stewart]] during the 18th-century [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

==History==
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]]]
The Scottish School of Common Sense was an [[epistemological]] philosophy that flourished in Scotland in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=Redekop&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redekop | first1 = Benjamin | year = 2004 | title = The Correspondence of Thomas Reid | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of History | volume = 39 | issue = 1| page = 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots can be found in responses to the writings of such philosophers as [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], and its most prominent members were [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Philosophically, Scottish Realism served as a rebuttal to scepticism while keeping with the influential teachings of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref name=Redekop /&gt; While largely understated for many years,&lt;ref name=Redekop /&gt; the influence it had on philosophers elsewhere in Europe, not to mention in the United States, is of a considerable magnitude.

One central concern of the school was to defend "common sense" against philosophical [[paradox]] and [[scepticism]]. It argued that common-sense beliefs govern the lives and thoughts even of those who avow non-commonsensical beliefs and that matters of common sense are inherent to the acquisition of knowledge. The qualities of its works were not generally consistent; [[Edward S. Reed]] writes, e.g., "[Whereas] Thomas Reid wished to use common sense to develop philosophical wisdom, much of this school simply wanted to use common sense to attack any form of intellectual change."&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Reed, The Necessity of Experience, p. 16. Yale University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
The Scottish School of Common Sense was founded by Reid in opposition to [[Descartes]]'s  [[Idealism|Theory of Ideas]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, Thomas (1997). An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press LTD. pp. xii-xxiii. {{ISBN|0748607226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the epistemology of [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] led [[John Locke]] and David Hume to a skeptical philosophy that realists found absurd and contrary to common experience. Thus Hume and his sceptical argument would serve as the primary foil to the development of Reid's philosophy. Under the tutelage of [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]], Reid embraced the tenets of Providential Naturalism and its four interconnected tenets; using these as the basis for his refutation of the theory of ideas.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt; Reid painstakingly developed his treatise ''An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense'' over the course of 40 years, often seeking the input of his contemporary philosophers within the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] including Hume.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

Reid articulated the basic principle of Common Sense Realism:

:"If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo and Woudenberg, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid'' (2004) p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish Common Sense Realism is rooted in Aristotelian thought and advocates an empirical and scientific philosophy wherein trust of our senses is implicit and necessary.&lt;ref name=Haldan&gt;Haldane, John (2007 April). "Scottish Philosophy". Monism 90 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148}} The principles of common sense are fundamental to our accumulation of knowledge of both [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and physical constructs.&lt;ref name="Redekop" /&gt; However, observation alone cannot account for all knowledge and truth can be garnered by reflection.&lt;ref name=Haldan /&gt;{{rp|149}} In Reid's own words:

:"I can likewise conceive an individual object that really exists, such as [[St. Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's Church]] in London. I have an idea of it; I conceive it. The immediate object of this conception is 400 miles distant; and I have no reason to think it acts upon me or that I act on it."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Thomas. [https://archive.org/stream/essaysonintellec02reiduoft#page/n7/mode/2up Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man]. Dublin: Ireland. Essay IV  p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The school taught that every person had ordinary experiences that provided intuitively certain assurance of a) the existence of the self, b) the existence of real objects that could be seen and felt; and c) certain "first principles" upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. These principles laid the foundation for Reid's influential theory of perception.

In practice, philosophers of the Scottish school offered scientific explanations to historical events and advocated an unprejudiced and inter-disciplinary approach to education, free from religious and patriotic biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirayes|first=J.

===Theories of perception===
Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart offered related theories of perception rooted in Scottish Common Sense Realism. According to [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] of [[Yale University]], Reid's philosophy can be non-contentiously reduced to four basic precepts:
:"(1) The objects of acts of perception are external objects-That is, mind-independent spatially-located entities;
: (2) The necessary and sufficient condition for perceiving an external object is that the object cause in one a conception thereof and an immediate (non-inferential) belief about it;
: (3) We human beings are so made that, in perception, the external object causes a conception of, and an immediate belief about, itself, by way of causing a sensation which in turn causes ('suggests') the conception and immediate belief;

==Influence==
Common Sense Realism not only dominated Scottish thought in the 19th century, it had a major influence as well in France, the United States, and other countries. [[Victor Cousin]] (1792–1867) was the most important proponent in France. Reidian thought was the "orthodox philosophy of colleges and universities"&lt;ref name=redekop&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redekop | first1 = Benjamin | year = 2004 | title = The Correspondence of Thomas Reid | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=9199cefe-9180-47a6-9e3d-6c43223696fa%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=123 | journal = Canadian Journal of History | volume = 39 | issue = 1| page = 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 18th century and provided an intellectual bedrock for the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Redekop" /&gt; 

===The Founding Fathers===

Trumbull's painting appears on the reverse of the [[United States two-dollar bill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrevolution.org/deckey.html americanrevolution.org] – Key to Trumbull's picture&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Common Sense Realism swept American intellectual circles in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;Robinson, Daniel (April 2007). "The Scottish Enlightenment and the American Founding". Monist 90 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} Reid's philosophy was pervasive during the [[American Revolution]] and served as a stabilizing philosophical influence.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|180}}  Hailed by some as the "father of modern psychiatry,"&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|173}} [[Benjamin Rush]]'s tutelage at the [[University of Edinburgh]] imbued him with strong realist tendencies which influenced much of his scientific and political work including his moral opposition to slavery.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|174}}  Evidence of the influence of Scottish Common Sense realism can readily be found in the philosophy of both [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]]. Adams compared the contributions of Dugald Stewart favorably to works of [[Aristotle]] and [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|170}} Scotsman and signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[John Witherspoon]] presided over [[Princeton University]]; students under his tutelage included 12 state governors, 55 delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and future president [[James Madison]].&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|171}} His education at the University of Edinburgh made him a strong proponent of the Scottish Enlightenment and Realism. [[James McCosh]] (1811–94) continued the influence of Scottish Realism at Princeton when he became president of the university in 1868, reviving its influence as a major stronghold of the movement. [[Noah Porter]] (1811–92) taught Common Sense realism to generations of students at Yale.

===Fundamentalism===
[[File:Princeton Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|right|Princeton Seminary in the 1800s]]
Scottish Realism greatly influenced conservative religious thought and was strongest at [[Princeton Seminary]] until the Seminary moved in new directions after 1929. The Princeton theologians built their elaborate system on the basis of "common-sense" realism, biblicism and confessionalism.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Livingston and Francis Schüssler Fiorenza, ''Modern Christian Thought: The Enlightenment and the nineteenth century'' (2006) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; James McCosh was brought from Queen's College, Belfast, to Princeton College's Chair of Moral Philosophy and Presidency because of his book "The Method of Divine Government," a Christian philosophy that was precursory to Charles Darwin's "The Origin of Species" (1859). The [[Princeton Theologians]] followed McCosh to adopt a stance of theistic evolution. They tried to persuade [[John Gresham Machen]] (1881–1937), a leader of [[Fundamentalist Christianity|the Fundamentalists]] in the 1920s, but he would not stand with McCosh, nor could he stand for the shift the school was making. Therefore, he and a number of other Princeton faculty members left and started [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in Philadelphia. This, however, did not stop McCosh from moving forward. It was his goal to develop Princeton as a Christian university in North America, as well as a forefront intellectual seminary of the Presbyterian Church.  The faculty of the College and Seminary included both evolutionary thinkers and non-evolutionary thinkers. Much evangelical theology of the 21st century is based on Princeton theology and thus reflects Common Sense Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Grenz, Brian McLaren, John R. Franke, ''Renewing the center: evangelical theology in a post-theological era'' (2006) pp 79, 177&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament scholar Grant Osborne concludes that Scottish Common Sense Realism influenced biblical hermeneutics, that the surface level understanding of Scripture became popular, and individualistic interpretations abounded.&lt;ref&gt;Grant R. Osborne, The Hermeneutical Spiral: A Comprehensive Introduction to Biblical Interpretation, Rev. and expanded, 2nd ed. (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2006), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">In [[mathematics]], the '''splitting principle''' is a technique used to reduce questions about [[vector bundle]]s to the case of [[line bundle]]s.

In the theory of vector bundles, one often wishes to simplify computations, say of [[Chern classes]].  Often computations are well understood for line bundles and for direct sums of line bundles.  In this case the splitting principle can be quite useful.  

{{math_theorem|Let &lt;math&gt;\xi\colon E\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; be a vector bundle of rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; over a [[paracompact space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  There exists a space &lt;math&gt;Y=Fl(E)&lt;/math&gt;, called the flag bundle associated to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and a map &lt;math&gt;p\colon Y\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that 

#the induced cohomology homomorphism &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon H^*(X)\rightarrow H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is injective, and
#the pullback bundle &lt;math&gt;p^*\xi\colon p^*E\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; breaks up as a direct sum of line bundles: &lt;math&gt;p^*(E)=L_1\oplus L_2\oplus\cdots\oplus L_n.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The theorem above holds for complex vector bundles and integer coefficients or for real vector bundles with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; coefficients. In the complex case, the line bundles &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; or their first [[characteristic class]]es are called '''Chern roots.''' 

The fact that &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon H^*(X)\rightarrow H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is injective means that any equation which holds in &lt;math&gt;H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; (say between various Chern classes) also holds in &lt;math&gt;H^*(X)&lt;/math&gt;.  

The point is that these equations are easier to understand for direct sums of line bundles than for arbitrary vector bundles, so equations should be understood in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and then pushed down to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetric polynomial==
Under the splitting principle, characteristic classes for complex vector bundles correspond to [[symmetric polynomials]] in the first Chern classes of complex line bundles; these are the [[Chern class]]es.

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}

A '''suspended sentence''' is a legal term for a judge's delaying of a defendant's serving of a sentence after they have been found guilty, in order to allow the defendant to perform a period of [[probation]]. If the defendant does not break the law during that period, and fulfills the particular conditions of the probation, the judge usually dismisses the sentence.

==Australia==
{{See also|Punishment in Australia}}
In Australia, suspended sentences are commonly imposed in order to alleviate the strain on overcrowded prisons. For example, an individual may be sentenced to a six-month jail term, wholly suspended for six months; if they commit any other offence during that year, the original jail term is immediately applied in addition to any other sentence.

As of 1 September, 2014, suspended sentences no longer exist in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/suspended-prison-sentences-now-banned-in-all-victorian-courts|title=Suspended sentences scrapped in all Victorian courts|first=Australian Associated|last=Press|date=1 September 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{further|Criminal sentencing in Canada#Probation and suspended sentences}}

==People's Republic of China==
{{unreferencedsect|date=October 2015}}
In the [[People's Republic of China]] (excluding [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), both suspended sentences and suspended ''sentencing'' ({{zh|缓刑}}, also translated as a sentence "with reprieve") are featured in the criminal law. In the first situation, a fixed term sentence of three years or below can be suspended. In the second situation, sentencing does not immediately follow the guilty verdict, but instead is determined after a period of [[probation]].

[[Capital punishment|Death sentences]] can also be suspended (called a "[[death sentence with reprieve]]"), so that an offender who does not intentionally re-offend during the two-year suspension period would have the sentence commuted to a life sentence.

==Finland==
{{unreferencedsect|date=October 2015}}
A suspended sentence is called ''ehdollinen vankeusrangaistus'' in Finnish, which translates to "conditional imprisonment". When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed conditionally, the enforcement of the sentence is postponed for a probation period. The length of the probation period is at least one and at most three years. The probation period begins at the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment. When conditional imprisonment is imposed, the convicted person shall be notified, in connection with the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment, of the date when the probation period ends and of the grounds on which the sentence may be ordered to be enforced. 

The court may order the enforcement of conditional imprisonment if the convicted person commits an offence during the probation period and the charge has been brought within one year of the end of the probation period. In this event, the conditional sentence to be enforced, the sentence for the offence committed during the probation period and the sentences of imprisonment for the other offences considered in the same trial shall be joined as one unconditional sentence of imprisonment. The court may also order that conditional imprisonment be enforced only in part, in which case the remainder of the sentence shall continue to be conditional, subject to the same probation period.

==Ireland==
In the [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], the 2006 law by which a suspended sentence is activated was ruled [[Constitution of Ireland|unconstitutional]] in 2016. The 2006 law required that a court decision on whether to activate the suspended sentence be made as soon as a later conviction was handed down, even if there was an [[Appeal (law)|appeal]] pending for the later conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0419/782865-high-court-suspended/|title=Suspended sentence law deemed 'unconstitutional'|date=19 April 2016|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=19 April 2016}}; {{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/suspended-sentences-are-rendered-useless-by-ruling-1.2616639|title=Suspended sentences  are rendered useless by ruling|last=Carolan|first=Mary|date=20 April 2016|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=20 April 2016}};  {{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0026.htm#id1152029045.17|title=Criminal Justice Act 2006 [as amended]|date=11 February 2016|work=Revised Acts|publisher=[[Law Reform Commission (Ireland)|Law Reform Commission]]|nopp=Y|page=§99.

==Japan==
{{nihongo|Suspended sentences|執行猶予|shikkō yūyo}} are common practice in [[Japan]] and can be applied in cases where a sentence is for up to 3 years in prison and/or 500,000 yen in fines. Any criminal activity during the period of the suspended sentence will result in the cancellation of the sentence and imprisonment for the prescribed term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.go.jp/saiban/qa_keizi/qa_keizi_28/index.html|title=裁判手続 刑事事件Q&amp;A 執行猶予が付いているとどうなるのですか|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Japan]]|date=2005|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
A suspended sentence can be applied if the term of imprisonment is under two years and the offender agrees to comply with court requirements including a curfew, performing [[unpaid work]] and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/about-sentencing/types-of-sentence/suspended-sentences/|title=Suspended sentences|author=Sentencing Council|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 5% of convictions resulted in a suspended sentence, compared to 7% immediate custodial sentences.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- Percentage calculated from "all offences" column (immediate/suspended custodial sentences respectively divided by "all sentenced") in the spreadsheet linked here: --&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/criminal-justice-statistics-quarterly|title=MoJ Sentencing Statistics|author=Ministry of Justice|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, it is common practice for judges to hand down suspended sentences to first-time offenders who have committed a minor crime, and for [[prosecutor]]s to recommend suspended sentences as part of a [[plea bargain]]. They are often given to mitigate the effect of penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/suspended-sentence/ |title=Suspended Sentence Law &amp; Legal Definition |work=Legal Terms, Definitions, and Dictionary |publisher=USLegal.com |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, the [[criminal record]] of the guilty party will still carry the offense, even after [[probation]] is adequately served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manitobacourts.mb.ca/definitions.html |title=Definitions: Understanding Legal Words |date= 23 October 2006 |publisher=Manitoba Courts |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the process of [[deferred adjudication]] prevents the conviction from appearing on a person's criminal record, once probation had been completed.

In the federal system, judges' authority to suspend sentences has been abolished, by the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] of 1984, through the [[United States Sentencing Commission]], and upheld by ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Sustainable Development Goals''' ('''SDGs''') (or '''Global Goals for Sustainable Development''', the '''17 Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;, the '''Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''the Goals"'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;) are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The SDGs are part of Resolution 70/1 of the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt;: "Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."

Achieving all 169 targets would signal accomplishing all 17 goals. The SDGs cover social and economic development issues including [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[global warming]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 54 of [[ the United Nations]] [[UNGA|General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/70/1 of 25 September 2015 contains the goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN-led process involved its 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|Member States]] and global [[civil society]]. The resolution is a broad intergovernmental agreement that acts as the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]. The SDGs build on the principles agreed upon in Resolution A/RES/66/288, entitled "The Future We Want".&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templatelab.com/rio-20-summit-the-future-we-want/ |title=United Nations Official Document |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a non-binding document released as a result of [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20 Conference]] held in 2012.&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"/&gt;

Implementation as of 2016 is described as "Localizing the SDGs" to highlight the role of local institutions and local actors.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Regional efforts included agreements like the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]]&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;. Some remain pessimistic about the potential for achieving the SDGs, especially because of estimates of the cost of achieving all 17.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  However, progress had been reported by 2018. For example, fewer African children under the age of 5 are suffering from [[Stunted growth|stunting]] and wasting. However, the same study concluded that it is unlikely there will be an end to [[malnutrition]] by 2030.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;   {{TOC limit|3}}

In 1972, governments met in Stockholm, Sweden, for the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], to consider the rights of the family to a healthy and productive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Sustainable Development in the United Nations |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618171731/http://www.uncsd2012.org/history.html |website=Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=UN |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=20-22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the United Nations created the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]] (later known as the Brundtland Commission), which defined sustainable development as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm|title=Our Common Future, Chapter 2: Towards Sustainable Development - A/42/427 Annex, Chapter 2 - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Development|first=World Commission on Environment and|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the first [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) or Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, where the first agenda for Environment and Development, also known as Agenda 21, was developed and adopted.

In 2012, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]], was held as a 20-year follow up to UNCED. Colombia proposed the idea of the SDGs at a preparation event for Rio+20 held in Indonesia in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deliver2030.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-short-history-of-the-SDGs-Paula-Caballero.pdf|title=A Short History of the SDGs|last=Caballero|first=Paula|date=April 29, 2016|website=Deliver 2030|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118221940/http://deliver2030.org/wp%2Dcontent/uploads/2016/04/A%2Dshort%2Dhistory%2Dof%2Dthe%2DSDGs%2DPaula%2DCaballero.pdf|archive-date=2017-11-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, this idea was picked up by the [[United Nations Department of Public Information]] 64th NGO Conference in Bonn, Germany. The outcome document proposed 17 sustainable development goals and associated targets. In the run-up to Rio+20 there was much discussion about the idea of the SDGs. At the Rio+20 Conference, a resolution known as "The Future We Want" was reached by member states.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/futurewewant.html|title=Future We Want – Outcome document .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication, energy, water and sanitation, health, and human settlement.

The Rio+20 outcome document mentioned that “at the outset, the OWG [Open Working Group] will decide on its methods of work, including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society, the scientific community and the United Nations system in its work, in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience”.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In January 2013, the 30-member UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs. The Open Working Group (OWG) was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly, September 2013 – September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/ga11339.doc.htm |title=New Open Working Group to Propose Sustainable Development Goals for Action by General Assembly’s Sixty-eighth Session &amp;#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases |website=Un.org |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2014, the OWG forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly. After 13 sessions, the OWG submitted their proposal of 17 SDGs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the General Assembly in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgsproposal|title=Home .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2014, the UN General Assembly accepted the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]]'s Synthesis Report, which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 SDG process would be based on the OWG proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/700&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] from 2007 to 2016, has stated that: "We don’t have plan B because there is no planet B!."&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/11/secretary-generals-remarks-to-the-press-at-cop22/|title=Secretary-General’s remarks to the press at COP22|date=15 November 2016|website=UN|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}} This thought has guided the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] was a process from 2012 to 2015 led by the [[United Nations]] to define the future global development framework that would succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The SDGs were developed to succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which ended in 2015. The gaps and shortcomings of MDG Goal 8 (To develop a global partnership for development) led to identifying a problematic "donor-recipient" relationship.&lt;ref name="post-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/untaskteam_undf/report2.shtml|title=Report of the UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|author=UN Task Team on the Post 2015 Agenda|year=March 2013|publisher=United Nations|page=1|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the new SDGs favor collective action by all countries.&lt;ref name="post-2015"/&gt;

=== Ratification ===
Negotiations on the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] began in January 2015 and ended in August 2015. The negotiations ran in parallel to United Nations negotiations on Financing for Development, which determined the financial means of implementing the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]; those negotiations resulted in adoption of the [[Addis Ababa Action Agenda]] in July 2015. A final document was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015 in New York City, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2015/09/24/undp-welcomes-adoption-of-sustainable-development-goals-by-world-leaders.html|title=World leaders adopt Sustainable Development Goals|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development".&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/breakdown-of-un-sustainable-development-goals.html?_r=0|title=Breakdown of U.N. Sustainable Development Goals|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agenda has 92 paragraphs. Paragraph 51 outlines the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the associated 169 targets.

== Implementation ==
[[File:B-1356@PEK (20180411153702).jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 787]] of [[XiamenAir]] in Sustainable Development Goals [[livery]] in 2018]]
Implementation of the SDGs started worldwide in 2016. This process can also be called "Localizing the SDGs". All over the planet, individual people, universities, governments and institutions and organizations of all kinds work on several goals at the same time.&lt;ref name="globalcitizen.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702204256/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |archive-date=2 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In each country, governments must translate the goals into national legislation, develop a plan of action, establish budgets and at the same time be open to and actively search for partners. Poor countries need the support of rich countries and coordination at the international level is crucial.&lt;ref name=D+C&gt;{{cite news |title=Global governance for SDGs|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/peer-pressure-can-contribute-achieving-sdgs-more-needed|author=Belay Begashaw|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=16 April 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent campaign "Project Everyone" has met some resistance.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://africaplatform.org/news/why-this-is-sustainable-development-not-global-goals/|title=Why this is Sustainable Development Not Global Goals – Africa Platform|website=Africaplatform.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several sections of civil society and governments felt the SDGs ignored "[[sustainability]]" even though it was the most important aspect of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicywatch.org/blog/2015/09/25/public-sdgs-or-private-ggs/|title=Public SDGs or Private GGs? – Global Policy Watch|website=Globalpolicywatch.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study in the journal ''Nature'' found that while "nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight... much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target—to end malnutrition by 2030."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osgood-Zimmerman|first=Aaron|last2=Millear|first2=Anoushka I.|last3=Stubbs|first3=Rebecca W.|last4=Shields|first4=Chloe|last5=Pickering|first5=Brandon V.|last6=Earl|first6=Lucas|last7=Graetz|first7=Nicholas|last8=Kinyoki|first8=Damaris K.|last9=Ray|first9=Sarah E.|date=2018|title=Mapping child growth failure in Africa between 2000 and 2015|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25760|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=555|issue=7694|pages=41–47|doi=10.1038/nature25760|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two books produced one by each of the co-chairs of the negotiations to help people to understand the Sustainable Development Goals and where they came from: "Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals: A transformational agenda for an insecure world" written by Ambassador David Donoghue, Felix Dodds and Jimena Leiva as well as "Transforming Multilateral Diplomacy: The Inside Story of the Sustainable Development Goals" by Macharia Kamau, David O'Connor and Pamela Chasek. 

===Europe and Russia===
Baltic nations, via the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]], have created the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbss.org/sustainable-prosperous-region/egsd-baltic-2030-2/|title=Sustainable Development - Baltic 2030 - cbss.org|work=cbss.org|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] has observed that UK and [[European Union]] [[pension fund|pension investors]] have been at the forefront of ESG-driven asset allocation at home and abroad and [[early adopter]]s of “SDG-centric” investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Government of India]] established the [[NITI Aayog]] to attain the sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name=indgoal1&gt;[http://www.looppng.com/business/businesses-india-keen-govt-delegation-71103 Business in India keen: delegation] Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 Haryana became the first state in India to have its annual budget focused on the attainment of SDG with a 3-year action plan and a 7-year strategy plan to implement sustainable development goals when [[Captain Abhimanyu]], Finance Minister of [[Government of Haryana]], unveiled a {{INRConvert|1151980|m|currency_formatting=c|lk=on|to=USD EUR|year=2018}} annual 2018-19 budget.&lt;ref name=ungoal1&gt;[Haryana Budget 2018 Presented by Captain Abhimanyu: Highlights Haryana Budget 2018 Presented by Captain Abhimanyu: Highlights], India.com, 9 Mar 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public engagement ==
[[File:SDG-pyramid.jpg|thumb|A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid.]]
UN agencies which are part of the [[United Nations Development Group]] decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience. This campaign, "Project Everyone," had the support of corporate institutions and other international organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-everyone.org/|title=Project Everyone|website=Project-everyone.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the text drafted by diplomats at the UN level, a team of communication specialists developed icons for every goal.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals&lt;/ref&gt; They also shortened the title "The 17 Sustainable Development Goals" to "[[Global Goals]]/17#GlobalGoals," then ran workshops and conferences to communicate the Global Goals to a global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenewdivision.world/global-goals-branding|title=the-new-division|website=the-new-division|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.good.is/slideshows/designing-the-global-goals-for-everyone|title=How This Great Design Is Bringing World Change to the Masses|date=2015-09-24|work=GOOD Magazine|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalfestivalofideas.org/|title=Global Festival of Action – Global Festival of Action|website=globalfestivalofideas.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early concern was that 17 goals would be too much for people to grasp and that therefore the SDGs would fail to get a wider recognition.{{When|date=November 2018}} That without wider recognition the necessary momentum to achieve them by 2030 would not be archived. Concerned with this, British film-maker [[Richard Curtis]] started the organization in 2015 called Project Everyone with the aim to bring the goals to everyone on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.project-everyone.org/ Project Everyone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/making-the-sdgs-famous-and-popular/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09382406&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis approached Swedish designer [[sv:Jakob Trollbäck]] who rebranded them as The Global Goals and created the 17 iconic visuals with clear short names as well as a logotype for the whole initiative. The communication system is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalgoals.org/resources&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Jakob Trollbäck and his company The New Division  went on to extend the communication system to also include the 169 targets that describe how the goals can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewdivision.world&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Le Temps Presse festival ===
The annual "Le Temps Presse" festival in [[Paris]] utilizes cinema to sensitize the public, especially young people, to the Sustainable Development Goals. The origin of the festival was in 2010 when eight directors produced a film titled "8," which included eight short films, each featuring one of the Millennium Development Goals. After 2.5 million viewers saw "8" on YouTube, the festival was created. It now showcases young directors whose work promotes social, environmental and human commitment. The festival now focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letempspresse.org/fr/le-festival/|title=Le Temps Presse|last=|first=|date=15 November 2017|website=Le Temps Presse|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==17 goals==
There are 169 targets for the 17 goals. Each target has between 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. In total, there are 304 indicators that will measure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/6754Technical%20report%20of%20the%20UNSC%20Bureau%20%28final%29.pdf|title=Technical report by the Bureau of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) on the process of the development of an indicator framework for the goals and targets of the post-2015 development agenda – working draft|date=March 2015|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has been asked to provide easy to understand lists of targets and facts and figures for each of the 17 SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/L.85&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations General Assembly Draft outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda|website=UN|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17 goals listed below as sub-headings use the 2-to-4 word phrases that identify each goal. Directly below each goal, in quotation marks, is the exact wording of the goal in one sentence. The paragraphs that follow present some information about a few targets and indicators related to each goal.

[[File:Sustainable Development Goals chart.svg|thumb|787x787px|A diagram listing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals|center]]

=== Goal 1: No poverty ===

==== "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-1-no-poverty.html|title=Goal 1: No poverty|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Extreme poverty]] has been cut by more than half since 1990. Still, more than 1 in 5 people live on less than the target figure of US$1.25 per day. That target may not be adequate for human [[subsistence]], however. Some suggest it may be necessary to raise the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] figure to as high as $5 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/global-poverty-climate-change-sdgs/|title=The Problem with Saving the World {{!}} Jacobin|website=www.jacobinmag.com|access-date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is more than the lack of income or resources. People live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare, security, and education. They also experience hunger, social [[discrimination]], and exclusion from decision-making processes.

Children make up the majority – more than half – of those living in extreme poverty. In 2013, an estimated 385 million children lived on less than US$1.90 per day. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide. On average, 97 percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards SDG Goal 1, and 63 percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women face potentially life-threatening risks from early [[pregnancy]] and frequent pregnancies. This can result in lost hope for an education and for a better income.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Poverty affects age groups differently, with the most devastating effects experienced by children. It affects their education, health, nutrition, and security, impacting emotional and spiritual development.

Achieving Goal 1 is hampered by growing inequality, increasingly [[Fragile state|fragile statehood]], and the impacts of [[Global warming|climate change]].&lt;ref name="D+C/E+Z"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/eradicate-extreme-poverty-ultra-poor-need-be-reached|title=Programmes for the poorest of the poor|author=Jörn Geisselmann|date=29 April 2017|work=D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 2: Zero hunger ===
==== "[[Hunger#Global initiatives to end hunger|End hunger]], achieve [[food security]] and improved nutrition, and promote [[sustainable agriculture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-2-zero-hunger.html|title=Goal 2: Zero hunger|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Goal 2 states that by 2030 we should end hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This would be accomplished by doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (especially women and indigenous peoples), by ensuring sustainable food production systems, and by progressively improving land and soil quality. Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40% of the global population. It is the largest source of income for poor rural households. Women make up about 43% of the agricultural labor force in [[Developing country|developing countries]], and over 50% in parts of Asia and Africa. However, women own only 20% of the land.

Other targets deal with maintaining genetic diversity of seeds, increasing access to land, preventing trade restriction and distortions in world agricultural markets to limit extreme food price volatility, eliminating waste with help from the International Food Waste Coalition, and ending malnutrition and undernutrition of children.

Globally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. Undernutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide,&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributes to nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five – 3.1 million children per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/130565-1.pdf|title=From Promise to Impact: Ending malnutrition by 2030|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic malnutrition, which affects an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children's brain and physical development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, only 26 of 202 UN member countries are on track to meet the SDG target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) of 2013 stated that the emphasis of the SDGs should not be on ending poverty by 2030, but on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition by 2025.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"&gt;Fan, Shenggen and Polman, Paul. 2014. [http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/128045 An ambitious development goal: Ending hunger and undernutrition by 2025]. In 2013 Global food policy report. Eds. Marble, Andrew and Fritschel, Heidi. Chapter 2. Pp 15-28. Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in China, Vietnam, Brazil, and Thailand. Three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture-led; 2) social protection- and nutrition- intervention-led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"/&gt;

=== Goal 3: Good health and well-being for people ===
==== "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-3-good-health-and-well-being.html|title=Goal 3: Good health and well-being|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with [[Child mortality|child]] and [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]]. Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births).&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Newborns account for a growing number of these deaths, and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under-5 mortality due to a number of factors.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; SDG Goal 3 aims to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. But if current trends continue, more than 60 countries will miss the SDG neonatal mortality target for 2030. About half of these countries would not reach the target even by 2050. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; 

Goal 3 also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/meetings/2015/un-sustainable-development-summit/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; In 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data for girls of greatest concern – those aged between 10-14 - is currently unavailable. Key strategies for meeting SDG Goal 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Similarly, progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and on reducing [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]].  From 2000-2016, new HIV infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 15-19.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; However, current trends mean that 1 out of 4 countries still won't meet the SDG target to end AIDS among children under 5, and 3 out of 4 will not meet the target to end AIDS among adolescents.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;  Additionally, only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need, and the need for [[family planning]] is increasing exponentially as the population grows. While needs are being addressed gradually, more than 225 million women have an unmet need for [[Birth control|contraception]].

Goal 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential medicines and vaccines.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under 5 and to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and water-borne diseases, for example.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; 2016 rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine (DTP3) and the first dose of the measles vaccine (MCV1) reached 86 percent and 85 percent, respectively. Yet about 20 million children did not receive DTP3 and about 21 million did not receive MCV1. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Around 2 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress in order to reach SDG targets for immunization.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Attention to health and well-being also includes targets related to the prevention and treatment of [[substance abuse]], deaths and injuries from [[Traffic collision|traffic accidents]] and from hazardous chemicals and air, [[Water pollution|water]] and soil pollution and contamination.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

=== Goal 4: Quality education ===
==== "Ensure [[inclusion (education)|inclusive]] and [[educational equity|equitable]] quality education and promote [[lifelong learning]] opportunities for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-4-quality-education.html|title=Goali 4: Quality education|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Major progress has been made in access to education, specifically at the [[primary school]] level, for both boys and girls. Still, at least 22 million children in 43 countries will miss out on pre-primary education unless the rate of progress doubles.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school. 103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills, and more than 60 percent of those are women.  In one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Target 1 of Goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.

Additionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards SDG Goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data on learning outcomes and pre-primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; This makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind.

=== Goal 5: Gender equality ===


==== "Achieve [[gender equality]] and [[empowerment|empower]] all women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-5-gender-equality.html|title=Goal 5: Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
According to the UN, "gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will nurture sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. A record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions as of 2014. However, another 52 had not taken this step. In many nations, gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms. Even though SDG5 is a stand-alone goal, other SDGs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men. Issues unique to women and girls include traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, such as female genital mutilation.

[[Child marriage]] has declined over the past decades, yet there is no region that is currently on track to eliminate the practice and reach SDG targets by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; If current trends continue, between 2017 and 2030, 150 million girls will be married before they turn 18.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world, most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the SDG Goal 5 target to eliminate child marriage by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Achieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=5 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targets call for an end to gender discrimination and for empowering women and girls through technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 05. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls – Indicators and a Monitoring Framework|url=http://indicators.report/goals/goal-5/|website=indicators.report|publisher=indicators.report|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have advocated for "listening to girls". The assertion is that the SDGs can deliver transformative change for girls only if girls are consulted. Their priorities and needs must be taken into account. Girls should be viewed not as beneficiaries of change, but as agents of change. Engaging women and girls in the implementation of the SDGs is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leach|first1=Anna|title=21 ways the SDGs can have the best impact on girls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/02/21-ways-the-sdgs-can-have-the-best-impact-on-girls|accessdate=5 August 2017|work=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has insisted on the transformational role [[Gender diversity|gender-diverse]] that boards can play in that regard, predicting that 2018 could be a pivotal year, as “more than ever before, many UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG5, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation ===

==== "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 6}}

The [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]] (SDG6) has eight targets and 11 indicators that will be used to monitor progress toward the targets. Most are to be achieved by the year 2030. One is targeted for 2020.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"/&gt; Worldwide, 6 out of 10 people lack safely managed sanitation services, and 3 out of 10 lack safely managed water services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption is critical to successful education and successful employment. Therefore, toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure. "Equitable sanitation" calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented.

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the users.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"/&gt; This will require cooperation between governments, civil society, and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko, Tan, Tay Keong, Flynn, Patricia M.|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017, two-thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for SDG indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; From those that were available, the Joint Monitoring Programme ([[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]]) found that 4.5 billion people currently do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; If we are to meet SDG targets for sanitation by 2030, nearly one-third of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation including Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) has made it its mission to achieve SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419043556/http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|archive-date=2015-04-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116185906/http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|archive-date=2017-11-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SuSanA's position is that the SDGs are highly interdependent. Therefore, the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance Knowledge Hub|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117064658/http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|archive-date=2017-11-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy ===
==== "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] and modern energy for all."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-7-affordable-and-clean-energy.html|title=Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Targets for 2030 include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and more investment in clean energy infrastructure. Plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]], [[Small Island Developing States|small islands]] and land-locked [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

As of 2017, only 57 percent of the global population relies primarily on clean fuels and technology, falling short of the 95 percent target.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth ===
==== "Promote sustained, inclusive and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic growth]], full and productive employment and [[decent work]] for all."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-8-decent-work-and-economic-growth.html|title=Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment weren’t prioritized enough. Being prioritized as number 8 and number 9 respectively was considered a rather "mediocre ranking and defies common sense''"''&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"/&gt;

For the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. Implementing the Global Jobs Pact of the [[International Labour Organization]] is also mentioned.

By 2030, the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs. Strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

=== Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure ===
==== "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster [[innovation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 9: Industry, innovation, infrastructure|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-9-industry-innovation-and-infrastructure.html|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Resilience (engineering and construction)|Urban resilience}}
Manufacturing is a major source of employment. In 2016, the least developed countries had less "manufacturing value added per capita". The figure for Europe and North America amounted to US$4,621, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg9|title=Progress of Goal 9 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturing of high products contributes 80 percent to total manufacturing output in industrialized economies but barely 10 percent in the least developed countries.

Mobile-cellular signal coverage has improved a great deal. In previously "unconnected" areas of the globe, 85 percent of people now live in covered areas. Planet-wide, 95 percent of the population is covered.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

=== Goal 10: Reducing inequalities ===
==== "Reduce income [[social inequality|inequality]] within and among countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities.html|title=Goal 10: Reduced inequalities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
One target is to reduce the cost of exporting goods from least developed countries. "Duty-free treatment" has expanded. As of 2015, 65 percent of products coming from the least developed countries were duty-free, as compared to 41 percent in 2005.

The target of 3 percent was established as the cost that international migrant workers would pay to send money home (known as [[Remittance|remittances]]). However, post offices and money transfer companies currently charge 6 percent of the amount remitted. Worse, commercial banks charge 11 percent. Prepaid cards and mobile money companies charge 2 to 4 percent, but those services were not widely available as of 2017 in typical "remittance corridors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg10|title=Progress of Goal 10 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 Nov 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goal Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities ===
==== "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-11-sustainable-cities-and-communities.html|title=Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The target for 2030 is to ensure access to safe and [[affordable housing]]. The indicator named to measure progress toward this target is the proportion of urban population living in [[Slum|slums]] or [[Shanty town|informal settlements]]. Between 2000 and 2014, the proportion fell from 39 percent to 30 percent. However, the absolute number of people living in slums went from 792 million in 2000 to an estimated 880 million in 2014. Movement from rural to urban areas has accelerated as the population has grown and better housing alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11|title=Sustainable Development Goal 11|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production ===
==== "Ensure [[sustainable consumption]] and production patterns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html|title=Goal 12: Responsible consumption, production|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Sustainable products}}
The targets of Goal 12 include using [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] production methods and reducing the amount of waste. By 2030, national [[recycling]] rates should increase, as measured in tons of material recycled. Further, companies should adopt sustainable practices and publish sustainability reports.

Target 12.1 calls for the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg12|title=Goal 12 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework, adopted by member states at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]], is a global commitment to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production in developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rio20.un.org/sites/rio20.un.org/files/a-conf.216-5_english.pdf|title=A/CONF.216/5: A 10-Year Framework of Programmes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to generate the collective impact necessary for such a shift, programs such as the [[One Planet Network]] have formed different implementation methods to help achieve Goal 12.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/platform-sustainable-development-goal-12 Retrieved October 15 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 13: Climate action ===
==== "Take urgent action to combat [[Global warming|climate change]] and its impacts by regulating [[emission of greenhouse gases|emissions]] and promoting developments in [[renewable energy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html|title=Goal 13: Climate action|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The UN discussions and negotiations identified the links between the post-2015 SDG process and the [[Financing for Development]] process that concluded in Addis Ababa in July 2015 and the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 21]] Climate Change conference in Paris in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/events/2015/december/COP21-paris-climate-conference.html|title=Paris Climate Change Conference: COP21|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in Paris in 2015 could enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Impact-of-climate-on-SDGs-technical-report-CDKN.pdf|title=The impact of climate change on the achievement of the post-2015 sustainable development goals|last2=Greño, P|date=May 2015|publisher=CDKN &amp; HR Wallingford|last3=Houlden, V|display-authors=et al.|last1=Ansuategi, A|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the SDGs are met. Further, economic development and climate change are inextricably linked, particularly around [[poverty]], [[gender equality]], and energy. The UN encourages the [[public sector]] to take initiative in this effort to minimize [[environmental impact|negative impacts on the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/no9.pdf&amp;embedded=true|title=Sustainable Development Innovation Briefs, Issue 9|last=|first=|date=March 2010|work=|access-date=12 September 2016|via=UN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial [[China–United States relations|Sino-American]] convergence that developed in 2015-2016, notably at the UN [[COP21]] summit (Paris) and ensuing [[G20]] conference (Hangzhou).&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth|title=Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth?|date=October 2016|work=Analyse Financière|first1=M. Nicolas J.|last1=Firzli|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the regions most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the Asia-Pacific region needs more [[public-private partnership]]s (PPPs) to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GCEOA Chairman Underscores the Value of Big Data for the SDGS |url=http://www.globalceoalliance.org/news-and-events/gceoa-chairman-underscores-the-value-of-big-data-for-the-sdgs/ |website=Global CEO Alliance (GCEOA) |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Press release |date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, for instance, citizens, working through a web page called finn.no, can earn money for picking up plastic on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tesdal Galtung |first1=Anders |last2=Rolfsnes |first2=May-Helen |title=Finn.no kjøper sekker med havplast |url=https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/finn.no-kjoper-sekker-med-havplast-1.13599585 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=NRK |date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, including Kenya, have [[Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags|banned the use of plastic bags]] for retail purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya plastic bag ban comes into force after years of delays |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41069853 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving the oceans contributes to [[poverty reduction]], as it gives low-income families a source of income and healthy food. Keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism, as stated in Goal 8, and reduce poverty by providing more employment.&lt;ref name="UN2016"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification, protecting marine and [[coastal ecosystem]]s, and [[fishing regulation|regulating fishing]]. The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fsustainabledevelopment%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2F14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf&amp;embedded=true&amp;chrome=false&amp;dov=1 [[chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg|link=]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 15: Life on land ===
==== "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, sustainably manage forests, combat [[desertification]], and halt and reverse [[land degradation]] and halt [[biodiversity]] loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land.html|title=Goal 15: Life on land|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
This goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest, desert, and mountain eco-systems, as a percentage of total land mass. Achieving a "land degradation-neutral world" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood. Goal 15 calls for more attention to preventing invasion of [[introduced species]] and more protection of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

The Mountain Green Cover Index monitors progress toward target 15.4, which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems. The index is named as the indicator for target 15.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/mountain-partnership/our-work/advocacy/2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development/mountain-green-cover-index/en/|title=Mountain Partnership: working together for mountain peoples and environment|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Mountain Partnership|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Red Index (Red List Index or RLI) will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg15|title=Sustainable Development Goal 12|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development UN|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal extinction is a growing problem.

=== Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions ===
==== "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide [[right to fair trial|access to justice]] for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-16-peace-justice-and-strong-institutions.html|title=Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Reducing [[violent crime]], [[sex trafficking]], [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], and [[child abuse]] are clear global goals. The International Community values [[peace]] and [[justice]] and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. By 2017, the UN could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. More women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also [[violence against women]]). In 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. Sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased.

One target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. However, reliance on the indicator of "crimes reported" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sdg16report.org/|title=SDG16 Data Initiative 2017 Global Report|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=SDG16 Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723064355/http://sdg16report.org/|archive-date=2017-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

SDG 16 also targets universal legal identity and [[Birth certificate|birth registration]], ensuring the right to a name and nationality, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. With more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals ===
==== "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for [[sustainable development]].“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-17-partnerships-for-the-goals.html|title=Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Increasing [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]] is seen as vital to achieving each of the 16 previous goals. Goal 17 is included to assure that countries and organizations cooperate instead of compete. Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships to share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial support is seen as critical to overall success of the SDGs. [[Public–private partnership|Public-private partnerships]] that involve civil societies are specifically mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg17|title=Sustainable Development Goal 17|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cross-cutting issues ==
[[File:Sustainable Development Goals (Lima, Peru) 1.jpg|thumb|240px|Young people holding SDG banners in Lima, Peru.]]

=== Women and gender equality ===
There is widespread consensus that progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized holistically – by policy makers as well as private sector executives and board members. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=6th World Pensions Forum held at the Queen’s House: ESG and Asset Ownership|url=https://amnt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/6th-World-Pensions-Forum2017.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= Revue Analyse Financière|publisher=Revue Analyse Financière|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statements from diverse sources, such as the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), [[UN Women]] and the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] have noted that investments in women and girls have positive impacts on economies. National and global development investments often exceed their initial scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/POST-2015%20Gender.pdf|title=Gender equality and women’s rights in the post-2015 agenda: A foundation for sustainable development|format=PDF|website=Oecd.org|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and sustainable development ===
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

Education for sustainable development (ESD) is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education. UNESCO promotes the [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as a complementary approach.&lt;ref&gt;Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning objectives UNESCO, 2015 &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it is important to emphasize ESD’s importance for all the other 16 SDGs. With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs. This would enable individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf|title=Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100209-0|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education, gender and technology ===
{{Main|Massive open online course}}

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free open education offered through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs was to open up quality [[Higher education|Higher Education]] to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 ("Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, MOOCs also contribute to Goal 5, in that they are gender neutral and can give women and girls improved access to education.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== SDG-driven investment ===
[[Stewardship|Capital stewardship]] is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda: 
: "No longer [[absentee landlord]]s', [[pension fund]] trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain, Benelux and America: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups [...] to shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment"&lt;ref name="Revue Analyse Financiere"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse Financiere| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using the SDG framework across all [[asset class]]es &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development. Finally, the MDGs used a  sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Whilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Competing goals ===

{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}
First, some of the SDGs might be contradictory. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] (as opposed to qualitative economic development and the goal of better distribution of the economic product) might undermine [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].

Second, the goal of achieving sustainable human population and lifestyle levels, and the scientific issues of matching ecosystems (and the Earth as a whole) to the number of human beings that they can sustainably support at a certain life-style level, seem neglected and largely unarticulated. Human population levels and reproductive rates are independent variables in trying to reach the SDGs and in aiming at an overall sustainable Earth/Human Community, they need to be scientifically recognized as such.

Third, in addition to population and lifestyle issues, three sectors need to come together in order to achieve sustainable development. These are the economic, socio-political, and environmental sectors in their broadest sense.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiid.in/2016/08/sustainable-development-goals-2016-2030-easier-stated-achieved/|title=Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030: Easier Stated Than Achieved – JIID|date=2016-08-21|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the promotion of [[multidisciplinary]] and transdisciplinary research across different sectors, which can be difficult, particularly when major governments fail to support it.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;. 

Fourth, the issues of demilitarization, disarmament, and conversion to peace-based economies also seem neglected, along with the issues of corruption, drugs, robotization of jobs, the need for global citizenship education, the lack of reliable UN and SDG financing, and the current disempowering inability of citizens to participate directly in the global-level decision-making and priority-setting process and to thereby feel the collective togetherness needed for the success of the SDG effort.

=== Too many goals ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals.

On the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals were justified because the agenda they address is all encompassing.

=== High cost of achieving the SDGs ===
''The Economist'' estimated that alleviating poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about US$2–3 trillion per year for the next 15 years which they called "pure fantasy".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Estimates for providing clean water and sanitation for the whole population of all continents have been as high as US$200 billion.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The World Bank cautions that estimates need to be made country by country, and reevaluated frequently over time.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/847191468000296045/pdf/103172-PUB-Box394556B-PUBLIC-EPI-K8632-ADD-SERIES.pdf|title=The Costs of Meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal Targets on Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene|last=Hutton|first=Guy|date=15 November 2017|website=Documents/World Bank|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses to criticisms ===
Other views are more positive. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

The Rockefeller Foundation asserts that "The key to financing and achieving the SDGs lies in mobilizing a greater share of the $200+ trillion in annual private capital investment flows toward development efforts, and philanthropy has a critical role to play in catalyzing this shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/new-role-foundations-financing-global-goals/|title=A New Role for Foundations in Financing the Global Goals|last=Madsbjerg|first=Saadia|date=19 September 2017|website=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale funders participating in a Rockefeller Foundation-hosted design thinking workshop (June 2017: Scaling Solutions) were realistic.  They concluded that while there is a moral imperative to achieve the SDGs, failure is inevitable if there aren't drastic changes to how we go about financing large scale change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sphaera.world/billions-to-trillions/|title=From Billions to Trillions: Mobilising the Missing Trillions to Solve the Sustainable Development Goals|last=Burgess|first=Cameron|date=March 2018|website=sphaera.world|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rigveda]] manuscript, [[Sanskrit]] in [[Devanagari]] script, India, early 19th century]]

'''{{IAST|Svādhyāya}}''' ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|स्वाध्याय}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] term which literally means "one's own reading" and "self-study".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html svAdhyAya], Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=self-study&amp;direction=ES&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 svAdhyAya] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a broader concept with several meanings. In various schools of [[Hinduism]], ''Svadhyaya'' is a [[Niyama]] (virtuous observance) connoting introspection and "study of self".&lt;ref&gt;Sharda Nandram (2010), Synchronizing Leadership Style with Integral Transformational Yoga Principles, In Spirituality and Business (Editors: Nandram and Borden), Springer Berlin Heidelberg, {{ISBN|978-3-642-02660-7}}, pages 183-203&lt;/ref&gt; The term also means the self-study and recitation of the [[Vedas]] and other sacred books.&lt;ref&gt;For compound derivation as {{lang|sa|स्व}} +  {{lang|sa|अध्यायः}} and meanings of ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' as "1. self-recitation, muttering to one-self. -2. study of the Vedas, sacred study, perusal of sacred books. -3. the Veda itself. -4. a day on which sacred study is enjoined to be resumed after suspension." see: {{Harvnb|Apte|1965|p=1016}}, right column.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of "स्वाध्याय, m. repeating to oneself, study ''of the Veda''; repetition ''of the Veda'' aloud" see: {{Harvnb|Macdonell|1996|p=373}}, left column.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition as "the regular habit of study of religious books", see: Chatterjee and Datta (1984), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology, meaning and usage==
Svādhyāya is a compound Sanskrit word composed of svā (स्वा) + adhyāya (अध्याय). Adhyāya means "a lesson, lecture, chapter; reading".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html AdhyAya], Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Svā means "own, one's own, self, the human soul".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html SvA], Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Svādhyāya literally means "one's own reading, lesson".

Svādhyāya is also a compound Sanskrit word composed of svā (स्वा) + dhyāya (ध्याय). Dhyāya means "meditating on".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dhyAyam&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes&amp;choice=yes dhyAyam], Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; The root of Adhyāya and Dhyāya is “Dhyai” (ध्यै) which means “meditate, contemplate, think of”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dhyai&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 ध्यै] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; The term Svādhyāya therefore, also connotes “contemplation, meditation, reflection of one self”, or simply “to study one’s own self”.&lt;ref name=rsovik&gt;Rolf Sovik (2014), Understanding Yourself: the path of Svadhyaya, Himalayan Institute Press, {{ISBN|978-0893892470}}, pages 191-197&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Svadhyaya'' has other meanings. In the ''[[Smritis]]'', it refers to the historical practice of self-reciting Vedas to ensure it is memorized and faithfully transmitted, without writing, by the word of mouth, to the next generation.&lt;ref name=arya6/&gt; In various schools of Hinduism, particularly ''[[Yoga]]'', ''Svadhyaya'' is also a ''[[niyama]]'', a virtuous behavior. As a virtue, it means "study of self", "self-reflection", "introspection, observation of self".&lt;ref&gt;C Woiwode (2013), Transcendence and Spirituality Human Needs and the Practices of the Indian Svadhyaya Movement, Journal of Developing Societies, 29(3): 233-257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KH Garland (2010), Yoga, Pradhana Dharma, and the Helping Professions: Recognizing the Risk of Codependency and the Necessity of Self-Care, International Journal of Yoga Therapy, 1(1): 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.

{{IAST|Svādhyāya}} is translated in a number of ways. Some translate it as the "study of the scriptures and ''[[Indian philosophy|darśanas]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhattacharyya|1956|pp=25–26}}, volume 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some translators simply use the word "study" without qualifying the type of study.&lt;ref&gt;For translation of YS 2.1 as ""Purificatory action, study, and making God the motive of action, constitute the ''yoga'' of action." see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For translation of YS 2.1 as "Austerity, study, and the dedication of the fruits of one's work to God: these are the preliminary steps to yoga." see: [[Prabhavananda]] and [[Christopher Isherwood|Isherwood]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; MacNeill translates it as "self-study or spiritual self-education".&lt;ref&gt;Paul MacNeill (2011), Yoga and Ethics: The Importance of Practice, in Yoga-Philosophy for Everyone (Editors: Stillwagon et al.), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-0470658802}}, Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; Dhyāya, when used in the context of self study in ancient and medieval Indian texts, is synonymous with ''Abhyasa'', ''Adhi'' and ''Viks''; while Adhyāya, when used in context of reciting and reading in Indian texts, is synonymous with ''Anukti'', ''Nipatha''&lt;ref&gt;often used to describe recitation of Vedas by a student; see BL Dwivedi (1994), Evolution of educational thought in India, {{ISBN|978-8172110598}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Patha''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html Study] Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany; see discussion notes and cited Indian texts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de Sanskrit English Dictionary] Koeln University, Germany; Search for each of: abhyAsam, adhI, vIkS, anUkti, nipaTha, paTh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Svadhyaya in ancient literature==
{{Hinduism}}

===Upanishads===
[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]’s hymn 1.9.1&lt;ref&gt;Original:&lt;br&gt;ऋतं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । सत्यं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । तपश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । दमश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । शमश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । अग्नयश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । अग्निहोत्रं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । अतिथयश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । मानुषं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । प्रजा च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । प्रजनश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । प्रजातिश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च ॥ १ ॥&lt;br&gt;For two translations: TN Raghavendra (2002), Vishnu Saharanama, {{ISBN|8190282727}}, page 763, and {{Harvnb|Zaehner|1966|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the central importance of ''Svadhyaya'' in one’s pursuit of Reality ([[Ṛta]]), Truth ([[Satya]]), Self-restraint (Damah), Perseverance ([[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]), Tranquility and Inner Peace (Samas),&lt;ref&gt;शम&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships with others, family, guests (Praja, Prajana, Manush, Atithi) and all Rituals (Agnaya, Agnihotram).&lt;ref name=tnr&gt;TN Raghavendra (2002), Vishnu Saharanama, {{ISBN|8190282727}}, page 763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For translation, see: {{Harvnb|Zaehner|1966|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taittiriya Upanishad, however, adds in verse 1.9.1, that along with the virtue of ''{{IAST|svādhyāyā}}'' process of learning, one must teach and share (''[[pravacana]]'') what one learns.&lt;ref name=tnr/&gt; This is expressed by the phrase "''{{IAST|svādhyāyapravacane ca}}''", translated as "and learning and teaching" by Gambhīrānanda&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit text of ''Taittirīya Upanishad'' 1.9.1; translation of {{lang|sa|स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च}} (''svādhyāyapravacane ca'') as "and learning and teaching (are to be practiced)"; and comment that "''Svādhyāyaḥ'' is study (of the scriptures). ''Pravacanam'' is teaching (of the scriptures)", see: {{Harvnb|Gambhīrānanda|1986|pp=40–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In verse 1.11.1, the final chapter in the education of a student, the Taittiriya Upanishad reminds,&lt;ref&gt;For context as "the teacher gives the scholar who is departing on his life's journey", and translation of opening phrases of ''Taittirīya Upanishad'' 1.11, see: {{Harvnb|Winternitz|1972|p=259, vol. 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest mention of Svādhyāya is found in [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] 2.15: "{{IAST|svādhyayo-adhyetavyah}}" ("svādhyāya must be practiced"). Śatpath Brāhmana also repeats it.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Chandogya Upanishad]] verse 4.16.1-2 recommends both silent (''mānas'') and vocal (''vāchika'') types of svādhyāya.

===Other scriptures===
Patanjali's ''Yogasutra'', in verse II.44, recommends ''Svadhyaya'' as follows

{{quote|

Study thy self, discover the divine.|Patanjali’s Yogasutra|II.44 &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (2009), ''Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231144858}}, page 209&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vishnu Smriti's verse 22.92, states that "human body is cleansed by water, the mind is cleansed by truth, the soul by self-study and meditation, while understanding is cleansed by knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Original: [https://archive.org/stream/vishnusmriti#page/n75/mode/2up Vishnu Smriti], Verse 22.92, page 68 (in Sanskrit)&lt;br&gt;Translation: [https://archive.org/stream/institutesvishn00jollgoog#page/n140/mode/2up Vishnu Smriti] Julius Jolly (Translator), Charles Scribner &amp; Sons, Chapter XXII, Verse 92, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasistha [[Dharmaśāstra|Dharmasastra]] verses 27.1 through 27.7 states that ''Svadhyaya'' helps an individual understand and overcome his past.&lt;ref name=walter&gt;W.O. Kaebler, Tapta-Marga: Asceticism and Initiation in Vedic India, State University of New York Press, pages 53-60, 112-115&lt;/ref&gt; Apastamba Dharmasutra 1.4.12.1 states ''Svadhyaya'' is a form of ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]''. This view is shared by Baudhayana Dharmasastra in verses 4.1.29 to 4.1.30, which adds that ‘‘svadhyaya is a means of getting past one’s past mistakes and any guilt”.&lt;ref name=walter2&gt;Walter O. Kaelber (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269719 Tapas and Purification in Early Hinduism], Numen, Vol. 26, Fasc. 2 (Dec., 1979), pages 192-214&lt;/ref&gt; Baudhayana Dharmasastra describes ‘‘Svadhyaya’’, in verse 2.6.11, as the path to [[Brahman]] (Highest Reality, Universal Spirit, Eternal Self).&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

{{IAST|Svādhyāya}} is mentioned as one of the virtues in ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' 16.1.&lt;ref&gt;For text of BG 16.1 and translation of ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' as "study of the scriptures", see: Chidbhavananda, p. 779.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Svadhyaya'' is mentioned a second time in ''Bhagavad Gita'' verse 17.15 as a component of the discipline of one's speech by which, states the verse, " speak words that are truthful, kind, helpful, and elevates those who hear it".&lt;ref&gt;For text of BG 17.15 and translation of ''{{IAST|svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ}}'' as "the practice of the study of scriptures" see: {{Harvnb|Gambhīrānanda|1997|pp=644–645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (2009), ''The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4384-2841-3}}, page 648&lt;/ref&gt;

==Svadhyaya as a historical practice==
;Learning one's Vedic recension
As a tool for memorization, ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' had a unique meaning for Vedic scholars as the principal tool for the [[Vedic recitation|oral preservation of the Vedas in their original form for millennia]]. When used as a formal part of scriptural study, ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' involves repeated recitations of scripture for purposes of mastering the [[mantras]] with their accurate pronunciation.&lt;ref name=arya6&gt;For traditional uses of ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' in the sense of repetition of scriptural mantras for purposes of memorization, see: {{Harvnb|Arya|1986|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedas had not been committed to writing in ancient times. Almost all printed editions depend on the late manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years, not on the still-extant and superior oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation of "... almost all printed editions depend on the late manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years, not on the still extant and superior oral tradition" is from: Witzel, M., "Vedas and {{IAST|Upaniṣads}}", in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monier Monier-Williams]] defines ''[[śruti]]'' as "sacred knowledge orally transmitted by the {{IAST|Brāhmans}} from generation to generations, the Veda".&lt;ref&gt;For definition of ''śruti'' as "sacred knowledge orally transmitted" see: {{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|1899|p=1101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael E. J. Witzel|Michael Witzel]] explains this oral tradition as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a ''tape-recording''.... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;For the quotation comparing recital to a "tape-recording" see: Witzel, M., "Vedas and {{IAST|Upaniṣads}}", in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|pp=68–69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The commentator [[Sayana|Sāyana]] discusses this term in the introduction of his commentary on the ''{{IAST|Ṛgveda}}'', in which he says that ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' enables Vedic rituals ([[Yajna|yājnika karmakānda]]) to take place.&lt;ref&gt;For text of Sāyana commentary as ''{{IAST|karma-kārana-bhūta-svādhyāya}}'' see: {{Harvnb|Sontakke|1972|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], the [[Dvaita|dualistic]] [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] philosopher, defined philosophy as the three-stage process of understanding (''{{IAST|śravaṇa}}''), reflection (''{{IAST|manana}}''), and application (''{{IAST|nididhyāsana}}''), expressing itself in two forms: study (''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'') and teaching (''{{IAST|pravacana}}'').  Of these two, Madhva considered teaching to be the highest aspect of discipline leading to [[Moksha|{{IAST|mokṣa}}]].&lt;ref&gt;For Madhva's threefold definition of philosophy and the twofold division of expression, see: Raghavendrachar, H. N., "Madhva's Brahma-Mīmāṁsā", in: Bhattacharyya (1956), volume 3, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Mādhavāchārya's views on svādhyāya are to be found in chapter 15 of Sarva-Darśana-Sangraha (cf. references).

The ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad|Taittirīya Upanishad]]'', which belongs to the ''[[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]]'', is still popular among those who learn [[Vedic chant]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;For ''{{IAST|Taittirīya Upaniṣad}}'' as part of ''Yajur Veda'', and continued popularity with students of Vedic chant, see: {{Harvnb|Gambhīrānanda|1986|p=iv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recitation of mantras ([[Japa]]) is an integral part of [[Bhakti Yoga]], and in this tradition of Hinduism, it is sometimes called ''Japa Yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Munyer (2012), ''How Yoga Won the West, in Yoga-Philosophy for Everyone: Bending Mind and Body'' (Editors: Liz Swan and Fritz Allhoff), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-0-470-65880-2}}, pages 3-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions===
There are certain days on which ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' were prohibited, these were called ''{{IAST|anadhyāya}}'', after which ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' must be resumed on the following day ; therefore the day of resumption is also called {{IAST|svādhyāya}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit English Dictionary of [[Monier-Williams]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Svadhyaya as a Niyama==
[[File:Siddhasana.svg|thumb|Yoga meditation – a means to the virtue of Svadhyaya.]]
Svādhyāya is one of the three key elements in the practice of yoga as defined in the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', appearing in the opening verse of Book two on spiritual practice and elaborated upon in two other verses.&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit text of verses 2.1, 2.32, and 2.44 and discussion as a key practice, see: {{Harvnb|Taimni|1961|pp=127–128, 220, 250}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Patanjali]] mentions {{IAST|svādhyāya}} a second time as one of the five recommended observances (''[[niyama]]s''), along with purity, contentment, austerity, and self-surrender.&lt;ref&gt;For text and translation of YS 2.32, and translation of ''niyama'' as "observances", see: {{Harvnb|Taimni|1961|p=220}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The five ''niyamas'', together with the five abstentions (''[[yamas]]''),&lt;ref&gt;For the five ''yamas'' or "restraints" as: abstention from injury (''{{IAST|ahiṁsā}}'', [[nonviolence]]), truthfulness (''satya''), non-stealing (''asteya''), control of the carnal desires and passions (''brahmacarya''), and non-acceptance of unnecessary gifts (''aparigraha''), see: Chatterjee and Datta (1984), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; have been described as "'the ten commandments' of the {{IAST|Sāṁkhya-Yoga}}."&lt;ref&gt;For quotation including ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' in the comparison to the ten commandments, see: Hiriyanna, M., "The {{IAST|Sāṁkhya}}", in: {{Harvnb|Bhattacharyya|1956|p=49}}, volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of Svadhyaya as a Niyama is perfected in many forms.&lt;ref name=rsovik/&gt; One form of Svadhyaya is [[mantra]] meditation, where certain sound constructs pregnant with meaning are recited, anchoring the mind to one thought. This practice helps draw the mind away from outward-going tendencies, silencing the crowding of thoughts, and ultimately towards inward feeling of resonance.&lt;ref name=rsovik/&gt; It can alternately be any music, sermon, chant, inspirational book that absorbs the person to a state of absorption, trance, unifying oneness.&lt;ref name=gary&gt;Gary Kraftsow, [http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/polishing-the-mirror/ Polishing the mirror], Yoga Journal, February 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Svadhyaya is practiced as a self-reflection process, where one silently meditates, in [[Asana]], on one’s own behaviors, motivations and plans. Svadhyaya is, in a sense, for one’s spirit and mind a process equivalent to watching one’s body in a non-distorting mirror.&lt;ref&gt;G Kraftsow (2002), Yoga for Transformation: Ancient Teachings and Holistic Practices for Healing Body, Mind, and Heart, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0140196290}}, pages 22-27&lt;/ref&gt; This self-study, in Yoga, is not merely contemplation of one’s own motives and behaviors, but also of one’s circumstances and the environment one is in, assessing where one is in one’s life, what is one’s life direction, if and how desirable changes may lead to a more fulfilling Self.&lt;ref name=gary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Markil, Hatha Yoga: Benefits and Principles for a More Meaningful Practice, ACSM'S Health &amp; Fitness Journal, September/October 2010, 14(5): pp 19-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Corrigan (2010), Your Quest for a Spiritual Life: Based on the Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, {{ISBN|978-1846942952}}, pages 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''thermal time hypothesis''' is a possible solution to the [[problem of time]] in classical and quantum theory as has been put forward by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Alain Connes]]. Physical time flow is modeled as a fundamental property of the theory, a macroscopic feature of thermodynamical origin.&lt;ref&gt;A. Connes, C. Rovelli, "Von Neumann Algebra Automorphisms and Time-Thermodynamics Relation in General Covariant Quantum Theories", ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' 11:2899–2918, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[Generally covariant]] theories do not have a notion of a distinguished [[physical time]] with respect to which everything evolves. However, it is not needed for the full formulation and interpretation of the theory. The dynamical laws are determined by correlations which are sufficient to make predictions. But then a mechanism is needed which explains how the familiar notion of time eventually emerges from the timeless structure to become such an important ingredient of the macroscopic world we live in as well as of our conscious experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">In [[fluid mechanics]], [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]], a '''trajectory''' traces the motion of a single point, often called a [[fluid parcel|parcel]], in the flow.

Trajectories are useful for tracking atmospheric contaminants, such as smoke plumes, and as constituents to [[Lagrangian coordinates|Lagrangian]] simulations, such as [[contour advection]] or [[semi-Lagrangian scheme]]s.

Suppose we have a time-varying flow field, &lt;math&gt;\vec v(\vec x,~t)&lt;/math&gt;. The motion of a fluid parcel, or trajectory, is given by the following system of [[ordinary differential equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \vec x}{dt} = \vec v(\vec x, ~t)
&lt;/math&gt;

While the equation looks simple, there are at least three concerns when attempting to solve it [[numerically]].  The first is the [[numerical ordinary differential equations|integration scheme]]. This is typically a [[Runge-Kutta]],&lt;ref name="Press_etal1992"&gt;{{cite book
  |title=Numerical Recipes in C: the Art of Scientific Computing

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others can be useful as well, such as a [[leapfrog integration|leapfrog]].  The second is the method of determining the velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; at a given position, &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt;, and time, ''t''. Normally, it is not known at all positions and times, therefore some method of [[interpolation]] is required.  If the velocities are gridded in space and time, then [[bilinear interpolation|bilinear]], [[trilinear interpolation|trilinear]] or higher-dimensional linear interpolation is appropriate. [[Bicubic interpolation|Bicubic]], [[Tricubic interpolation|tricubic]], etc., interpolation is used as well, but is probably not worth the extra [[overhead (computing)|computational overhead]].

Velocity fields can be determined by measurement, e.g. from [[weather balloons]], from numerical models or especially from a combination of the two, e.g. [[data assimilation|assimilation models]].

The final concern is metric corrections.  These are necessary for geophysical fluid flows on a spherical Earth.  The differential equations for tracing a two-dimensional, atmospheric trajectory in longitude-latitude coordinates are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \theta}{dt} = \frac{u}{r \cos \phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d \phi}{dt} = \frac{v}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are, respectively, the longitude and latitude in [[radian]]s, ''r'' is the [[radius of the Earth]], ''u'' is the zonal wind and ''v'' is the meridional wind.

One problem with this formulation is the polar singularity: notice how the denominator in the first equation goes to zero when the latitude is 90 degrees—plus or minus.  One means of overcoming this is to use a locally [[Cartesian coordinate]] system close to the poles.  Another is to perform the integration on a pair of [[Azimuthal equidistant projection]]s—one for the N. Hemisphere and one for the S. Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Mills2012" &gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1202.1999

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trajectories can be validated by [[balloons]] in the [[atmosphere]] and [[buoys]] in the [[ocean]].

The developers and users of these models, the decision makers using information obtained from the results of these models, and the individuals affected by decisions based on such models are all rightly concerned with whether a model and its results are "correct".&lt;ref name ="Sargent"&gt;Sargent, Robert G. [http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc11papers/016.pdf "VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF SIMULATION MODELS"]. Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; This concern is addressed through verification and validation of the simulation model.

Simulation models are approximate imitations of real-world systems and they never exactly imitate the real-world system.  Due to that, a model should be verified and validated to the degree needed for the models intended purpose or application.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

The verification and validation of simulation model starts after functional specifications have been documented and initial model development has been completed.&lt;ref name ="Carson" &gt;Carson, John, [http://informs-sim.org/wsc02papers/008.pdf "MODEL VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION"]. Proceedings of the 2002 Winter Simulation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; Verification and validation is an iterative process that takes place throughout the development of a model.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;

== Verification ==
In the context of computer simulation, '''verification''' of a model is the process of confirming that it is correctly implemented with respect to the conceptual model (it matches specifications and assumptions deemed acceptable for the given purpose of application).&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;
During verification the model is tested to find and fix errors in the implementation of the model.&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;
Various processes and techniques are used to assure the model matches specifications and assumptions with respect to the model concept. 
The objective of model verification is to ensure that the implementation of the model is correct.

There are many techniques that can be utilized to verify a model.
Including, but not limited to, have the model checked by an expert, making logic flow diagrams that include each logically possible action, examining the model output for reasonableness under a variety of settings of the input parameters, and using an interactive debugger.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;
Many software engineering techniques used for [[software verification]] are applicable to simulation model verification.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;

== Validation ==
Validation checks the accuracy of the model's representation of the real system.  Model validation is defined to mean "substantiation that a computerized model within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model".&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; A model should be built for a specific purpose or set of objectives and its validity determined for that purpose.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

There are many approaches that can be used to validate a computer model.  The approaches range from subjective reviews to objective statistical tests.  One approach that is commonly used is to have the model builders determine validity of the model through a series of tests.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

Naylor and Finger [1967] formulated a three-step approach to model validation that has been widely followed:&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;

Step 1. Build a model that has high face validity.

Step 2. Validate model assumptions.

Step 3. Compare the model input-output transformations to corresponding input-output transformations for the real system.&lt;ref&gt;NAYLOR, T. H., AND J. M. FINGER [1967], [http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/14/2/B-92 "Verification of Computer Simulation Models"], Management Science, Vol. 2, pp. B92– B101., cited in Banks, Jerry; Carson, John S.; Nelson, Barry L.; Nicol, David M. ''Discrete-Event System Simulation'' Fifth Edition, Upper Saddle River, Pearson Education, Inc. 2010 p. 396. {{ISBN|0136062121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face validity ===
A model that has '''face validity''' appears to be a reasonable imitation of a real-world system to people who are knowledgeable of the real world system.&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt; Face validity is tested by having users and people knowledgeable with the system examine model output for reasonableness and in the process identify deficiencies.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; An added advantage of having the users involved in validation is that the model's credibility to the users and the user's confidence in the model increases.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt; Sensitivity to model inputs can also be used to judge face validity.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if a simulation of a fast food restaurant drive through was run twice with customer arrival rates of 20 per hour and 40 per hour then model outputs such as average wait time or maximum number of customers waiting would be expected to increase with the arrival rate.

=== Validation of model assumptions ===
Assumptions made about a model generally fall into two categories: structural assumptions about how system works and data assumptions.

==== Structural assumptions ====
Assumptions made about how the system operates and how it is physically arranged are structural assumptions.  For example, the number of servers in a fast food drive through lane and if there is more than one how are they utilized?  Do the servers work in parallel where a customer completes a transaction by visiting a single server or does one server take orders and handle payment while the other prepares and serves the order.  Many structural problems in the model come from poor or incorrect assumptions.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  If possible the workings of the actual system should be closely observed to understand how it operates.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  The systems structure and operation should also be verified with users of the actual system.&lt;ref name="Banks" /&gt;

==== Data assumptions ====
There must be a sufficient amount of appropriate data available to build a conceptual model and validate a model.  Lack of appropriate data is often the reason attempts to validate a model fail.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;  Data should be verified to come from a reliable source.  A typical error is assuming an inappropriate statistical distribution for the data.&lt;ref name="Banks" /&gt;  The assumed statistical model should be tested using goodness of fit tests and other techniques.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; Examples of goodness of fit tests are the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] and the [[chi-square test]].  Any outliers in the data should be checked.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

=== Validating input-output transformations ===
The model is viewed as an input-output transformation for these tests.  The validation test consists of comparing outputs from the system under consideration to model outputs for the same set of input conditions.  Data recorded while observing the system must be available in order to perform this test.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The model output that is of primary interest should be used as the measure of performance.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if system under consideration is a fast food drive through where input to model is customer arrival time and the output measure of performance is average customer time in line, then the actual arrival time and time spent in line for customers at the drive through would be recorded.  The model would be run with the actual arrival times and the model average time in line would be compared with the actual average time spent in line using one or more tests.

==== Hypothesis testing ====
[[Statistical hypothesis testing]] using the [[Student's t-test|t-test]] can be used as a basis to accept the model as valid or reject it as invalid.

The hypothesis to be tested is
:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the model measure of performance = the system measure of performance
versus
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the model measure of performance ≠ the system measure of performance.

The test is conducted for a given sample size and level of significance or α.  To perform the test a number ''n'' statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and an average or expected value, E(Y), for the variable of interest is produced.  Then the test statistic, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is computed for the given α, ''n'', E(Y) and the observed value for the system  μ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;t_0 = {(E(Y)-u_0)}/{(S/\sqrt{n})}&lt;/math&gt; and the critical value for α and n-1 the degrees of freedom

: &lt;math&gt;t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated.

If 
: &lt;math&gt; \left\vert t_0 \right\vert &gt; t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the model needs adjustment.

There are two types of error that can occur using hypothesis testing, rejecting a valid model called type I error or "model builders risk" and accepting an invalid model called Type II error, β, or "model user's risk".&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The level of significance or α is equal the probability of type I error.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; If α is small then rejecting the null hypothesis is a strong conclusion.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if α = 0.05 and the null hypothesis is rejected there is only a 0.05 probability of rejecting a model that is valid.  Decreasing the probability of a type II error is very important.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The probability of correctly detecting an invalid model is 1 - β.  The probability of a type II error is dependent of the sample size and the actual difference between the sample value and the observed value.  Increasing the sample size decreases the risk of a type II error.

===== Model accuracy as a range =====
A statistical technique where the amount of model accuracy is specified as a range has recently been developed.  The technique uses hypothesis testing to accept a model if the difference between a model's variable of interest and a system's variable of interest is within a specified range of accuracy.&lt;ref name="Sargent2"&gt;Sargent, R. G. 2010. "A New Statistical Procedure for Validation of Simulation and Stochastic Models." Technical Report SYR-EECS-2010-06, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement is that both the system data and model data be approximately [[Normal distribution|Normally]] [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|Independent and Identically Distributed (NIID)]].  The [[Student's t-test|t-test]] statistic is used in this technique.  If the mean of the model is μ&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and the mean of system is μ&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; then the difference between the model and the system is D = μ&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; - μ&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.  The hypothesis to be tested is if D is within the acceptable range of accuracy. Let L = the lower limit for accuracy and U = upper limit for accuracy.  Then

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; L ≤ D ≤ U
versus
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; D &lt; L or D &gt; U

is to be tested.

The operating characteristic (OC) curve is the probability that the null hypothesis is accepted when it is true.  The OC curve characterizes the probabilities of both type I and II errors.  Risk curves for model builder's risk and model user's can be developed from the OC curves.  Comparing curves with fixed sample size tradeoffs between model builder's risk and model user's risk can be seen easily in the risk curves.&lt;ref name="Sargent2" /&gt; If model builder's risk, model user's risk, and the upper and lower limits for the range of accuracy are all specified then the sample size needed can be calculated.&lt;ref name="Sargent2" /&gt;

==== Confidence intervals ====
Confidence intervals can be used to evaluate if a model is "close enough"&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; to a system for some variable of interest.  The difference between the known model value, μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the system value, μ, is checked to see if it is less than a value small enough that the model is valid with respect that variable of interest.  The value is denoted by the symbol ε.  To perform the test a number, ''n'', statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and a mean or expected value, E(Y) or μ for simulation output variable of interest Y, with a standard deviation ''S'' is produced.  A confidence level is selected, 100(1-α).  An interval, [a,b], is constructed by

: &lt;math&gt;a = E(Y) - t_{a/2,n-1}S/\sqrt{n} \qquad and \qquad b = E(Y) + t_{a/2,n-1}S/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;,
where 
: &lt;math&gt;t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
is the critical value from the t-distribution for the given level of significance and n-1 degrees of freedom.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε then the model needs to be calibrated since in both cases the difference is larger than acceptable.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε then the model is acceptable as in both cases the error is close enough.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε or [[vice versa]] then additional runs of the model are needed to shrink the interval.

==== Graphical comparisons ====
If statistical assumptions cannot be satisfied or there is insufficient data for the system a graphical comparisons of model outputs to system outputs can be used to make a subjective decisions, however other objective tests are preferable.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines wisdom as "Capacity of judging rightly in matters relating to life and conduct; soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends; sometimes, less strictly, sound sense, esp. in practical affairs: opp. to folly;" also "Knowledge (esp. of a high or abstruse kind); enlightenment, learning, erudition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=wisdom, n|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/229491 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press|subscription=yes|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Haddon Spurgeon]] defined wisdom as "the right use of [[knowledge]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiquote:Charles Spurgeon#Quotes]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert I. Sutton]] and [[Andrew Hargadon]] defined the "attitude of wisdom" as "acting with knowledge while doubting what one knows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Carney|first1= Brian M.|last2= Getz|first2= Isaac|title= Freedom, Inc.|date= 2009 |publisher= Crown Business|isbn= 9780307462473|page= 238 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J3nVgNxrvlwC&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate= 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the psychological literature however the construct of wisdom does not have a commonly accepted definition.&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt;

== Philosophical perspectives ==
The [[ancient Greeks]] considered wisdom to be an important [[virtue]], [[personified]] as the [[goddess]]es [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] and [[Athena]]. Athena is said to have sprung from the head of Zeus. She was portrayed as strong, fair, merciful, and chaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turnbill|first=S|date=12 August 2011|title=Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and craftsmanship|url=http://www.goddessgift.com/goddess-myths/greek_goddess_athena.htm|publisher=Goddessgift.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], [[philosophy]] was literally the love of Wisdom ([[-phil-|philo]]-[[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]). This permeates Plato's [[dialogues]], especially ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', in which the leaders of his proposed [[utopia]] are to be [[philosopher king]]s, rulers who understand the [[Form of the Good]] and possess the courage to act accordingly. [[Aristotle]], in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', defined wisdom as the understanding of [[Causality|causes]], i.e. knowing why things are a certain way, which is deeper than merely knowing that things are a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;But note that two thousand years after Aristotle, Isaac Newton was forced to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|admit that]] "I have not yet been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity"&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was Aristotle who first made a distinction between ''phronesis'' and ''sophia'' aspects of wisdom.&lt;ref name="Trowbridge2011"/&gt;

The [[ancient Romans]] also valued wisdom. It was personified in [[Minerva]], or Pallas. She also represents skillful knowledge and the virtues, especially chastity. Her symbol was the owl which is still a popular representation of wisdom, because it can see in darkness. She was said to be born from Jupiter's forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths about Roman goddess minerva. (n.d.)|url=http://www.roman-colosseum.info/roman-gods/myths-about-the-roman-goddess-minerva.htm|publisher=Roman-colosseum.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom is also important within [[Christianity]]. [[Jesus]] emphasized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/matthew/11-19.htm|title=Matthew 11:19 (KJV): "The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children|publisher=Bible.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/matthew/10-16.htm|title=Matthew 10:16 (KJV): "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves|publisher=Bible.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]], in his [[first epistle to the Corinthians]], argued that there is both secular and divine wisdom, urging Christians to pursue the latter. [[Prudence]], which is intimately related to wisdom, became one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] of [[Catholicism]]. The Christian philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] considered wisdom to be the "father" (i.e. the cause, measure, and form) of all virtues.

In Buddhist traditions, developing wisdom plays a central role where comprehensive guidance on how to develop wisdom is provided.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title= The Noble Eightfold Path|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Inuit]] tradition, developing wisdom was one of the aims of teaching. An Inuit [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]] said that a person became wise when they could see what needed to be done and do it successfully without being told what to do. In many cultures, the name for third molars, which are the last teeth to grow, is etymologically linked with wisdom, e.g., as in the English ''[[wisdom tooth]]''.

== Educational perspectives ==
[[File:Jacob de Wit - Allegorie op het schrijven van de geschiedenis 1754.jpg|thumb|''Truth and Wisdom assist History in writing'' by [[Jacob de Wit]], 1754]]

Public schools [[Education in the United States|in the US]] have an approach to character education. Eighteenth century philosophers such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], referred to this as training wisdom and virtue. Traditionally, schools share the responsibility to build character and wisdom along with parents and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ed.gov|date=31 May 2005|title=Character education: our shared responsibility|url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/character/brochure.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Maxwell]], a contemporary philosopher in the United Kingdom, advocates that [[academia]] ought to alter its focus from the acquisition of knowledge to seeking and promoting wisdom, &lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (2007) [http://www.pentirepress.plus.com/#wisdom From Knowledge to Wisdom]. Pentire Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defines as the capacity to realize what is of value in life, for oneself and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/friends-of-wisdom], Friends of Wisdom "an association of people sympathetic to the idea that academic inquiry should help humanity acquire more wisdom by rational means" founded by Maxwell.&lt;/ref&gt; He teaches that new knowledge and technological [[know-how]] increase our power to act which, without wisdom, may cause human suffering and death as well as human benefit. Wisdom is the application of knowledge to attain a positive goal by receiving instruction in governing oneself&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2011. The wise stance in human geography.

== Psychological perspectives ==
Psychologists have gathered data on commonly held beliefs or folk theories about wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1985). Implicit theories of intelligence, creativity, and wisdom. Journal of Personality and Social [[Psychology]], 49, 607–62.&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses indicate that although "there is an overlap of the implicit theory of wisdom with intelligence, perceptiveness, spirituality and shrewdness, it is evident that wisdom is an expertise in dealing with difficult questions of life and adaptation to the complex requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = S.

It is achieved when in a concrete situation, a balance between intrapersonal, inter- personal and institutional interests can be prepared".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2937249 | pmid=20233730 | doi=10.1093/geront/gnq022 | volume=50 | title=Expert consensus on characteristics of wisdom: a Delphi method study | date=October 2010 | journal=Gerontologist | pages=668–80 | last1 = Jeste | first1 = DV | last2 = Ardelt | first2 = M | last3 = Blazer | first3 = D | last4 = Kraemer | first4 = HC | last5 = Vaillant | first5 = G | last6 = Meeks | first6 = TW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Problem Solving with [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and sustainable actions.
* Contextual, [[sincerity]] to the circumstances with knowledge of its negative and positive aspects (or constraints).
* Value based consistent actions with knowledge of diversity in ethical [[opinion]]s.
* Tolerance towards uncertainty in life with unconditional acceptance.
* Empathy with oneself to understand one's own emotions (or to be emotionally oriented), morals...etc. and others feelings including the ability to see oneself as part of a larger whole.

Wisdom leads a person to overcome feelings of helplessness, powerlessness, anger or aggression by non-understanding of external elements and internal acknowledgement. It leads to a change from the experience of meaninglessness to meaningful goals, prospects for coping with critical life events and to engage constructively with complex life problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferrari|first=Michel|title=The Scientific Study of Personal Wisdom |year=2012 |publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=978-9048192304}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Vervaeke has argued through ''cognitive science of wisdom'' that, when basic [[relevance realization]] processes that underlie cognition is fed back onto themselves and made self-referential/differentiated reflection with the problems facing and its dimensions, leads to enhanced insight abilities associated with wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vervaeke|first=John|title=The Cognitive Science of Wisdom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti4Kj8TcEgk|publisher=Mind Matters Conference|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sternberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|authorlink=Robert Sternberg|title=Wisdom, Intelligence, and Creativity Synthesized|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2003|location=New York|isbn=0-521-80238-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has segregated the capacity for judgement from the general qualifiers for intelligence, which is closer to cognizant aptitude than to wisdom. Displaying sound judgement in a complex, dynamic environment is a hallmark of wisdom.

&lt;!--A graduate in psychology with field experience might understand this. But I suggest the following valuable "Dr. B. Legesse" paragraph of excessive abstraction be re-written.--&gt;
Dr. B. Legesse et al., a neuropsychiatrist at [[McLean Hospital]]/[[Harvard Medical School]], offers "a theoretical definition that takes into account many cultural, religious, and philosophical themes is that wisdom represents a demonstrated superior ability to understand the nature and behavior of things, people, or events." He states "this results in an increased ability to predict behavior or events which then may be used to benefit self or others." He furthermore adds "there is more often a desire to share the accrued benefits with a larger group for the purpose of promoting survival, cohesion, or well-being of that group. The benefits do not result from malicious or antisocial intents or inequitable behavior. Environmental factors, such as family, education, socioeconomic status, culture, and religion, are involved in generating the milieu in which the personal value system develops. Many of these same factors also influence how a given community decides whether wisdom is present or not. This model of wisdom relies on the individual's ability to generate a mental representation of the self (cognitive, emotional, and physical), the external world, and the dynamic relationship of the self with the external world." Dr. Legesse proposes that "the neural (brain) systems critical to enable these functions are distributed but heavily dependent on those that support [[memory]], learning, understanding other people's mental states ([[Theory of Mind]]), and assigning relative value to information." The neuroanatomy of wisdom he says depends on "the three frontosubcortical neural networks, the [[limbic]] system, and the [[mirror neuron]] system" which "are of particular importance for supporting these activities."&lt;ref&gt;Legesse B, Price BH., Murray ED Brain-Behavior Relations.

Vilanayur S Ramachandran MD PhD(ed) Academic Press. 16 March 2012. {{ISBN|978-0123750006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the need to distinguish two very different “levels of analyses” has been proposed as being important especially when one attempts to describe wisdom using neural anatomy.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE open|volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sapience ==
{{redirect-distinguish|Sapience|Sentience}}
{{see|artificial intelligence|sentience|self-awareness|consciousness}}

Sapience is closely related to the term "''sophia''" often defined as "transcendent wisdom", "ultimate reality", or the ultimate truth of things.&lt;ref name="Trowbridge2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggregates "/&gt; Sapiential perspective of wisdom is said to lie in the heart of every religion, where it is often acquired through intuitive knowing.&lt;ref name="Trowbridge2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt; This type of wisdom is described as going beyond mere practical wisdom and includes self-knowledge, interconnectedness, conditioned origination of mind-states and other deeper understandings of subjective experience.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trowbridge2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt; This type of wisdom can also lead to the ability of an individual to act with appropriate [[Value judgement|judgement]], a broad understanding of situations and greater appreciation/compassion towards other living beings.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

The word ''sapience'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''sapientia'', meaning "wisdom".&lt;ref name="LewisShortLatinDictionary"&gt;{{cite book|title=Latin Dictionary|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1963|isbn=978-0-19-864201-5|author1=Lewis, C.T.  |author2=Short, C. |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The corresponding verb ''sapere'' has the original meaning of "to taste", hence "to perceive, to discern" and "to know"; its present participle ''sapiens'' was chosen by [[Carl Linnaeus]] for the [[Latin binomial]] for the human species, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.

=== Ancient Near East ===
In [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian religion and mythology]], [[Enki]], also known as Ea, was the God of wisdom and intelligence. Wisdom was achieved by restoring balance.

[[Sia (god)|Sia]] represents the personification or god of wisdom in the traditional mythology adhered to in [[Ancient Egypt]].

=== Hebrew Bible and Judaism ===
{{See also|Chokhmah|Wisdom literature}}
The word wisdom (חכם) is mentioned 222 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. It was regarded as one of the highest virtues among the Israelites along with kindness (חסד) and justice (צדק). Both the books of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] and [[Psalms]] urge readers to obtain and to increase in wisdom.

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], wisdom is represented by [[Solomon]], who asks God for wisdom in {{bibleref2|2 Chronicles|1:10}}. Much of the [[Book of Proverbs]], a book of [[Proverb|wise sayings]], is attributed to Solomon. In {{bibleref2|Proverbs|9:10}}, the fear of [[YHWH]] is called the beginning of wisdom. In {{bibleref2|Proverbs|1:20}}, there is also reference to wisdom personified in female form, "Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the marketplaces." In {{bibleref2|Proverbs|8:22–31}}, this personified wisdom is described as being present with God before creation began and even taking part in creation itself.

The [[Talmud]] teaches that a wise person is a person who can foresee the future. ''Nolad'' is the Hebrew word for "future," but also the Hebrew word for ''birth'', so one rabbinic interpretation of the teaching is that a wise person is one who can foresee the consequences of his/her choices (i.e. can "see the future" that he/she "gives birth" to).&lt;ref&gt;[[David Wolpe|Wolpe, David]], perf.

{{Further information|Sophiology|Sophia (wisdom)}}
In [[Christian theology]], "wisdom" (From [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''[[חכמה]]'' transliteration: chokmâh pronounced: khok-maw', [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Sophia'', [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Sapientia'') describes an aspect of God, or the [[Theology|theological]] concept regarding the wisdom of [[God]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

There is an oppositional element in Christian thought between [[secular]] wisdom and Godly wisdom. [[Paul the Apostle]] states that worldly wisdom thinks the claims of [[Christ]] to be foolishness. However, to those who are "on the path to salvation" Christ represents the wisdom of God. ({{bibleref|1|Corinthians|1:17–31}}) Also, Wisdom is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] according to Anglican, Catholic, and Lutheran belief. {{bibleref|1|Corinthians|12:8–10}} gives an alternate list of nine virtues, among which wisdom is one.

The book of Proverbs in the Old Testament of the Bible primarily focuses on wisdom, and was primarily written by one of the wisest kings according to Jewish history, King Solomon. Proverbs is found in the Old Testament section of the Bible and is written in a sort of poetic way, giving direction on how to handle various aspects of life; one's relationship with God, marriage, dealing with finances, work, friendships and persevering in difficult situations faced in life. Also the nature of Wisdom as being female.

And through God's wise aide, one can have a better life: "He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless, for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones" Proverbs 2:7-8. "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight" Proverbs 3:5-6. Solomon basically states that with the wisdom one receives from God, one will be able to find success and happiness in life.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bible.org/seriespage/7-god-and-man-proverbs|title=7. God and Man in Proverbs|newspaper=Bible.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various verses in Proverbs that contain parallels of what God loves, which is wise, and what God does not love, which is foolish. For example in the area of good and bad behaviour Proverbs states, "The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, But He loves him who pursues righteousness (Proverbs 15:9). In relation to fairness and business it is stated that, "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord, But a just weight is His delight" (Proverbs 11:1; cf. 20:10,23). On the truth it is said, "Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, But those who deal faithfully are His delight" (12:22; cf. 6:17,19). These are a few examples of what, according to Solomon, are good and wise in the eyes of God, or bad and foolish, and in doing these good and wise things, one becomes closer to God by living in an honorable and kind manner.

&lt;ref name="christianity.about.com"/&gt; King Solomon continues his teachings of wisdom in the book of Ecclesiastes, which is considered one of the most depressing books of the Bible. Solomon discusses his exploration of the meaning of life and fulfillment, as he speaks of life's pleasures, work, and materialism, yet concludes that it is all meaningless. "‘Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher [Solomon]. ‘Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless’…For with much wisdom comes much sorrow, the more knowledge, the more grief" (Ecclesiastes 1:2,18) Solomon concludes that all life's pleasures and riches, and even wisdom, mean nothing if there is no relationship with God.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insight.org/resources/bible/the-general-epistles/james|title=Book of James Overview - Insight for Living Ministries|website=www.insight.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book of James, written by the apostle James, is said to be the New Testament version of the book of Proverbs, in that it is another book that discusses wisdom. It reiterates Proverbs message of wisdom coming from God by stating, "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you." James 1:5. James also explains how wisdom helps one acquire other forms of virtue, "But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere." James 3:17. In addition, James focuses on using this God-given wisdom to perform acts of service to the less fortunate.

Apart from Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and James, other main books of wisdom in the Bible are Job, Psalms, and 1 and 2 Corinthians, which give lessons on gaining and using wisdom through difficult situations.

=== Indian religions ===
{{see|Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā (Hinduism)|Prajnaparamita}}
Developing wisdom is of central importance in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions, where the ultimate aim is often presented as “seeing things as they are” or as gaining a “penetrative understanding of all phenomena,” which in turn is described as ultimately leading to the “complete freedom from suffering.”&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"/&gt; In Buddhism, developing wisdom is accomplished through an understanding of what are known as the Four Noble Truths and by following the Noble Eightfold Path.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"/&gt; This path lists [[mindfulness]] as one of eight required components for cultivating wisdom.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

Buddhist scriptures teach that a wise person is usually endowed with good and maybe bodily conduct, and sometimes good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct.(''[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3:2'') A wise person does actions that are unpleasant to do but give good results, and doesn’t do actions that are pleasant to do but give bad results (''AN 4:115''). Wisdom is the [[antidote]] to the self-chosen [[poison]] of [[ignorance]]. The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] has much to say on the subject of wisdom including:
* He who arbitrates a case by force does not thereby become just (established in [[Dhamma]]). But the wise man is he who carefully discriminates between right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dhammapada]]'' v. 256&lt;/ref&gt;
* He who leads others by nonviolence, righteously and equitably, is indeed a guardian of justice, wise and righteous.&lt;ref&gt;''Dhammapada'' v. 257&lt;/ref&gt;
* One is not wise merely because he talks much. But he who is calm, free from hatred and fear, is verily called a wise man.&lt;ref&gt;''Dhammapada'' v. 258&lt;/ref&gt;
* By quietude alone one does not become a [[Wise old man|sage]] (muni) if he is foolish and ignorant. But he who, as if holding a pair of scales, takes the good and shuns the evil, is a wise man; he is indeed a muni by that very reason. He who understands both good and evil as they really are, is called a true sage.&lt;ref&gt;''Dhammapada'' v. 268–9&lt;/ref&gt;
To recover the original supreme wisdom of self-nature covered by the self-imposed three dusty poisons (greed, anger, ignorance) Buddha taught to his students the threefold training by turning greed into generosity and discipline, anger into kindness and meditation, ignorance into wisdom. As the Sixth Patriarch of Chán Buddhism, Huineng, said in his Platform Sutra,"Mind without dispute is self-nature discipline, mind without disturbance is self-nature meditation, mind without ignorance is self-nature wisdom."

In [[Hinduism]], wisdom is considered a state of mind and soul where a person achieves [[Moksha|liberation]].

The god of wisdom is [[Ganesha]] and the goddess of knowledge is [[Saraswati]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Wisdom in Hinduism is knowing oneself as the truth, basis for the entire Creation, i.e., of ''Shristi''.{{clarify|date=March 2014}} In other words, wisdom simply means a person with [[Self-awareness]] as the one who witnesses the entire creation in all its facets and forms. Further it means realization that an individual through right conduct and right living over an unspecified period comes to realize their true relationship with the creation and the ''[[Paramatma]]'' who rules it.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

"[[God in Islam|He]] gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good. And none will remember except those of understanding." ({{cite quran|2|269|s=ns}}).
and [[Sura 22]]:46: "Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel and ears wherewith to hear? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind."{{cite quran|22|46|s=ns}}
[[Sura 6]]: 151: "Say: "Come, I will rehearse what Allah (God) hath (really) prohibited you from": Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;― We provide sustenance for you and for them;― come not nigh to shameful deeds, whether open or secret; take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom" ({{cite quran|6|151|s=ns}}).

=== Chinese religion ===
{{refimprove section|small=y|date=March 2016}}
The Buddhist term ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]]'' was translated [[Chinese Buddhism|into Chinese]] as
{{lang|zh|智慧}} (pinyin ''zhìhuì'', characters [[:wikt:智|智]] "knowledge" and [[:wikt:慧|慧]] "bright, intelligent")&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', [[Confucius]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Love of learning is akin to wisdom. To practice with vigor is akin to humanity. To know to be shameful is akin to courage (zhi, ren, yong.. three of [[Mencius|Mengzi]]'s sprouts of virtue)."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare this with the Confucian classic ''[[Great Learning]]'', which begins with: "The Way of learning to be great consists in manifesting the clear character, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good." One can clearly see the correlation with the Roman virtue [[prudence]], especially if one interprets "clear character" as "clear conscience". (From [[Chinese Chán|Chan's Sources]] of [[Chinese Philosophy]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In [[Taoism]], wisdom is construed as adherence to the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)]]: charity, simplicity, and humility.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
"He who knows other men is discerning [智]; he who knows himself is intelligent [明]." ({{lang|zh|知人者智，自知者明。}}[[Tao Te Ching]] 33)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing Chinese Text Project], trans. James Legge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
In [[Norse mythology]], the god [[Odin]] is especially known for his wisdom, often acquired through various hardships and ordeals involving pain and self-sacrifice. In one instance he plucked out an eye and offered it to [[Mímir]], guardian of the well of knowledge and wisdom, in return for a drink from the well.&lt;ref name=Faulkes&gt;Faulkes, Anthony (transl. and ed.) (1987). ''[[Prose Edda|Edda]]'' ([[Snorri Sturluson]]). [[Everyman's Library|Everyman]]. {{ISBN|0-460-87616-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In another famous account, Odin hanged himself for nine nights from [[Yggdrasil]], the [[World Tree]] that unites all the [[Norse cosmology|realms of existence]], suffering from hunger and thirst and finally wounding himself with a spear until he gained the knowledge of [[runic alphabet|runes]] for use in casting powerful [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, Carolyne (transl. and ed.) (1996). ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. [[Oxford World's Classics]]. {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to acquire the [[mead of poetry]] from the [[Jötunn|giants]], a drink of which could grant the power of a scholar or [[skald|poet]], for the benefit of [[Æsir|gods]] and mortals alike.&lt;ref name=Faulkes/&gt;

In [[Bahá'í]] scripture, 
"The essence of wisdom is the fear of God, the dread of His scourge and punishment, and the apprehension of His justice and decree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahai Reference Library|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-11.html|work=Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas|publisher=US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1988 pocket-size edition|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisdom is seen as a light, that casts away darkness, and "its dictates must be observed under all circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=ʻAbduʹl-Bahá ; translated by Edward G.|title=A traveler's narrative.|year=1980|publisher=Bahá'i Publ.

'''Wish fulfillment''' is the satisfaction of a desire through an involuntary thought process. Wish fulfillment can occur in dreams or in daydreams, in the symptoms of [[neurosis]], or in the [[hallucinations]] of [[psychosis]]. This satisfaction is often indirect and requires [[Dream interpretation|interpretation]] to recognize.

[[Sigmund Freud]] coined the term ({{lang|de|Wunscherfüllung}}) in 1900 in an early text titled ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. {{Wikisourcehas|Freud's original book about wish fulfillment|[[wikisource:The Interpretation of Dreams|The Interpretation of Dreams]]}} According to Freud, wish fulfillment occurs when [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] desires are repressed by the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[superego]]. This repression often stems from guilt and [[taboo]]s imposed by [[society]]. Dreams are attempts by the unconscious to resolve some repressed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sigmund |first1=Freud |authorlink1=Sigmund Freud |title=Die Traumdeutung |trans-title=The Interpretation of Dreams |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams |origyear=1899 |publisher=Franz Deuticke |location=Leipzig, Vienna |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yves Peintures''''' (Eng: ''Yves Paintings'') is an [[artist's book]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]], originally published in [[Madrid]], 18 November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Stich, p42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_us.html According to the Klein Archive, the book was published May 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This publication was Klein’s first public gesture as an artist, featuring pages of 'commercially printed papers &lt;ref name="tate"&gt;Tate Liverpool, text taken from the 'Reinventing Colour' exhibition, May-Sept, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;' that were seemingly reproductions of paintings that, in fact, didn't exist. Using a practice started by [[Marcel Duchamp]], this use of [[readymade]] objects to represent nothing but themselves has been referred to as an early example of [[Postmodernism]],&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, T. Yves Klein: Messenger of the Age of Space. Artforum 20, no.5. January 1982. pp. 38-51&lt;/ref&gt; using a series of carefully executed strategies to undermine its own authority, and as a precursor to [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein By Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt; 'The simplicity of his [[Found object|readymade]]s is at once sublime and mischievous.' &lt;ref name="tate"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The booklet asserts its character straightaway in the preface: a wordless text of unbroken horizontal lines with the same two paragraph indentations on each page.... a homogenous continuum with no real beginning, middle, or end, and no content - at least insofar as there are no descriptions, analyses, or personalized utterances. The colour plates are similarly presented as anonymous entities, each a flat spatial field of an uninflected hue: turquoise, brown, purple, green, pink, gray, yellow, ultramarine, mint, orange, or red.  Here, too, there is no attempt to represent or symbolize anything....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The booklet thus offers an utterly pared down presentation. Unlike most art books, it provides no reverential prose about the artist or the art, and no embellishing descriptions meant to convey meaning or context. Instead the booklet itself is made into a work of art that shares the same spirit of nothingness exemplified by the monochrome paintings that it features." Sidra Stich &lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p43&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The origins of the Monochrome==

===Zen Philosophy and Kōdōkan Judo===
[[Image:YvesPeinturesNice.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Yves Peintures'', showing 'Nice, 1951']]
Klein had painted his first monochromes - paintings consisting of a single colour - whilst working in a framing shop in London in late 1949 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_us.html Yves Klein Archives, Biography&lt;/ref&gt; which he exhibited in his room privately, inviting only friends. Initially influenced by his readings of [[Max Heindel|Max Heindel's]] ''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity'', which taught that 'space equals spirit and life, that matter is inert form, [and] that sponges and water symbolize the saturation of matter with spirit,&lt;ref name="Berggruen"&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Cantz, p216&lt;/ref&gt; he later rejected these teachings for a more rigorous study of the philosophy behind [[Judo]], which involved long periods of meditation with his friends [[Arman]] and Claude Pascal.

His second private exhibition of monochromes took place whilst Klein was in [[Tokyo]], late 1953, around the same time as he earned a diploma from the [[Kodokan|Kōdōkan Institute]], as a fourth degree [[Dan (rank)|Dan]], achieving the highest level possible for a European.&lt;ref name="Berggruen" /&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The philosophy of [[Zen]], which is essentially prevalent in Kōdōkan judo, being primarily concerned with an increased sensitivity for the present and an extended concept of space and time, [meant] a new form of spirituality for Klein, and [had] a direct effect upon his artistic activities.' &lt;ref name="Berggruen" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Upon his return to Paris in February 1954, he was deeply upset to discover that his diploma would not be officially recognised by the French Federation of Judo, meaning he could not officially teach or effectively participate in French Judo activities.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p39&lt;/ref&gt; He responded by publishing a book, ''Les Fondements du Judo'', (see [http://www.theeverydaypress.net/]), studying six Katas formulated by [[Kanō Jigorō]] in the 19th century, in an attempt to establish a reputation in France by circumventing the federation. Unable to teach in France, he took a post in [[Madrid]] in May. It was whilst he was in Spain that he formulated and published his first public gesture as an artist: ''Yves Peintures''.

===The Book Itself===
''Yves Peintures'' is a small booklet, 24.4&amp;nbsp;cm by 19.7&amp;nbsp;cm, containing 16 sheets of unbound paper, each printed on one side only and 10 containing tipped-in sheets of coloured paper. Starting with a preface of 3 pages consisting entirely of horizontal black lines designed to parody a traditional introduction credited to ‘Pascal Claude’, (Claude Pascal, a close friend of Klein’s), the introduction was actually designed by Klein himself, persuading Pascal to sign it to ‘certify the production’.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p42&lt;/ref&gt;
10 vivid monochromatic plates follow, mechanically signed ‘Yves’, each given unspecified numerical dimensions and assigned a large city.

If, as is usual in exhibition catalogues, the dimensions refer to centimetres, the plates would represent medium-sized easel paintings; if metres, large [[frescoes]]; if millimetres, then the plates are life size, leading to the conclusion that, rather than illustrations, they are the work itself. Klein would later create work in all three categories.

The cities are all places Klein had lived and worked in the preceding 4 years, implying either that the idea for each work had come to him in the relevant city, or that the work was an abstract representation of the city’s atmosphere. There are three versions of the book; one in which the plates have the name Yves next to the cities with a date; one with additional information about the size of each work, and one in which the entire work is credited to 'Haguenault'.

''Haguenault Peintures'' is basically the same book, and was published at the same time, but attributed to a different, unknown, artist. Curiously, some of the plates are still mechanically signed ‘Yves’, part of a series of deliberate strategies to undermine the works’ integrity, leading some critics, such as Pierre Restany, to call Klein an early post-modernist.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, quoted in Yves Klein, Jean-Paul Ledeur, Editions Guy Pieters, p66&lt;/ref&gt; The main structural difference was the accrediting of ownership in the captions (Collection Particuliere, Collection Orickson, Collection Raymond Hains, etc.).&lt;ref name="Yves Klein 1995, p46"&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p46&lt;/ref&gt; This implies the (fictional) artist was a painter of some stature, with work collected in major collections. 
According to [[Raymond Hains]], a close friend of Klein's at the time, Klein had named his pseudonym after a brand of gingerbread.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, 1928-1962, Selected Writings, Tate Gallery p82&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“ The fact that there were two different monochrome artists featured in two nearly identical booklets augmented the manifestations of doubling, duplication and duplicity that lay at the core of the project.” Sidra Stich&lt;ref name="Yves Klein 1995, p46" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influences ==

===Lettrism and the Readymade===
Klein was in contact at this time with key advocates of [[Lettrism]], a group of French avant garde artists who were challenging the assumed authority of texts by creating ‘an experiential language that was to be the basis of (the) new culture.’&lt;ref&gt;[http://cotati.sjsu.edu/spoetry/folder4/ng441.html Lettrism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509090049/http://cotati.sjsu.edu/spoetry/folder4/ng441.html |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1952, he had seen various works by key members of the group, including [[Isidore Isou]], and by Dufrêne, [[Gil J. Wolman]] &amp; [[Guy Debord]],&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery p31&lt;/ref&gt; and had become a close friend of Dufrêne in particular. The lettrists advocated challenging textual authority, and would serve as a direct reference point for the introduction. He was also familiar with the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], having given a copy of the 1947 artist's book ''Le Surrealisme'', designed by Duchamp with a famous cover of a 3D breast, to his friend [[Arman]]. Duchamp's theories about the [[readymade]], and his belief in the viewer making the meaning of a work of art, would be central to ''Yves Peintures''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/klein.shtm Tate Liverpool, Colour Chart] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627220435/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/klein.shtm |date=June 27, 2009 }}, retrieved 08-07-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'[Klein] dismissed line as a ‘tourist walking across the space’. For him lines were a ‘prison grating’, whereas the fine individual particles of colour were an expression of ‘total freedom’. He attempted to free himself from all materiality through the totality of colour. In gold, red and especially dark, deep ultramarine blue he found colours that corresponded adequately to his visions of the immaterial and the infinite. He wanted to induce independent sensations, feelings and reactions in viewers without giving them a depicted object or an abstract sign as a starting-point, just by means of the state and effect of the colour. He saw monochrome as an ‘open window to freedom, as the possibility of being immersed in the immeasurable existence of colour’ Ulrike Lehmann &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Lehmann, Yves Klein, Grove Art Online&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Editions===
The book was published by Fernando Franco de Sarabia’s engraving workshop in Jaen near Madrid, in a numbered edition of 150;&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Cantz, p216-7&lt;/ref&gt; despite this, there are believed to only be around 10 copies in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozanne-rarebooks.com/ Denis Ozanne Rarebooks, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yves Peintures'' has since been re-published by Editions Dilecta, Paris in 2006 in an edition of 400.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editions-dilecta.com/ Éditions Dilecta - Maison d'édition - Histoire des idées - Anthropologie de la culture - Société contemporaine - Rééditions de prestige&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
The book seems to have had a small but influential impact on the Parisian Art scene; using ''Yves Peintures'' to gain entry into the Parisian art world,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p57&lt;/ref&gt; he managed to secure an exhibition of monochromes at the Club Des Solitaires, Paris, opening on October 15, 1955.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Yesterday night, Wednesday, we went into an abstract café… the abstractionists were there. They are easy to recognize because they give off an atmosphere of abstract painting, plus you see their paintings in their eyes. Maybe I’m delirious, but I have the impression I see things like that. In any event, we sat down with them. Then we began speaking of the book ''Yves Peintures''. Later, I went to get it from the car and I laid it down on the table. At the very first few pages the abstractionists’ eyes began to change. Their eyes lit up and in the depths, pure, beautiful single colors appeared.' Paris newspaper, dated January 13, 1955 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_content_us.html Klein Archives, retrieved 08-07-2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705023902/http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_content_us.html |date=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
